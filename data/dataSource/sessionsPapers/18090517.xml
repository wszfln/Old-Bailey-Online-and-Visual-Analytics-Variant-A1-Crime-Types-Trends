               <p>Q. Was there more than one person - A. Only one rushed violently against me, with an attempt to shove me down on the right hand side, and at the same time he made that rush my watch was taken from me; he came from one side of me, or from behind me; I never saw him before he rushed against me; there was no demand of money, or any intimation that he meaned to rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watch taken from you before you could attempt to lay hold of it, so as to prevent it from being taken from you - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the person was that did this - A. I do not, he ran away with great speed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue - A. I did not, I perceived it was so far distant it was in vain; it was done so suddenly that I never saw the person's face that did it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you saw your watch again - A. It was brought to me on Tuesday morning by Trott the officer; this was done on Sunday at half after twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it to be your own watch - A. Certainly so. I afterwards attended at Hatton-garden office, I saw the prisoner, I had no recollection of his being the person, no further than by his size, not to speak to his person.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the watch was brought to you, was the chain, key and seal, the same as when it was taken from you - A. All the same as when I had lost it; they are considerably undercharged in the indictment.</p>

I searched him, the watch was not found upon his person; I handcuffed him, and asked him what part of the house he occupied; he said a room up stairs; I told him to walk first and shew me the room; he went up one pair of stairs, he said this is my room; I said do you occupy any other, he said no; there was a bed in the room; I proceeded to search the room; there were no persons then in the room but me, Davis, and the prisoner, and while I was searching a woman of the name of Bosworth came up, the young woman he was going to be married to; she sat down in the chair and began crying, saying, Good God, what have you done (addressing herself to the prisoner); he made no reply, and she cried very much. Mr. Davis took down a bason over where she sat, from a shelf out of her reach, as she sat, I am sure; this watch was in the bason, covered over with some rags and some worsted. I then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170004"/>said to Mr. Davis, secure the girl; the prisoner said the girl was innocent, not to take the girl, he had put it there, and he supposed he must suffer for it; I told him he was honourable in saying that; I secured him and the girl.

When we got in the room Trott shut the door, and proceeded to search the room; while he was searching a young woman came in the room, she sat down in a chair by the right hand side of the fire; she said what is the matter, addressing herself to the prisoner; the prisoner told her to be quiet, he did not know what was the matter, if he had done any thing that was wrong he would wish to be taken before a magistrate. I looked upon a shelf by the fire place; I took down a little bason; at the bottom of this bason was this watch, covered over with a rag and a little bit of worsted; there was enough to cover it. The moment I got this watch, I said to Mr. Trott here is what we came to look for; I delivered the watch to Mr. Trott; the prisoner said the woman is innocent, she knew nothing at all about it, I put it there myself, and I must suffer for it. We took them both down to the office.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any shutters to the bar window - A. Yes; the screws that fastened the two shutters had been forced out, and a bit of the bar broken; the shutters were not taken down; the screws had been taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170005"/>out; the shutter was forced back, so that they could enter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of your property gone - A. Yes, about forty-five pounds in pence and halfpence; there was a great deal more. I can speak to forty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Now just tell me in what manner the copper money was placed there - A Twenty-five pound was tied up in five-shilling parcels in paper; I lost gold and silver coin; we reckon that we take twenty five pounds in gold and silver, besides copper, in a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose half guineas, shillings, and how many notes - A. There were eight one-pound bank notes, two mourning rings, one gold ring, and a family ring besides; we lost two time pieces, one of which was set in Derbyshire spar; we lost two bags, a tin box, a silver two-pence, a new shilling and a new sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. When you discovered that your house had been robbed, did you and Legg discover any tracks near your house - A. Not so near my house as the new buildings where they took the wheelbarrow from; the buildings are about an hundred yards from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. At these buildings did you find any of your property - A. Yes, we found our till and three wooden money bowls.</p>
               <p>Q. Whoever had been at your house, they had disposed of your property there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from that place did you trace any track - A. Yes.</p>

Another bag, these were in this bag as it is now, all on the floor, by the side of a large box; the contents of the second bag is seven pounds and eleven pence halfpenny in halfpence, and six shillings in penny pieces; they are in the same state now as they were then. The third bag, these were told out on a box from a heap and laid out in six-pences; these amount to about five pounds, and nineteen shillings in copper, penny-pieces and halfpence. This is the fourth parcel, it was on the floor in an apron or a wrapper, tied up, this amounts to two pounds nine shillings in penny-pieces, in halfpence, and two shillings and three pence in farthings; the fifth parcel, this was on the ground, in the handkerchief were seven shillings and sixpence in penny-pieces and one pound one shilling and three-pence halfpenny in halfpence in these brown papers, it appears to be broken; there are several pieces of brown paper, string and all.

            . Q. You went along with Armstrong, have you any thing that you found independant of what he produced - A. I found a quantity of penny-pieces and halfpence on a box, and in the box twelve pounds five shillings; I found eight pounds and fifteen shillings in halfpence, and three pounds ten shillings in penny-pieces, these are in five shilling papers; on searching the room below I found this guage rule, one of the joints is wanting. Vickrey found a crow, it was under the floor in a concealed place under the stairs; I took that crow to the prosecutors, I matched it to the window shutters and to the window frame; it exactly corresponded to these marks.</p>
               <p>Q. Wherever a crow had been used to the breaking of the house it corresponded with the marks - A. It did; I have no doubt but with that crow the marks were made; I likewise fitted the marks in the bar, it corresponded with the marks in the drawers of the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Jones produce to you a joint of the guage rule - A. He did; which corresponded with this joint; I have matched it, it appears to me that that piece belongs to that rule, I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. You say you have no doubt that crow found in this man's house was the crow that did break into that house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And if any other crow corresponded so well you could speak so positive - A. I found the crow in the prisoner's house; it fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKREY. Q. You are also an officer belonging to Worship-street - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You went and your brother officers to this house in which you found Ware and the other prisoners - A. I went about two minutes afterwards, I was not with them at the time they went in; I found this copper in this cloth as I produce them now, ten shillings and ten pence in penny pieces, one pound nine shillings and two-pence halfpenny in halfpence and three-pence farthing in farthings, making all together two pounds and three-pence-farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now describe where it was you found this - A. After seeing the money found by the officers, I went down stairs; there are only two rooms in the house; I went down stairs; I went into the lower room; in a cupboard to which there is a door opens under the stairs, there was a quantity of rubbish with the remains of some coals and some bricks intermixed together; I cleared some of that away and then I found the way underneath the floor of that bottom room; the floor was not laid to the ground by a foot or fifteen inches; I could not get under, I reached my arm in and discovered that cloth that I have been describing; I took it from under there with the contents tied up; after I had taken this out I proceeded further in the same place; I got this crow from underneat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go and fit the crow - A. I went alone, and saw the prosecutor and his sister; I fitted the crow to all the inner places, the drawers and the cupboard, every place that was broken open; it fitted exactly; I found that the drawers had been done with one end of the crow and the cupboard with the other end; I called the prosecutor, he saw me fit the crow. At the office this dark lanthorn was produced, this bolt and this crow, by the prosecutor, I have had them ever since; this dark lanthorn has a piece of candle nearly burnt out, and this crow bar produced by the prosecutor was too large for the marks, it would have made a larger impression.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Where did you find the crow that you gave to Vickrey - A. This crow bar was found by the buildings where the drawer was found.</p>
               <p>Vickrey. This bolt appears to have been taken off the shutter; it was given me by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the bolt off my window shutter, it was found by a man at the front door, he gave it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170007"/>me. The lanthorn I saw on the counter when I came down and found the door open; I took it off the counter and gave it to Vickrey.</p>
               <p>Vickrey. That is the lanthorn the prosecutor produced to me.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information that you received, did you go any where else - A. I did, to

This is my bag; it has been in my house two years, till it was taken out this last time; I am quite sure it was in my house, and secure on the night the house was broken open; it is tied together; it is a sailor's knot; my nephew left it behind him. This apron I can safely take an oath is my own; I have had it a twelvemonth or hardly that, it was in my house at that time. The time piece is mine, I had it about three months, my sister wiped it one day and wiped a bit of the colouring off the front; and the rule I am certain is mine, I know it by the joint being broken off, they took the long piece, and left the short piece behind, I am quite sure it is mine; the two penny piece was in the tin box, but I have no mark on it; the money was put away to be paid to different creditors on Monday; the five shilling papers is one new halfpenny and one old; and the penny pieces are put up in five penny pieces, and two old halfpence.</p>

                        targets="t18090517-5-off33 t18090517-5-crimeloc36"/> - A. I keep about twenty or thirty; sometimes more and sometimes less.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes before the 31st of March did you miss any sheep - A. Yes; one sheep from the common; I missed it several days before I heard of it; I found it at the Red Lion, at Mr. Claridge's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when that was - A. No; I cannot say that I took particular account of it; they had got all the skins there when I found my skin; I saw it Hatton Garden, and I swore to the mark of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by saying it was at Mr. Claridge's - A. It was there then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You do not know that.</p>
               <p>COURT. You saw it first at the police office in Hatton Garden - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me as near as you can what time that was - A. No, I did not set it down; I came up when the other gentleman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you usually mark your sheep - A. Of the near side with a pitch mark, W. M. both the letters were alike; you can make a W. M. with the brand this way or other; it was made on purpose because I should know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any skins so marked at Hatton-garden - A. Yes, and that I swore to it there, and there is a reddle mark from the neck down to the chine, and then crossed; that is marked with oker and oil.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the skin that you saw at Hatton-garden that mark with oker as well as 
               <persName id="t18090517-5-person140">W. M. </persName>
            - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sheep that you lost a ewe or a wether - A. It was a pug lamb; a yearling ewe; to the best of my knowledge it was a ewe lamb.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that at the time you saw this skin it was one of your sheep - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. No; I might have seen him on the common; I took no notice of him till I saw him at Hatton Garden.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. The initials of any man, W. M. would mark it the same way - A. No; there is no other name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170009"/>on the common marked like that.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you, whether there were any marks at all upon this skin - A. Yes; when I saw it the marks were visible and distinct, the pitch marks and likewise the reddle and oil.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KIRBY. I live nigh the seven mile stone on Finchley common; some time the first week in April the prisoner came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. Yes; he is a servant to Mr. Grimaldi; he asked me if I knew any body that bought sheep skins; I told him I did; he said he had two or three to dispose of; I saw the person that did buy them. I never saw the skins till I saw them at Hatton-garden office.</p>
               <p>Q.What was his name that purchased them - A. Goodall.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you told Goodall - A. Yes; the next thing was, the constable came to my house and informed me that Goodall had bought six. It was on a Friday the first week in April that I told Goodall.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the next Saturday the constable came to you - A No; I understood they were purchased on the Saturday; the constable came to me in the week after he was apprehended; I told the prisoner I would send a person to buy the skins.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner - A. Not till I saw him at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then - A. I told the same exactly as I told you, I believe.</p>

            . I am a breeches maker, a fellmonger, and a dealer in skins and wool.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Kirby mentioning to you that there was a man wanted to sell some skins - A. On the 2nd of April I was at the Red Lion at Finchley; Kirby was then there; he asked me if I bought skins, I told him I did; he then told me if I went to Mr. Grimaldi, his servant had got some to sell; I went on the 8th of April, I saw the prisoner in the garden, I asked him if he had got any skins to sell; he asked me if I belonged to the boy that collected skins; I told him no, I was sent there by the shoemaker that lived near the Green Man (that is Kirby); he then took me into Mr. Grimaldi's chaise-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Grimaldi's house on the common - A. Yes. He then set a ladder up, he went into a hayloft, and while he was in the loft I heard him say he had six skins; he began to throw them down out of his loft, and throwed them all down; I looked at them as he threw them down; he came down the ladder; I asked him if they did not keep a good many sheep here, seeing so many different sorts, some Welsh, some Southdown, and some Dorsets; he then said that his master bought many different lots of sheep; I asked him who took the skins off, they appeared to be taken off very indifferently, which I told him; he told me he took this skin off the day before yesterday; then I looked at a small lamb's skin, he told me it was a very small lamb and weak when it was lambed, he knocked it on the head, because it did not thrive, I then agreed with him for the skins for eight shillings altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the price of six skins - A. Yes, such as they were, they were only pieces, small lambs some of them, with the heads cut off, and many holes cut in many of them; one lamb skin, and the rest were sheep nearly full grown; some of them Welch small sheep, and others of the larger kind. When I had agreed for the skins I was putting them together to bring them away; he wished me to have a sack to put the skins in, saying that I could carry them better than without a sack; I told him that I never made a practice of carrying skins in a sack; he pressed upon me again to have a sack, and that I might leave it at any time at Mr. Kirby's; he gave me a sack, and I told him I would leave it at Mr. Grimaldi's; he wished me not to do that, he did not wish his master to see any thing about it. I then took the skins and carried them to the Red Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you put any of the skins in the bag did you perceive that any of them had marks - A. All the skins had marks, and all different, except two; they were nearly alike, they belonged to Decamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the letters of Decamp on them - A. I saw the reddle marks; some were marked with pitch marks; I did not look at them particular. I took the skins to the Red Lion and throwed them down in the yard; a shepherd came up of the name of Rose, I told him I had bought a lot of skins; he looked at them; the firsk skin that he looked at he said was Fitzwater's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You must not tell what he said in consequence of what passed between you and the shepherd - what did you do with the skins - A. After he looked them all over, I left the skins at a house just by, where I locked them up myself and carried the key back to a person of the name of Baldock; he was the person who lent me the key.</p>
               <p>COURT. How long did they remain there - A. A few hours; I sent Rose to Decamp and Fitzwater; they did not come while I was there, that was on Saturday; the next week I was taken ill; I did not arrive at Finchley till the Saturday following; then they had taken the skins and the man to Hatton-Garden. I saw them at Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to swear that the skins that you saw at Hatton-Garden, or any of them, were the skins that you bought of the prisoner - A. Yes, the whole of them; them six are those that I bought of the prisoner; I know them by the look of the skins, being bred and born to the business; if I look at a thing once or twice, I know them immediately for seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Among those that you saw at Hatton-Garden, did you see this little lamb - A. Yes; it was not a little lamb, it was what they call a cuckoo lamb; they had all marks on them; it was the 17th that I went to Hatton-Garden, the Monday sen'night after I bought them. On Sunday the 16th I went to Finchley. Mr. Grimaldi sent down to the Red Lion that there was a discovery of some meat; the officer of Finchley went with me to Mr. Grimaldi; we went into the hayloft, we found a sack under some loose hay.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same loft from which the prisoner had thrown down the skins - A. No, it was another loft, I believe there was only a partition between, there was two doors, one went in one way and the other another way; both the lofts are over an out house of Grimaldi's; we there found a sack, and two legs, two shoulders, part of the scrag of a neck, and some part of a back.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they cut up as a butcher would cut up - A. No; the sheep appeared not to be chined down; they were not cut as a butcher would cut them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that part of the back was not cut like a saddle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170010"/>of mutton - A. No, there was only a part of the back and a part of the aitchbone.</p>
               <p>Q. Either part, the bones and flesh you mean, I suppose - A. Yes. We then brought it down from his house; we went immediately to Mr. Bacon, of Colney Hatch, we asked him if he should bring the meat to Hatton-Garden, he said no, as the meat was in a bad state, which it really was; the next day, after the examination was over, Mr. Turton desired me to go to Finchley, and pick out the skin that I thought the meat belonged to; I picked it out; the skin was marked with a reddle mark. It belonged to Fitzwater.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Matthews at Hatton-Garden on Monday - A. Yes; I saw all the owners of the skins on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any of these owners pick out skins that they claimed - A. Yes; I saw Matthews pick out a skin that he claimed as his own. Matthews' was the lamb skin, that he owned; called the cuckoo lamb.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Grimaldi any other servants but the prisoner - A. I saw nobody else there but the prisoner, when I bought the skins.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether Mr. Grimaldi kept any sheep on the common, do you - A. I know no more than seeing two skins that Mr. Grimaldi claimed, one he was sure to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You say you was bred and born to this business, and if you saw a skin once or twice, you should know it again for seven years - A. I was brought up a breeches maker, and fellmonger; I should know it again if it was not altered for seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not gone by the name of Johnson - A. I have been called Johnson; I was victorious in the florist line; by some people I was called a Johnson; I was the first florist in the known land.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave eight shillings for these skins - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They had the wool on - A. Yes; they were a good deal disfigured, or they would be worth more.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose at the time you bought them, you supposed they belonged to Mr. Grimaldi - A. I did; he told me his master had bought different lots of sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there were no particular marks that led you to believe the boy came dishonestly by the sheep - A. At the time I thought it was odd he should have so many different sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had suspected him, would you have bought them - A. I do not suppose I should, if I had known them to be stolen, I should never have bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. This mutton you found up stairs - this was ten days after you bought the skins - A. No, eight days; I look upon it that the mutton had not been killed less than ten or twelve days.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ROSE. I am a shepherd.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what you know about Matthews' sheep - A. I was going to my labour, past the Red Lion at Finchley, on the 8th of April; the man who bought the skins called to me, asked me if I would have part of a pint of beer with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank some beer with Goodall, did you - A. Yes; as we had drank the beer, he went and fetched me a skin, it was Fitzwater's skin, I knew it; then we went out; I looked at another, it had Decamp's mark very plain; I did not examine the others, till I let Fitzwater and Decamp know; afterwards I examined the others on the Sunday following, at the Red Lion at Finchley.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this second examination of the skins, did you know any of the marks on the other skins - A. I did not, till they came and owned them; Mr. Milne came to the Red Lion and owned his skin, and Mr. Matthews came to Hatton-Garden; he looked at the skins, he owned his own skin. The skins were left at the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You say the skins were left by Goodall at the Red Lion - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that the skins that you saw there, were the skins that were brought by Goodall - A. Yes; three I am certain of.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of the others - A. No, I cannot pretend to say; three of the skins are very remarkable; they were all reddle marked but one; three of them were pitched marked, and reddle marked both Some were so bad I could not see.</p>

            . I am headborough of Finchley. On Sunday, I think the 9th of April, Mr. Fitzwater ordered me to go up to Mr. Grimaldi's to take up a man; he asked him if he had sold the skins to this man, he said he did. I took him before Mr. Bacon. I, by the order of Mr. Bacon, locked him up for that night, and brought him to Hatton-Garden office the next day. I brought one skin only that day; I brought the rest on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was that - A. The 13th I fancy; we brought five more on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Were did you get these skins from - A. We got four from the Red Lion; the other two we got from a small house below.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what the marks were of the two that you took from the small house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what were the marks - A. I did not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took two skins from the small house, and four from your brother's at the Red Lion - A. Yes, at my brother's house the people saw these two skins, they knew them; Matthews was not at the Red Lion when I brought them, and they looked at them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at Hatton Garden when Matthews did look at them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were at Hatton-Garden, I suppose the six were all together, were they not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Goodale looking at them at Hatton Garden - A. He looked at them on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether Matthews picked out any one of these skins - A. I saw him pick out one, and claim it as his own. The skins were left at Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM READ. I am a police officer of Hatton-Garden. I saw the skins at Hatton-Garden. I have had them ever since locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Goodall examine them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Matthews examine them - A. Yes; Matthews looked at his, and said it was his by the mark. This is the skin that Matthews claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. to Matthews. Look at that skin, can you swear to that skin - A. Yes, there is the reddle round there, and here is the W. M.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other person on the common that marks in that way - A. No.</p>

            . What is the difference between your mark and Matthew's mark - A. Mine is a real W. M. that is two M's, one reversed; this is reddle, and mine is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark of a W. M. there - A. It appears to me a W. M. the same as Mr. Matthews marks his, not in the same way that I mark.</p>
               <p>JURY. We are not able to perceive the W. M. as described by Matthews - we would wish the shepherd to look at it, and to say if he could swear upon his oath that the W. M. is there.</p>
               <p>COURT to Rose. Look at that sheep skin, and say whether you can see satisfactorily the mark of

            - A. I have no doubt but it is the same mark, but I cannot swear to it by this sky light; when I saw the skin at the Red Lion, the headborough called upon me and said it was mine; I examined the skin, I told the headborough that the skin belonged to Matthews; I saw the mark distinctly then, and I saw the mark distinctly before the magistrate; I cannot see the marks distinctly now; the skin; have been all over lime.</p>

Yes, two five pound notes, three one-pound notes, five guineas, seven half guineas, and four seven shilling pieces; they were all in the bag, amounting to 23 l. 3 s. 6 d. I was perfectly sober, I slept there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had them when you went to bed - A. I cannot say whether I had or not; the way I knew I was robbed of it, Russel, the boy came to wake me about half after four in the morning. I was going to Gravesend by the tide; I am the master of one of the Gravesend boats; he told me that his mistress had stopped a man; I searched my pocket, and missed my bag; I told the boy to go down stairs and tell his mistress to stop the man; there were two beds in the room, besides the one I slept in.</p>

I told the constable, before they opened the bag, if my money was right, there were two five pound notes, two or three ones in it, and gold, to the amount of twenty three pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was delivered to you did you know the five-pound notes - A. I did not know the number of the notes; to the best of my knowledge there was the same value I expected to find in it. I expected to find twenty-two or twenty-three pounds; I did not know the exact sum.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say - A. He said nothing, he did not claim the bag nor the property; he suffered us to take it away without claiming it as his own.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no idea at what time it was taken from you, whether after going to bed or before, have you - A. No; I went to bed perfectly sober, I had no occasion to look for my bag.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in your house after Mr. Brown was there - A. Yes; about half past two in the night he came in and applied for a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep your house open all night for the reception of persons going to Gravesend - A. Yes. The prisoner slept in the same room with Mr. Brown, in the second story.</p>

               <p>Q. You had known Mr. Brown before - A. Yes, and I have seen the prisoner before, he slept seven or eight nights at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a person going backwards and forwards to Gavesend - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoner get up that morning - A. About half after four. When he came down stairs, I said it did not look well to get up so early; he had paid a shilling for his lodging and was going out of the door; I stopped him, saying I did not think every thing was right, I would wish to stop him till the boy went up stairs; he said nothing, nor did he attempt to get away in the st. I sent the boy up stairs, he brought down word that Mr. Brown desired me to stop the man; I stopped him. In less than ten minutes Mr. Brown came down, and asked the prisoner for the bag; the prisoner said he had not got it. Mr. Brown then said he must have an officer to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body slept in the room that Brown slept, except the prisoner - A. One other person, he is not here, he was asleep when Brown came down. An officer was sent for. Locking and Postan both came together.</p>
               <p>- LOCKING. I am a patrol of Billingsgate ward. About twenty minutes to five o'clock, I was sent for to this house in Darkhouse-lane, I saw the prisoner; Mr. Brown said he was sure the prisoner had robbed him; I ordered the prisoner to strip. I searched him, I found the bag in his right hand coat pocket; Brown said he would swear to its being his property; he described the contents of the bag before the bag was examined.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.

She never came into the room and talked with me before; I had spoke to her once, I believe, no farther than to ask her how she did.</p>

I did not search her till the next morning at Guildhall. There were two persons with her at the time I took her, a soldier and another girl; I found nothing on her. I have only been an officer three months.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do; she lived next door to me. On the 9th of May, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was coming into the house from the bakehouse, I met her at the door, she had a large bundle in her lap, it seemed to me to be white linen, wrapped up in her apron; she came very fast; she apparently came from Mrs. Dimmock's room; Dimmock's room is on the ground floor, to the left; she seemed to turn from the left. I went up stairs and took no further notice.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM READ. I am an officer of Hatton-Garden office. I apprehended the prisoner on Thursday the 11th of May, I searched her lodgings, I found nothing; I asked her what she had done with the property, she told me that she had sold them to a ragman for ten-pence; I asked her what she had in a large bundle when she came out of Dimmock's house; she said she had been to the baker's for a loaf; I took her to the baker's and enquired whether she had bought a loaf there that morning; the baker said she had not been there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up the town between seven and eight o'clock in the morning for tea and sugar; coming home I picked up a few things on the dunghill. Mrs. Dimmock's mother tells fortunes, and carries gingerbread nuts about; I went and talked with her; I met Mrs. Martin coming out of the house, she said good morning to me. On Tuesday Mr. Dimmock came to me and said I had taken his soldier's great coat; and when his wife came she came and abused me, and asked me for the things; I told her I had not seen them; whether they were red or white I know not. On Thursday afternoon I was sitting mending my clothes; Mr. Read and Dimmock came up stairs; they searched my place; I had nothing but my own; Mr. Read took me to Tottenham Court Road, from one pawnbroker to another. I am as clear of it as a child unborn.</p>

             came in; they asked to drink with me, I said they might; after that we had a third pint, then I paid my shot, and returned out of the house, into the street. They immediately followed me out, and said if I would go with them, they would treat me with a pot of beer, as I had treated them. I went along with them, expecting I was going to a public house; they took me to a private house, and said they would not stop in the kitchen, I went up stairs with them, into a room on the right hand; immediately I got into the room, the servant girl of the house, demanded three shillings of me, for the use of the room. When I found where I was, I said I would pay it, if they would let me go; I gave the servant girl a five shilling piece, she gave me two shillings in change; I then wished to go; Wells said I should not go without paying them as for the room; I gave her a shilling, and begged to go; she said I should not go unless I gave her a seven shilling piece; I told her I had no money about me; she then struck me over my mouth and nose with her open hand, and downed me on the floor. I cried out murder; immediately a man entered the room, and said if I cried out any more, he would take me into custody; I told him I was robbed of all I had.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were down, did any body do any thing to you - A. I cannot possibly swear that I felt them take the money from me; but when I got up, I had none.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you in your pocket when you went into that house - A. I had five guineas; I felt it when I put my hand into my pocket to give the girl a five shilling piece. I came down stairs, there was a great crowd about the door; I told them all I was robbed, some person went for an officer; the officer was nearly two hours before he came. I did not stir from the door all that time; some woman came out of the house between the time of the officers coming, and the people at the door asked me if that was one of them, I said it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lay down on the ground, after you were knocked down with this blow - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Now young man, you talk of drinking three or four pints of beer - what had you been drinking all the day - A. I had drank part of four or five pots of beer along with a friend; I was in liquor, but I very well knew what I did.</p>
               <p>Q.From this blow of a woman with her open hand,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170014"/>how came you to lay on the ground so long as a quarter of an hour - A. Wells kept on the top of me, and Dix she bore a hand to help her to keep me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any bed in this room - A. I cannot tell; I never saw any bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath, had you used no familiarity with this woman, or either of them - A. None at all. I am a single man.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts was this house - A. In Shire-lane, up an alley.</p>
               <p>Dix. I would wish the prosecutor to say when we were in the wine vaults, whether or no I spoke to him - A. You did; you asked me which of you I would have; I told you I did not wish to have either of you.</p>

            , came into the house with this young man, on a Thursday in this month, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I cannot tell the day of the month. I followed them up stairs; they went into a first floor room, of the right hand side, there was a bed in it; Wells told the young man to pay for the room, he asked me what it was, I said three shillings, he gave me a five shilling piece, and I gave him two shillings in change; they shut the door, and I came down stairs; when I had been down stairs about two minutes, I heard a noise up stairs, as if they were disputing, and the cry of murder; I think three times; it was a man's voice, and loud enough for me to hear it very plain. When I went up stairs, I saw Wells strike him; they were both standing up then; I never saw him fall down; I said she had better let him alone, and let him go out of the house quietly; she insisted that he should not go away from the house. Dix was in the room, they were all three of them in the room together. Then I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember some man in the house that went up stairs - A. There was a man in the house that ran up stairs the same as I did, to see what was the matter; he came in by chance, I had not seen him above three or four times; I understood he was a waiter. I believe he was a stranger to the prisoners; the prisoners neither of them lodged at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now young woman, you say you saw this man come in your house, and you saw him go out of the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he appear to you, to be drunk or sober - A. He did not appear to me to be intoxicated; as he was going down stairs on the landing place, I heard him say he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. I know them by sight; I saw Wells once in the house before; I do not know that ever I saw the other in house before. When the young man went out, he stood at the door a great while; there was a great mob about the door; I do not recollect any woman going out of the house while he stood at the door.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took charge of the two women, and the man that was with them. I searched Wells, there was only one shilling and two or three halfpence in her pocket; Dix had only a penny piece about her; they were both sitting in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the bed-room - A. No, they were not in the bed-room at the time I came in.</p>
               <p>Well's Defence. I went into this wine vaults, the young man was there; he immediately asked me to have some of his porter; he afterwards asked me to go with him; I went with him into the house, he cruelly ill-treated me; I resented it; he said he would not let me go out of the room, untill he had connection with me to his satisfaction; he said if I would not, he would do for me, if it cost him fifty pound. Then he accused me of robbing of him.</p>
               <p>Dix's Defence. I promiscuously met with this lady in Fleet-street; she asked me to take something to drink; I told her I could drink nothing but a small glass of wine; I went with her into the wine vaults; that young man was there, he asked her to drink, and she asked me to drink; I did not. He asked her to go with him, she went with him; I believe she would not have gone if she had not been a little elevated in liquor. I saw a bed in the room; I said, young man, you do not want two women. I went down to the landlady; there was a man sitting behind the door; shortly after that I heard a voice call out murder; I went to the stairs and said what is the matter, she said this man has very ill treated me; he immediately accused us of robbing him; he went to the door and called for a watchman; a mob came about the door, I would not quit the house until I was searched, the officer searched me and found a penny; they searched this lady and found a shilling.</p>

I had none of his property about me. I never robbed a man of a penny in my life. I never offered to go out of the house.</p>

On the 18th of March, about half past six in the morning, I got up and went up stairs in the garret to work, in which room the prisoner lodged: I took my watch out of my pocket, and hung it up against the window, which I work against; it there remained till eight o'clock, or after; the prisoner all that time was in bed. A little after eight my wife rang a small bell, as a signal for breakfast; the prisoner used to take his breakfast with us of a morning; I said to him in a familiar way, come Jonney, get up; he immediately began to dress himself, and was near dressed at ten minutes past eight. I left the room to go down stairs; the watch hung at the window at the time; in a few minutes he came down stairs, and told my wife that he was going out for a two-penny loaf.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him tell your wife - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then tell me what you heard yourself - A. He did not come back to breakfast as he usually did. I saw no more of him till he was in custody. I went up to work again, twenty minutes before nine, the watch was gone. The watch was found at Rossiter's, the pawnbroker's, Great Surry-street.</p>
               <p>- FITZPATRICK. My master received this watch on the 18th of March, between nine and ten o'clock; I saw the prisoner lay it out of his hand; I took it up, and looked at it; I am sure this is the watch; it is worth four pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing - A. I lost my pocket book, various memorandums, also the copy of my freedom, and two five pound notes; I described Dennis at Hatton-Garden office, and Stanton, the officer, took him last Saturday night. Dennis is the person that took the pocket book out of my pocket; I have not the smallest doubt of either of them; the moon shone; I could perfectly see their persons.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober - A. I was.</p>
               <p>- MOONEY. I am the constable of the night. When the watchman brought Crawley in on the 23rd of April the prosecutor was quite intoxicated in liquor. Crawley said to the prosecutor, you want to take my life away; the prosecutor began to look at him; he said you are the person that put your hand upon my mouth to stop me crying out. I searched him. I found a shilling, and a few halfpence, and a knife that he cuts his bread and cheese with; the prosecutor was dancing about, he was so intoxicated.</p>

             I am a watchman in Holborn. I was crying half past two o'clock when I heard the cry of watch; I came to Hatton-Garden, I there saw the prosecutor without his hat, he was expostulating with the watchmen on the other side of the way, blaming them for not coming to his assistance; he said he had lost his pocket-book and his hat. The prisoner Crawley came up and asked what was the matter; the prosecutor gave me charge of him; he said he was the man that put his hand on his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober - A. I cannot say; he seemed to give his evidence very fair at the watchhouse; I have no doubt but he was sober; he told the same story then as he did at the office, and the same as he has told to day. When the prisoner Crawley came in the watchhouse, he applied to Mr. Mooney, the constable; he said to him, you know my father and mother very well; Mooney said he did, and they were very industrious people.</p>
               <p>Q. When this conversation passed, did any thing strike you to believe the prosecutor was in liquor - A. No; he delivered his story very clear, as ever I heard any man; I do not know him any more than seeing him that night.</p>
               <p>Crawley's Defence. I was coming along, this gentleman was in full discourse with a watchman; when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170016"/>came up, and there was a young man standing with an umbrella, he was blowing the other watchman up; he said you rascals you have not done your duty, he said he had been robbed; the man said he saw nobody coming along; he looked at the man with the umbrella very hard; I asked him what was the matter; he was going to give charge of this man, and then he said he would give charge of me; I never made any resistance.</p>
               <p>Dennis's Defence. I was never there at all; about nine o'clock I went to the Pickled Egg, I stopped there till about half past twelve, from there I went to my mother's, and staid till half past two o'clock; it was not five minutes walk from the Pickled Egg to my mother's, and from my mother's I went home.</p>

I am an officer of Worship-street; they live very near to our office; I went down to the prisoner's house, I made some enquiry; I found the prosecutrix's door broken open; I went into the prisoner's apartment, I asked her if she observed any strange people going up or down that day; she said no not one; she informed me that her own door had been broken open and she had lost her husband's great coat, and some baby linen; she seemed rather alarmed; I asked her if she had any objection to let me search her apartment; her husband was close by, he said not the least objection, she made no answer; I searched the drawers, there was a pair of stockings and a prayer book; the prosecutrix said they were her's; in the table drawer I found this chisel and a broken knife; I immediately went up stairs, I matched the chisel with the marks on the prosecutrix's door, and the top of the box lid I matched the broken knife to that, it exactly corresponded to the marks of the box; I came down stairs and asked her if she had any pawnbrokers duplicates in the house; she said no, not one; I searched her pocket, I found none there. I begged of Mrs. Edwards, the landlady, to feel under her arm; she took out this box from under her arm-pit with twenty one duplicates in it, which she gave to me; there were four or five handkerchiefs found under her other arm; she said she was sorry for what she had done; we found the property at the pawnbrokers by these duplicates.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you leave your horses - A. At the door; the horses had the harness on, and the saddle on the riding horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they the traces of a post chaise - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the barber's shop - A. About six or seven minutes; I went into the shop to be shaved.</p>
               <p>Q. What day in the week was it - A.Last Friday the 12th.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170017"/>Q. How did you fasten your horses when you went in - A. I left them loose, there was nothing to tie them to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think that the horses would run home to the Toy - A. One was nearly blind, that was the saddle horse.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came out, what did you observe about your horses - A. The horses were gone, it was dark; I went after them directly, towards the Toy, on foot; I ran after them; I went to Smallborough-Green before I stopped. It is on the same road, just before you get to Hounslow.</p>

               <p>Q. How far was that from the barber's shop - A. About six miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire on the road - A. Yes; I enquired for the horses; the turnpike man saw them go through the gate; he gave me information.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that information, what did you do - A. I stopped at Smallborough-Green, and went to bed for three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to bed - A. Because I was tired with walking so far.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking that day - A. No, not at all; I had nothing that day till I came to Hammersmith.</p>

               <p>Q. When you got up at Smallborough-Green, what did you do - A. I enquired at the turnpike gate at Smallborough-Green.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Hammersmith, and then to go to Smallborough-Green - A. I had something to eat and drink at Smallborough-Green.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you drink at Hammersmith - A. A pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went on to Smallborough-Green - A. Yes, that was on the Friday night.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Smallborough-Green, you heard nothing about your horses - A. No; I came back to Brook-Green, by Hammersmith; on the Saturday morning; I enquired there, I could not hear any thing of them. I then went to the King's Arms, at Acton-Bottom; I saw the ostler cleaning one of the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. That is out of the Road to Toy - A. Yes. That is in the Uxbridge Road. The ostler gave him up; I took the horse in my hand; I found the other horse tied to a post, by a sadler's shop; the saddle was changed; my new one was taken off, and an old one put on. The prisoner was in the sadler's shop.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it the prisoner at the bar - look at him - A. Yes; I told the prisoner they were my horses; he tried to get away directly; he run through the sadler's shop, down a court; he fell over a gate, and we took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you - A. The blacksmith, and the sadler.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he had your horses - A. I was informed so.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes. On Friday night, the 12th of May, about half past ten, the brought with him two horses.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of horses were they - A. Bay horses; they seemed to be post chaise horses; one had a saddle and bridle, the other had a collar and bridle, of a led horse. There were no traces on them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in about ten o'clock at night, what did he do - A. He put up at our house, I had the care of the horses, and he slept at our house; in the morning he got up about half past five; he went into the stable, he put the saddle and bridle on the horse that he rode; he brought him out of the stable, telling me he was going to have a shoe put on; he left the other horse in the stable; he ordered me to feed the horse, and clean him, and give him some water, I did so; at the time I was cleaning the horse, Girdler came and owned the horse; he asked if there was not another belonging to it, I told him there was; he was gone to the blacksmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Girdler go towards the blacksmith - A. Yes. The two horses and the prisoner were all brought back to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Girdler went away with the two horses - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember in the course of Friday evening, or on Saturday morning, the prisoner giving any account of the horses, what they were - A. I asked him in the morning if they were coach horses, he said one was a coach horse, and the other was an old charger; he told me that he had been taking a carriage to town for his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who his master was - A. No, nor did I ask him; he said he was going to take them to the barracks, after he had got one shod.</p>
               <p>Q. to Girdler. Now the horse that you saw at the stables, at the King's Arms, are you sure that was your master's horse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the horse that you saw facing of the sadler's, that horse was likewise your master's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, you took both the horses, did not you - A. Yes; and my master has had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williams. The horse that was brought back with the prisoner, was that one of the two horses that he brought in the night before - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, look at him - A. Yes; he came to my master's shop on Saturday morning the 13th, he brought a horse with him to be shod.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop facing a sadler's - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not tell you how he came by this horse, did he - A. No; I shod him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take the horse away - A. Yes; after I put the shoe on the horse, he sent me for the other horse to be shod all round. I went for the other horse, I found it in the possession of Girdler.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with Girdler when the man was taken - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of his attempting to escape, did he run away - A. Yes; I ran after him with Girdler.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been punished by the regiment a great deal; it made me quite careless almost to think I should be punished, and not in fault; for that reason, I was careless what I did. I did not take the horses with intent to make money of them, or steal them. A gentleman that I never saw in my life before,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170018"/>persuaded me to ride the saddle horse, and be rode the other. We went on the road, I cannot tell what place it was; I never was in the country before. The other man took the traces off the horses; I asked him what he was going to do with them, I thought it was wrong; he said you never mind; he told me to put up at the house where the ostler lived, he would call at eight o'clock in the morning. As we were riding along, I perceived the horse I was riding, go lame; I said we had better get him shod, than for the horse to go lame. When I came to the stable in the morning, I asked the ostler where I could get a blacksmith, he told me. I took him to the blacksmith; I saw the other horse wanted shoeing all round. I told the blacksmith to fetch him.</p>

I followed them and stopped them just by the governor's grape trees in the Tower; I told them they must go back with me to the clerk of the work's office; they went back with me; I then said go along with me and bring the remainder of the lead that you have been stealing.</p>

             the witness, when I came down stairs I found the lead that was taken from the bar window of my house; I have since fitted it to the place to see that it was taken from there. It is my own dwelling house; the house is in my possession.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH MOSES. Q. Do you live opposite the Gun and Star - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. At about four o'clock in the morning of Sunday, the 30th of April, were you awoke by any circumstance - A. Yes; I was awoke by my dog barking in my shop; I got out of bed and went to the window, I saw Fonseca standing at my door; I saw three men besides double up a piece of lead by Mr. Nightingale's door.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know any of them three - A. Jones was rolling the lead up with two more; Fonseca was about fourteen yards from any of them; Fonseca's face was towards the lead; I halloaed out stop thief; Mr. Fonseca answered, you jew thief, what is it to you; I made more halloaing and they all run off; Fonseca and Jones and the others were all together; I went down to run after them; they were gone before I came; they left the lead behind them. Mr. Nightingale came down and took the lead away.</p>
               <p>Fonseca. There has been an animosity between the witness and me years back.</p>
               <p>Witness. I never spoke two words to Fonseca in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see where the men placed the ladder - A. Yes; against Mr. Nightingale's bar window. Fonseca came up to me; he said Bill, what causes you to be out so late in the morning; I told him I were locked out of my lodging; I had a pint of beer or two the over night; I wanted something to drink, I was rather dry; he told me to go down Cobb's-yard, I could get something to drink at the Yorkshire Grey public house. He walked several yards down Cobb's-yard with me; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170019"/>turned back; I wenton to the Yorkshire Grey, they were not up; I then went to Aldgate pump and got some saloop; the clock struck four while I was drinking it. I returned to Petticoat-lane, and when I came to Mr. Cox's I heard something lump on the ground; then I came on; I saw Fonseca and Jones stand in the lane; they doubled up the lead; Mr. Moses called out of the window; Jones and Fonseca ran away; the man in the blue coat then I did not see; shortly after the ladder was moved against Mr. Moses's house; then it was I heard Mr. Moses call out, and I saw them go up Petticoat-square.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. I was in bed at the time.</p>
               <p>Fonseca's Defence. There has been a bit of dispute between him and me; he borrowed sixpence of me. It is only spite and malice about this lead. He uses the house where I go constantly to have a pint of beer, he is there constantly with common prostitutes; he asked me for a sixpence; I sent it him; since that he gave me a shilling. He came on the Wednesday as I was taken on the Thursday; he asked me for the sixpence out of his shilling; I said I had not got it, I will give it you tomorrow; he abused me, and I said because he used such bad language to me I would get him on board the tender; he said he would do for me in my old days, he would transport me. He went to Mr. Nightingale the next day. I have lived in the same place many years.</p>

            . I am watchman of the wholesale part of Leadenhall market for the butchers. On the 4th of May, about five in the afternoon, I walked round the market two or three times; I went into the common privy of the market; I saw the prisoner with two others in there; I did not like the appearance of them. they went out and whispered something, I could not understand. When I came out, one of the working men said there had been three men trying to lift a quarter of beef; I said more likely to steal it. I went into the Fleece public house; I there saw the carcase of mutton on a man's shoulder; I suspected it to be stolen, I enquired of Mr. Walmsley whether he had sold it, he said no. I ran after the prisoner; I saw him throw it off his shoulder, he said he was employed to carry it for Wragg, the man that took it out of the market; he was to have six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it upon the man's shoulder, did you - A. Yes; and I saw Wragg run away; the prisoner threw it off his shoulder, and stood by it. He had not got a step further when I came up to him; when I came up, I said you have stolen this carcase of mutton, he said no, I was employed by Wragg to carry it for six-pence. I knew he was in company with the others before.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he one of them you saw in the privy - A. Yes, he was one, and Wragg was another. I knew the prisoner for two years, he had lived in the market.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not deny having it on his shoulder - A. No.</p>

I saw it was gone from the place where it hung up; then I went in pursuit immediately. Going across the hide market, a tanner's man gave me information. I saw the prisoner with the carcase of mutton on his shoulder; I pursued him round the corner of Threadneedle-street; I asked him what he was going to do with the carcase of mutton, he told me he was to have six-pence for carrying it; I took him to the Compter.

Three men in contract met me; the prisoner shoved me with his hand in the breast, and at the very instant took my watch from my pocket, which I felt; I immediately endeavoured to take hold of him, but the other two jumped in before me. I holloed out stop thief; the two others absconded; I followed the prisoner, calling out stop thief; he ran down the street towards London bridge. Several people in the street endeavoured to stop him; he turned, and ran the other way; I never lost sight of the prisoner all the time, except when a coach stood in the way; he was one side of the coach, and I of the other; he fell down, and the constable laid hold of him. I said this man has stolen my watch; he was taken into a house, the constable there searched him; he immediately said you are mistaken in the man, I did not steal the watch, I was running, calling out stop thief. After some search, the constable said, I feel something like a watch; I said I will give you the description of it. I gave the description; the watch exactly corresponded with the description I gave. The watch was found upon the prisoner.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL SHEPHARD. I am an officer. On Saturday, April the 22nd, I was in Gracechurch-street, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner run across the road, he turned back; I took hold of him, and took him into a public house; I searched him, and found the watch between the lining of his breeches, under the ham.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of taking the watch I am accused of, the same being given me in the following manner; I was accosted by two men who said they were going to walk for a wager, they told me to take the watch to tell the time. I am now sixteen years of age, and should I be so unfortunate as to be found guilty most humbly beg the clemency of the court to order me on board one of his Majesty's ships of war.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Are you sure the prisoner is the person that took the watch from you - A. I swear that he is the person that took the watch from me.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 29th of April, I took the boots down stairs to clean them and put them in the servant's hall; I went out at two o'clock with my master to Devonshire-place; I left them there, and when I came back I found the boots were gone; I made enquiry of the servants that were there; none of them knew any thing about them. On Tuesday the 2nd of May as I was walking up Swallow-street I saw the boots in the boot-maker's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170021"/>shop; I went in and looked at the boots, I found them to be my own. I asked the price of the boots, he asked me twenty-eight shillings for them; I said I did not know that I wanted a pair myself, I had a fellow servant that did; I would return back to Hatchet's hotel, I would bring the waiter up with me; I did; the waiter was going to try them on, the master of the shop said, they were too large for him; then I told him the boots were mine; he said that he bought them on the Monday before.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, in Swallow-street. On the 1st of May, the prisoner came to my house, and offered the boots for sale, he asked twenty-five shillings for them, I bid him a pound, he said he could not take it, because they belonged to another man, he could not take less than a guinea; he went away, and staid for two hours; then he came again, told me that the man would take the money for the boots. I paid him for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the man - A. That is the man. I had seen him before; I thought he was a servant. They are the same boots that Mr. Bowdridge claimed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. He told you they were not his own - A. Yes, he said he sold them for another.</p>

            , a constable - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call on him on Thursday the 2nd of March - A. Yes; and in consequence of what past between us on the Saturday, after I went to the flatting mills in Wild-street, Drury-lane, I saw Mr. Miller, I told him I wanted to purchase a few goods, meaning bad shillings and six-pences; Mr. Miller readily gave me one bad shilling and two good six-pences; I gave him one good shilling for them. We appointed to meet again the same evening at the Lemon Tree public house, at the top of the Hay-market; he said he would meet me there with half a piece, he thought he could make up meaning half a guinea; if he should disappoint me, he would meet me on the Monday following, at the Hog in the Pound, in Oxford-street; then we parted. On Monday morning I received two good shillings from Mr. Burton, they were marked; I received directions from him. I went to the Hog in the Pound on Monday morning at ten o'clock. I took the two marked shillings with me. The prisoner met me within ten minutes of the time he appointed.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you when you met at the Hog in the Pound - A. I asked him if he had got the goods ready, meaning two guineas worth, he said no; I said when will they be ready, Mr. Miller; he said about two o'clock this afternoon, I said have you none now, he said I think I have nine; I said I would take four, he gave them to me; the four in the street, not in the public house. We first met in the public house and drank there, we came out together. I gave him the two good shillings that I had of Mr. Burton, marked, and he gave me the four. We walked down Oxford-street, a little way further.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were going along the street, did you see Burton - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any signal been agreed upon between you and Burton - A. Upon my seeing of Burton, I touched the right side of my bonnet; Mr. Miller and I went into the next wine vaults to have something to drink; Burton came in directly and took Miller and me into custody; he searched me, and took from me the four bad shillings; I had put them into my pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you any bad shillings in your pocket before you saw Miller - A. No, I had not; he took and put us all three in a coach together; he said where did you get these, I answered from Mr. Miller.</p>

After the other man had got his change, the prisoner wished to pay for the liquor himself; the other man then desired me to return him his note, and he gave me the change back again; he consented then for the prisoner to pay for the liquor; he then asked the prisoner why he did not pay for the liquor; the prisoner felt some time in his pocket, and said he wanted change for half a guinea; he gave me no half guinea; the other said I might as well change my note as you change your half guinea; he then desired me to give him the change again and take the note; I put him down the change I received of him; he then threw me down a note, very closely folded up, and they all three of them went out of the house as fast as they could go with the money.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did she live in your service - A. It did not exceed five weeks. On the 15th of this month, about eight o'clock in the evening, my wife was washing in the washhouse in the back yard; there were some articles wanting to wash; the servant maid went up stairs and found the room door of my bed chamber locked; the property was taken away from the first floor; she came down and said the door was locked. I looked about for the key, supposing it had been mislaid; I took a candle; the entrance to my bed chamber is very dark. I went up one pair of stairs to ascertain whether the room door was locked; I found the door locked and the key out of it; I asked my wife about the key, and all my domestics; my wife said she believed it had been left in the door. In a few minutes afterwards my wife went up stairs and found the room door open; she called me up; I found the room door open, and the room was all in confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the first time of going up - A. About ten minutes. I have sworn to the room door being locked, and the prisoner was in the room at the same time; I found several things were missing and the bed clothes tumbled and the sheets apparently going to be taken away; my wife opened the drawers and found they had been ransacked, and the articles in the indictment were missing; the property was not removed off my premises, they were taken up to the attic story and placed in a basket ready to be carried away. There were several other articles found on the prisoner when she was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that those things that you saw in the attic in the basket, were ever in your bed room - A. They were in my bed room in the morning, that I have sworn to. When I was acquainted that the drawers were ransacked, I said no person has come down stairs with a bundle, they must have ascended after I found the room door locked. I watched the passage to see that no person came down.</p>
               <p>Q. You went from this room that you saw so ransacked up into the attic - A. I did. Upon the landing place I saw the bundle of clothes, but I did not immediately inspect them; I made a search near the tops of some of the houses out of my own trap door, I could find no person whatever. I came down stairs; my apprentice went up and saw these bundle of clothes, it was brought down by him, it is the property that is laid in the indictment. I am sure I saw my coats in the bed room in the morning; we went up again; a thought struck me that there was a possibility of a person being concealed behind the partition, and the prisoner was found behind a partition adjoining my premises, at the top of the house, that separates my neighbours and my own.</p>
               <p>Q. The second search you found her behind the partition - you were present the second time, were not you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170023"/>- A. I was present; the prisoner was found by my apprentice; I saw her there, I gave her in charge of the constable; she was then taken to the watchhouse and searched in my presence; there was a piece of silk, two gown sleeves, a pair of plated sugar-tongs, several pieces of gowns, and pieces of linen, found in her pockets. When the prisoner was seized I said to her, how could you do such a thing, one that has been my own servant; she said that she had robbed me; I had been robbed a few months before; she confessed that she implicated my wife's son; I suppose he was innocent. This key of my bed chamber was taken out of her pocket by the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember going up to the top of the house searching with your master - A. On Monday evening last, a few minutes after eight o'clock, I left off work, I heard my master say you have mislaid the key; I understood my master had been up stairs; I went up stairs and perceived a counterpane full of things on the landing place of the garret; I asked my fellow apprentice whether these things had any business there; he told me no; I told him to look at them while I went on the top of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. You went to the top of the house - you did no, find the prisoner - A. No; I went out a second time then I found the prisoner behind a partition, which parts my master's house and the next door. I immediately broke down the partition and seized the prisoner by the arm; she exclaimed to me, Tom, you blackguard, do not ill use me; I brought her to the trap door, where my master laid hold of her and took her down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing she said - A. When I entered the landing place. I heard her say, pray forgive me, sir. I accompanied her to the watchhouse; there were several things found upon her, they have all been described. The constable took my master's key out of her pocket.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street-office. Mr. Simpkin's house is in the hamlet of Mile End Old Town. On Saturday morning, the 13th of this month, between nine and ten o'clock, I went down to the last witness's house; I saw the prisoner come out of his house while I was talking to the young woman; a house that he had an apartment in; I did not know who kept the house; then since that I learned from his wife that he had an apartment there. I desired the young woman to go with me to the office to get a warrant to search the house; she did so; the warrant was granted. I went down there in company with Coombes and Miller, two other officers; we searched the lower part of the house, we could not find any thing; we went up stairs, searched the back room, we found nothing there; we took Ware's wife up with us, and took her into the front room, which she said belonged to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know from the prisoner that belonged to him - A. Yes; after he was apprehended. We found a chest in that room, it was locked; we asked Mrs. Ware if she had got the key; we broke the chest open, in that chest we found this black bag, it contained six shirts, two pair of sheets, four tablecloths, five napkins, six towels, eleven yards of table linen, not made up, and a time piece. After we had found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170024"/>this property. I tied up the bag, and carried it into the prosecutor's house, and asked for a key, and locked it up in the room, and put the key in my pocket; Mr. Coombs staid with the woman in the house that we had searched, while Miller and I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and the other man. In Shadwell market-place, I saw the prisoner, I laid hold of him; and Peasgood, who rented the house, I pointed out to Miller. We tied their hands together, and brought them up to the office; they asked me what I wanted with them, I told them I wanted them for breaking a house in Pleasant-row.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before - A. Not before that morning; he came out of the door and threw a stone at a dog. When I saw him in the market, I knew him again. Coming from Shadwell. I asked the prisoner if that front room was his room; I told him I had broken the chest open, and in that chest we had found a great deal of property, and I should like to know if he could account how he came by it; he said the chest was his, as to the property, he knew nothing about it. I asked him if he could account how it came there; he said no, he know nothing about it. We took them up to Lambeth-street. They both were committed for re-examination. On the Tuesday the young woman swore to the property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Is Peasgood here - A. I believe not; he was discharged; he kept the house as I understood.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether the room in which the goods were found, was not Peasgood's sleeping room - A. No, Ware acknowledged that the room where the chest was found, was his room, and it was his chest.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you he knew nothing of the things, nor how they came there - A. He did so.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Griffiths when the box was broken open, and when he found the property; I likewise found a shawl belonging to the young woman; I was left in the room with the two women; the prisoner's wife said she expected him to come home to boil dog's meat; the water was boiling at the time.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mary Ann Brown. Had you ever seen the prisoner or his wife - A. I have seen his wife, but not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the wife - A. About the door of the house that she lived in with the children; it is a short distance, only across the road.</p>
               <p>Q. You found, I think you said, the window open - A. Yes; a one pair of stairs window; a man could not get in without a ladder. When I went out I locked the door, and I found it locked.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen the prisoner at or about the house at all - A. I had not; I saw Peasgood in the afternoon of the day before it was broken open; I saw him walking up and down the row, looking at our house; he keeps the house in which the prisoner lived up one pair of stairs, and he is a butcher.</p>
               <p>Q. Then ma'am, there was no reason to suppose but what any person might get in as well as the prisoner - A. No reason at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Griffiths. When you went to this house where the prisoner lived, who opened the room door where the chest was - A. I cannot say whether the door was open or shut, the wife of the prisoner went up with me, she said she had not got the key that belonged to the chest. The prisoner was searched at the office; no key was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have lived in the house; I left the house on the Wednesday, as the robbery was committed on the Monday. There was no lock on the door; the box was not locked, I left the key in it; there were only some rags in it; I had not fetched it away.</p>

            , I saw the other servant, she said she was up stairs, and laid on the bed; I examined the house; I found no person had broken any part of it; I desired the other maid to call her down, I wanted to speak to her; she answered me she was in fits, she could not come down; I desired Mr. Phillips, the master of the house, to go up stairs with me to her; after some conversation with Mr. Phillips and the prisoner, she said she knew nothing about it. The prosecutor told her he did not mean to hurt her, if she told him the truth. Through what past we went down stairs; I desired Mr. Phillips to send for a coach, which he did; and a lad that was in the house, a brother to the prisoner; we took him with us to find out the mother's house; we found out the place, and went into the room where she was. I asked her for the plate that she had brought away from Mr. Phillips's, she said she knew nothing of any plate; I asked her what she meaned by that, as her own daughter had sent me there for it, she had gave it to her; she blamed the girl for saying so; called her a wicked hussy, or something similar; I desired her to give me the plate immediately, if not give me up the duplicates if she had pledged them; she pulled out the duplicates from her pocket, wrapped up in a bit of paper, and delivered them to me; when I saw the duplicates, and what she had pledged them for; I asked her where the money was that she had pledged all them things for; she put her hand into her pocket, and pulled out the most part of it. I received in notes and money, nine pounds seventeen shillings and six-pence, which she said was the money that she had pledged them for. I then took her in custody; brought her to the office in Whitechapel, and put them in the watchhouse that night. It was late the next day before they were examined; the things were produced from the pawnbrokers by the duplicates; two of the pawnbrokers were bound over to appear here; three in Surry gave up the property, and the two in Middlesex are here. They were all pawned by

               <p>Q. Now tell me what the young woman said before you went to this house - A. She said she had taken them; I asked her whether she kept company with any man that she gave them to at the door, or in the street, she told me no; I told her I was certain that she did. Then she told me that she gave them to her own mother at the door; and she told me where she lived; and she hoped that we would have mercy on her mother. I asked the mother how she came to go there, she said that her daughter had sent for her over, that she wanted to see her very particular; that she had no thought what it was for, nor did not know; and when she went there she gave her all them things and desired her to go away as soon as she could; I asked her why she had not delivered them to her again, and made her take them into her master's house, as being her own daughter, she said she was afraid of doing so, I asked her why she had not packed them up the next morning, her answer was, that she was afraid to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the promise made to the daughter by the prosecutor - A. He would have conversation with her; I saw it was of no use of my talking; I believe he is quite ignorant of any thing of the kind; I believe he was never in a court before; he is a man of good character; he told the girl that if she would tell where the whole of the property was, that he would not hurt her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the mother's house - A. I take it it is nigh Dock-Head, Bermondsey, I do not know the place, it is in Surry.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose this guinea - A. On the 26th of April; I was on the march from the regiment through town to Birmingham; I was quartered at the Castle in Holborn; I had been to a friend in the Five Fields, Chelsea; it rained very hard; and as I was crossing Dyot-street a hackney coach came and I was knocked down by the horses; I then made to the first public house and asked for lodgings; the mistress of the house told me she had no room, I could have no lodgings, and by reason of the fall I laid my head down on the table; I slept about an hour, I then awakened and called for a pint of ale; the ale was drawn; I put my hand into my right hand pocket and pulled out two guineas and a seven shilling piece; I gave the seven shilling piece to the girl to pay for the ale; she returned me six shillings and eight-pence; I laid down the remainder of the change to see if the silver was good, and I laid down the two guineas on the table; while I was looking at the silver the prisoner came up, took up one guinea and went out of the house backwards. There was another woman on the other side of me; I thought she had taken up another guinea; I looked at the money and saw a guinea was gone; I sent for the watchman; I kept the other woman that was along with the prisoner, thinking she would tell me who the prisoner was; by and by the landlady said the woman is at the door that stole your guinea; the watchman and I went out and took the prisoner and searched her; we found two seven shilling pieces, four shillings and two sixpences in her bosom; in consequence of that I requested her to be taken to the watchhouse; when the money was taken from her she swore it was not mine. I am quite sensible it is the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I made away with all my things for that money, I was going into the hospital; when I went in the public house he sat with another woman, he had some silver on the table; I was not near him at all; he was in liquor and his coat was all over mud.</p>
               <p>JURY. Did you see the prisoner take up the guinea - A. I positively did, or else I would not come so far to prosecute.</p>

The prisoner then said he was very sorry, he hoped I would forgive him. This lead was taken from a cottage that I left to Mr. Kingston; the stable is close to the house; it is a leaden pipe, about forty feet.</p>

About a quarter before three o'clock in the afternoon, my wife said, Dobson, there is somebody up stairs; I at last went up stairs, I got within four stairs of the top, going into the room the prisoner came from behind the door, and came down stairs; I caught hold of him, I said you scoundrel, what do you do here; he said he came there to hide himself from the press gang. I perceived something under his left arm. I asked him what he had got there, he said he had got nothing of mine; I said whether you have or have not, I will look at it; I took the articles from between his jacket and waistcoat, which proved to be an old shift of my wife's, marked A. D. No. 1; I took him to the watchhouse. When I returned, I went up stairs, and looked behind the door where he had been; I found wrapped up in this dirty handkerchief, a shirt, a child's petticoat, and a pocket handkerchief, which he had taken from the drawers. I know all these things to be mine. I can swear to the whole of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had not the things about me; he would force the shift about me. I am a stranger here; I was afraid of the press-gang.</p>

               <p>Q. On Saturday night, the 15th of April, were you at the top of your house watching the next house, No. 15 - A. Yes; about twenty minutes after nine; I saw two men on the top of the house, No. 15, they were in the act of cutting the lead; I went down and called my young master; when he came up the two men were there; my master sent for a watchman; when he came the men were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners and tell me whether they are the men - A. Yes; Goddard is one of the men; he was employed in cutting the lead, I could see his face from the light of the candles at the back of the other houses; I was within four yards of them; I was looking at him two minutes; he had a dark brown jacket on.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see him again - A. A little before ten o'clock; he was then in custody; I believe he is the man; I could not distinguish the other person. I saw two men.</p>
               <p>MR. OLDHAM. Q. We have learned that you were called up to the top of the house by the servant - A. Yes; I certainly saw two men there; I first heard them cutting or sawing of lead, probably for a minute and a half or two minutes on the back leads of No. 15. While I was there they both raised up their heads, I only could observe the face of one man, I believe William Matthews to be the man; I saw him on the Monday following at Bow-street-office, I immediately recognized him then. I had observed his face for some time; I have no doubt in my own mind of his being the man, after I had observed him. The alarm was given by springing the rattle in Montague-place; they were then rising themselves up, taking the alarm; I having no weapon in my hand, and my servant being gone; I stepped back and waited half a minute; on my returning they had escaped; there seemed to be no way of escaping but either in the house or over the wall, into the Museum gardens; I searched both of the houses, I found no person there; I saw two rolls of lead on the wall adjoining the house. The alarm was given immediately to the watchmen and the centinel of the guards.</p>

Yes; Mr. Oldham found the lead on the wall; I took it upon the top of the trap, and fitted it to No. 15; it fitted the place from whence the lead had been cut away; there is about fifty-six pound. It has been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. On the night of Saturday the 5th of April, did you see any person come in at the gate - A. I from four o'clock till nine kept the gate; I am sure I let no person in; about twenty minutes or half past nine the prisoners were stopped; they came to the gate to be let out; we stopped them before the alarm was given. I asked them how they came there, they said they were let in at some gate, but they did not know which; they were taken into the lodge. We called two centinels and took them outside, to see if they could tell the gate they was let in at; they said they believed that was the gate; they said they had been drinking at the public house before they came in with a cobler; we sent for the publican, the publican said they had not been in his house all that afternoon. In about five or ten minutes Mr. Oldham's servant came in our garden and made the alarm.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CLARK. Q. I believe you are a watchman there - A. Yes; I and the last witness staid there the whole night. I did not let the prisoner in at twenty minutes past nine o'clock; I heard the step of a foot; the prisoner Matthews is the man that came to ask for Moatt, I detained him; he was inside.

               <p>Matthew's Defence. On Saturday the 15th of April last, I had occasion to go to Knightsbridge-barracks, at the request of a friend, to John Moatt; they informed me he was at the British-museum. When I came to the British-museum, I enquired of a soldier is he knew

            , he said he did not, but if I would go to the lodge, most likely I should hear of him; I went in, they said they did not know him; the serjeant of the guard came forward, i.e said he knew the man for fifteen or sixteen years; that he was on guard, but not that guard; he was upon the Queen's guard, Pimlico. I was detained upon this business. I know no more of it than a child unborn.</p>

On the 27th of April, the prisoner came to my other house in King-street; about two o'clock in the afternoon my brother came up and told me there was a man came in the shop, and stole the waistcoats; I went down to the shop, No. 17, in King-street; I went in and perceived the prisoner with my other servant, Mahony, in my back premises below stairs; the prisoner had his coat off. Mahony told me that the prisoner had offered him a shilling to let him go; the prisoner denied if, he said that he offered it to get something to drink; the prisoner requested me to let him go, saying that his master where he lived would probably turn him away if he apprehended he was charged with such a thing; I asked him who his master was; he told me Mr. Adams the upholsterer, in the Minories; I told him I would send for him; he then denied living with him, and fell on his knees, begged me to forgive him and let him go; I told him I had lost a deal of property, and if he had robbed me I was determined to punish him; I had sent for an officer, I turned round to see if an officer was coming towards the front door, at that time he took a waistcoat from some part about him and put it on a chair close behind him; I turned round and asked him how he came to put it there, when he said he had none, he said that was all he had robbed me of, and begged me upon his knees to let him go; I told him no, I had sent for an officer and would punish him; my brother and the officer at this moment came in; I shewed my brother the waistcoat which he had put on the chair; my brother stated that was not the waistcoat that was stolen from the front shew, and went immediately and fetched a pattern waistcoat of the one he had missed; the officer immediately proceeded to search him, he searched every part but his hat; he then said probably he has got it in his hat; Mahony took the hat off the prisoner's head, in the crown of which was a waistcoat of the same pattern that my brother produced; the prisoner said Mahony, my servant, had put it in his hat; the prisoner never had his hat off while I was in the warehouse with him; the officer took the two waistcoats and secured the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. In what parish is this house of yours, this warehouse, No. 17, King-street, Tower-hill - A. St. Botolph, Aldgate, and some call it the Tower-royalty; the tax gathers always collect as in St. Botolph, Aldgate, Lower precinct.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ever hear that the Royalty was a separate parish - A. No; one is in the City, and the Royalty is without.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. For what you know there may be something attached to the Royalty, distinct from St. Botolph's, Aldgate - A. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a shop is this of yours - A. There is a shew of goods internally; the windows are taken out entirely; we shut up at night with the shutters my way of hanging my goods is internally, other shops externally; there are two persons to serve in that shop my man and my brother, he is not here; my man was bound over, he is here.</p>
               <p>- MAHONY Q. You are shopman to Mr. Swift are you not - A. Yes; in King-street, Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person of the prisoner - A. Yes. On the 27th of April last, about two o'clock in the afternoon, he came to my master's shop, he asked me for my master's brother; I told him he was not in the way; he said he had partly agreed for a coat and waistcoat of him and he would wish to see him; I told him if he would take care of the door for five minutes I would go and fetch him; I went for my master's brother at my master's house in Sparrow-corner; when I returned back he was not at the door where I left him. I went into the shop I did not see him in the shop; I went from there into the back warehouse, and there I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you use that back room as a shop too - A. Yes; the clothes are laid up in the back warehouse on shelves, and they outside of the door hung on railing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that railing outside of the door or within side<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170031"/>- A. It is where the windows should be; the windows are taken out to shew the goods, and the clothes are hung upon the railings; and the railings are within side; the railings is at the center of the window, and these things are hung where the panes of glass should be.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you found him in the back warehouse - A. Yes; he had a patent cord waistcoat in his hand; he asked me if I could tell him the price of that waistcoat; I told him when my master's brother came he would tell him the price of the waistcoat; I left him then in the back warehouse, and came to the door, and as my master's brother was coming down I missed the waistcoat that hung at the door on the railing.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the waistcoat hanging there before - A. When I went for my master's brother I saw it then, I am positive of; I told my master's brother this waistcoat was gone from the door while I was gone for him; master's brother went into the warehouse, I remained at the door.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you ever seen the prisoner before - A. He was one day in our shop but he bought nothing. In about five or ten minutes master's brother called me in; he said this young man came for nothing but a thieving; he told me to take care of him while I go for an officer; while he was gone for an officer the prisoner offered me a shilling; then master came in, and the officer; when the officer had searched him, I found the waistcoat in the crown of his hat; the prisoner said I put the waistcoat there. Upon my oath I never saw the waistcoat there until his hat was taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the waistcoat that was picked up from the chair - A. I did; I know it to be my master's waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Before it lay on the chair what part of the shop was that waistcoat in - A. At the further end of the warehouse there were fifty waistcoats upon the shelf; I cannot say particularly when I saw it before.</p>

            . I am headborough of the Old Tower, without the city.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this shop in King-street - A. It is in the same liberty as I live in myself; in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate, lower precinct. When I came into the warehouse I searched the prisoner; at first I found nothing; the prisoner had his hat on, I said he had nothing concealed on him, except it was his hat; Mahoney took off his hat; it was concealed in his hat; it appeared to be put in very exactly and level; I took the prisoner in custody, and I took the waistcoat that was in the hat; Mr. Swift gave me another waistcoat.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of the waistcoat found on the chair - A. Six shillings and sixpence; they both cost me alike, only this is soiled.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the London docks to see a cousin of mine; this man wanted me to buy some clothes before he called me in; I called on that day to see whether that young man was there, and this man told me he would go and call him; his brother took me up stairs to look at a coat, this man never mentioned that it is the brother I dealt with. I bought a pair of breeches of him about two months before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . On the 20th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in my field, he was carrying this lead wrapped up in a sack; on seeing me he turned back; it was just about dusk; I knew him before. I had a young child in my arms; I gave it to my brother. I ran after him and laid hold of the end of the bag, behind him, I asked him what he had there; he replied, what is that to you. I held fast of the bag and looked him in the face, and said what is it you have got; he said he had nothing belonging to me; I told him it belonged to somebody else; I should stop him and the lead too. I took hold of his collar, he shoved me from him; I took hold of him again and called for my brother; I repeated a third name, to make it appear there was three of us, and when my brother drew near he said if I would let him go quietly, without holding of him, he would go with us; on them conditions I let him go; he walked about twenty paces and then he ran away; I pursued him half way across the fields; he escaped.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was it before you saw him again - A. On Saturday morning last, between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not quite two months ago - A. No; my brother came and told me that a man of that description had just past by; I told him to watch where he went to, I would be with him presently; he said he thought he went down Grove-row; he made an attempt at a gate, to perceive whether it was fast or not; at a house that was robbed a few nights before. I went the back way, and met him nearly opposite of Mr. Pagett's; I came upon him by surprise; he asked me what I wanted with him, I told him I wanted him for what he had done before, and I thought he was after no good then.</p>
               <p>Q. What had been his trade, do you know - A.He told the justice he was a lumper. I only know him to be a bad character. I delivered him to the officer, who took him before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q.When you took him first of all, did you take possession<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170032"/>of the lead - A. Yes, he left the lead, and I secured it. I marked the lead. The prisoner said as I was coming down the road, this would but detain him a few months; and he would he d - d if he did not serve me out when he came out of trouble; with the most bitter oaths and expressions.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On Friday the 12th of May, I missed my child's cap out of my drawer. I asked the prisoner if she knew any thing of it; I told her if she would tell me what she had done with it before her master came home, I would not punish her; but she did not confess then. On the following day, Saturday, when she was cleaning the apartment, I saw a man's neck handkerchief drop from under her petticoats; I asked her what it was, she told me it was a handkerchief that her mother had to wash for some person, and her mother asked her to take it home for her.

               <p>Q. Was she an acquaintance of yours - A. I know nothing of her; she came in unperceived by me or any of my children; a neighbour knocked at my door, and from the information I received, I found her on the landing place; she had just come out of the front kitchen with some coats; I saw her laying them out of her hands as I came on the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. What coats were in her hand - A. Two of my husband's coats, and a pair of my husband's boots; she saw me come, and then she laid them out of her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had the coats been - A. They lay on our bed; I left them there not ten minutes; I asked her what she wanted down there, she said let me go backwards; I looked and saw that my husband's coats and boots were laying down by her; I asked her if she was going to take them away, she told me that she had not got any thing; she wished to get away very much. I sent for an officer, he apprehended her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found out since who she is - A. I have heard a bad character of her.</p>

            , gingerbread-baker, in the Township of New Brentford, in the parish of Hanwell, Middlesex; I went to the house and I saw the prisoner; I told him I had a warrant to search his premises, I knew he lived there, I have known him for a number of years; he said he was very glad to see me, for he wanted a constable, he was accused of stealing the boy's watch, he knew nothing about it, and he was very willing I should search him; I searched his person to see if I could find the duplicate; I did not find any thing about him; he said he had two boxes up stairs if I would go up stairs with him; I went up stairs with him; one was locked, he took the key out of his pocket and unlocked it; I searched the box, I did not find the watch there; he said he had another box there if I would search that he would be glad, it was unlocked; he suspected the servant girl of the house, and the boy had put the watch there; he had a quarrel with them, and they were both his enemies; I looked in that box, and taking up some some loose things this watch lay under them; I took the watch and him before the magistrate, he was committed; I have had the watch ever since; it is a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You went on the Thursday to search the place for what was lost on the Monday morning - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nearly four days had elapsed before you found it, the prisoner was doing his work in the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had an opportunity of getting rid of it - A. No doubt of that; I have known him twenty years; I believe him to be too honest for that; I know him to be an honest sober man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The box that was locked he willingly opened with the key, and he told you he wished you to search the box that was unlocked - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a servant girl that has left the place since, she went up stairs to make the bed - A. Yes; the girl left the master's service the night I made the search; she had warning previous to that.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether they were upon good terms together - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. to Salmon. The prisoner got up every morning before you and went to his work, did not he - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Betty, the servant girl and you were upon good terms - A. Not upon very good terms; she had been plagueing of me, she took away my gaiters and I lost a shilling up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Betty ever say to you that she thought she had better confess the frolic that she had with the old man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning when you told the prisoner of your loss he directly advised you to go to the magistrate and get a warrant - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. You did not put the watch in the trunk yourself, did you - A. No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Your lordship, I cannot tell who put it in my trunk, the trunk was open; I persuaded him every day to get a constable and have every body searched in the house; I told him I should then be satisfied, and he would too; I said it grieves me that you should lose your watch. I cannot say that the lad had done any thing against me; I told him to do his business; he always said stop a bit, by that reason I had to do it myself, which sometimes made me so tired I could hardly walk up to bed; I told him I was in my master's place in the bake-house; and two or three times the maid did things which was not her place to do to me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 12th of May last do you remember seeing the prisoner - A. Yes; I saw him in my loft up one pair of stairs; it is on the same floor with my accompting house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any business in your loft - A. None, whatever. When I came down the lower loft I saw him as it coming from the accompting house; I asked him what he wanted; he made no reply that I could understand. I believe he is a Spanfard. He passed on and went down stairs; I immediately went to the accompting house and missed these ten claspknives; I had seen them there not above five minutes before. I called John Metcalfe, an apprentice of mine, he is no relation, he went and fetched him back. The first place that I saw him afterwards was at the Thames police; the office was by; they took him in there; he delivered the knives up to the boy.</p>
               <p>JOHN METCALFE. Q. Your master bid you go after the prisoner, did he - A. Yes. He overtook the prisoner in Lower Gun-alley, about half a mile from our house; as soon as I spoke to him he immediately gave me the knives; I took the knives before the magistrate; they have been sealed up ever since.</p>

On the 4th of May, he and I were working at the same scale where every thing is weighed that were landed; I was at the landing of the case of books out of the ship, called the Spanish Patriot; it was opened for the purpose of being weighed; there was paper between every tier of books.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found these books in some waste paper; I put them in my bosom; I thought them of little or no value, and when I came to the gate the officer stopped me; I had them in my bosom.</p>

            . Q. You are the wife of the last witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing respecting the loss of a key - A. Perfectly well; the key of the closet in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. That closet contains a bunch of keys on which was the key of your cellar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that key being lost do you remember whether the prisoner was aware of the circumstance - A. She was asked if she had seen the key, and helped me to look for it; it was not found at that time, not till lately.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the key not being found what was done - A. The lock was taken off; the wards were a little altered, and another key was made.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the prisoner lived in your service did you lose any silk stockings - A. Yes, one pair out of my bed room, and the half silk handkerchief I lost; I enquired for it among the servants; I did not miss the other things until they were brought from the prisoner's mother.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of something that passed in your family were all the servants in your family summoned before you - A. There were, a fortnight ago; all asked to deliver up their keys; they all did except the prisoner, she denied having her keys about her, she said she must go to the kitchen for them; I insisted that she should not leave the room, she should search her pockets for the keys and give them up; she did so, and gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170036"/>up her keys. I insisted that she had more keys about her, that she had a particular key of mine; she denied having the key of my closet, and to convince me that she had not, she would take her pockets off, and in doing so, she took the key out and tucked it up her clothes somewhere; she then sat down. Mr. Lyndon went to search the boxes, and took her keys; I continued in the room; a loud knock happened to come at the door, she got up, and the key dropped from her clothes; I picked up the key, and found it was the key that I wanted; it was the key of the front parlour closet that I had lost. I gave the key to the officer, and the prisoner was taken to Hatton-Garden; and in consequence of what passed at Hatton-Garden, the house of Halesworth was searched, and the property was brought to my house the next morning. I saw it afterwards at the office, it is the subject matter of this indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long ago was the key lost - A. This time twelve month; the stockings in September, and the other things at various times; the fan and books I did not miss at all, nor never suspected that the prisoner had taken them. The prisoner said she found the key in the kitchen among some dirty rags.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not she add, that she did not know what key it was - A. She did so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Have you any reason to know that that key was made use of by the prisoner for opening of any thing - A. I am positive to her opening the closet with it, I heard her; the key was tried by the officer, and Mr. Lyndon; it opened it perfectly easy, better than the new key.</p>

In the premises I found these silk stockings, this one handkerchief, and one half silk handkerchief, two books, and a fan; she came down to the office, she was not taken in custody that day; on the next examination, she came voluntary to the office, and then she and the daughter were fully committed.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you searched Halesworth's premises, was any thing said by her of the property that was found - A. She said she had bought the property at different times; the stockings she bought of a jew a twelve month ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. At the time that you went to make the search, she readily gave up the keys - A. She did, and then she came to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. There was plenty of time for her to go away if she chose - A.She was allowed to go away from the Friday to the Tuesday.</p>

               <p>JAMES JOHNSON. I am a carpenter; I live next door to Mr. Varney. On the 12th of April, near five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner turn up the boots and look at them. I did not see him take them away; I saw them in his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was it after they were put in the club room that you parted with the prisoner - A. A week or ten days; I never looked after the things; I did not suppose that she would touch them; after I had discharged the girl the prosecutrix came the next morning to my house, she said she had left some things; I sent for this band box down, on her examining the band box; she said there were not all the things that she left in the house, and she wished to know where the girl was; when the girl came to me I told her she was liable to be taken up for taking the things away; she brought some things back again, that I had never seen before; she sent them to the person at the next door, and they brought them into my house.</p>
               <p>Q. These things which the prisoner brought back were they claimed by the prosecutrix - A. Yes; she had them all from my house; she claimed them as her own; this was near a month before the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Before you saw this girl and caused her to be taken up, had you found any thing at Curnock's of yours that you left there - A. What she left next door I did; they are not the things mentined in the indictment.</p>

               <p>JEREMIAH FITZPATRICK. On the 26th of April the prisoner came to the house where I lodge; my sister let him have a bed in the same room where I slept; he came as a constant lodger to my sister that keeps the house; he agreed by the ck; he had his supper and went to bed; he did not pay for either. On the same night, when he and I were going to bed, he asked me what time in the morning I should rise; I told him I must be at my work at six o'clock in the morning; he told me seven o'clock was time enough for him to be up; I got up at six o'clock, leaving him behind; he was awake; I got up; he spoke to me. I came back, I found the prisoner dressing himself; he turned his back to me, and wrapped something inside of that loose coat he has on now. I went down stairs and my mother was down stairs making a fire. I went to my work. In a little time after this I heard that the cloak was missing. I saw the cloak at six o'clock in the morning, when I got up. He had to go through the room in which the cloak was, to come down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return the next night - A. No; he did not return till the next week. My brother heard he was at a house of call in Long Acre; I went there; the prisoner came in, he asked to speak to me; he took me outside; he said pray do not expose me in the taproom; I knew you have come after me; I said why; he said I know you have; I said you must be a villain to rob my poor mother of her cloak; he said if you come along with me I will shew you the house where it is; he took me to a Jew's house, the corner of Clare-market, his name is Nathan; he said Nathan, let this man have the cloak which I brought you, it belongs to his wife; Nathan said he had not the cloak in the house that night; he would let him have it in the morning. In the morning, when we took the two officers there, he said he knew nothing about it; the prisoner afterwards told me he pawned the cloak at the pawnbroker's, and sold the duplicate to the jew for one shilling and six pence.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any cloak pawned at your house - A. Yes, I believe by the young man at the bar; I cannot positively swear to him; it was something like him. It was on the 27th of April, about the middle of the day; he pledged it in the name of Sullivan; I believe the cloak was taken out on the 29th of April by a young woman; it was pawned for sixteen shillings. I saw Nathan at Shadwell office.</p>

               <p>ROBERT WILLIAMS. I am a constable; I know nothing more than apprehending this man; I searched Nathan's house; the cloak was not found.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a piece of drab brown cloth - A. Yes; I have got the piece now in court that it was cut off. I took stock in August, 1808.</p>

               <p>Mr. Andrews. Be so good as to turn to the 3d of October, 1808, and before you read it tell us whether it is your hand writing - A. It is my hand writing. Two yards of corbow mixture, exactly that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Go on to the 13th of October - A. That I have not got in here, that is in the day book; this is in the cash book.</p>

               <p>Mr. Andrews. Go on to the 5th of November - A. That is in my day book; there is no entry here. A yard and three quarters, corbow mixture, my own handwriting. 11th of April, one yard and three quarters; my own hand writing. A yard and three quarters makes a coat.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended - A. The 15 or 16th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the quantity of corbow cloth you had at that time - A. Yes; as soon as the piece of cloth was brought to me; I examined it.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of corbow cloth had you in your possession - A. I have left all things to my attorney.</p>
               <p>MR. WALKER. Twelve yards and a half.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are to swear for yourself, not by your attorney nor clerk - A. I measured it; it measured twelve yards and a half; I found it a yard and a half too short.</p>

            . On the 15th of April I went to the prisoner's lodgings, I did not go after him, I went after another person, whom I took in custody, on suspicion of house breaking, that was Howard; I did not find the prisoner there. I have two pieces of cloth; I found these on the Sunday at Mr. Barber's, Cow-cross; Mrs. Barber delivered them to me, in company with the prisoner's wife; she went with me to shew me where they where; she herself asked Mrs. Barber for the piece of blue cloth; she said nothing about the brown cloth. I saw the prisoner on the Sunday before I found the cloth; I told him that I had a suspicion that it was some cloth that Howard had stole; Andrews said no, it was not, it was some cloth that he had purchased to Mr. Shephard his master; he did not say when, he said it was regular entered in the book; whether he said it was entered, or that he had entered it, I am not certain. There was enquiry made in the course of the day after Andrews. I took him in custody about ten o'clock at night; the prisoner declared solemnly, that it had been Mr. Shephard's cloth, it was his property that he had bought for a relation in Cow-cross.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you got the cash-book here, turn to the date of the 13th of October - A. The day book, that entry is my hand writing, 13th of October, one yard and three quarters of superfine mixed cloth.</p>
               <p>Jury. What colour - A. It does not say what colour here, by the 31, 162 I know what cloth it is; it refers to a superfine corbow mixed cloth; we had no other mixed cloth of that number; November 5th, 31, 162, one yard and three quarters superfine mixed cloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you any means of knowing what quantity was sold in the whole of that mixture - A. After taking the stock in August 1808, the whole quantity sold was nine yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended - A. The 16th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after he was apprehended, examine what quantity of corbow cloth remained in your shop - A. Yes, there remained twelve yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. There would be a deficiency then of one yard and three quarters - A. Yes; I examined the books all the way from the taking of the stock, to the 16th of April, there are no other entries than those I have read; I have two books, when it is ready money, it goes into the cash-book, and when on sale, it is in the day book.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it appears that the quantity found upon the prisoner being apprehended, there was a deficiency of one yard and three quarters - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined that brown cloth to know whether it is Mr. Shephard's - A. I believe it is the same that I have here, and cut from the twelve yards and a half; I have compared them, and I believe it to be the same; one yard and three quarters is enough for the cut of all our coats.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. That is a secret that our taylors do not let us into; you had another corbow mixture, had not you - A. There might be.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was there or was there not - A. I am not in the shop altogether, I am clerk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You are in the shop in part, do not you know that there was another corbow mixture - A. I do not know whether there was or there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many cuts of cloth were in your warehouse took off in the course of a day - A.Ten or twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not an hundred - A. Not so many as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you fifty or sixty - A. I do not know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170040"/>there were a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of business where money is received, it goes into the cash-book; where money is not received, where the creditor is to debitted, as for instance, suppose I was to go into your shop for one yard and three quarters of the corbow mixture, you put down 31, 162, one yard and three quarters without any name - A. Then the course is to make an entry on the slate; No. 31, 162, one yard and three quarters, one pound sixteen shillings and nine-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you or the other clerk is to enter in the book, so that whether your entry is correct in the book; that depends with the shopman who enters it on the slate; so that whether either of you should alter or drop a figure, that remains with one of you, or whether you should be asleep or awake when you make the entry, and in spite of all your care a mistake will arise - A. Where there is a quantity it may arise, and when we are in a great hurry, we might make a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. And whether you were in a hurry that day the entry was made, you do not know how many persons make the entry in the book - A. Only me and Mr. Shephard makes the entry in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons serve in the shop, and enters on the slate - A. My master and Mr. Andrews; I have sometimes in a hurry, and sometimes other persons make the entry.</p>
               <p>Q. So if I was Mr. Andrews, I might serve in the shop; I might call 31, 162, and another put it down, therefore whether there be or be not a deficiency of a yard and three quarters, it depends upon the accuracy of the person that makes the entry, if there has been an error in any one number, there may not be that deficiency - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The crime that I am now charged with I am innocent of; Mr. Shephard took me up on Sunday; I had not the opportunity of going to satisfy my master that I had bought that piece of cloth.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>MRS. VYSE. On the 5th of May, I saw the prisoner go into Mrs. Wilson's house, she had no tea tray with her then; I saw her come out with a tea tray under her arm, half covered with a cloak: I knew it to be Mrs. Wilson's tray; I have often seen it in Mrs. Wilson's house. I went and informed Mrs. Wilson; I know the prisoner by going through the street crying old clothes. I am sure she is the woman.</p>
               <p>MARY Mc FELLAN. I saw the prisoner come out of Mrs. Wilson's house with the tea tray; and she passed me at my own door with the tea tray under her arm. I am sure she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My prosecutrix came to me in Rosemary-lane, where I get my bread; she told me she was informed that I was the person that came out of her house with the tea tray under my cloak; I told her I would go with her any where; I knew nothing of her tea tray. I said ma'am, you know me well enough to think better of me. I gave her a direction to come to me in the morning, she never came nigh me in the morning; I waited till half past ten o'clock, and then I went down to her house, to know who was the person that informed her that I had the tea tray under my cloak; I had no cloak on, I had not been in the neighbourhood two months; she said she would not prosecute me if I would tell her where the tea tray was, I told her I did not know any thing of it; I said I would sooner tell her if could, than he taken to a prison.</p>

In the morning of the 17th of April, I was informed that my house would be down, as the props that supported it were taken away. It is necessary for me to tell you that this house is against a common shore, called the Fleet river, to that house and the other opposite of it, there were props put up of an equal support, from one house to the other; I saw these three props were gone. I was informed by a neighbour who had taken them away.</p>

I saw Thomas Usher drive the props along the water, as he was in the shore the water was very low; the other prisoner and he were together; I did not see where they took them from; they were not far from the place. I am sure they were taken from Mr. Rankin's houses.</p>

               <p>Usher's Defence. On Saturday the 17th of April, the water was about six feet in the shore; it was impossible for a man to get up. On that same day we caught three or four planks, we delivered them up to Mr. Wood's carpenter. On the Monday following we went to see whether there were any more lodged in the creek.</p>
               <p>Manning's Defence. On Monday the 17th of April we could not work, the water was so high; the bricklayer took me to Clerkenwell-Green, and there I worked with him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ROOKE. I am a bricklayer, I was employed by the same master; they were employed to work on the shore.

             was passing on the opposite side; the prisoner had this old bag hanging across his back, it appeared to be nearly full; I said to my brother officer look out. I stopped the prisoner just before he got in the bars of the city; he was going towards Smithfield, I touched the bag that he had on his back with a cane; I said halloa, Tom; what have you got here, dust; he said yes, master; I knew him. My brother officer hit the sack underneath, it sounded hard; I said you had better take him in the house here, and it turned out to be a bear skin. He stood a little bit amazed as if he did not know what to say; at last he said he found it under the wall of the New church, in the Strand, about ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he was going to take it - A. No; not till after he was committed; he then said that he happened to see me stand, or else he should have taken it to the sign of the Blue Post, near where I stood, to one Wilcox, who was to give him two guineas and a half for it. Wilcox was a publican, and this was the son of the publican, who kept another house in West-street.</p>

Trott asked me what I had, I said a bear skin, and some bones; he said shoot it out; I shot it out. and went with him; I said I was going to take it to Rag-fair, or somewhere thereabout, to get vend for it.</p>

               <p>Q. You had no occasion to look after it till the prisoner was apprehended - A. I had not. A Lambeth-street officer came to me, I went to the prisoner's house in the hay loft, I saw a pair of wheels; I have never seen the axle-tree again. The wheels were fresh painted red; I rubbed some of the paint off; I found them to be the wheels that I had lost; they were painted yellow and prickled down with black.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself with positiveness to say they are your wheels - A. I positively think they are; I can swear no further.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 20th of April, in the morning, I had occasion to go to Flower's house to search it, and to apprehend him, which I did. In searching of the hay loft I saw these two wheels, which are in the indictment; they were fresh painted, and in the hay loft merely to dry. I took the prisoner to the office. I knew of a person that had lodged an information a few days before, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170042"/>he had lost a pair of wheels. After I had locked up the prisoner I went to Mr. Parson's house and informed him, and took him into the hay loft, where the wheels were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing about the premises that wheels would be useful to - A. No, nothing at all. Mr. Parsons immediately said he would swear to them wheels; he took a cloth and wiped some of the paint off, and pointed out the box where he had altered it. I have one wheel here, and the other is at the New inn. I asked the prisoner how he came by these wheels; he said he bought them in Smithfield market about two months before; he meaned to get a little timber and knock up a body himself, and make a little cart, and drag it about with a jack ass, for the benefit of his wife's health; she was far advanced in her pregnancy; it was to ride her about.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There is witnesses to prove that I bought the wheels in Smithfield market.</p>

On the 25th of March I found my warehouse broken open; I lost sixty pound weight of beaver wool, the value of some was sixty, some seventy, and some eighty shillings; I found that I had lost half a lot of Hudson's Bay skins; I lost three dozen of beaver skins; there are three of them here. The wool had been pulled off. I have no partner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SCRIVENER. I am a hatter, 111, in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I know him by bringing these skins for sale on the 2nd of May. A few days before he brought the skins he called and asked me whether I dealt in skins; I told him I did; he asked me what I generally gave for skins; I told him according to the quality, if he let me see them I would tell him what I could give for them; he said they belonged to a male of a ship. On the 2nd of May, in the evening, the prisoner brought the skins to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of them - A. I do not know; there were very little passed. I was going out at the time, I desired him to leave the skins, on the next day I would take an opportunity and look at them, and give him an answer in the evening. On the 3rd I went over to Mr. Taylor, a furrier, to ask him his opinion of it; for him to come over to my house to inform me the value of them. They were sent to Mr. Taylor by a porter, he could not come himself.</p>
               <p>Q. While they were at Mr. Taylor's did the prisoner call on you - A. The prisoner called on the evening of the 3rd, he asked me if I had determined about the skins, and if I had looked at them; I told him that I had not an opportunity of looking them over, that if he would be with me the next day I would give him an answer. He said that the man that belonged to them was waiting at the public house near me, or, I believe, the first public house; he urged me very much to go and speak to the man about them, to agree about the price; I told him it was of no use my going to the man, I could say no more to him than I did, as my friend had not seen them. He said the man very much wanted money, and would be glad if I could strike a bargain, or to that effect; I asked him how much he wanted; he said twenty pounds; I told him I had not so much cash in the house; I advanced him fifteen pounds in part; he called the next evening; I told him I had not an opportunity of looking at them; he was to call again on the Friday. I saw Griffiths and Mr. Taylor on Friday; I did not see the prisoner till the Saturday; I met him as I was coming out of the London dock; he asked me if I had determined about the skins; he told me the man wanted seventeen shillings a pound for them; he would not take less, as they were any one's money; I appointed him to come up to my house and bring the man with him; he did not come. On the Monday following I saw him when he was apprehended; he came down to the London dock; he asked me if I had determined about the skins; I told him I thought they were a great deal too dear, and asked him if he could not take any less. He excused himself not coming on Saturday; he said the man was groggy; he would not come. Then he said he would take fifteen and sixpence for the skins; he wished me to go up to a public house on Tower Hill and see the man; I told him I would much sooner he would come to some house near the dock. He came to the Ship and Star, he did not bring the man. He remained with me till the officer came. Mr. Griffiths asked him if he was the man that brought the skins to my house, and if he knew any thing about them; he said he knew nothing more about them than being employed to sell them. Griffiths told him to give up the person and clear himself; he then said that he had them of a man in the neighbourhood of the name of Brice; Mr. Griffiths said, you had them of Brice, had you, in East Smithfield; he said, yes; Mr. Griffiths answered, that as soon as ever he went to Brice, he would deny ever seeing him. When the prisoner had the money of me he returned to the door and wished if the man himself came after the skins that I would make as good a bargain as I could, so as to give him a few shillings for himself, as the man would give him very little for his trouble.</p>

I did; I looked at the skins, they appeared suspicious; in consequence of that, I wrote a short note to the prosecutor; the prosecutor came.

               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS. I went to the Ship and Star, East Smithfield; that was on Monday at four o'clock. When I went in, I saw the prisoner and Mr. Scrivener sitting together; I asked Mr. Scrivener how he did, and the next words, I said, is that the man that you had the skins of; I spoke it out loud; Mr. Scrivener said it was; I asked how he accounted for the skins, did he carry them himself, he said he knew nothing about the skins; I am quite sure of that; after some conversation that passed between Mr. Scrivener and him, he acknowledged that it was so.</p>
               <p>COURT. What conversation passed between Mr. Scrivener and him, that should induce him to say that - A. He said you know you brought them to me; then he acknowledged that he had brought them to Mr. Scrivener</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person of the prisoner - A. No, I did not; he told me he knew me. I told him that Mr. Scrivener had accounted how he came by them, now it was his turn; I searched him then, I found nothing; he said after I had talked to him a little while, that he had them of one Brice, a tallow chandler, I told him I knew Brice very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the fifteen pounds - A. No, I did not; there were some halfpence about him; as we were going into the street, he said will you go round with me by Brice's, I told him no, I should take him up to the office; as soon as I had done that I should go and fetch Brice, I did; I took Brice in custody and took him to the office. Brice was discharged the second hearing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you know Brice - A. I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. He has been taken up a good many times - A. He has. As I was bringing the prisoner from the magistrate to the House of Correction, I said I would assist him in bringing any thing out that he could give information of; I would do every thing I could to catch him. When I brought him out of the House of Correction, he told me he thought he could find two soldiers at the White Horse in High Holborn, near Mr. Scrivener's house, that saw him and Brice at that house; I took him in a coach there to the public house; he pointed out two men that I took down to the office in a coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You found out two men that had observed him and Brice together - A. Yes. He told me then that if I would go to Wych-street, Drury-lane, he would shew me the house that he took the skins from. I went into the house of one Solomon, no skins I found; they denied knowing any thing at all about it. They swore at the office that they knew nothing about it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jones. There is a mark on that skin.</p>
               <p>COURT. What may be the value of these thirty-five skins - A. About forty-six pounds; they cost me a guinea and eight-pence a pound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I took the skins to Mr. Scrivener; I never told him that I had them of a mate of a ship; I had them of Brice, that Brice had a commission of a mate of a ship to sell these skins.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean to say that you mentioned Brice's name to him. - Prisoner. Yes, I did; Brice said he had them of a mate of a ship to sell some beavers; he asked me if I was acquainted with a hatter, I told him I was not particularly; there was an excise officer of the dock, I was employed by times in it, I would ask him the question. I asked Mr. Serivener if he used any such thing, he said he did; I asked him then if he would buy them, he said he would if they were worth his money; he could not tell the worth of them until he saw the bulk; Brice asked me if I knew where Mr. Scrivener lived, I told him I did not; I asked a man that knew, it proved to be No. 111; I told Brice that Mr. Scrivener said he would buy them if they were worth his money. On the 1st of May, when I was going to the dock, he said Watkins, I have not sent these skins, I told him I was going to my employment, I could not go; he said my employment was over at four o'clock; I told him I had no objection to go at four o'clock; he said the skins lay at Temple-bar, it was a short way to carry them, he would pay me porteridge. We went into the Crooked Billet; he told me to go in there, he would call upon me; I stopped there an hour. I was on my feet going away when in he came; I asked him why he stopped, he said the people were not at home, they were at home now. I went with him a short way, he told me to stop at a door, the stairs faced the door right up; he went up and brought the bundle down; Brice brought it down. We walked in company to Scrivener's house; I was at the door before him, he was close by my side. I laid the bundle down in the passage; Mr. Scrivener asked me if these were the skins, I never saw the skins; I told him I supposed they were; I asked Mr. Scrivener, when he could give an answer, he said he would let me know in the morning. Brice asked me when I should see Mr. Scrivener again, I told him I should see him in the dock; he then asked me to go up to Holborn with him to ask Mr. Scrivener for twenty pound; I told him I had other things to do that evening, I could not go; he said he had a bill to pay he wanted twenty pounds; I accordingly went. Mr. Scrivener brought up fifteen pounds, he said it was all the money that he had in the house, he gave that in part of payment; and if he did not bargain for the skins the fifteen pound was to be returned, and the skins were to be taken away. I pressed Mr. Scrivener to go into the public house; I acted as porter, I told him to make the bargain as cheap as he could, as I got nothing by it, he said that perhaps it might be a penny or two pence a pound, they might split upon that; I told him then not to concern himself with me. I accordingly went into this public house; Brice was there, and we went away together. On the evening of the 5th, Brice was determined either to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170044"/>he money for the skins, or to take them away, as he had not seen Mr. Scrivener, he wanted to see him particularly; I went into this public house, and Brice by and by comes in; I said I was waiting for you. There were three men that saw me take the money out of my pocket-book; I said I had fifteen pounds, and in case they did not make a bargain, the money was to be returned. Brice has denied of ever being in company with me, and ever knowing any transaction in the business. These men have swore to him at the office. That jew swore that he did not see Brice; his wife was in the passage at the time that he put the bundle on my shoulder. I never had any connections with Brice; I never knew any of his connections or transactions whatsoever in my life. I keep a chandler's shop, he served me with half a hundred weight of soap, and half a dozen pounds of candles; I never had any other dealings with him, than he asking me to get a customer for these beaver skins.</p>

            . I was in the White Horse with the last witness and an acquaintance. When I went in the prisoner said there is two old faces that I know; I asked the prisoner if he lived in the neighbourhood, he said he did not, he was waiting for a person coming in; he said he thought the man would not come, he was going out; the man came in, he said here the man is.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see that man afterwards at the magistrate's - A. Yes; it turned out to be Brice; he called for something to drink; they had some conversation, Brice spoke so low I could not hear; the beer did not come; Brice pushed him to go. They had no parcel with them.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember being in company with the prisoner at any public house - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Brice - A. Yes, I saw him there; I am servant to Mr. Trower, the counseller, Harper-street; I went into the tap-room about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner there counting some notes on the table; he doubled them up in one fold, and put them in his pocket-book, and put his pocket-book into his side pocket, then he went to the door; he called a serjeant of the Guards; they drank a pot of porter; the serjeant went away. The prisoner sat a considerable time afterwards, till these two witnesses came in, he said there is two faces I know; they could not see his face being in the dusk of the evening. In about an hour after the serjeant went, Brice came in, the prisoner got up to go away; the first man said when he was going by, I know you, you was a grenadier; they stopped a minute, and then Brice came in, he said he was going; Brice said what have you got to drink, they both went and sat down together in the box; the prisoner unbuttoned his coat and put his hand inside his coat; the other man just touched him, and then they both went out; it struck me that these were not his notes that he was counting of then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see the prisoner take the pocketbook out - A. No, Brice whispered to him, he was in the act of taking it out. They went out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. He put his hand as if towards the pocket, but before he had taken any thing out Brice whispered to him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One can easily understand that - A. Brice whispered to him, and then the prisoner said well, well, and they went out; I saw no more of them that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Pray how near were you setting to these two men who have been examined as witnesses - A. I was not sitting in their company, they were as near as me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they could see what you saw - A. No, they were talking together. I was in nobody's company.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they before you or after you in the public house - A. After me; when I went in there was nobody but the prisoner and the servant maid of the house, till he called serjeant Ball in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the prisoner waiting in the house - A. An hour an a half from the time I first went in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after these men came in, did he take the notes and count them - A. He counted the notes half an hour before these men came in; there was nobody else in the tap-room but him and me when he counted them; I conversed with the prisoner about some highland soldiers that went by, respecting their dress. I saw Mr. Brice in the yard on Thursday, he was looking at the list; I said this is the man. I never saw Mr. Brice before I saw him at the public house; I knew him directly when I saw him. I was subpoened to come here; I said I saw this man count some notes, and that is the way I came here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I have since been in company with the police officer to execute a warrant at the house of Westbrook, on the 9th of this present month; and on my going to the door I enquired if she recollected buying any goods of Stock and Cooper in Holborn, to which she answered yes. I stood in the door way when the officer came, and I repeated the same question, and as to the recollection of my person; she then appeared to hesitate, and said that though she recollected bying goods in Holborn, she did not recollect the name of the shop, nor my person. We asked her several questions afterwards, most of which she answered with apparent indifference, and said, I do not recollect. By the prisoner a piece of linen was produced out of a box from under the bed, she was desired to produce a piece of linen.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was taken out of the box, and you saw it, did you know it to be the same piece - A.

I deposited it in the till after having referred to Mr. Watson respecting the propriety of giving the prisoner change; I marked it before I put it in the till; that note was taken from the till by Mr. Watson, that is the usual course of the business; I do not know that I saw it done.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. You know that you received a note on that day but your doubt is whether it was from the prisoner - A. After the elapse of so many months I might be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now, sir, looking at her, to the best of you belief do you believe she is the person - A.I do; so far as my memory is perfect it is the prisoner; but it is possible my recollection may not be sufficient.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BROWN. I am an officer of Shadwell office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for the purpose of executing a warrant - A. Yes, on the 9th of May. Mr. Cooper went to the door first, he rapped at the door, the other gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170046"/>was with him; I stood at a little distance behind, till the door was opened; Mr. Cooper said to the prisoner, how do you do ma'am; he then asked her where the linen was which she bought of him in Holborn; she turned herself a little way round, and said she did not recollect him, she bought some linen in Holborn, but she did not recollect the shop. I then left the other officer below, and proceeded up stairs with Mr. Cooper and the other gentleman. When we got up stairs, Mr. Cooper asked where the linen was; she took the keys out of her pocket, and pulled the box out from under the bed, she said there it was; I took it out of the box, Mr. Cooper said it was the property that was bought at their shop. Then I looked in the chest of drawers in the room; she said what are you looking for money, I told her yes; looking for money as well as any thing else; she then said come into the other room, for that she took the bunch of keys, and undid another chest of drawers. In this pocket-book there was a twenty pound note, and a ten pound note; I asked her how she came by it, and who she had taken it of, she said she did not know; I told her it was very strange that she could not inform me and the gentleman where she took these two notes. I took one of these small keys from her bunch of keys, and unlocked a drawer in a dressing case that belonged to her; there I found a one pound note and some new six-pences; I asked her then how she came by that, she said she did not know that it was there, she could not give any account of it; I locked the drawers again, and went down to Mrs. Yoert's lodgings; I tried one of these keys, it undid Mrs. Yoert's drawers; I brought the keys, the notes, and linen, all away. I examined Mrs. Yoert's premises on the 22nd of November, I saw the glass was broke just over the hasp; I found then that the glass had been broken on the inside. The points of the glass were standing out in the street; I told Mrs. Yoert then that I was satisfied it was done by somebody in the house; I tried the key of Mrs. Westbrook's chamber door, it undid Mrs. Yoert's, it is a common chamber key. These are the two tablecloths, and this is the Irish linen.</p>
               <p>Cooper. These tablecloths are part of the things found in the house; whether they were what I sold, I cannot recollect; the Irish answers the description exactly of the one I sold; it is of the same quality with the name of Stock and Cooper on it, and the name of the bleacher, Conn I can also prove a certain date that these goods must have gone out of the house; I have here an invoice of a certain quantity of tablecloths; I believe these two to be a part; it bears date the 21st of February; and I have here an entry of the last remaining part of these cloths in our house, on the 2nd of March, being sent out of our house to be bleached, on account of being stole; then they were sold on the 25th of March, to whom I do not know.</p>
               <p>COURT. The result of your evidence is, these things were sold on the 25th of March - you do not say they were sold to the prisoner, only you believe it - A. I believe it to be her as far as my recollection serves me.</p>
               <p>Q. The note that is produced, what is the real date of it - A. October 22, 1807.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called nine witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Hoare, at East Sheen. On the 1st of February I was in London, I was out of service then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose your watch on the 1st of February - A. Yes; I had a two pound note, two ones, and eight or ten shillings in silver; this was in the evening about a quarter after ten o'clock; I had been drinking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170047"/>but I was perfectly sensible of what I was about; I had been drinking from between three and four o'clock, but not hard.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the town was it that you left the last public house - A. In St. James's-street, Covent-Garden, I believe, but I will not be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Then every body else must be sure you was drunk, how do you know that your watch and bank notes were about you when you left the last public house - A. I am convinced they were; what I had there I paid for; I returned my purse into my fob on the top of my watch, both in my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. The house you left about ten o'clock - A. Yes; my lodgings were at the Mason's Arms, Maddox-street, Hanover-square. I met these two girls in Covent-Gardon; they asked me to give them something to drink, and I did; it might be nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took them to this house in James's-street - A. Yes, I cannot say the sign of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever got your watch and your notes again - A. None of the notes, the watch is here; I had nobody with me but these two girls; after I got out of the house I went towards my lodgings, through St. Martin's court.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you getting from James's-street, to St. Martin's-court - A. Not above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. I think any body might walk in a minute and a half - A. I was along with these two girls; we did not hurry.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is, whether you were sober enough to recollect the persons of any body - A. I was sober enough for that.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see these girls again, if they were the girls that you were with - A. I never saw them till last Wednesday before the justice; I am perfectly sure it was them. I went strait from St. James's-street, to St. Martin's-court with them; we did not stop any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am sure you must be drunk - A. There they took the advaniage of me; my fob was torn, and the watch and purse were both taken out, I did not perceive them take it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know your watch was in your pocket in St. Martin's-court - A. I stopped no where else; they stopped with me perhaps five or ten minutes; I was all in an instant left by myself; that minute they were gone, I perceived what was the matter; it was dark but there were lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so indecent to have two women - A. They hanged about, me and asked me to give them something to drink.</p>
               <p>- GILLMORE. I am an officer belonging to Queen's-square. On Friday was a week, Mr. Courtney a pawnbroker, sent for an officer, the watch was there to be pawned by a woman of the name of Silverthorn; I detained her, and went in search of her husband. They are costermongers; the watch was claimed by the prosecutor. I apprehended the prisoner; he identified these two girls.</p>
               <p>- SILVERTHORN. Q. Do you know any thing of that watch - A. Yes;

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was the lead pipe affixed in the cellar when you took the house - A. Yes; half of the pipe was taken at one time, and half at another; I saw it in the cellar two days before the last part was stolen,</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the two prisoners - A. Yes, they both lodged in the house. We found six or seven feet of the lead on them, when I took the officer up stairs in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both lodge in one room - A. The woman said the man lodged with her; I found the lead in a basket, and an old cloak over it. They were both in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pipe fitted to the cellar, where it should have been - A. Yes; it appeared to come from that place in the cellar.</p>

On Tuesday morning I stopped the prisoner with this iron on his shoulder, it was a little after four o'clock, in Penning-street, I asked him where he got the iron from; he said he had brought it from Deptford. I detained him, I told him he must go to the watchhouse; he then endeavoured to throw the iron on my partner that is here. He made resistance; I tore his coat. I took him to Lambeth-street office; I went round to all the iron founders, I found it belonged to Mr. Johnson.</p>

               <p>MR. CASLER. I am a bricklayer. I was going for some coals for Mrs. Ankins, at No. 30, Molineaux-street, at nine in the evening, I saw the prisoner coming up the area with a bundle; on seeing of me he dropped it; he stood at the area door looking at me; I said my young fellow I will have you in a minute; I unlocked the door; a neighbour came up. I found the things in the area loose; I found the prisoner in the first floor back room, I took him into custody; he said pray do no hurt me; I told him it was out of my power to hurt him, the things did not belong to me. I took him to the watchhouse.</p>

I saw her chuck the bundles under the shop of the bar; Mr. Slade found the bundle there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive any instructions from Burton with respect to Miller - A. Yes; I did what Mr. Burton directed me. I saw Miller on the 4th of March at the Flatting Mills, Great Wild-street, Drury-lane; I asked Mr. Miller if he had any goods, meaning sixpences and shillings; he said yes; I told him I wanted an order for a friend that was going in the country, as much as two pieces; a piece is a guinea's worth; it means two for one; he said he had not them about him; he had got some; he very readily gave me one shilling and two sixpences, bad ones; I mean all bad; I gave him one good shilling, that is all I purchased at that time; another appointment was made on the same day, in the evening to meet at the Lemon Tree, at the top of the Hay-market.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you meet there - A. I was desired; Mr. Miller did not come; we were to meet there for the same purpose.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive any thing from Burton - A. I received a queen Ann's half crown from

               <p>Q. How soon after did you receive any thing from Burton - A. On the Monday morning; Mr. Miller promised me that as he had disappointed me at the Lemon Tree, he would meet me in Oxford-street, at the sign of the Hog in the Pound; I received two good shillings of Mr. Burton; they were marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on Monday the 6th of March did you see Miller, and where - A. At the Hog in the Pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go with you - A. Mr. Burton went with me; Mr. Burton and I parted before we got to the Hog in the Pound. I met Mr. Miller, I asked him how he came to disappoint me; he said he could not get the goods ready; I said are they ready now; he said no. - How long, Mr. Miller, do you think it will be before you let me have the two pieces? he said about two o'clock. I came out of the public house; we walked down the street; I said Mr. Miller have you none about you; he said yes, I have nine; I said I would take four; Mr. Miller gave them me and I gave him the two marked shillings that I received from Mr. Burton. Mr. Miller and I went into the next wine vaults; Mr. Burton followed and took Mr. Miller and me into custody. Mr. Burton took from Mr. Miller five bad shillings; he took the four shillings that I purchased; he asked me where I got them; I said of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. You know the last witness, did she apply to you, and on what day - A. On the 4th of March; she said she knew a person that was in the habit of selling bad money; I gave her a shilling and went with her to Great Wild-street; I marked that shilling. I went with her there, opposite of the flatting mills; she went in and stopped some time, then she came out again; she marked a shilling and two six-pences which were bad, and gave them to me; which she said she bought of the prisoner. She told me that an appointment was made, that she was to go to the Lemon Tree in the Hay Market, at eight o'clock in the evening. That appointment was not kept by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did you agree to meet on Monday at ten o'clock in the morning, at the Hog in the Pound - A. She called at my house first on Monday morning, I gave her two shillings, I marked them before her; she went to the Hog in the Pound, I remained on the opposite side of the street; she was about five or six minutes before she came out. We had agreed upon a signal when she came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you agreed before she went into the house, for the purpose of what she was to do - A. Yes; for the purpose of buying four counterfeit shillings. She came out and the prisoner with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. I never saw the prisoner before the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came out together, did she give that signal that you had directed - A. She did. I followed the prisoner and the last witness into the liquor shop; I told Miller that he was my prisoner, I must search him, and see what he had got in his pockets; he said very well, I am done; and perceiving something in his right hand, which was shut; I found in that hand five bad shillings and three good six-pences, and the two shillings which I had marked and gave to English; these were altogether in one hand. I then confined his hands and sent for a coach. At the time the coach was sent for, he said Mrs. King, how could you serve me so, you know what a family I have got.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the woman - A. I searched the last witness; I found four bad shillings in her possession. I asked her how she came by them, in the presence of the prisoner; she said she purchased them of Mr. Miller, he made no answer to that. I took them both to the office in a coach; I delivered four of the bad shillings that I found in the prisoner's hand to my brother officer, Jackson; keeping one myself; and the four I found upon Mrs. English, I kept myself, and the marked money that I gave to Mrs. English, I have got; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that that is the marked money that you gave to Mrs. English to give to the prisoner - A. I am positive of that; these are the pieces of marked money that I gave to Mrs. King originally, there are three small dots upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.Before Mrs. King had gone into the public house had you satisfied yourself that Mrs. King had no other money about her - A. I had; I saw her pockets turned inside out.</p>
               <p>Jury. How can you swear to these little dots, there is a cross also - A. Yes; that is marked by the other person that I gave them to; I put the dots myself; I speak to that, and the cross I speak to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you any doubt that these are the marks that you put on - A. I am certain to that being the money that I delivered to Mrs. King; I searched Mrs. King in my own apartment; she had no other money about her whatever.</p>

               <p>Q. I will now ask you whether Mrs. King applied to you, or you to her - A. Mrs. King applied to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not been acquainted with Mrs. King before she applied to you - A. I saw her two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that she had been tried here - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had you would not have employed her - A. I might not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she say, if you paid her well, she would tell you of a person that dealt in bad money - A. She told me that she knew of a person that dealt largely in bad money; I dare say I might say she would be paid well for her trouble; I take it for granted the gentlemen that undertook the business would pay her for her trouble. I thought it my duty. I undertook it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you that she would very willingly try to catch the prisoner - A. We went for that intent, at least I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You laid the plan, you had no confidence in the woman - A. No; I marked the money before I gave it her; and I should if it was to any other person; I should have marked it to my own sister, if I had her for that intention. I can swear that the two shillings I gave her, I found them two upon the prisoner when I searched him; and on the woman I found these four shillings in her possession, in the presence of the prisoner. I am confident that the prisoner had five counterfeit shillings in his hand, and the two shillings that I gave her he had in his hand, and three good six-pences. I produce the one counterfeit shilling that I had.</p>
               <p>Jackson. I have got the other four, I produce them. I received them from Burton.</p>
               <p>Burton. Them are the four found upon the woman, and there are the two good shillings found in the prisoner's hand, and the three six-pences.</p>
               <p>MR. FRANKLIN. Q. I believe you are one of the moniers of his majesty's mint - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these four shillings taken from the woman, Mrs. English, and tell me whether they are counterfeit or not - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. I now put into your hand the one received from Burton, the one out of the five found in the prisoner's hand, tell me whether that is a counterfeit - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I put into your hand the four produced by Jackson - A. They are counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I only beg for mercy.</p>
