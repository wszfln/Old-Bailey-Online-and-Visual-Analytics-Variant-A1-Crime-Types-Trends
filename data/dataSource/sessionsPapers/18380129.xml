I am a constable of Covent-garden-market, On the 23rd of December, about half past twelve o'clock, I was at Bucking-ham Palace—I saw the prisoner, in company with another—I watched them, and when the Queen left the Palace I saw them go behind Mr. Young—the prisoner took the handkerchief out of his pocket, and I saw him put it into his own jacket pocket—I saw him go behind Mr. Young, and take the handkerchief from Mr. Young's coat pocket, I am certain—it was from his coat pocket—Mr. Young had his hat on at the time—when the prisoner took it from Mr. Young's pocket he put it into hit own—I took him into custody, and took the handkerchief from his pocket—I then called Mr. Young, who claimed the handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 48, Ratcliff-highway, and am a watchmaker. On Wednesday, the 18th of October, the prisoner came to my shop, and purchased a watch, between one and two o'clock—I should say it was half-past one o'clock—he paid for it with a £10 Bank of Eng<lb/>land note—I observed, when he gave it to me, that he did not face me, but turned himself round, and took the note out of something—I could not see what he took it from—he took something out of his pocket, turning his back to me—he stood by the shop-door, at the light—he took something out of his pocket, and seemed to between or three minutes taking the note</p>

               <p>from whatever he had in his hand—I did not change the note myself—I did not ask him any thing about it at the time, not till I saw him a se<lb/>cond time—he came to the shop twice, to have the watch regulated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you heard, before he came to have it regulated, any thing about the note being stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had no conversation with him abort the note on those occasions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first have any conversation with him about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a week after I heard the note had been stolen, which was about fortnight after I had taken it, I saw him on the opposite side of the way, looking at a print shop, and called him over—I sent for Mr. Potter, who had changed the note for me, and I asked the prisoner if he was not the person who had changed the note and bought the watch—he said, "Yes"—I asked where he got the note—he said he had not stolen it—I said I did not say he had, but it had been traced to me, and I wished to know where he got it—he said he changed it for a sailor, who had gone to sea I asked his name and address, and he wrote in my book, "Thomas Eaton, No. 4, Bett-street, Ratdiff-highway"—he wrote that in this book, which I have here—Bett-street is about fifty yards from my house—I di rectly went to Bett-street, to No. 4, and could not find such a persona—it was nearly dark, and I thought I would leave further inquiry till the morning—I inquired <hi rend="italic">at every house</hi> In the street to see if I could find him but nobody knew of any such man—about three weeks after I met him again in Spectacle-alley, Whitechapel, leading from Church-lane, about half a mile from Ratcliff-highway—he passed me, and I turned after him and said to him, "Did you not buy a watch at my shop?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "You gave me a £10 note?"—he said, "Yes"—I said "How was it you gave me a false address f"—he said, "I did not give you a false address, I live there"—I said, "You. do no such thiog"—he said he did live there, but directly he found himself in this hobble he went to his lodgings and told the woman if anybody inquired for him to say he did not live there—be told me he had been into the country, to Bristol, I think, and had only returned the night before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say why he went into the country? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, because he had got himself into such a hobble—I asked him what account he could give me of the note, how he got it—he said he was going down the Strand, and met a man, who said to him, "Jack, I have picked up a book with a £10 note, and if you will get it changed I will give you something for your trouble"—he did not say what the man was to give him for his trouble—he said the man was waiting conveniently by, waiting for the change, after he had bought the watch, he bought the watch for two guineas, and when he went out he gave the man the change, and the man gave him the watch for so doing—I then took him down to the station-house.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did any thing particular occur after you had been there some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a quarter past eight o'clock Mr. Hodges came into the adjoining! room to the bed-room, and asked me to come in—the bed-room is the back room—I came from another room into the bed-room, and found Mrs. Hodges standing with her hand on the drawers—Mr. Hodges was walking about with his hands folded, in a very melancholy way, and his expresion was, "Oh God, what will become of me? what shall I do, Mrs. Harvey?" I instantly looked round, and saw Mrs. Hodges standing, perfectly coflect<lb/>ed, by the drawers—I saw the bed clothes were put down, and inquired where the child was—I got no answer—I ran to Mrs. Hodges, took hold of her hand, and said to her, "My dear girl, what have you done with the child?—she said, "It is dead"—she did not answer me the first time I spoke to her—I asked her two or three times before she gave me any answer—when she did answer, she said, "It is dead"—I said, "Dead! my dear girl, where?" and asked her what she had done with it—she said, "In the copper"—I flew instantly into the other room where the copper was, and there I saw the baby—I did not say any thing further to her before that—I went back into the room, and said to Mr. Hodges, "What are we to do?—he instantly said, "Run for her father and mother"—they live opposite—I then took hold of Mrs. Hodges' hand, and asked her how she could do such a deed—she gave me no answer, but looked in a most wild, distracted state—I went into the other room after that, and took the baby out of the copper—the lid of the copper was on, part over it and part not there was some water in the copper, which exactly covered the child—I wrap had the child up in a blanket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Newgate-street I have been in the habit of attending Mrs. Hodges, and attended he in her last confinement—the child was born previous to my getting there—it was born about a month before she expected—I remember being called in on. Sunday morning, the last day of December, and saw the child—it was lying on the table, wrapped up in a blanket, dead—I observed a dark livid appearance on the face of the child, as if it had been smothered—then was no appearance round the neck of any compression, but merely on the fcce—I went into the room where Mrs. Hodges was, and said to her, "This is a shocking business, Mrs. Hodges: how could you do this; how was it?"—she was not at all communicative to me, but at last she said she had smothered the child, by placing a pillow over its face—I asked her if the child struggled at all—she said it. struggled a little—she said she afterwards took it into the other room, and put it into the copper, having previously put some water into the copper—I asked her what time she did it-her answer was, before her husband came to bed—I asked her how she could do it—she gave no answer to that—I fanned the greatest difficulty to getting answer from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you observed any thing with respect to her milk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She had no milk for about a fortnight previous to that—I understood so from inquiries—that would very likely have an effect on the head of a person to circumstanstanced.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is your opinion of the state of her mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At that time I consider she was not at all aware of any thing she did—she was not conscious—she was very ill for some time afterwards, so much so, that her life was despaired of.</p>

On the 4th of January I took this hay for the prosecutor to the prisoner's residence, as he represented—he took me to No. 108, Cromer-street, which is a beer-shop—that was the place to which I was originally directed to take it—I saw the prisoner when I brought the hay there—I asked him whether he had bought it, whether it belonged to him—he said "Yes"—he said "You must come along with me"—I gave him the bill—he did not ask me for it—it was for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was a bill of parcels—he was to pay me that—when I gave him the bill, he said, "Come along with me"—he took me to Battle-bridge mews—I undid the ropes, and delivered the hay into the stable—there were thirty-six trusses—he took them into the stable himself—I then asked him whether he was going to pay me—he told me I must go up to Cromer-street again—I did so, and took the empty cart along with me—when we got there he went into the house—he went into the front door and came out again, and told me his wife was not at home, that she was gone to the other end of the town—I am quite sure he said his wife was not at home—I am sure he told me it was his wife—I told him it did not matter to me about his wife, I wanted the money—he said, "You must come along with me up Cromer-street, to go into Gray's Inn-lane, to my sister"—he told me to stop in Gray's Inn-lane—I did so, and he ran down the street, and came back to me, and told me his sister was not at home—I told him I wanted the money, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said he must go back to Mr. Mason's with me, or else pay me then—he said, "Do you think Mr. Mason will doubt my word for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?"—I said, "Yes, perhaps he might"—he said I was to go up into Cromer-street with him again—he did not go all the way with me—he went about half-way up the street and then sent one of his men with me, as he called him, and said he would be back in about ten minutes—I went to No. 108, Cromer-street, and waited till half-past six o'clock in the evening—I went there about three o'clock—he never came back, and I went back to my master without the hay or money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman of the Church of England, and am the brother of Ann Muckleston. My sister became acquainted with the prisoner in the year 1826—my father was sub-chanter of Litchfield Cathedral—he and his family were then residing at Wellesbourne, in War<lb/>wickshire, but at the time the prisoner became acquainted with her, they were at Leamington—that acquaintance led to a marriage between the pri<lb/>soner and my sister, which I performed at the church at Wellesbourne, in Warwickshire—the parties were the prisoner and my sister Ann—I have not been living from home lately—I last saw my sister about three or three and a half years ago—she was residing with my father just before the marriage—I was not part of the family—I was living in Litchfield—I saw my sister in London—it might be about four or five weeks after the marriage—I believe they were married on the 15th of June, 1826—I saw her again about a couple of months after the marriage—she has remained under my father's roof from that time—my father has not remained in the same place from that time till now—he has been from ill health travelling from place to place, and is now in Devonshire—my sister has lived under his roof, where he has been—if any body inquired at Wellesbourne there was no difficulty in finding if she were alive—her family were perfectly well known—in consequence of circumstances after this marriage, a divorce was obtained at the instance of the family, <hi rend="italic">a mensa et toro,</hi> and we lost sight of the prisoner from that time to this—we had no certain intelligence of him since two or three months after the marriage—my sister returned home very ill.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was subpoenaed last night—I was in Whitecross-street prison—I asked the prisoner for money when I became acquainted, through the means of the papers, that he was about to be married—I sent to him to try if he would relieve me from my difficulties—I did not name any amount, I asked him to relieve me from my difficulty—that would be getting out of prison—I was in there for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I mentioned the amount to him, but never demanded any sum from him—I sent a person to ask a loan—I do not recollect that I named any amount—I said a mm of money, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never named any sum to him myself—I did not solicit any myself—I do not recollect asking him for more than that—my messenger was a person of the name of Becker, of Vine-cottage, Charlton-place, New-road—I did not name any sum—I said he ought to give me 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on account of my knowing all the circumstances of the case—I did not send any message by Becker—he knew all the circum<lb/>stances before—we talked them over, and we then said that I was labour<lb/>ing under very great difficulties, and very much distressed; and I said to Becker, if he went there he might get some money, that would relieve me and assist him—I had no claim upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not this conveyed to him, that if he did not come down hand<lb/>somely, you would turn round upon him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that was not sent—it was said that we knew the circumstances of the case, and he had better give 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we did not get the money, and I am here as a wit<lb/>ness, but the business had become known to the prisoner's friends before I said any thing—the thing could not have been known except through me or the prisoner—I expected he would have given me 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I founded that on his fear that I would come against him—if I had got this money, I should have been silent on the subject—I gave no information all the family knew it—Mr. Becker brought Mr. Stovin to me after the prisoner refused the money—I did not know that Becker was going to Stovin's—he met Mr. Stovin accidentally—when Becker told me that the prisoner would not give 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said, perhaps he would give some<lb/>thing less—I said if he will give enough to release me from prison—from 120J. to 150/.—I did not say "We will come down a little lower"—I did not say, "D—the fellow, we will appear against him"—I said we would not do any thing, we would be silent—I would have been silent under all circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much was Becker to have had of the spoil? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was to have had a portion according to what we got—if 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was got, he was to have had half, but if 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was got, he was not to have 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we were to share the money, but he was not to have half of the large sum—I do not recollect what he was to have of that—I remember an advertisement which I drew up—it is lost—it was an advertisement drawn up for the purpose of showing to Disney, that we might get the money—it was relat<lb/>ing to his former marriage—it was an advertisement which I and Becker threatened to put into the paper, exposing the former marriage of Disney, and I told Becker to threaten him with it, but I told him never to do it—I did not intend to do it—I would not have done it—I would not have injured him to that extent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much was the money, or the acceptance you demanded of him, for the purpose of keeping that back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the most I ever asked of him—I know there was an acceptance spoken of—the former</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290044"/>
               <p>I forget, but the latter was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not recollect the amount of the ac<lb/>ceptance I first demanded—to the best of my recollection it was not 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I will not swear it was not mentioned, but I do not recollect it—I men<lb/>tioned 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Becker, but I never intended that he should ask that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had got the 25, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as mentioned in the papers, you would have had no objection to have <hi rend="italic">fleeced</hi> him of 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I certainly would have asked him for it—Mr. Becker was in prison—I met him there—he was there before I went—he is not there now—we were in the same ward—I had not known him before—I saw him this morning, and we had some conversation, but not in reference to my evidence, nor on reference to any message, but on the subject of the trial.</p>

BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you were carrying on this sort of attempt, were you aware that the man's first wife was alive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know that she was alive—I supposed she might be alive—I have been an acquaintance of the prisoner's for some years—I did not know Mr. Stovin, nor any of his family, before this circumstance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk. On the 29th of November I had a box—it contained a coat, a pair of drawers, and the other things, I believe, but I could not swear it, as I had not opened it—it came from my relations in the north—it arrived at the Leith and Berwick wharf, and came to Mr. Davison in Cannon-street—I got it off the cart at Whitechapel church, and was carry<lb/>tog it down the road, when a man dressed like a porter came to me, and said I had got a very heavy load—I said I had—he said he would put me in an easier way of carrying it—he put it on his shoulder, and carried it a little way, and let it fall—we took it up, and carried it to the Anchor and Crown, in Great Garden-street, when the prisoner came and stopped me, and wanted to know the contents of the box and where I got it from—I said had he authority for stopping me—he said he would tell me that by-and-by, and it was agreed we should take the box home, and see the contents of it there—we came out, and there was another man standing by the box beside the porter-man—we carried it a little further, and went to the next public-house, to Sir George Osborne's Head, in Princess-street, to ask the landlord permission to leave it there, till I went back to the City to satisfy him where I brought it from; and when we came</p>

               <p>out, the two men were gone with the box—I had left it with this porter<lb/>man and another man—neither of the men I left the box with are here—the prisoner had stopped me with the box—he would not allow me to carry it—I did not see the prisoner speak to either of the two men—he did not appear to know them—the prisoner and I were gone into the house, to ask leave to let the box lie there, till I went back with him to the City, to show where I got the box from—the prisoner asked to know the contend of the box, and said he suspected I had stolen it—I went after the other two, and this man was gone when I came back.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop, in Long's-buildings, in the parish of St. Luke. I know the prisoner—he was at my house on the 16th of January—he came in, in company with three others, about half past ten o'clock at night, and went to the first-floor room, where persons go to smoke—there is a skittle-board in the room—I did not see him go into the room, but I saw him go up stairs, and afterwards saw him in the room—I went up, in less than ten minutes after, into the front room, and he was there—I came down again, and went up again within three minutes after—he was not there then—I missed him, and one of the party who came with him—I heard footsteps overhead in my bed-room, and went up, and when within just three steps of the bed-room door I saw the prisoner coming out of the bed-room—I stopped him on the staircase, and asked him what business he had there—he said he had been lighted up there by a gentleman who described it as a skittle-room—I told him that he was wrong, that he had not been lighted up there, and I wished him to go down with me—I then called for a light, a person who came out of the bed-room after him having knocked my light out of my hand—I cannot say who that other man was—my wile brought up a light—she passed me and the prisoner, and followed us down stairs—I went first, and the prisoner behind me—the other man escaped when he knocked the candle out of my hand, and he had a large bundle with him—I could not observe that the prisoner had any thing in his hand—I collared him when I first met him coming out of the bed-room—I had no struggle with him—he at first said he would strike me if I did not let him go, but afterwards he said he would go quietly—my wife was within hearing when I first collared him—I brought the prisoner down stairs, and gave him into the custody of a police-officer—my wife went up to the bed-room—I cannot tell how the bed-room door was when the prisoner first came to the house, as I had not been up stairs myself.</p>

On the 3rd of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I discovered my house broken open when I came down, and I found my parlour window open—my house having been attempted several times, I had had some iron bars fixed to the window—one screw was abstracted from the bar—the bar was not removed, but the window was open, and a window was broken in the yard, which goes into the wash-house—that was fastened with a bolt inside the tub-house—there were some bars there as well, and one of them was moved enough to admit the body of a man—I went into the wash-house immediately—I discovered the parlour window open between seven and eight o'clock—I had left that window perfectly safe between eleven and twelve o'clock the night before, I saw it fast—I missed various articles from the wash-house—there were three pairs of my own boots, two pairs of ladies' boots, three pairs of shoes, one plated egg-cup, a pair of plated snuf<lb/>fers and tray, a plated decanter-stand, and five silk handkerchiefs, which had been washed and left there to dry—the property all belonged to my<lb/>self—I had seen the wash-house fastened the night before, but did not look for the property then—the snuffers-tray, egg-cup, and decanter-stand were taken from the kitchen; the other things from the wash-house—I have seen some of the articles since—they are a pair of boots and a hand<lb/>kerchief, which had been in the wash-house with the others—I found a pair of boots in the cesspool which did not belong to me, and I gave them to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 10.) On the 7th or 8th of October last, I went to Mr. Lazarus's house, and examined the premises—I found a pair of boots down the privy—I succeeded in getting one up, but the other I could not—I afterwards went to the House of Correction, on the 6th of January, and saw the prisoner there—he had been in custody there for three months, and was about to be discharged that day—I was the cause of his going there—I brought him to King David-lane station-house, and requested him to try the boot on which I had found in the privy—he did so, and it exactly fits him—I received a pair of boots and a handker<lb/>chief</p>

               <p>from Mr. Hoare, the turnkey at the House of Correction, at the same time—I had taken the prisoner into custody on the 6th of October, lurk<lb/>ing about Brook-street, Ratcliffe, and I remember, on taking him into cug<lb/>tody then, observing him stoop, as if in the act of putting something down—it was up a court in Brook-street—having no further assistance but my. self, I could only secure him and take him to the station-house—I then returned and found two chisels exactly at the place where he had stooped—I have examined the place at Mr. Lazarus's, and there appears to be a pressure on the sill of the window, such as would be made by a tool of this description—the smallest of the two chisels—I do not consider it is at all a mechanical tool—it is not like one—the impression seemed to me to be made by such an instrument—at the time he was at the station-house I desired him to take off his boots, which he did—I remember he had a pair on, similar to those taken from him at the House of Correction, and they were turned down with red as these are—I believe these to be the same he had on when I took him into custody and took him to the sta<lb/>tion-house—I have shown those boots to Mr. Lazarus, and he has iden<lb/>tified them as his property—they are lined inside with a sort of red leather.</p>

                  </hi>. I am watchman at the Grand Junction Waterworks, at Old Brentford. I know the prisoner—on the 6th of Janu<lb/>ary, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I heard him call to a watchman who was on board a barge on the other side of the river—I hew his voice, and called to him, "Is that Joe?"—he came down to me, and said, "Yes, is that you?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I sup<lb/>pose Bob (meaning the watchman) is asleep; what o'clock is it?"—I said "Half-past five"—he said, "I thought it. was half-past six"—I said to him in joke, "Go and have half a pint of beer, and spend the time"—he said, "No, I will go and <hi rend="italic">turn in</hi> again." and He left me—I walked away in the same direction-as I stood on the platform I thought I heard a noise in the yard of the next quay—I stopped some time, and then heard the prisoner jump with some boards from the top of the wall—I ran towards him, and he ran towards the rivet with the planks—he put the planks as far into the river as he could, and sent them adrift—I called out to the other watchman in the barge, and called to the police—the watchman came out in a boat—the prisoner made every exertion to get away—he was in the water, and I was on the bank—I called for the police, and the watchman to come from the other side, and he came across in a boat—the prisoner got into the boat, and the watchman secured him—the planks belong to Mr. Hugh M'Intosh.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mare-street, Hackney, and am a farrier. I had a pig—I saw it safe about seven o'clock in the evening of Saturday the 7th of January—it was gone on Sunday morning—I had left it safe in the stye, in the farm-yard—part of it was covered up—the next morning the top rail was broken down—it was a sow pig—I saw it again in the green-yard on the Monday—I did not know the prisoners till I saw them at the Magistrate's—I knew the sow—I had bred her—she was three yeanrs old.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Kent's-place, Paddington, and am fore<lb/>man to Mr. Thomas John Bolton, an omnibus proprietor. Clipsome was a washer of carriages—Louke and he were in Mr. Bolton's employ—three Chinese pigs were in the body of an old omnibus in Mr. Bolton's yard—on the 22nd of January, Monday morning, about seven o'clock, I missed one of the pigs—there were two left—I searched for the lost one, but did not find it—in consequence of suspicion I went to Mr. Feltham the inspector, and we went to Clipsome's house in Kent-place, on Tuesday, a little after six o'clock in the evening—Clipsome was at work in the yard—Mr. Feltham went up stairs—I remained down below for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I afterwards went up, and saw some pork in Clipsome's room, and the entrails of a pig in a dish in a bed-room, on a sideboard—the other parts were in the front room—there was a fore leg, and a loin—I cannot say whether there was any more—Mr. Feltham asked him how he came possessed of it, and he said, <hi rend="italic">big Jem</hi> brought it to him in a sack—that man's name is Goatley—I know Goatley—he is a horse-keeper in Mr. Bolton's employ.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. I went with William Conzens to Clipsome's house—I went up into the room by myself—Clipsome's wife and two children were there—I saw some pork fn the cupboard—here is a fore and hind leg, a piece of a flap, and a fore-loin—I found some pork that did not appear to belong to the same pig—that is not here—I desired the woman to call her husband, which she did—I said to him, "I have every reason to believe this is part of Mr. Bolton's pig"—I asked him how he became possessed of it—he said it was some he had bought of his master, and some that <hi rend="italic">big Jem</hi> had brought up—I said it had never been killed by a butcher, I had every reason to believe it was Mr. Bolton's, and I should take him into custody—I do not remember that Clipsome's wife said any thing in his presence, except that part of it was the lodger's—I then handed the prisoner to the police-constable, and directed him to take him to the station-house—his wife said paft of it was purchased of Mr. Bolton, which I have no doubt of—I then went into the back room, and found the chitlings, the internal part of the pig, which had been killed, were in water, in a dish—I then went to Louke's house, and the foreman and I went up stairs—his wife was there—I asked if she had any pork in the house—I found there two pieces—one is part of a loin, and the other the fore-leg—Couzens brought Louke to the room—I said to him, "I have no doubt the pork I see here is part of Mr. Bolton's pig, and I shall take you into custody"—he said he knew nothing about it—he made some hesitation about going, but I said he must, and he did go—I did not go to Cooper's—the hind-leg of this pig some time before had been broken, and this leg that I found at Clipsome's is broken, and one of the toes which the constable found at Cooper's, was trod off by a horse—the pork found at Louke's exactly corresponded with the other parts found at the other two prisoners'.</p>

               <p>up stairs—the deceased came in, out of the yard, in a minute or so, and went up stairs, and the door of their apartment was locked—the deceased tried it, and could not get in—I asked the prisoner at the foot of the stairs to open the door, saying she had only been into the yard with me—he then opened it and let her in—he was in the room at the time—in a short time after I observed them both go out together, and they came home again to<lb/>gether—when they came down stairs they both went out into the street together—the prisoner had been drinking—I observed that when they were going out together—the deceased did not seem as if she had been drinking when she returned the second time—I did not hear her say any<lb/>thing to the prisoner when they came in together, but the prisoner went out again, and the deceased stopped down with me, standing at the street door—when the prisoner came back again she said to him, "Come in, <hi rend="italic">Dick;</hi> come in, my dear;" and they went up stairs together—I do not know whether they went into their own room—I saw the deceased after<lb/>wards go out for some supper—that was about half-past eleven o'clock—I went out myself, and on my return I found her in my room, crying—she again went up stairs, and came down again—no liquor was sent for into our room—we had a pint of beer—me, my husband, and the deceased, drank it, and after that the deceased went up stairs again—I did not go with her then—she had only been in our room a few minutes—when she went up I heard her try to get into her room—she asked the prisoner to open the door—she pushed against the door, and asked him to let her in—she was very violent—she pushed the door violently, and called him a cock-eyed b—she then came down stairs again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in the room opposite to where the deceased lived. I went out with the deceased that night about seven o'clock—three of us went out together—we came home at half-past nine o'clock—we drank a glass of spirits each while we were out, besides beer—I think we had about three pots of porter between four of us—another person had joined us—when we came home I went into the room, and the deceased and the prisoner seemed perfectly comfortable—I went to bed at a little after ten o'clock—Turvey was in bed with me—he had been with the deceased and me—the prisoner, the deceased, and me, had been down to the Ship tavern to him, and we returned with him—Turvey did not partake of the liquor with us—we had a glass of rum each at the Britannia Tavern—the prisoner was with us—he went out with us at seven o'clock—he was one of the three that drank with us—when we returned, he and the deceased remained in my room a short time together, and they seemed quite comfortable between themselves—it was then near ten o'clock—I saw the deceased again, about ten o'clock, in Salmon's-lane, standing talking to young Turvey, James Turvey's son—I passed her at the door, just spoke to her, and went on—I did not see her again till after one o'clock, when she broke my bed-room door open, after I was in bed—she said she would be b—if she would not break the b—door open, and she did break it open, and sat down in a chair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you then see in what state she was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She certainly was in liquor—I did not rise out of my bed to see, and did not speak any more to her—she sat down a few minutes, and then she said she would break the prisoner's b—door open—she arose and left my room, and broke his door open, which is facing ours, and a very short space from it—I should not think it is more than three quarters of a yard—when she broke the door open I heard the prisoner or somebody get out of bed, and cross the room—I then heard a scuffle in the passage against the door, and heard a scream and a fall—I heard the door shut before I heard the fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell how long it was between the door shutting and the fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost instantly—I heard the policeman come, but did not get up, and did not see the prisoner—in the scuffle at the top of the passage it sounded as if one wanted to go in and the other out, and the fall was almost instantly, as it appeared to me—I have never given a different ac<lb/>count of that, to my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether the deceased had been to any public-hours before that, on that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, she had not, for I had been with her all day—she was in the habit of going to public-houses at night and drinking; and was a little violent in her temper when drunk—my room door was locked, and she broke it quite open—it was after that she said she would break the prisoner's b—door open—she thumped very violently indeed at his door—I heard a scuffle in the passage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say the prisoner did not go out <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the prisoner did not go out of his room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the door of his room is about three feet from the top of the stairs—she had no light with her when she left my room to go and break his door open—there was no light in the passage.</p>

I came home on this Saturday night about half-past eleven o'clock—while I was eating my supper Mrs. Williams came into my room—I was having some beer with my supper, and she partook of it—we had a quart between me and my wife, when we first began supper—it was partly drank when the de<lb/>ceased came in—she drank once out of that quart—she went away, and I vent to bed—I cannot say whether the prisoner was in bed then—I never saw him—I went to sleep, and was awoke by the deceased making use of very improper language—she called him a d—b—I knew her voice, and am sure it was her—I do not know where about she was at the time—it appeared that she was abusing the prisoner—that was all I heard—I fell asleep again, and did not wake till my wife struck a light—I went out some time afterwards, and saw the deceased lying stretched on her back in the passage—I believe my wife had moved the body at that time—she was quite dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At what hour was it you last saw the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure I cannot say—it was at my supper-time, about half-past eleven o'clock, or it might be towards twelve o'clock—it was nearer to twelve o'clock—she was about a quarter of an hour under my observation at that time—she spoke very sensibly to me then, and did not appear to be in<lb/>toxicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How often did you have beer at your sapper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had part of a pot at supper, and a pint after—I only sent once for beer while she was there—I cannot tell whether she was a well-conducted wo<lb/>man when sober, as she was an entire stranger to me—I never spoke a dozen words to her in my life.</p>

I was called in between on and two o'clock, on Sunday morning—I know nothing of what took place on Saturday night—when I got there, I found Marshall had the prisoner in custody—I saw the deceased lying in the passage—I asked the prisoner how the woman came down stairs—he said she had come home two or three hours after he was in bed, and burst open the door, that he got out of bed, pushed her out of the room, and shut the door, but he was not aware at the time that she had fallen down stairs, he thought she was sit<lb/>ting on the landing still—the door is two feet three inches from the tap stair—the door opens inside, and from the nearest door-post to the top of the stairs, it is two feet three inches—the lock of the door is towards the staircase—the landing itself is two feet six inches wide, and the length from the top stair to the wall is four feet nine inches—at the end of the landing against the wall there stood a pail with a tub on the top of it, which measured seventeen inches oval—it is two feet six inches from Wil<lb/>liams's door to Turvey's—there are twelve stairs, nine of them are very steep—there is a turn at the bottom of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside in Brunswick-street, New-road. I am acquainted with Fanny Wellard—I also know William Sym, a prisoner in the House of Correction—they were on intimate terms—Mrs. Wellard resided at Manchester—in November last the prisoner called on me several times—he brought a letter to me to be given to Miss Wel<lb/>lard—I forwarded it to her—this is the one I forwarded to her—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am certain he is the person—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>.) "Coldbath-fields, Sunday, Nov. 12, 1837.</p>
               <p>"My dear Fanny,—You will be a little surprised at receiving a note from me, as it is quite against the rules of the prison; but even here I have found two good friends who have kindly undertaken to allow me the privilege which I eagerly embrace; my turnkey, in his great kindness to write for me, and a friend of his, one of the engineers, to convey this to you, and will also return me an answer. Now, my dear girl, my writing to you must be kept a profound secret, as should it be known I have writ<lb/>ten, or got to write, I should not only lose my situation and be punished and sent to hard labour, but both the turnkey and engineer would in all probability lose their situations; therefore, for God's sake, be very circum<lb/>spect, and do not allude to my having written in any letters you may send to me through the gate, as they are all first read by the Governor before I get them, do therefore, for my sake, keep it to yourself as much as possible; and any thing you wish to say to me privately, transmit it to me in writing, through Mr. Greenway, the engineer, who will send one of his men to call upon you once or twice a week. The bearer is a distant rela<lb/>tion of his, and one he says he can put every confidence in, though he will not know where this is from, and you need not say. I shall not, ac<lb/>cording to the rules of the prison, be able to write to you myself until the expiration of six months, and then, they say, nothing but the Governor will see; and if you should get another order to see me, the time is so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290099"/>
               <p>short, and we are so overlooked, there is no speaking what I could wish. I was very glad to see you the other day, but it made me very dull after<lb/>wards. Do not say any thing about Mr. Willmott's business, except in the letters sent through my friend, and in them you may say any thing, as I shall receive them perfectly safe. This is a privilege I do not suppose there is a prisoner in the house has but myself, which I may thank my two friends for, who have got me placed in the situation I am, which entirely exempts me from work, as I have nothing to do but to look after the men, and to see that they do their work, and attend on the turnkey, keep an account of the men on slates, and to look after the yard when I am stationed. Oh, my dear Fanny, what a happy release it was for me or when relieved from work on the tread-wheel? I think it would have killed me. I may, through proper conduct, keep my place the remainder of my imprisonment; therefore be most careful in any letters you may send in to me through any other way than by my friends, or whatever way, or when you call, if you should be able to get another order before you go into the country. Now, my dear, I will acquaint you with my wants; and I feel confident you will, as far as possible, send me what yon can If you will get me two Guernsey frocks, such as fishermen wear, let them be a large size, long in the arms and body, as we never see a fire all winter, and my place exposes me very much to the frost and cold; also a pair of warm gloves—worsted. I received the pair you sent, but as they are leather, they are so cold; get any you think the warmest, and a comforter for my throat. You can, at the same time, send me the flannels you bought for me the other day; and I should like a change of apparel—a coat, one or two waistcoats, a pair of trowsers, a pair or two of stockings; and if I had my great coat, I could wear it in the mornings, before the Governor goes round, and in the evenings, after he has been. Do not think me too troublesome, as my situation is uncomfortable. I know you feel pleasure in making it as comfortable as you possibly can; and my friend will get these things conveyed to me unknown to the Governor, as any thing of the sort is not allowed. If you can, also send a shirt or two, and a pair of shoes, strong and warm, for the stones are very damp; and I have all the winter to get over. Call at (my dear girl) Mr. Blackburn's, about my father's picture; you will find the paper of it in ray pocket-book. Call before the 8th of next month. I hope you found all to your wish respecting Mr. Willmott's business. I shall be glad if there is enough for you to benefit from. Send me word, when you write, by my friend; but if you should write to me in any other way, do not mention it, as I do not want them to know: or at least, if you do, let it be in a very dark manner. I send this to Mrs. Jenkins's, as I do not know whether you are at your sister's, or where you are. Let me know how you are, and all particulars—how far you have succeeded in Mr. Will<lb/>mott's business; and remember me to all my sister's family, and accept my love to you. Believe me to be ever yours most affectionately, "<hi rend="smallCaps">WM. SYM."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"P.S. I write this on a slate, and my turnkey is going to copy it for me on to paper, as I durst not be allowed pen and ink; so he will write it as if he was writing from himself. At present, my dear F., I have acquainted you with all my wants, which if you can, relieve me; and I trust you will, and by so doing, alleviate as much as possible my present situation. His friend, the engineer, will send it to Mrs. Jenkins's by one of the men,</p>

               <p>as I have mentioned above, who you must satisfy for his trouble; and tell him when to call again; and in respect of the things in your letter, I will write again, and tell you more about my way of living and my duty. My living is very low indeed, but I am happy compared to some; I have very many extras in my present situation.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Continued</hi>.) "I hope you will keep up your spirits, and continue in good health. Send me word when you expect your things. Put in all particulars, for I shall send in a person to assist in getting the things into the house, and arranging them. Our engineer says I cannot have a better than the bearer, who is used to furniture and wood-work. I shall expect to her from you by Wednesday, and Mr. Greenaway will send his man up for it Mind and pay the man for his trouble, and let me hear from you as soon as possible, as I am very anxious to hear about Mr. Willmott's business and how you are. Give my love to all your sister's family. Do not fail to write soon, and send the things I have mentioned, if possible, Pack them up as small as possible, and tie them in a handkerchief, as I went one very much. All the things I had on, and brought in with me, are taken from me, and I cannot get any of them until I go out; and they take every thing from us, money and every thing, and clothe us with their nasty clothes, as cold as they are coarse. I do not feel like myself in them, and to put some of my own things on will be a great treat; and I can slip the others over them about the time the Governor comes round Do not fail to send me whatever you can, and I must add another want to those already made, which I am afraid you will think too many; that is, if I had a trifle of money, I might get many little comforts bought for me; though it is strictly prohibited, yet my friends will oblige me. If you can spare me a little, do, my dear F., and sew it in one of the pockets of the trowsers or waistcoats; and when I get out, I hope, through God's grace, to make you every amends for the great trouble I have caused you Forgive me, my dear F., and we may yet see many happy days together. God bless you, is the ardent prayer of your most affectionate.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came on board on Tuesday, the 30th of January—I was cooking—he was there about ten minutes—he came on board with the pretence of warming his hands—I had a handkerchief and book on the forecastle, and my jacket too—I saw them on Sunday—while I was gone half he took the opportunity to go down to the forecastle—I and the officer law him come up, and he went on the other side of the deck—the officer asked what he wanted there—he made no answer—the officer opened his jacket and found my jacket underneath, with this handkerchief and book—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they are mine.</p>

I have known the prisoner personally nearly four years, and partially, on account of knowing his mother, seventeen years—he was summarily convicted of having a jacket in his possession—up to that time he bore a most irreproachable character—I have heard from his family that fourteen years ago he fell down a ship's hold, and was insensible (for three days, and there are now pieces of lint and things in his head; I know he is subject to such fits of aberration, that he will sit for hours together with his head on his hand, and beat his head to get sense in it—I know Mr. Deverell, the beadle—he has been able to get a ship for him—the prisoner had engaged himself to go a long voyage, but his wife did not like him to go so far—I know he was seventeen years at sea, and when he came home he was always at home at his mother's—he worked by daily labour in the Docks, but it was precarious, and we wished him to go to sea again.</p>

The prisoner lodged in my house about eight months, and left in August, 1836, when I was going for some vegetables, and asked him to mind the place while I went—he said he would—that was about eight o'clock in the even<lb/>ing—I returned in a quarter of an hour, and he was gone, and the dog was gone, which I had left chained to the bed, close to my box—the dog was loosened from the chain, and put out of doors—the doors of the house were on the latch, and my box was broken open—an iron bar laid by the tide of it, which it had been done with, and my money was gone—I lost thirty-two sovereigns and six half-sovereigns—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody this year.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Ezekiel John Baker, who lives in White<lb/>chapel-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel. I fastened up the house on Thursday night, the 25th of January, and on Friday morning, the 26th, between eight and nine o'clock, I missed eight guns and eleven pistols, out of glass cases—there were no marks of violence about the place, but I was not the first who entered the counting-house—I had left at five minutes to eight o'clock the evening before, and the guns and pistols were then safe in the counting-house, which is in a yard enclosed with the dwelling-house—it joins the dwelling-house—there is a dining-room over the front shop—you pass through to the back shop, without going into the open air—it is part of the house, and joins the dwelling-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 31, Nottingham-place, Mile-end—I am a dealer in jewellery, and attend sales—last Monday night, the 29th of January, I was going home with the articles stated in a bag—it was about ten o'clock—I carried the bag in my hands, over my arm, with the string twisted round my wrist, and round the mouth of the bag—I had got about fifteen yards from my house, and was talking to a woman, who I wanted to buy a pair of slippers of, when the prisoner came behind me—he said nothing, but pulled hold of my bag—I said, "What do you want of me?"—he said, "Give it to me"—I would not, and said, "What do you want of me?"—he took a knife out so quick, so clever, and cut it away—he cut the bag, not the string, and went away with the bag, leav<lb/>ing the string and part of the bag in my hand—he went away very quick—I hallooed out, "Stop thief," and ran after him, but could not go fast, as I had the rheumatism, and I fell down, and Sarah Burgess ran after him—I hallooed out, "My bag, my bag," and she said, "O the bag; the property"—I got up and ran on further, and saw the prisoner when I got to the station-house, when the rest of my bag and my property was produced to me—I knew it directly.</p>

A man, who works for us, brought home two pairs of shoes, and in conseq<lb/>uence of something, I walked with him down Nottingham-place—I saw a man standing by the side of a wall there, about a yard before I got to him—the prosecutor was going along, and the man rushed out with great violence, caught hold of his bag, and said, <hi rend="italic">"</hi> Give it to me"—the prose<lb/>cutor</p>

                  </hi>. On the 1st of February, last year, I was cook on board the barque <hi rend="italic">Kingston</hi>. I went on board at Liverpool—the prisoner was the captain—I knew the deceased Lewis Handford—he was the steward—the crew consisted of twenty or twenty-one—on the 2nd of March we sailed for the coast of Africa, and on the 17th of April we arrived at New Calabar—on the 20th of May we were at the Island of Baracoon, in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290130"/>
               <p>Calabar River—that is about ten miles from the mouth of the river—the tide flows there—we carried about 300 tons—on the afternoon of the 20th of May, I observed the steward pumping some rum off—that was part of his duty—he came to me, and asked me to clean some candlesticks for him—he was going to get some tacks out of the cabin—he then left the deck, and went into the cabin—I afterwards heard the carpenter cry out for the Kroo boys to come to the cabin, and some of the native boys, who were also in the cabin, called out for them too—the Kroo boys are natives of the coast—full-grown men are called Kroo boys—I did not hear the captain say any other words at that time—the Kroo boys came out of the cabin, and at that time there were some other Kroo boys coming alongside in a canoe—there were three Kroo boys, four "pull-away boys," and the second mate—they came out of the canoe on to the deck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said the captain called for the Kroo boys to come, after that what did he do? was any thing said about the steward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he said, "Fetch this b—son of a b—on deck, out of the cabin; he has struck me in my own cabin"—three of the Kroo boys, named Walker, Gray, and "Bottle-o'-beer," then rushed into the cabin—I saw them fetch the steward out on deck, on to the starboard side, by the companion-door—the cabin is only two steps down from the deck—after the steward was brought out of the cabin, the captain came from the cabin—he followed the men on deck—he had a <hi rend="italic">cat</hi> In his hand—a <hi rend="italic">cat</hi> Is a stick with twelve tails attached to it—the stick is from eighteen inches to two feet in length, and about two-and-a-half-inches round—the tails are made of log-lines—it is a mere plain line made up very hard—the captain had one of these in his hand—I saw him strike the steward with the butt<lb/>end of it on the head, and it knocked him down like a bullock—the cap<lb/>tain then said, "Pay that black son of a b—, he has struck me in my cabin, he has catched me by the p—s and the throat, and tried to choke me"—he then said, "Lay on him, and kill him, a black son of a b—, kill him!"—the captain was addressing the Kroo boys, and the natives of the country, the boys who had been in the cabin—they had <hi rend="italic">cats</hi> In their hands, and sticks and pieces of rope besides—pieces of lead-line, which it what they sound with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came that in their hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The captain ordered it to be cut up when they were flogging him—there were from twelve to eighteen flogging him at different times—he never rose from the deck after the cap<lb/>tain knocked him down with the butt-end of the <hi rend="italic">cat</hi>—they flogged him while he was down; and while they were flogging him on the deck the cap<lb/>tain kicked him more than twenty times—he kicked him at his side, face, and head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the steward say any thing while this was going on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he said, "Oh Lord, I am a dead man," several times—that was while the flogging was going on—the captain came half-way forwards to me after that, and said, "Cook, you know something about this"—I said, "Captain Cain, I know nothing about it"—I told him I knew nothing about his and the steward's affairs—he then said to me, "Cook, you black son of a b—I I will shoot you."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any flogging after your hearing the steward cry out that he was a dead man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was flogged till he was dead—the captain still remained kicking him—I did not hear the steward say any thing more—all I heard him say was, "Oh Lord, I am a dead man"—he said that three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290131"/>
               <p>or four times—I remained close to where the flogging was, standing on the starboard side, aft—the steward was dressed in a striped shirt, a flannel singlet, and a pair of trowsers, but the captain ordered the shirt and singlet to be torn off after the flogging had continued some time—they were partly torn off, and he said, "Never mind the son of a b—; kill the black son of a b—; flog him"—I am a native of the West Indies—the steward was an American born.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what state was he when they left off flogging; do you mean that the flogging continued till he was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had any complaint been made against you before the 20th of May? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I had been flogged—that was on the 2nd of May—it was on a charge that I was going to run away with the ship's boat—the steward and me were the only black men on board the ship, the only ones that sailed from Liverpool, but at Calabar several other black men joined in working the ship—I had no dispute with the captain after this respecting my wages—none whatever—I assisted a boy, named Lees, to do the steward's duty after the steward's death—I made no demand for that—I never made any demand for more wages than I had first agreed for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had the captain arrived at Liverpool before you made this charge against him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A fortnight I believe, or three weeks—I cannot say whether he was on board every day after the ship arrived there—I was not on board the ship but twice, and he was not to be found then—I knew where the owners resided—they are Messrs. Stevens and Horsfall—I knew where they were—I tried to find the captain after his arrival on the 2nd of January—I inquired at the office, and could not find him,—he was not to be found for two or three weeks after the ship's arrival—I made a com<lb/>plaint against him to the owners, Messrs. Stevens and Horsfall, on the 2nd of January—we arrived on the 1st of January, and I made a complaint to them the next day, and then looked out for the captain, but could not find him for three weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the length of time, according to your judgment, between the steward going down below to look after the tacks and the time he was brought on deck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From five to ten minutes—I did not hear any scuffle in the cabin when the captain came on deck—I observed a wound on his head—it was not bleeding much, not worth speaking of—it was bleeding—it was on the back part of his head—I did not observe any marks of fingers on his throat—I did not observe his throat, to see whether there were or not—he did not seem exhausted—he seemed very passionate—he seemed very fresh, as far as I could see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean he did not appear to you as if he had been ill-used; do you mean that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were either of the Kroo men called Walker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was one that flogged first—him and Gray—both of them laid on at once, and "Bottle-o'-beer" at the same time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a boy at Calabar called Dogaboo? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I saw him flogging the steward about the eyes—the captain was on deck at that time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that the captain was present, and must have seen Dogaboo flog him about the eyes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a boy who went by the name of <hi rend="italic">Three-fingered Jack</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and he had a stick, beating him—it was a heavy stick—I cannot say whether he gave the steward severe blows with it, but he was beating him all the time, every chance he could get at him—I cannot say where he hit him, but I saw him beating him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean the captain saw him do that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was standing kicking him at the time—he was so near that he must have seen him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that the captain had not gone below, before <hi rend="italic">Three-fingered Jack</hi> struck the steward with the stick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was striking him all the time—I never saw him go below till the man was dead—he did not go below—<hi rend="italic">Three-fingered Jack</hi> struck the steward from the beginning, as often as he had a chance—the flogging continued three quarters of an hour, till he died—<hi rend="italic">Three-fingered Jack</hi> had the stick, and was beating him with it all that time, whenever he had a chance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not examined on this subject, when you were on board the ship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she was lying in the Calabar river at the time—Captain Hemmingway and Captain Dawson came on board at the time, and I was examined before them—there was no promise or persuasion made to me then, with respect to the account I was to give of it—there was no threat held out to me—I was desired to speak the truth—the account I then gave was taken down in writing, and read over to me, and I signed it—this is the paper—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Captain Cain present when you were-examined? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was walking backwards and forwards in his own cabin—I was examined in the main cabin—there are two cabins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of shoes did the captain wear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were strong shoes—the natives do not wear any shoes in that climate—the captain generally wore strong shoes—I cannot say whether he wore strong shoes that day or not, but he had shoes on—he generally wore strong shoes on the coast of Africa, when going on shore, and when he was on board, at times, unless he had on his slippers in the morning, when he first got up—generally speaking, he wore strong shoes on the coast of Africa.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever said that the steward was not punished except in an ordinary way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that taken down in writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Captains Hemmingway and Dawson examined you, hady on not an opportunity of stating what you pleased respecting the transaction <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had not, because I was in danger of my life from Captain Cain and the Kroo boys—the examination was better than a week after the steward's death, but I cannot exactly say how long—it might be a month—there had been no disturbance on board after the steward's death—no threat was held out to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why were you afraid then of stating this, if they had not threatened you, and there had been no disturbance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was threatened before this—before the flogging—I was put in double irons, and chains round my neck, with a padlock to my neck, and was kept on deck all</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that the reason why you were afraid to give the account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—some of the crew made the charge at Liverpool before me—they made the charge the second day—I was examined before the Magistrate at Liverpool on Saturday week, this day fortnight—the only time that I said the steward was punished in an ordinary way was, then what I said was taken in writing by the two captains—they were the captains of two vessels which were lying near us at the time this took place—they were about a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards off us at the time—it might be a month after it happened that that inquiry was made by the captains—there were only those two vessels near as—they laid inside the harbour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him sit up at any time after the flogging was over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was sometimes half sitting—he never sat up—the handle of the cat was three inches thick in the round, and it might taper off to about an inch and a half—I did not observe what kind of shoes the captain wore—when he did not go ashore he used to have nothing but slippers—he wore slippers on board—sometimes they were made of morocco—they were light slip<lb/>pers—the steward died during the flogging—any person who was looking on might perceive that he was dead—I perceived it—I saw him stretch himself out, and the captain was looking on—he was walking backward and forward—he must have seen it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After it was clear and evident that he was dead, they continued flogging him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the captain being by—after it was clear that he was dead, the captain ordered him to be put in irons—they might give him a dozen lashes or so after he was dead—I could not see any movement whatever after he was dead—it was after that he was ordered to be put in irons—I was examined on this subject before Captains Hemmingway and Dawson.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not on that occasion desired to speak the truth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they told us to say what we knew concerning it—they did not hold out any promise, or make any threat—what I said was taken down in writing, and read over to me, and I signed it—this is the paper, with my signature to it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I was cooper on board this vessel. I remember on the 20th of May being at Calabar—between five and six o'clock in the evening of that day I heard a great noise in the cabin—after hearing that noise I saw Captain Cain come out of the cabin, and three Kroo boys—when he came out, the three Kroo boys brought out the steward—the cap<lb/>tain had a cat in his hand, and when they got the steward out, the captain struck him on the head—I cannot say exactly where he struck him with the stump of the cat—he knocked him down, and he never rose again—the captain said, "He is a black b—to take me by the throat and * * * *, and throw me down in my cabin;" and "I will have your life this night"—the captain hit him several lashes himself with the tails of the cat—he then called to Mr. Carr, the second mate, to make some cats for the three Kroo men, Gray, Walker, and Bottle-o'-Beer—the mate made them, and they were given to the Kroo men—he cut them off the log-line—Captain Cain then ordered them to commence flogging him—they had not been flogging him before that—they did then flog him, the steward being down—the cap<lb/>tain was by at the time—they were flogging him all the time, from beginning to end, until his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the captain himself do any thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He kicked him every time he got a chance, about the head and neck mostly—the steward had his shirt on—it was ordered by Captain Cain to be pulled off, and it was pulled off his back—after the shirt was off he told them to go on flogging—the steward said, "Lord, save me, I am a dead man"—the captain was on deck at the time he said that, and after he said it, the captain said, "You black b—, I will have your life this night."</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear the steward say any thing else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he said, "Lord, save my eyes"—there was a boy named Dogaboo, and every time he could get a chance to cut the steward, he was trying to cut him in the eye—the captain was by at the time—every time he called out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean the captain must have seen Dogaboo trying to cut him in the eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could not help seeing him, he cut him so often.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see him at the moment you judge he died? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he turned himself on his face, and stretched his arms and legs to the greatest extent, and they still flogged him on his back—the captain must have seen that—he was there at the time—I observed his face and neck in the morning after—the neck and head was all in a jelly, and all of a thick<lb/>ness nearly—his eyes were closed—he was cut terribly about the eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the eyes project, or were they knocked in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were rather out a little—they were not knocked into his head—I returned to</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you see him first on board the vessel, when she arrived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Friday, the 19th of January—(she arrived on the 1st, and during those eighteen days I did not see the captain on board)—I went on a stage which a cask had been landed from, and I said, "Captain Cain, how are you, I hope you will shake hands with me now?"—he was taking off his glove to shake hands—I said, "Captain Cain, you must come now, for that man's life"—I called two policemen, and gave him into custody—the ships to which Captains Hemmingway and Dawson belonged were at Calabar before we were—we were in the river before the <hi rend="italic">William</hi> brig—Dawson was the captain of that—the name of Hemmingway's vessel is the <hi rend="italic">Snowden</hi> barque—they were not lying near the <hi rend="italic">Kingston</hi>—they were lying higher up—the <hi rend="italic">Haywood</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ann</hi> were the nearest vessels—they were both nearer than the other vessels.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect being examined before Captains Hemmingway and Dawson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they desired me to tell what I knew about the trans<lb/>action—they did not offer any reward, or throw out any threat about my speaking the truth, but I durst not tell the truth because the captain was a cruel man to others, and I thought he would be the same to me—he had never hurt me nor struck me either before nor after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that the captain absconded on his arrival at Li<lb/>verpool? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a boat came alongside, and he engaged it, and just as we got round the Dock he got into it, and before the ship came to anchor he left it—it was then in charge of the pilot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not usual for a captain to go ashore to meet his owners as soon as he arrives? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen them go before—it is usual for captains to remain in the ship to see her discharged, and to attend the vessel during her discharge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not that the duty of the chief-mate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the duty of both—I have seen them both do it—it is not the captain's place to attend the delivery of cargo.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say he never came on board from the time he</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the 20th you went before the Police-Magistrate at Liverpool? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I remember immediately after going be<lb/>fore the Magistrate being in company with Gove, the boatswain—a man named John Jones was not there to my knowledge—I do not know a man named John Jones—I was in company with the boatswain at the spirit vaults in Exchange-street—Gove and I were-examined before the Magistrate separately—I do not know whether we were at the spirit vaults after we had been examined—I did not say to the boatswain, "What did you say on your examination?" not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the boatswain reply to you that he had said that the captain flogged the steward on such a day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me he knew he had flog<lb/>ged him on a certain day—I do not recollect saying that I had said the very same—I recollect the boatswain did say that to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say, "I said the very same, and we must both speak alike?" and that you would go any length, any distance, and at any price, to hang the b—b—? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I said I would go before any Court of Justice to tell the truth upon him—that is all I said—I did not say I would hang him at any price—when I was examined before Captain Hemmingway and Dawson, what I said was taken down in writing, read over to me, and I signed it—this is ray signature—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it)—</hi> they desired me to tell all I knew about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How often did the captain kick him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say how often—I saw it more than twice—I should say three times, but I cannot say he kicked him constantly; whenever he could get a chance—I should say he kicked him four or five times—I do not know where.</p>

               <p>fruit again," or words to that effect—I cannot exactly mention the words, as there was such an uproar in the ship—I suppose they had been flogging him twenty minutes, when he said that—the captain said, "Flog the black b—, I will have his life"—I did not hear the steward say any thing else—the flogging continued until he died—the captain was there till he died—I saw there was no life in him—he was not moving, and the captain ordered irons to be put on by the carpenter—the carpenter said it was no use putting irons on a man that was dead—the captain said, "Never mind the irons; heave a bucket of water over him, and see if there is any life in him"—the steward's shirt and singlet were taken off, after they had flogged him a little while—that was by the captain's orders, I suppose—the doctor was sent for after the steward's death—what passed about the irons was after the flogging had ceased—no white man assisted in the flogging—we were all white except the steward and cook, and the Kroo men—they did not belong to the vessel—they did not come from England—I never had any quarrel with the captain in my life—I have been following a seaman's life twenty-eight years—I never sailed with him before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not usual, when any of the persons on board the ship address the captain, to say "Sir" to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the. steward did not say "Sir"—he merely said, "Nothing," in a saucy manner—the captain said, "You have been drinking out of the decanter"—the steward said he had not—he did not use the word "Sir" then—he did not address the cap<lb/>tain as "Sir" during the whole conversation, and his manner was saucy all the way through—the captain said, "Will you tell a barefaced lie to my face?"—the steward said he did not tell a lie—the captain then took up a cat that was alongside the chest, (where it usually was, as the blacks are rather fond of stealing things on board,) and struck him across the shoulders three or four times—the steward then seized him by the knee with his right hand, and by the throat with his left, and said he would be d—if he would be imposed upon, he was a hard-working man—his right hand was at the captain's knee, but he shifted it to his * * * *, and lifted the captain up, holding him in that manner—the steward was a very strong, vigorous man—he then threw the captain down on the chest, and as he fell his bead knocked against the handle of the door—the key was in the key-hole, and it cut his head, and I observed it bleeding very much at the back part of the head, just above the ear, on the right side—the cut was about the size of two joints of my fingers—the steward kept hold of him by the throat, and his right hand also was still in the way I have described, while he was down, and he had his head against the captain's head to keep him down.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what you saw, did it appear to you that the captain was in danger from him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I observed the marks of his five fingers on the captain's throat, and his face was a blue colour—Walker was the first Kroo boy that flogged—he was striking, and the others were holding him—five of them were flogging at the same time—Walker, and Bottle-o'-beer let him go a bit, and then they flogged him again—they took his shirt and singlet off, and then let him go for a time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before you went down with the captain, what injury did it appear to you the steward had received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was nearly killed before I went down—he could just roll about, but he could not sit up—that was before I went down into the cabin with the captain—the captain got his head dressed—his head was not bleeding much at that time—the blood was getting very hard—I was washing his neck.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Old Hicks Coffee-house, at the corner of King-street and Frith-street, Soho. The prisoner was twice in my employment—he first came to me in the latter end of May, 1836—I took him from his friends from school—he remained at that time till the latter end of January, or the beginning of February—he came again on Friday, the 13th of June, 1837, and continued up to the 19th of January last—he was a bar-man, and confidential youth—it was his duty to receive money for the things sold at the bar—on the night of the 4th, when I went to bed about one, or half-past one o'clock, as my general custom is, I counted every farthing of money I left behind me in my two tills, which are about two yards apart—I left two silver sixpences in each till, and about a shilling's worth of coppers in each till, with the addition of a few pence more—it may be 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—I could not say to a few coppers—I left no more in the bar that night, but I left, on the marble slab at the back, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. counted in coppers—that was the whole—the amount of the monies left in the tills was not five shillings—the money on the slab is always there—it is stationary there—the money con<lb/>sisted of four silver sixpences, and the remainder in copper—then were two silver sixpences in each till, and about a shilling's worth of cop<lb/>per in each till; and there might be a few halfpence more—that was the whole of the money in the tills—I did not leave any shillings in the tills—it is the prisoner's usual custom to go to bed at ten, or half-past ten o'clock—he went to bed, I may say, two hours before me that night—I went to the tills again the following morning, from eight to half-past eight o'clock—it was not nine o'clock—I found the same money, with the addition of a few coppers extra—there was no more silver—only the sixpences that I left the previous night—I again examined the tills after I sent him to breakfast, about nine o'clock—I found the money I left on the slab exactly the same as I left it—it had been there for days and weeks.</p>

               <p>swear it—I mean deliberately to swear it—there is no mistake about it—I expect only what is right and just—that I swear—there were two shillings' worth of coppers on the marble slab—I said so from the first time I came into the Court—I have said what money was in the tills, and what money I left on the marble—I have always said so—I did not mention it to Sir Frederick Roe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say that the whole was under 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What I left in the tills I confined it to the tills—I said that the money I left in the tills was under 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in halfpence on the slab—I do not think I mentioned the coppers on the marble slab before the Magistrate—I do not think I said any thing about the money on the slab before the Magistrate—the prisoner came down soon after seven o'clock, and had his breakfast a little before nine o'clock—his usual business was to clean the counter-tops, and serve cus<lb/>tomers—he was in the shop when I came down, soon after eight o'clock; and it was after he went that I examined the tills—not in his presence—I got some information from a woman named Gee, about the prisoner, on or near the morning of the 16th—she did not tell me at all—she told my wife, on the 16th—she kept an account of the day of the month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did she tell yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My wife told me the same day—I lad some conversation with the woman on the morning I discovered this robbery, the 5th of January—Gee came to me then, and I had no doubt who committed this robbery on the 5th of January, as she told me of it—the prisoner remained in my service after that till Friday, the 19th of January—I kept him from the respect I had for him and his friends—he was en<lb/>rusted to my care, that was the reason I kept him—I can conscientiously wear that—I never mentioned, between the 5th and 19th, to any of the boy's friends, that he had robbed me—I continued to leave him in his place trust till the 19th, occasionally watching him—I always watched him—did not mention to himself that he had robbed me on the 5th—I did be<lb/>fore he left me—I do not know whether it was on the Friday—his warn<lb/>ing was not out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did not the boy leave you in indignation because you accused him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I called those people who had accused him before his face, and mentioned it to him—that was not the woman Gee—I did not say that it was the woman Gee told me on the 5th, and that was the day he robbed me—Gee told me she had paid the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she told me that on the 5th of January; and on the 5th I discovered the robbery—I gave the boy a character when he left me—it was from the good feeling I had, and having brought him up in the way I had done, and taught him the business—I could not tell his friends, and I thought the best I could do was to recommend him to some other person, which I did—Mr. Rivers asked me for his character—he lives in White Lion-street, and is a respectable tradesman, I believe—the prisoner was going to a place of trust, I believe; but it is no rule because he robbed me that he should rob others—I heard, from information I received from respectable Persons, that he had been robbing me. for some time—I got that information, on the morning of the 16th, from my wife—there were three persons—they came to me—it was before I got this information that I gave him the honest character—I cannot say on what day I gave him the character—I believe it was Wednesday—it was before he left me—I called him into my presence before the person I gave him the character to—the gentleman asked me how soon I could part with him—I said I would leave it to himself—the prisoner gave me the notice to quit—</p>

               <p>I cannot say the day—I really cannot say the day—I think it was on Wed<lb/>nesday—I really cannot say what day it was—he quitted me on Friday afternoon—I will not swear it was not on Tuesday that he gave me the notice—the gentleman came on Wednesday or Thursday evening—it was before Mr. Rivers came to ask the character of the boy that he gave me notice—it was after I had seen Mr. Rivers that the three respectable people came to tell me he had been robbing me to a great extent—I cannot say the day of the month—he had not left me—I then went to Mr. Rivers, and told him—I swear that—it was before he took him into his service, I went to Mr. Rivers myself—my respect for the boy's friends had ceased after I found he had robbed me to such an extent—about half-past one o'clock on Friday I saw him do what was not proper, at my counter—I got up, gave him a box on the head, and sent him out of the house directly—I have a second public-house—I asked the prisoner to go and live there——that was before I gave him the box on the head—the day Mr. Rifen came to me, I said, "Why cannot you go to the other house and live with me, as well as go to Mr. Rivers?"—that was on Wednesday or Thursday—it was the day before he went—these people came to tell me he bad robbed me to a great extent on the Tuesday or Wednesday before the Friday he left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, as you must have heard from the three people on the Tuesday or Wednesday, that he had robbed you, why did you not tell Mr. Rivers when he came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was after I saw Mr. Rivers I made this discovery—it was on Tuesday I allowed him to go and seek for a situation—I think it was on the morning previous to his leaving that the three persons came—I cannot say to the day, but I think it was—I have sworn he left me on Fri<lb/>day—the morning previous to that would be Thursday—i said that on Tues<lb/>day or Wednesday the three people came—I cannot say the day indeed—it was a day or two before the boy quitted me that these three people came—I cannot say to the day—I kept him after that for the respect I had for him—I did not go and tell Mr. Rivers till after he was in the station-house—he never went to Mr. Rivers—he was taken to the station on Saturday night—it was not on that Saturday night that I went to Mr. Rivers—I went to Mr. Rivers on Sunday—a day or two before he left I had dis<lb/>covered he had robbed me to a great extent—on Friday he left, and on Saturday night he was in the station-house—on Sunday I went to Mr. Rivers—I did not give the boy a good character on that very Saturday—I gave him no character at all on Saturday—I mean deliberately to swear that—no gentleman called about his character on Saturday, upon my oath—I told a person on Saturday, that from the great respect I had for the boy I had previously given him a good character.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say, at ten o'clock on that Saturday night, that you had given him an excellent character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not at home at ten o'clock—I did not say so between eight and eleven o'clock—I am sure of that—I might have said on Saturday that I had given him a character to get a place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say on Saturday night that you had discharged him and given him an excellent character, and he had got another place, and was going to it on Wednesday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot call to my mind whether I did on Saturday night—the policeman told me he was in the station-house—there was a gentleman with him who asked me if I had lost any thing, and I said, "Not to my knowledge"—they took me at a moment when I did</p>

               <p>not know what I was about—I was not twice deliberately asked the ques<lb/>tion, and I did not twice deliberately deny it—when the policeman come into my house, he said, "Have you lost a cash-box containing any money; have you lost any money?"—I said, "No, not to my knowledge"—he did not ask me if I had lost 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to my knowledge—I said, "I believe I have not lost any thing to that amount"—he did not—I told the officer that I did not know, to my knowledge, that I had lost any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And that after you had been told by three respectable people that he had been robbing you to a great extent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said that to the officer—after I had given that answer, the officer told mo he had taken this boy into custody with a good many sovereigns on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not then say, "No doubt he has been robbing me?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Money is not my object in prosecuting—I did say that he had previously robbed me—I did not say that till the officer told me there was money found on the boy—I wished to protect the boy—I had previously wished to screen him from any thing he had done to me, and then the, officer put it blank to me—I did not tell the officer he had robbed me till he told me there was money found—I denied it when the officer came to fetch me, and said he was in custody—I did not say, "No doubt he has been robbing me, and I will go and recognise him"—the officer begged me to go directly—I said I would go with the officer—I went to the boy's lodgings, at the house of Mrs. Mary Ann Dickens, on Sunday morning, about half-past ten o'clock—his box was searched by the officer and myself—there was a bottle in the box—I said I would swear to it—I afterwards declined to do so, but I found when I got home that my wife had given it to him—I declined to swear to it before I left the house, or saw my wife, from motives of my own—I knew the bottle came from my shop; because I have so many like it—my good feeling towards the boy made me decline swearing to it on the spot—that was on the Sunday alter I had told the officer that he had rob<lb/>bed me—I did not say on Sunday morning, "I have no charge whatever against him"—I said I would not make any search—the officer was search<lb/>ing his box—I did not say, to my recollection, after the bottle was found, "I have nothing against him"—I believe I did not say so before the po<lb/>liceman and the prisoner's aunt—I cannot recollect saying those words—I do not think I did.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Chelsea, and get my living by labouring. On the 30th of January I lodged in George-street for one night—the house is let out in lodgings for men—I had two sovereigns and a half wrapped up in a piece of paper in my watch pocket—I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock—I do not think the prisoner lives in the house—I had put my trowsen on the top of the bed, over against the wall—one side was close to the wall, and there I put my trowsers—in the morning I saw the prisoner with my trowsen in her hand—I cannot exactly tell the time—it was daylight—I asked her what business she had with them—she said she was going to throw them on the bed, as she saw them on the floor—I do not know whether she slept in the room—there were three or four beds there—I did not get up till near twelve o'clock—I then missed my money—I went out to inquire where she lived—I was two or three hours before I could find out, and they said she was. not at home—I went for a policeman, and saw one just by the Compasses, in Grosvenor-row—I took him to the house, and gave her into custody—the policeman, found one sovereign and a half in her hand, in the piece of paper which they had both been; and she had most of the other sovereign in silver in her pocket—I am sure it was the same piece of paper.</p>

I am in the service of Philip James Chabot; he is a silk and worsted dyer—the prisoner worked there—on the 2nd of February he came into the room where I was, saying he wanted some tobacco—he went to his coat, and took something out of his trowsers pocket, which I supposed to be a handkerchief—it was something yellow—he looked at it, and put it into the coat pocket—I took an opportunity of seeing what it was, and found it was 2 1/2 oz. of silk—this was about twenty minutes to eight o'clock—I told my master, and about twenty minutes to nine o'clock he was going to breakfast—my master told me to follow him, which I did, from the dye-house in Fashion-street, as far as Spitalfields-church, when I took him—the officer took the silk from him.</p>

It was impossible for you to see me take this out of my pocket—it was hanging to my button when I went into the room—I did not want any one to see it, and I was determined to hide it a moment till I got an opportunity of getting to the parcel which it belonged to, and I had no opportunity of doing so—when I went to ray breakfast I thought to get back in time to put it with the silk—I had no occasion to take it out of my trowsers pocket, which I must have undone my apron to do, and put it into my handkerchief, and put it into my coat pocket, when a man was there, who was likely to go to my coat pocket as well as me—I only went to my coat pocket for a bit of tobacco—I would have returned it as soon is I could. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose, from your desiring Campbell to take care of him, you were afraid some accident might happen to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was afraid he would make a disturbance in the house—he was reeling about—I would not have given him any thing more to drink if he had wanted it—I did not notice him with any stick—the hat is a new invention, called washable hats—they are very common.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a twopenny post-hoy. On Sunday, the 22nd of October, I had been to see my father in Essex—I was returning home in the evening with Pluckrose—we got to Maryland-point, near the nursery, about half-past seven o'clock—I saw the prisoner there—he was alone—there was nobody near him—he was going the same way as we were—we overtook him—he appeared in a state of intoxication—we bade him "Good night"—he wanted me and Pluckrose to lead him home to Well-street—we said we would not, and he said we should—we had then passed him—when we said we would not lead him home we ran away, and he ran after us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far did he run before he got up to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half way to the nursery-ground—about twice the width of this Court—he then caught bold of Pluckrose, and threw him down—Pluckrose had a small stick in his hand—the prisoner drew it out of his hand, and hit him twice across the face with it, after pushing him down—I went and touched Pluck<lb/>rose, and the prisoner turned round and hit me over the head with the stick, but I had a pair of spurs in my hat and they saved my head—it was a small hazel stick—we called out for assistance, and a gentleman came up and threw him down away from Pluckrose—he had hold of Pluckrose at the time—the prisoner got up, and the gentleman threw him down a second time—he then turned back towards Laytonstone, and made his es<lb/>cape, and the gentleman walked on along with us—the prisoner ran along, and ran past Mr. Bush as Mr. Bush met him—I cannot say how far Mr. Bash was from me—we were opposite the police-station when he was about half way along the nursery-ground—the police-station is about twice the length of this Court from the nursery-ground—we heard screams of dis<lb/>tress, and ran to see what it was, and found two ladies picking up the old gentleman—I did not see Mr. Bush before I heard the screams, but the prisoner ran off, and we heard a scream—when we went up we found Mr. Bush, and the two ladies picking him up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner when he parted from you and Pluckrose gone in the direction which would enable him to meet Mr. Bush and the ladies? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not see any other man about at that time, except the gen<lb/>tleman who had assisted us, and he was on forwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How old are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Eighteen next May—I had never seen the prisoner before, to my knowledge—it was not a bright night—it was quite dark, but I had hold of him, and saw him in the face—was greatly alarmed when I got the blow across the head with the stick, and I was frightened when I saw Pluckrose struck—I began to scream out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take notice what kind of dress the man had on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he had on a white flannel jacket—I am sure it was flannel, for I had the sleeve of it in my hand, and he had a white hat with a round top to it—he had not his hat on when he ran away from us, but he had when he came up to us—it was knocked off in the scrummage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were you doing out that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had been down to see a friend, and was returning home—I had dined at home—the stick I speak of was about the thickness of my little finger—we had brought it up on purpose for riding—it was a kind of switch.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know it made any difference to him whether he had a blue or a white jacket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should have thought it did, because they swore that he had a white jacket—I heard them say so—I heard Johnson say to to the Bench—I was present at his examination before the Justice—I did not give evidence there—I was not called up at all—I do not know how soon after the examination it was that I saw ms mother—it was the same day—I had no conversation about him that day—I did not say a word about what had just passed before the Magistrate—not a word was said about the jacket at that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not think it necessary to tell his mother you had heard a witness swear he had a white jacket, and you knew he had a blue one—perhaps you did not remember it at that time, was that it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose it was—I mentioned it after we came home from Stratford to Mrs. Hughes, and she asked me to come here and speak the truth—she did not ask me to come and state about the jacket—I told her I would come and speak the truth myself—that was all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I was with Chittenden when the prisoners were seen in New-road—Chittenden apprehended William Fabling—I went up to Hoare and said to him, "What have you got here?"—he seemed rather bulky—his smock-frock stuck out—he pulled his smock-frock up, and these two pieces of lead dropped from under it—this was about a mile from Plumstead—it was about seven o'clock in the evening—I said I should take him on suspicion of stealing—he said he supposed I did think so—I took him to the station-house, and on searching him found a knife in his pocket—I cannot say whether it had cut lead—I fitted the lead next morning to the premises, and it tallied exactly—he said he picked it up—Richard Fabling ran away when we took the other two—when I first came up to them they were standing still, near a marine store dealer's, right opposite the, door—I know such shops buy lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Red-cross-alley, in the Borough, in the parish of St. George-the-martyr. I remember the day after Christmas-day—I was in the court about a quarter to eight o'clock that evening, and saw the prisoner Bryan—he lives in the parish—I saw him when he first came into the court—he came by himself—his wife had come before him—I knew the deceased John Bryan, and had lived three years next door to him—he had a brother named <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan—there had been a quarrel that even<lb/>ing between <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan and the prisoner Thomas Bryan, and blows passed between them—that was at a quarter to eight o'clock—a very few words passed between them, and then the blows took place—the women inter<lb/>fered when they were fighting, and took <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> into the deceased's house, and after that the prisoner, Thomas Bryan, went away from the court—he did not say any thing when he went away—he was gone about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—the court was quiet while he was gone—there was no disturbance then—neither of the Mahoneys were present at the first quarrel—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Thomas Bryan came back and the two Mahoneys with him—Daniel Mahoney was in his shirt sleeves, and I think Patrick had his jacket off—Daniel is the son of the other—I did not see any thing in either of their hands at all—when they came, Thomas Bryan said, "Where is <hi rend="italic">e'er</hi> a b—Bryan now? I am not alone now"—he said to the elder Mahoney, "Never mind, <hi rend="italic">gossip</hi>"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290189"/>
               <p>(that means a person who has stood godfather to a child)—Mahoney said he had been listening for a long time, and did not know that Bryan, his <hi rend="italic">gossip</hi>, was concerned in it, or he would have come—(I had told Bryan's wife to go home before that)—I said, "There is no Bryan here to answer you"—Thomas Bryan said, "Never mind, <hi rend="italic">gossip</hi>, I shall see John the <hi rend="italic">Iron</hi>, either over the bridge or on this side the bridge"—(the deceased was called John the <hi rend="italic">Iron</hi>—he worked at Mr. Alderman Thompson's iron-wharf)—Thomas Bryan then said, "Never mind, <hi rend="italic">gossip</hi>, if I do not see him to-night, or any of the Bryans, I shall meet them over the bridge to-morrow, or on this side the bridge, or any of his brothers, I don't care which it is, and I will give them blood to drink, or they shall give it to me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any appearance of any of the Bryans out in the court at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the prisoners then went away—they went the same way as they came—after they were gone, <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan, the deceased's bro<lb/>ther, came out of his house into the court, and asked who was looking for him—upon which the two Mahoneys returned, but not Thomas Bryan—the two Mahoneys came right up to my door—<hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan was standing under the lamp at my door—the elder Mahoney (Patrick) came up, and shook hands with him very heartily under the lamp by my door, and asked him how he did—young Mahoney (Daniel) also came up the court, but I did not hear him say any thing—a young man named Reardon also came up the court, and tome others whom I did not know—they went two doors from my house—I did not hear the deceased's wife call out after that—I heard nothing; but I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> between <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan and some of the women, at the second door to me where they had gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear anybody, on the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> taking place, call out for the de<lb/>ceased to come out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear him called out myself, but I saw him come out of his brother Patrick's house—not out of his own house—(<hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> had been in that house) before that the deceased had come out of his own house with his child in his arms, and took the child to his brother Patrick's house; and when he was called, he came out of his brother Pa<lb/>trick's house, which is four doors from his own house—I did not hear him called—when he came out of his brother's he went into his own house, and came out again—he hardly staid a minute in his own house—when he came out he went down to where the mob was—where the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was going on—it was in the same court—Redcross-alley.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see what he did when be went down there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard him saying, "In the name of God, what do you all want here?" and I saw no more of him till they dragged <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan away from the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—pre<lb/>sently I saw a kind of clearance, and they dragged <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan into the deceased's house—I then saw the deceased on the ground, and noticed a great quantity of blood come from his head—I did not see any blow struck myself—Mrs. Grant and Michael Bryan went to pick him up—Michael Bryan is no relation to him, nor to the prisoner Bryan.</p>

               <p>worse for liquor—I cannot say that he was much—it was Boxing night—Thomas Bryan went away with the Mahoneys, not by himself, when they first left—I do not know that <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan was taken down the court by the deceased's nephew—I am quite sure about the words Thomas Bryan used when he came back with the Mahoneys—, he called out whether there is ever a Bryan here; and said, "If I was alone a while ago, I am not alone now;" and Mr. Mahoney said, "I have heard the disturbance a long time, and little did I think it was you there, or I would have been here before now and cleared the court"—he said, "Never mind, as we cannot find <hi rend="italic">e'er</hi> a Bryan now, I shall find him to-morrow, or either of the brothers, I don't care which it is; I shall give him blood to drink, or he shall give it to me"—the deceased had come out of his own house first with the child, and took it to his brother's house; but when he was called out he brought the child back to his own house, left it there, and went down the court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What became of you when you heard him say, "In the name of God, what do you all want here?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I stood at my own door, which is not within four doors of them—I could not see what was going on—it was very dark, and I was very ill—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> seemingly at the bottom of the court—there were a good many people there—there were none of the other Bryans there, that I could see, but <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the deceased came out of his house, and went down to the bottom of the court, how many Bryans were there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Jerry and his wife—there was no other Bryan that I could see, only Thomas Bryan—I did not see whether the deceased did any thing, when he said, "What in the name of God do you all want here?"—it was too dark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am going on for eleven years old, and live with my mother in Redcross-alley. I remember last Boxing night—I was standing in the alley, on the railing, about eight o'clock in the evening—I saw the two Mahoneys in the alley—I think they were in their shirt-sleeves—I saw them when they first came up the court—I did not see Thomas Bryan with them—the court was quiet when they came in—<hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan and Tho<lb/>mas Bryan had been quarrelling before this, but <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> had gone into his house, and Thomas Bryan had gone out of the court—he did not live in the court—I did not hear either of the Mahoneys say any thing when they came into the court, but I afterward saw young Mahoney with a poker hitting the deceased, John Bryan—I did not see him with the poker when he came into the court—I do not know whether he had it or not when I first saw him—I knew the deceased—I saw him come into the court—he came out of his brother's house—he came out of his own house first, with his little boy, and went into his brother's house with it—about a quarter of an hour after I saw him come out of his brother's house with the child in his arms, and go into his own house with the child—I did not see him come out of to his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290193"/>
               <p>own house again, but I saw him afterwards in the court, near his own house—I had not heard anybody call before be came out, nor before I saw him standing in the court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did he do after you saw him standing near his own house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard him say to Thomas Bryan's wife, "You had better go home in peace," as <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Bryan's wife was quarrelling with the deceased's wife—the Mahoneys were not there then—they had not returned—(they bad come up once in their shirt-sleeves, and gone away again)—I did not see the deceased do any thing after the Mahoneys came up the second time—I saw him in the court—I saw young Mahoney come up the court with a poker—the deceased was in his own house then, smoking hit pipe—it was after that he came out with his child, and went back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see either of the Mahoneys do any thing to the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I saw the youngest one (Daniel) hit him on the shoulder with the poker—it made him stagger a little, and I saw him (Daniel) hit him twice more on the head with the poker—he then fell—he was close by the railing at that time, and I was standing over him at the tine he was struck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before young Mahoney struck the deceased, did the deceased strike him, or attempt to do so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not see it—I do not think he could have done it without my seeing him, where I was—I did not hear them say any thing to each other before the blows wore struck—the deceased had no hat on—he had what is called a <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> cap, which fits close to the head—old Mahoney was standing by while the deceased was being knocked down; and after he was down he came and kicked him—he was about as far from the deceased at the time he was knocked down as I am from you—(<hi rend="italic">about six yards</hi>)—I did not hear him say any thing at the time the deceased was being knocked down—he kicked him twice after he was down—he kicked him once first; then his wife, who was among the women, came and kicked him; and then he kicked him again—he caught hold of his wife's clothes, and kicked him—I did not see in what part of his body he kicked him—the deceased had his cap on while he was on the ground, and he had his hands over his head—I did not notice either time where he was kicked—they were not very hard kicks—I did not see any more of the Mahoneys after that, for they ran away—I did not see any policeman come—I hallooed out "Murder!" and the Mahoneys ran away—Mrs. Williams was at her win<lb/>dow at the same time, and she called "Murder" also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it a dark night or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The lamps were lighted—they are gas lamps, but there were a <hi rend="italic">lot</hi> of women and men, and they took the light away—the lamps did not give much light where this took place—there was light enough for me to be sure that young Mahoney knocked the deceased down with the poker, and old Mahoney kicked him—I saw them quite plain—I did not notice what was done with the poker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did the deceased come from at the time you lay young Mahoney struck him with the poker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He came out of his own house, and was going into his brother's house—he did not come from the bottom of the court where the disturbance was—he came out of his own house—I was standing on the railing, and stood over the deceased when he was struck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you stood over him, why could you not see where he was kicked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because it was dark down there—it was more dark on the ground than in any other part—persons were standing between the lamp and young Ma<lb/>honey,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290194"/>
               <p>and that made it dark—I had been standing on the railing almost half an hour—I did not see the deceased come out of his own house, and go down the court where the quarrel was—I was before the Coroner at the first examination—I was not sworn the first day—I was not asked any questions the first day, because I did not know the Lord's Prayer—a Ca<lb/>tholic priest gave me instructions, and then I was sworn—I could not say the Lord's Prayer the first day, and I was taught it by the priest—I was never before a Magistrate in my life before—I did not hear any one say, "Will you see your mother struck?"—a person named Mary Ann Bryan was in the court—she lives at No. 6—she is no relation of the deceased—his wife's name is <hi rend="italic">Peggy</hi>, I believe—old Mahoney did not say or do any thing while his son struck the blows—he was near to the dark part of the court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he pulled his wife by the gown, are you quite sure he did not stumble over the man, and kick him by accident? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he stooped his head—he kicked him about the head, I dare say, for he kicked towards his head, but it was so dark I cannot tell where it was exactly.</p>

I knew the deceased, John Bryan—he worked at an iron manufactory, I under<lb/>stand—I live at No. 4, Red Cross-court, or alley—I believe they call it alley—on the day after Christmas-day I was at home, in my bed-room, on the first floor, between nine and ten o'clock—it was not ten o'clock—I heard a scream of murder, and threw up my window—I saw several people fighting together, but it was very dark opposite my door—I saw a man in his shirt-sleeves, with a heavy weapon in his hand—it appeared a very large poker or an iron-railing—it was very long—I saw him give three dif<lb/>ferent blows, but there were five or six people there, and I cannot say whether he gave all the blows to one person—my window was not further from them than from me to the Bench—(<hi rend="italic">about seven yards</hi>)—I left my win<lb/>dow just to go and put my hand on my child, and then returned to it—there then appeared nobody in the court, but I saw somebody on the ground, and a man in his shirt-sleeves came up and kicked him—I could not tell whether it was a man or a woman on the ground—I saw a man in his shirt-sleeves just come to the body and kick it with his right foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see where he kicked it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About the white part of the body—it must have been the upper part of the body because he had a white smock-frock on—I could not tell whether it was the head then, not knowing whether it was a man or woman—the man then went past the body a few steps, and seized a woman by her gown.</p>

               <p>when the weapon was used, but it was in a dark part of the court—I called out that somebody was murdered, and then Michael Bryan came up to the, body—I saw nobody the last time of looking out, but one man and a wo<lb/>man—I stopped to shut the window, and while I was doing that I heard them say it was John Bryan, the deceased—when I came down he was led away by two policemen—he walked along between them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Red Cross-alley. I knew the deceased John Bryan, but am not related to him. About eight o'clock in the even<lb/>ing, on boxing-day, I was at my own door, in the court, and saw the pri<lb/>soner Thomas Bryan there—I heard him inquiring for John Bryan, or any of the Bryans, and he said he would serve them so and so; that he would jump on any of the Bryans in the court, and if he did not catch them then he would have John Bryan as he was going backwards and forwards on London-bridge to his work, (the deceased used to go over the bridge to work,) and he said if he did not have help then he would go and bring help, that he would bring his <hi rend="italic">gossips</hi> from the Back-alley—the Mahoneys—I have been told that the Mahoneys do live in Back-alley—Thomas Bryan then went away, and was gone for a quarter of an hour or better—I did not see him return with the two Mahoneys—I know <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan, the de<lb/>ceased's brother—I did not see him come out of the house, but he was at the bottom of the court, and was rather in liquor, and a great many women had a quarrel down at the bottom of the court—I did not see the deceased there—he was next door to me, at his brother's house—I saw him come out, with his child in his arms—I do not know what made him come out—at this time the two Mahoneys were down by his house—I followed him down the court—he put his child in doors, came out, and advised the Mahoneys to go home, and to take no notice of women's quarrels; as they had begun it, to let them finish it betwixt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What part of the court were the Mahoneys in when he said that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Close to the deceased's own house—the elder Mahoney then said he would jump on any man who would say any thing against his <hi rend="italic">gossip</hi>—at this time <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan was rather in liquor, and six or seven women got round him, and were <hi rend="italic">clawing</hi> him opposite the deceased's door—the deceased's wife and I assisted <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> into the house, and got him in doors, as he was in liquor—I did not go in doors with him—the two Mahoneys and the deceased at this time were coming up the court, talking together—I followed them up, and as I came a little towards my own house, I saw something white lay against the palings—I had been two doors further up, and there were a great many women and people in the way—I did not see any thing done to the deceased, but I saw something white against the paling, which turned out to be him—he had a white smock frock on—I looked at him, and thought it was one of the women, and said I would let her stop down a bit, as she deserved it, having begun the quarrel—some<lb/>body said, "It is John Bryan," and then I went to pick him up—I saw a man standing against his head—I looked, and it was young Mahoney, hold<lb/>ing a poker over his head with both hands, as if he was going to strike, but I did not see any blow struck—it appeared as if he was going to strike me—I said, "Mind, young fellow, don't you go to hit me with the poker, I have not interfered on either side"—I drew back—there was a door open behind me, and I got in—I got up on the stairs, and remained there two or three minutes, and when I thought they were gone I came out—I helped to pick the deceased up, and he was taken away by the policemen—I saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290196"/>
               <p>no blow struck whatever—I am sure it was young Mahoney had the poker in his hand—I did not notice whether old Mahoney was there—I kept my eye on the poker—the two Mahoneys were in their shirt-sleeves when they first came into the court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I saw the two Mahoneys come into the court—they had nothing in their hands—I saw the deceased come out of his brother's house with his child, which is two years and a half old—I did not see what became of the child—I saw the deceased talking to the Mahoneys, and heard him say that he never inter<lb/>fered with women's quarrels, and to go home and be peaceable and quiet—I did not hear them say any thing to that—I saw a man named Reardon striking hands with the deceased, and saying he would rather take his part, than ill use him—I heard the elder Mahoney say to his son, "Will you tee your mother struck?"—the deceased at that time was standing with hit back against the shutter of our window.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he struck Mahoney's wife, or done any thing of the kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I saw—I think he could not have done so without my seeing, for I was standing close by—I then went into my house, and was gone about five minutes—when I came to the door again, I saw the elder Mahoney was putting his hands together, and he said, "Be off, all of you"—the de<lb/>ceased was on the ground at that time, and I saw the elder Mahoney kick him on his head—that was after he said, "Be off, all of you"—he then took I woman by the clothes and brought her along; and as he passed the body he kicked him a second time—I then put my door too, and saw no more—I am quite sure the first kick was somewhere about his head—it was not on the shoulder, it was on his head, towards the upper part—I am quite sure the kick was on some part of the head—it was a violent kick—I can<lb/>not say whether the prisoner had boots or shoes on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far were you from the man on the ground when he was kicked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He laid opposite No. 7, and I live at No. 6—I could see by the light of the gas that his head laid on the ground, towards where Mahoney's foot went—I can safely say the kicks did not take effect on the shoulder, or upper part of the smock-frock—there were no people between the gas lamp and the body that I know of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How then could you tell it was the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The smock-frock appeared white, and his hair was dark—he had nothing on his head, when I picked him up—if he had any thing on his head, when he was kicked, it must have been the colour of his hair—I cannot say how many people were there when Mahoney said to his son," Will you see your mother struck?"—I know there was the deceased, the two Mahoneys, Reardon, <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> Bryan snd his wife, and my husband and myself—there had been a tumult in the court from about seven o'clock, and this was about ten o'clock; but I had bad nothing to do with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Bransby Cooper, of Guy's Hospital. I remember the deceased being brought there, on the 26th of December—he was alive then, and lived till the Thursday week follow<lb/>ing, the 4th of January, when he died—he was suffering from a large wound on the left side of the head, which was bleeding profusely—there was a con<lb/>tusion on the left temple, and a smaller wound, near the vertex of the head—he was unable to speak when he was brought in, but was conscious of what was being done with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose it was a perfectly hopeless case from the first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say, certainly not, as far as we were able to judge when he was brought in—there was not appearance enough to prove a pressure of the skull on the brain—I examined the head after death—on removing the scalp, I saw a large quantity of extravasated blood, and discovered an excessive fracture, without any displacement of the bone—it had extended over a large artery, and ruptured that artery, and formed a large coagulum of blood, which, pressing on the brain, caused death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had known the state of the wound to be as you found afterwards, would you have trepanned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would not have altered the case—there may be pressure of blood from various causes—trepanning is of use in cases where the pressure is from blood, and not from the bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it such an injury as was likely to have been in<lb/>flicted by such an instrument as a poker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think it very probable that the contusion on the temple might be the result of a kick that alone would certainly not be the cause of death—there was no mark on the shoulder when I examined after death—I did not examine it particularly before—there was no sign of violence on the shoulder after death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the two wounds, besides the contusion, so situated as that they might be inflicted by one blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it possible they might be in<lb/>flicted by one blow—they were about two inches, or two inches and a half apart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You consider death was caused by the pressure of coagulum of blood on the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that proceeded from the rupture of a vessel which was caused by a large fracture of the skull which I found—that fracture corresponded with the wound outside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leatherseller, and live at No. 187, Union-street, Borough. The prisoner was in my service—he was formerly in, my warehouse, but last year he ceased to be in my warehouse, and became my collector—he had authority to receive money on my account—it was his duty to keep a book to enter accounts of what he received—the monies he received were to be entered the evening of the same day, if he was home before the warehouse closed, if not, the first thing next morning—he left me about three months since of his own accord, being in some difficulty at that time—I was not aware that there was any deficiency in his accounts—I had a customer of the name of Hartley—he never accounted to me for the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received from Mr. Hartley on the 24th of May, nor for 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received from the same gentleman on the 7th of June—I had a cus<lb/>tomer of the name of Thomas Sale—the prisoner did not account for the receipt of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received from him on the 2nd of June—he accounted for 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have known the prisoner a long while? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have—he did not always take a book with him—I was angry with him that he did not—he was arrested, I believe, for his son's debt—he was in very great trouble about October—I always had reason to believe that he was a man of good character till these discoveries—I was answerable for him when he was arrested—he has been obliged to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act—I think that was about October—it was before Term time—at the time I made this charge against the prisoner, he was in Mr. Car<lb/>penter's service—I am not aware that Mr. Carpenter is a great rival of mine—he is in the same line of business, but we are on good terms—the prisoner brought a small connexion to me—(he was in business himself)—I should not like to lose that connexion—when the prisoner came out of cus<lb/>tody, I was willing to take him into my employ again if he had come bad to me, but he never came—I never discharged him—he went into Mr. Carpenter's employ after some days—he solicited me first before he went to Mr. Carpenter—he had a wish to have a weekly salary again, and I said I would consider of it—he then went and made an agreement with Mr. Carpenter—he was negotiating with Mr. Carpenter at that time—he had been from five to ten days with Mr. Carpenter when I had him taken up—he had absconded once—he was not at home for three or four days—I cannot tell where he was—I wanted to find him—he afterwards called on me himself—an officer came after that and told me he was in custody—I did not tell the officer I had no charge against him—I said I had no warrant against him—I never gave him in charge—the officer told me that Norris was taken, and that I was to come down to the station-house—I said I was unwell, I would come in the morning—I did not go to the station-house—I did not say I had no charge against him—the prisoner came to my house after I sent for him—he was at my house that very night, but he came then without being sent for—I had sent for him before he came, both after and before the policeman came—in the first instance he came by himself; in the last he and his wife came together to my warehouse, about eight o'clock in the evening—I sent for him to Mr. Carpenter's, and he came—he did not say he should give himself up into custody—he was to come the next morning—some days after that, the policeman came and said he was in cus<lb/>tody, and the same evening the prisoner and his wife came—that was the evening I gave him into custody—I never heard him say that he came for the express purpose of explaining any thing that was wrong in the accounts—I never spoke to him, as he was in the warehouse and I was in the counting-house—I would not go to him—he might have said that he wanted to explain any thing that was wrong in the accounts, but I did not hear it—he collected monies without his books—I have never found that he has given an account of having received more than he has—he was never over nor under his cash-book—he was over in one account in the ledger, not in the cash-book—I know that he has overcharged himself, and made mistakes of different kinds, in consequence of not taking the book—his book is not lost, it is now at home; he had mislaid it—I was over the way, in a public-house opposite my warehouse, taking tea, at the time the officer came—that is not a dozen yards from my warehouse—I live at Peckham; and, ill as I was, I went home that night to Peckham—the station-house is at Westminster—I went to Peckham in the omnibus—I</p>

               <p>walked to the Borough from Union-street—the prisoner and I kept a sort of account one against the other, and there was no settlement come to till the year's end—I gave him money on account—he was always in my debt on the commission—I was always paying him money, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time; not on any calculation of the account, but according to the money he wanted.</p>
