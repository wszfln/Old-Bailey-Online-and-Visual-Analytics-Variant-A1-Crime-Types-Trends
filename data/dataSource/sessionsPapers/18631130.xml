                  </hi>. I live at Brentford, and am shopman to Mr. Box, a wine and spirit merchant—I have been with him four years, and with his predecessor eleven years—in 1859 I had occasion to invest my savings in a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I had a memorandum of the number in my pocket-book—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the note—I received this note alone, and placed it in my pocket-book, and put my pocket-book under lock and key up to the time of going to the prisoner's lodging—at the time I had it I put a memor<lb/>andum of the number in one corner—this is the book; the number was 29, 101, but it has been altered to 29, 469—I can decipher several of the original figures—I went to lodge at the prisoner's in April, 1862—after a time I put the pocket-book in my wardrobe—I went to the expense of having a Chubb's lock put on the upper part of the wardrobe; on the folding doors—I left the wardrobe secure—I missed the note on 6th October—I had seen it safe about six weeks or two months before—when I missed the note, the pocket-book was in the same state as I had left it, and I found this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note substituted for the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—it has an endorsement of the name of "Cole" on it—I believe that name of "Cole" to be the hand-writing of the prisoner—I do not know any person of the name of Cole—I know a person named Coles; he is an acquaintance of mine, and has been for some years past—he was so at the time I lost the note—we were on visiting terms—the last time he visited me was on 26th September—there is an endorsement on this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, "W. Jones, Stains;" that is the prisoner's handwriting—when I missed the note, I examined the wardrobe; the Chubb's lock was still locked—there were two bolts on the left-hand door which kept the doors together—I found that some instrument had been used in order to remove the bolts, top and bottom—there was no other way of getting at the wardrobe—the Chubb's lock would then be useless—after satisfying myself how it was taken, I went in to Mr. Box, my employer—next morning I went to Scotland-yard, and communicated with Mr. William<lb/>son, and an officer went with me to the Bank—about March last the prisoner had asked me to lend him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when some alterations were going on at his house—he is a tailor—he said he wanted the amount to invest in</p>

               <p>his business, as he should require a stock—I refused to lend it him—I told him, on other occasions, when I had lent him money, that it was very much against my principle, lending money—he said if I would lend him the amount he would give me 5 per cent, and good security—I had previously lent him small sums; on one occasion I lent him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I never received any interest.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had this note in 1859? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was in April, 1862, I went to lodge with the prisoner—I then kept the note in this pocket-book, in a chest of drawers that were given me for my use—I kept it under lock and key; the key was given me by them—I kept the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note there until it was removed into my wardrobe—that was about thirteen months afterwards—I did not take the number of the note for any particular purpose, only I believe it is always customary to take the number—I was not contemplating its probable loss—I had lost things on a great many occasions: on one occasion I lost 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the drawers—I complained of it to the prisoner, and he at last paid me the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I com<lb/>plained on one occasion of having lost a scarf—I did not complain to him of the loss of money on any other occasion: I am quite sure of that—the scarf that I lost I saw round the prisoner's neck—he did not say, when I com<lb/>plained, that it was my own carelessness, and Fought to keep my things more carefully—he never complained to me of my leaving my keys about—there is a bank at Brentford; I should have had interest for my money there—it was in consequence of missing things that I got the Chubb's lock put on—I lost the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. last October twelve months—I kept the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in the drawers till the April after that—I was not in the habit of having many people at my house; I was in the habit of having a few friends now and then to supper—one of them, Mr. Coles, has stayed all night; he was the only one—a blacksmith was in the habit of mending locks at my place—he has been in my bedroom on several occasions to repair the looks—Mr. Hall's man, a carpenter of New Brentford, put on the Chubb's lock—he had not been there before, nor since, to my knowledge—some of my friends sometimes stayed late; some of them were occasionally in my bedroom—I sometimes came in late—I once left the door open, in consequence of an im<lb/>perfection in the door; it was negligence not forgetfulness—I opened the door with a latch key, and thought I had closed it, but did not—that only happened once—the prisoner mentioned it to me—I once left the latch key in the door, and a policeman found it there next morning—I carried the key of the Chubb's lock on a ring of keys—I did not leave them about my sitting-room—I always had them in my pocket until I left the prisoner's place—I had last seen the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note about six weeks before 6th October—I had during that six weeks occasion to go to the wardrobe daily—I saw the pocket-book, but did not look in it—I missed it about half-past 5 in the evening of the 6th, when I was going in to my tea—I took my meals with the prisoner—I did not take tea with him that night; I had dined there that day—it was on that day that I discovered the marks on the wardrobe—I had no difficulty in opening the wardrobe with my key; it opened as usual—I showed the marks to the policeman on Thursday—I saw the name of Cole on the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that same night—I then thought it was the prisoner's writing—I told Mr. Box that I thought it looked like the prisoner's writing—I did not mention it to any one that night—I showed it to Mr. Box that night, but did not say anything to him about the handwriting—next day, the 7th, I came to London, and went to the Bank, where the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was shown to me—I did not tell the Bank clerk that I knew the writing on it—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186311300005"/>
               <p>it was about 11 o'clock that I got to the Bank—I had previously been to Scotland-yard—the officer did not go with me to the Bank the first day—after going to the Bank, I went back to Scotland-yard, and communicated with Mr. Williamson—I then went home—I said nothing to the prisoner that night—on the 8th, I went again to the Bank with the officer—I can't say whether or not I then said to the Bank clerk that I knew the hand-writing on the note—Mr. Coles was at my lodging on Saturday, 26th September, about a quarter to 12—he was there for about a quarter of an hour—he came to borrow an umbrella, as it was a stormy, boisterous night—he had not been there during the day—if he or any of my friends called when I was not at home they would not go up stairs; if I am not in my lodgings, I am generally in my business, in the house adjoining—I had no persons to supper the week following the 26th September; I am quite sure of that—it was in March that the prisoner asked me to lend him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had on a previous occasion lent him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and once, 'I think, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he repaid me—it was not the prisoner who recommended me to get the Chubb lock—I have never said so—I am satisfied the handwriting is his; it is exactly like his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BEST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Both on the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is the difference of one being written with a quill pen and the other with a steel pen; it is the same character of handwriting—I am prepared to swear that, to the best of my belief, the writing on both notes is his—while Coles was with me, on 26th October, he did not go into my bedroom; he did not go up stairs—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that the prisoner repaid me, disappeared afterwards—after my friends have left my place, I have seen the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note safe—I never left the blacksmith alone in my room—the first person to whom I mentioned the writing being the prisoner's, was the detective at Scotland-yard—that was on 8th October.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Gibson and Co., Army contractors and saddlers, of New Coventry-street—I live at Brentford—I have known the prisoner some time, and have had dealings with him—he was always in the habit of addressing me as "Cole," and of writing to me so—I have acquired knowledge of his handwriting—I believe this "W. Jones, Staines" on the front of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to be his, and also the name of "Cole" on the back of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I have not the least doubt about it—I slept at Abraham's on 23d August—I have been there since, on two occasions, but I did not go into his bedroom.</p>

               <p>and am an unfortunate girl—I was in Ship-alley between 12 and 1 o'clock on the morning of 20th November—I heard the female prisoner tell two girls that if they would annoy Mrs. Elmhorst, she would treat them—about half-past 1, I saw a scuffle in the alley, and saw the prisoners there—Mrs. Roberts was holding Mrs. Elmhorst down by the hair of her head, and she then said to me, "Clara, Clara, they have my watch!"—I went out, and Mr. Roberts had hold of part of a chain, but the watch I did not see—a part of the chain was on Mrs. Elmhorst's neck—the prisoners heard her call out; they made no reply—I have since seen that chain in the policeman's possession.</p>

I am surgeon at the London Hospital—on the morning of 20th, Elmhorst, his wife, and Clara Herbert came to the hospital—Mr. Elmhorst had a slight outside wound on the forehead—the skin was cut—there was a little bleeding—Mrs. Elmhorst had a wound on the scalp, and a little wound on the hand—I could not say positively what the wound on the scalp was done with; a somewhat blunt instrument, I should think; an oyster-knife would do it—the wound on the hand might have been done with the same instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might it not have been done by an oyster-shell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might, or by a scraper, or anything sharp on the ground.</p>

I slept there on the Saturday night, and at Plaistow on the Sunday night. I came up by the Fenchurch-street Railway, and wanting something to eat, I went into the first prosecutor's shop and ordered a chop. I paid with a five-shilling piece; I did not know it was bad; it was part of the change for the sovereign, and I had a half-sovereign and a penny left. I went back to Newmarket and came up again in six weeks, with my brother, who is a jockey. He gave me a half-crown and a sixpence, and said he would send me some postage-stamps. I went into the Ship and gave the half-crown. He bounced it, and I said to myself, "Why, that seems like a bad one." I was utterly innocent that it was bad when I gave it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to the Justices at Guildhall—on 7th May last, two persons, named Benjamin Close and Benjamin Everett, were charged with felony before Mr. Alderman Humphrey—the charge against was, first, against Close for stealing 900 yards of elastic web, value 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and other goods, in the dwelling-house of Emanuel Lambert Lyons, and after<lb/>wards feloniously breaking out of the said dwelling-house; and also against Close and Everett for feloniously receiving the same goods, knowing them to have been stolen—on the examination of those two persons, before Mr. Alderman Humphrey, I saw the oath administered to the prisoner as a witness on the part of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you reading from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The original deposi<lb/>tion—I have my original minutes here; this is an exact copy—I do not remember seeing any charge-sheet—there is given only what is called a charge-sheet, containing the nature of the charge—there were several charges against Everett and against other persons—whether in this particular case of Lyons there was a charge-sheet, I am not able to say—that which I have read from the depositions was made out after the evidence was heard—the charge was first made by Inspector Bond, verbally—he charged one with stealing and the other with receiving the goods—I don't think Yates was present at the time Bond made the charge, I think he was in the adjoining room.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that Everett was given in custody by Mr. Commissioner Kerr? I do not know it of my own knowledge, it was said so—he was brought to the police-court in custody on 10th April—there is generally a charge-sheet, in almost all cases—my impression is that there was a charge-sheet when he was first brought, but that was in respect of another felony alleged to have been committed, not this of Lyons—the charge in respect of Lyons was not made until 7th May—there had been in<lb/>vestigations on various days between 10th April and 7th May—Lyons' case was heard on 7th May, after the hearing of other charges had been concluded—I don't think Lyons' case was on the charge-sheet; I do not remember</p>

               <p>seeing it; I cannot say one way or the other—my impression is that there was no charge-sheet—there were a very great variety of charges constantly, almost every day, not entered separately, but elicited in the course of the evidence.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Refreshing our memory by the depositions, will you state what the prisoner stated on his oath in reference to the charge against Close and Everett? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps I had better read from my own minutes—he said, "I have known the prisoner Close for eight or nine years; I have known Everett for fourteen or sixteen years; I have seen Close at my house, at 86, Wheeler-street, Spitalfields; in December last I lived at 35, Collingwood-street, Mile End; I have seen Close at that house; he came with a man called <hi rend="italic">Velveteen</hi>, from 9 to half-past 9 in the morning; that was in December, a little before I was taken into custody; they came in a horse and cart; some boots were in the cart, some uppers; I am not sure whether there were not two or three pieces of elastic; there were three or four bags of a darkish colour; Close said, 'Jack, have you got any stuff (money)?' I said, 'No, but I will find you a man that has got some;' the things were not taken out of the cart; I got into the cart with Close and <hi rend="italic">Velveteen</hi>; Close drove the cart, and I took them to Everett's, at No. 60, Sale-street; the bags were taken out of the cart and taken into Everett's house, into the front parlour; Everett was in the parlour with us; close said to him, 'Everett, I have got something to suit you;' Everett said, 'What are they?' Close said, 'Some boots and shoes, and some uppers;' I did not see the bags opened; Everett said, 'How much do you want for them?' Close said, '40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;' he said, 'Unsight and unseen, I will give you 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;' Close said, 'No, that won't do;' then Everett said he would give 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I saw the money paid in gold; it was paid to Close, and <hi rend="italic">Velveteen</hi>; I got 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from each of them; Close and <hi rend="italic">Velveteen</hi> said to Everett, in his parlour, that the things were from Lyons' <hi rend="italic">burst</hi>; I got to Everett's house a little before 10 o'clock in the morning; I then saw Mrs. Everett first; I think the servant of Everett's was in the passage, but I won't be sure. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined as a witness against Close in March; I did not say anything about taking them to Everett's, I was not asked; Close's brother was tried with me; Close's brother pleaded guilty; my wife did not go with me to Everett's on this occasion; I never gave information about this transaction until after Close had been tried and acquitted. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not believe my wife saw Close and <hi rend="italic">Velveteen</hi> when they came with the horse and cart; she was upstairs. <hi rend="italic">Further examined.</hi> I saw the mouth of one of the bags opened; there were boots in the bag, uppers and boots together; I can't say whether I saw the other bags opened; the bags appeared to contain what looked like boots"—The reference to Close's acquittal applied to a previous trial—the result was that the two parties were committed for trial.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I was convicted in June last, and am undergoing a sentence of penal servitude—I now come from Millbank Penitentiary—I am forty-two years of age—seventeen or eighteen years ago I was prosecuted for an offence, and was found guilty; I did not plead guilty—I had a mother living at that time—a sentence of nine months was passed upon me—when I came out of prison my mother assisted me in starting in a business in Nichol-street, Church-street, Shoreditch—I remained there eight years—the business was that of a grocer, cheesemonger, and broker—I also carried on business as a paper-stainer, but not then; I com<lb/>menced that seven years ago, and have carried it on simultaneously with the other business until I was taken into custody—I was married on 28th August, 1848. to my present wife—I was living with her up to the time of my being taken into custody—we kept a servant—I kept another shop in Nichol-street until February, fifteen months before I was taken—I have always been in the neighbourhood—during those seventeen or eighteen years I had saved some money—at the time I was taken into custody I had 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my possession—that was not all the result of my eighteen years' savings; when I started, my start was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I dare say; that was from my friends, my mother, and my sisters, and my brothers-in-law; they set me up in business and took the shop for me—my mother is still alive, but she is above eighty years of age, and infirm—I was at this Court when I was given into custody—I voluntarily came up—I had a subpoena—I was subpoenaed by Lewis Lambert, 311 K—that was on 7th April—I was not present when Yates was examined—I saw Lambert at the foot of the Court, in the street, and asked him what could be the meaning of leaving me the subpoena; I told him if he required me I should be over at the Beehive public-house—I remained there; he called me, and I came, conscious of my innocence—I came into the Court where the trial was; directly I put my foot in the Court I was taken into custody—I had been in the neighbourhood of the Court before the trial commenced: I came on purpose—I was taken into custody after Lambert called me, and said, "Make haste;" I don't know the hour of the day—I was taken to Fleet-street station for the night, and the following day to Guildhall—I was then put into the dock with a person whose name I now know to be Close—I had never seen that person before—the first case I heard of was a robbery from a person named Skelton, in Bow-road, but ultimately this case of Mr. Lyon was gone into—that was at the second or third hearing—it was imputed to me that I had received a quantity of property, and paid 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I never paid 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or any sum of money whatever to Close and the prisoner.</p>

               <p>on London-bridge—no purse was ever produced, and no prosecutor was ever produced; the man always declared that he never stole it—the case was tried here, in this or one of the other courts—William White was the man who was tried with me; he was convicted and had the same sentence as I had—I was then shopman to my mother; she kept a shop at 13, Vine-street, and at 13, Oak-street, Spitalfields, thirty-five years, in the grocery and cheesemonger line—after having served my imprisonment, I married and was started in business—the start was worth 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or more than that, I dare say—my mother furnished the shop and stocked it well, which came to a good deal of money, and my brothers-in-law and my sisters gave me a very handsome present in money; I should say altogether 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in fact, I got a little money from each of my sisters unknown to my brothers-in-law; my sister made me a present of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unknown to her husband—my brother-in-law bought me some goods and some cheese—I had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—my sister gave me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I got 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my brother-in-law, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my other sister and my other brother-in-law made me a present of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are the exact sums—my sister that gave me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. kept a cheese<lb/>monger's shop in Turk-street, Bethnal-green—she gave me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. soon after I was married; three months after I came out of prison—I went in business directly I was married—I know she gave me the money without the knowledge of her husband, because she told me not to say anything to John about it—he assisted her in the business—he had vans and carts; he merely attended to the cart business; he carted coals, and went down to the ships—he and his son attended to the horses, and my sister attended to the cheesemongery, with assistants that she had—I can't say what was the rent of my sister's house; it was not a small shop—the other sister that gave me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was named Wills—her husband was a shoefactor at 152, Brick-lane, Bethnal-green—it was not a small shop, a large one—she did not give me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without the knowledge of her husband; he knew of it—I knew that, because when she gave it to me at first she did not say anything about it, and afterwards when we were at a party it came out—she gave it at first without his knowledge—I can't say how long afterwards it was that she told him—he told me himself that he knew of it—he is not living now—he made the remark that he knew what Mary had given me—he did not tell me how he knew it—of course he could not have known it without she told him—at the time she gave it me she said, "Don't you say anything"—I did not think it extra<lb/>ordinary that she should have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to dispose of without her husband's knowledge—she paid it me all in gold, 100 sovereigns—the name of my other sister who gave me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was Arabella Collins—it was the husbands of those two sisters that gave me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—they did not give me the money after they had discovered that their wives had given me the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; it was before that: they thought that was all I did have—they gave me the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—my mother then stocked the shop for me—I had not been doing anything up to the time I was taken in custody, except assisting my mother—after I came out of prison of course I settled down and was married—I don't deny but my friends had given me money before; I dare say I had cost them some hundreds of pounds before my conviction—I wasted it, that is the truth, I am sorry to say so—it was after I had wasted it that I was taken up on the charge of stealing the purse—Wills was a shoe<lb/>factor—he is dead—I suppose somebody is carrying on his business—his wife is—I do not know that some of the shoes that were taken from Mr. Lyons' were found at Wills'—I heard that they attempted to make a charge of the sort—I do not know that such a thing took place—I heard that it</p>

I think you have lost your watch"—he said, "Have I?"—I immediately turned round to the prisoner, and said, "You have got his watch "—she said, "No, I have not"—I said, "You have"—I took hold of her right hand with my left—she said, "He is a friend of mine; you are mistaken"—she was about to do something with her left—I let go of her right hand and took hold of her left, and in struggling I put my hand on her bosom or right shoulder, and there felt the watch—I said, "You have got it now; give it up;" and my hand with hers took the watch from the upper part of her dress—I took her in charge, and took her to the station—she there said that the prosecutor had given it to her—I found 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on her.</p>

               <p>a box of lucifer-matches, half consumed, and everything in it very much dis<lb/>coloured—the wood of the chiffonnier was very much charred, not burnt through—it is rather a common mahogany chiffonnier—it is not of the best workmanship; the doors may not close very well—when the prisoner was taken in charge she at once said, "I have pawned the plate; I was obliged to do it"—she was in indigent circumstances—after she was committed I visited her in the House of Detention, and had some conversation with her—I told her I had called to ascertain what she thought of the serious crime she had committed now she had had time to reflect upon it—she said, "I did it, Miss Coleman, and I hope you will forgive me"—she confessed before I said anything about forgiveness—I believe she said, "I am guilty"—I said, "I know you are guilty of the plate; you confess it, but with regard to the fire?"—she said, "I did that; will you forgive me?"—I said, "I will, but it is a serious crime, and as you have confessed it, now tell me your motive"—that was after I had said I would forgive her—she said "At first I thought I would deny it for the first few days, but then I thought I could not stand up again in the police-court at Hammersmith, and deny it".</p>

I told her she must have done it—I did not accuse her of doing it wilfully—I said at least it was an act of carelessness, and I thought so at the time; I could not think it was design—I went to see her of the House of Detention as a friend I may say—I did not so describe myself to the officer—I said I was the prosecutrix—I went merely to satisfy myself that she had really confessed, that I might name it to the Magistrate the next time I appeared before him—I wanted to see if she was really sorry for the deed—she is about twenty-two years of age—she had occasionally been very ill, and subject to fits—she had only been in the house three weeks—she was very reserved—I knew very little of her—when I saw her in the House of Detention she was confined in a cell—she appeared in great distress of mind—I did not go into the cell—I spoke to her through a piece of perforated zinc—my object in going was to know whether the confession she had made to her father included the setting fire to the place—I might have said at the end that I would intercede for her—the prisoner had never seen the invalid lady while she was in the house—she knew that she was there.</p>

On 4th November, in the evening, I was in a public-house in Salisbury-street, Lisson-grove, and saw the prisoner there—I recognised him as a man whom I had seen convicted at this Court—I called him outside and asked him if his name was James Douglas—he said, "No"—I said, "Is your name James May?"—he said, "No"—I said, "I am an inspector of police; listen to what I am going to say. I was present at the Central Criminal Court Session in June, 1856, when you were tried in the name of James Douglas, convicted of burglary, and sentenced to fourteen years' transportation; and unless you show to me that you are on ticket of leave, or some papers that justify your being at large, I shall take you in custody"—he said, "I am not the man, you make a mistake"—I took him to the station, made him strip up his sleeves, and found some marks on his arms which I had seen previous to his being transported, some <hi rend="italic">tattooing</hi> on both arms—there were four letters when he was transported right across his arm, there is now only a smudge, a blue mark, and there were some additional marks—I was present in 1856 when he was stripped at the Paddington station, and I took him in custody—I know him independently of those marks, because I was present when he was transported before, for ten years—I have the certificate here—I searched him, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his breast pocket—it was not in a sheath.</p>

We took in prisoners at Portland, Portsmouth, and Plymouth, and could not get out of the channel. We put back, and were twelve weeks before we reached Freemantle. I was there fifteen months, and received my ticket of leave. I held it twenty-seven months, and got my conditional pardon. I was driving the mill for the last eight months. A gentleman asked me to take charge of fifty horses from Freemantle to Madras. I landed forty-nine out of the fifty, and one died on the passage. I stopped at Madras one month, and afterwards a captain gave me a passage to the Cape of Good Hope, having worked nine weeks on board. The captain could not make the Cape, and we ran for London, which is what brings me here now. I came in on the 5th August. I lost my pocket-book and papers, and all that I had when I came ashore in London.</p>

I am a butcher—on the morning of 20th October, at 7 o'clock, I was in College-street, Camden Town—I live at No. 41—I saw the constable stop both the prisoners—he caught hold of McKenzie, who was very violent, and I assisted him—Dunn threw an umbrella at the policeman, and said something; I cannot say what—I have no doubt that Dunn is the person.</p>

"Do you hear that"—he said, "That is my business, and not yours"—I then went to the last witness's shop in Drury-court, and he handed me these books which I now produce, and which he said he bought from the prisoner—I then went to Mrs. Miller's lodgings, 15, Clare-court, and on the top of the house, between the roof and the ceiling of the third floor, I found this looking-glass, these three pictures, and this tablecloth—it was a sort of lumber-room—I then went to the prisoner's lodgings and found the silk umbrella which has been identified by the prosecutrix.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 132, Blackfriars-road—on 13th November be<lb/>tween 1 and 2 in the morning, I was returning home through Farringdon-street; when I came near the railway-station, I passed the two prisoners briskly—after having passed them some few yards they overtook me and knocked me violently down from behind—I got up and confronted them face to face, and was levelled to the ground again by both of them—while on the ground Williams laid hold of my left hand and tried to get my ring off—I clutched my hand, and finding there was some difficulty in getting the ring off, she held my hand and bit me violently in the place—my three fingers were lacerated in getting the ring off—I then got up in a sitting posture, almost exhausted, but I was able faintly to ejaculate "Help!"—I said to Brown, "Oh, let me get up"—Brown said, "Oh yes, we will let you get up"—before that they were both kneeling over me—Brown then rose to her feet and gave me a violent kick on my face—I wore a mantle and a black shawl under it—the shawl was taken from under my mantle, it being only secured by a pin—then a desperate struggle ensued for my mantle; that was secured by a brooch, which gave way, and the mantle was also taken—I had four teeth loosened, and I fear I shall lose all four—I have not been able to masticate a bit of food since—I am now suffering from the injuries then received—I am very ill this morning—I did not sleep a wink last night—my nerves were so shaken—the prisoners were in the act of starting from me, when policeman 121 arrived—I said to him, "That woman (<hi rend="italic">Williams</hi>) has got my ring"—I did not lose sight of the prisoners—the policeman came up and took them—I am quite sure they are the women—there was no one else near the place at the time—I had lost my way, and it was a foggy night; I was en<lb/>deavouring to find my way.</p>

               <p>and enter it on the card, to return the card to the person paying, and to make an entry in his book corresponding with the entry on the card—Friday was the day he would come to me to account—he would produce this book and make out a slip which should correspond with the total entered in the book for that week—there is the page of the collecting-book referred to in the first column, so that from this you can tell what amount he has attri<lb/>buted to each column in the collecting-book—it was his duty to give me this slip, to produce the book, and then to account to me for the total of the weekly collection—he would pay over the money to me in accordance with those accounts—his signature is at the bottom—on Mrs. Fogarty's sick-fund card on 22d June the prisoner has entered in his book fivepence instead of sixpence—the card is sixpence—nothing is entered on the burial-fund on that day; that makes sevenpence in the burial, and one penny in the sick, defi<lb/>cient—on Garris' on 22d June there is fivepence entered instead of sixpence—to Cockwell on the same day fivepence is entered in the book and tenpence on the card—there is nothing entered in his book on 15th June, the week before—on 27th July there is nothing entered on Fogarty's burial-fund in the book—on the card is twopence and five single pennies—on 3d August nothing is entered on the burial account; by the card, sevenpence was received—on 27th July on Martin's sick-fund fivepence is entered and on Cockwell's five-pence—nothing is entered in either case for the previous week, the 20th—by the card tenpence was received for each of them—there is nothing entered to Gale's sick-fund on 3d August—fivepence is on the card—nothing to Dredge, fivepence on the card—fivepence entered to Fogarty, sixpence on the card—there is nothing entered to Gale's burial-fund, on the card seven pence—Dodge's burial on the same date nothing, fivepence on the card—on Blight's there is nothing entered on the burial-fund—there are ticks made to indicate nothing as in all the others I have spoken of—there is eightpence on Blight's burial-card—on Kemper's there is nothing entered—fourpence was paid for two weeks, nothing in entered for either week—nothing entered to Pearce, fourpence on the card; that makes 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. entered short on that day—I have the slips for 22d June, 27th July, and 3d August—I have compared those slips with the entries in the book, and they correspond—all the deficiencies left out in the book are left out in the slips, the slips and the book tally—he accounted on those days from the slip—he did not at any time account to me for any of the sums we have been speaking of, or pay them over to me.</p>

Mr. Snowden by going to the church occasionally—I was not aware, until I was at the Police-court, that he had obtained a situation for a grandson of mine; I know it now—the name of Blackburn is on my house—I let the house for a twelvemonth to George Blackburn for the purpose of getting my poor afflicted wife out of it—I wanted to get her into a private place, by the advice of my medical man—Blackburn did not occupy it for a twelvemonth—I have not seen him for this three weeks—I have taken possession of it myself—I never gave up possession particularly, I reserved the right to myself to enter when I pleased—my wife is living with me now, not in the same house—she lived there with me about two months ago—she was living in the same house with me in June—she in paralyzed on one side, and a little affected in the brain, what the medical men call softening of the brain—she was very violent at times, and the medical men recommended that she should be removed from the house three months before I removed her—she refused to go, and I entered into this arrangement with Blackburn to pretend to my wife that I had got rid of the house—that was to get her to remove to a private house, and that was why the name of Blackburn was over the door—she used to disturb my customers—there is no word of truth in the suggestion that I ever took even any liberties with Augusta Tibble—on my solemn oath, I have never had any connexion with her—I first became acquainted with her when my wife engaged her as servant—she came up from the country somewhere between West Drayton and Slough about two years ago—she was an orphan, and I and my wife have acted as parents towards her; we promised her mother to do so when we took her.</p>

This point, however, was worthy of consideration, viz., that it appeared doubtful upon the evidence whether or no the name of "Dodd" was given at the font; he was prepared to rule that even if that were so, it would not prevent the prisoner being liable, because she was not charged with anything that occurred in the act of' christening, but with wilfully and knowingly permitting a false entry to be made in the register; now the register went on to describe the father, his residence and occupation, and the question would be whether, if in any of those matters the prisoner gave false information, that—would be the causing of a false entry to be made in any matter relating to the baptism.</hi>

               <p>my niece, and she said, "If Aunt Jemima comes, I know she will murder me," and that was the first I heard of the bother between them—that was a fortnight before he made this charge—at the same time I said to my niece, I hoped there would be no bother while I was there, for I was not well, and had had a sore throat for months—she said, "Aunt, my throat has been dreadful, and Mr. Dodd took me to Margate to see if the change would do me good"—I said, "Have you been to the sea-side?"—she said, "Yes, and as so ill while we were there, when the waitress asked if we should want the bed again that night, Mr. Dodd said, 'No,' he must make the best of his way home to get some help, for he was afraid his <hi rend="italic">missis</hi> would be choked.</p>

I keep the railway tavern, 2, London-street, Fenchurch-street—the prisoner was in my service from 10th October till 5th November—when he applied for the situation I asked him if he was married—he said he was unmarried—for some reason I communicated with the police, and acting under their advice I marked some money on Tuesday and Wednesday,</p>

I am foreman to Mr. Thomas Wilkinson, wharfinger—he owns a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Express</hi>—the prisoner was employed on that ship as ship-worker, or labourer, but not by Mr. Wilkinson—the cargo was mostly India-rubber, and there were some Brazil-nuts—the prisoner was working on board, on Thursday, 12th November—in consequence of something I saw, I followed him—on three occasions I missed him, but on the fourth, I followed him to a marine-store dealer's, of the name of Mrs. Daley, at St. Mary-at-Hill—I watched him into the shop, and then ran to the top of the street, and fetched a constable—as we came back, I saw the prisoner coming out of the shop—he went across the road, and spoke to another man—I then went into the shop, and saw a woman with a piece of rubber in the scale, weighing it—it was similar rubber to that which I had</p>

"O. G." when I took the prisoner back to Mrs. Daley's shop—"O.

On 24th November I took the prisoner in custody at Coupar Angus, on a warrant—I told him that I was a police-officer, and that I had come from London for the purpose of apprehending him—he began making a statement—I told him that he had no occasion to make any statement at all, but what he did say I should have to repeat in evidence against him before the Magistrate—he made a statement—I could not understand it very well; it was rather broad Scotch—I asked a gentleman to take down the statement in writing, and he did so—I read the statement over to the prisoner, and then asked him to read it himself, and sign it if he liked—He did sign it—I brought the prisoner up to London with Culross—I heard a noise in the night while we were in the train—I distinctly heard Stewart say, "If you do, you will ruin me," and Culross indignantly refused to do as he wished—(<hi rend="italic">Statement read</hi>: "David Fairnie, shoemaker and dairyman, Blengowrie, came to me some time ago, and asked me to take two cows belonging to him, and send them to the London market; he asked me to do so as a great favour, and I consented out of charity to him, as he had to my knowledge previously lost some cattle. My arrangement with Fairnie was, that I should slaughter the cows, forward the carcases to London in my own name, and hand over to him the proceeds of sale. I took delivery of the cattle at Rosemount Station between 10 and 11 o'clock at night. I drove them to Coupar Angus, and James Culross, butcher, slaughtered and dressed them next day; and the day following that, I quartered the carcases, packed them up, and conveyed them to the railway station at Coupar Angus where I consigned them to George Lee and Co., meat-salesmen, Newgate-market. The two carcasses were cut down into four quarters each, and packed in cloths. Four quarters of these beasts were seized in London, and condemned. I received the condemnation, which I afterwards handed to Fairnie, and which is still in his possession. I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., made up thus:—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from London; 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the two hides, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the tallow.

If this alteration was made by the prisoner in order to obtain an appointment which he could not otherwise obtain at that time, it was to all intents a fraud.</hi>

I am a feather-manufacturer, carrying on business at No. 80, Little Britain—the lad at the bar has been in my employment about eighteen months—I don't know his age exactly; I never inquired—about 10th November, the officer Moleyneux brought to me that box of feathers marked D—I have since examined those feathers—there are two kinds of feathers in that box, vulture feathers and ostrich feathers—these are small ostrich feathers, and those are vulture feathers—they are all dyed—I identify both, the vulture and the ostrich feathers, as my property—I</p>

I am the wife of John Bragg, of No. 1, Porchester-Gardens, Bays water—the prisoner, John Glynn, was in our service as foot-man, and Elizabeth Glynn as cook—on their applying for the situation in the beginning of October, they referred me to Mrs. Wheeler, 55, Cambridge-place—they told me they had been in the house for eighteen months with a Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell, who were gone to Italy with an invalid daughter—they were both together—I went to 35, Cambridge-place, saw Wheeler there, and said, "Mrs. Wheeler I have come about two servants who, I understand, have lived at this house-eighteen months with a Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell"—she told me they had done so, and that Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell had gone to Italy with an invalid daughter—I said, "Then you must know the servants as well as Mrs. Mitchell herself would"—she said, yes, she did, and better—she spoke very highly of them, gave them both a very good character, and from that character I took them—they entered my service on 14th October in the evening—the next day, being very wet, I put my drawers all tidy—that was the 15th—the articles that I subsequently missed were then safe—I knew exactly what I had in my drawers—the articles mentioned in the indictment were there—I mean such articles as would be kept in drawers; not the spirits, and wine, and so on—on Thursday, 22d October, I missed a light silk dress, trimmed with black velvet—I mentioned it that evening at the dinner-table—the male prisoner was present—I went to a con<lb/>cert that evening with my cousin, Mr. Wilson, a clergyman, who was stopping in the house, and my little girl—Mr. Bragg is an invalid, he very seldom goes out now—I put my keys down by him on the table in the drawing-room—I always leave them with him when I go out—he is in the habit of sleeping in the evening in his chair—he is very drowsy—on my return I found my keys on the mantel piece—when I went down in the kitchen I mentioned the loss of my dress—the woman told me that the man was ill, and that he must leave—on the following day, the 23d, I went out for a drive directly after lunch, between 2 and 3—on my return I found the male prisoner had left, and taken his luggage—I made a search, but not till after I had appeared in Court against him the first time—on Saturday, 24th October, I went to my jewel-drawer—that was the day I first appeared in Court against him—I missed the jewels which the officer Pink afterwards produced to me, and in the course of the week I missed a great quantity of wine and spirits, and several other things—at the second hearing I heard Mrs. Wheeler give evidence against Glynn—that was the Thursday following the first hearing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Thomas Parker of Blackheath—I know the two Glynns—I first saw them a few days before 15th July, this year—I first saw the male prisoner—he applied for a situation as in door servant, and came down the following morning to be engaged—I afterwards engaged the female prisoner, who now goes by the name of Glynn, as house<lb/>maid, upon his recommendation—she then went by the name of Cottrell, I think—she did not go by his name as his wife—he said that she had lived for a year and nine months with Mr. Stewart—they entered my service on 15th July, and they left on 29th September.</p>

The contents she knew nothing of; and the second I gave her to take to Miss Cox, and she didn't know what was in it, or anything at all about it. She didn't know whether it was clothes Mr. Bragg had given me. I did not return them, which I did not know the evil of until now, or I should have given it to Mrs. Bragg. A week after Mrs. Bragg talked to me about it being stolen, and I went to Mrs. Wheeler's to get the property back, but I could not get it, or I should have done so. I never took the property from the drawers, or any other portion of her house. In other places where I have been living, had I had a mind to be a thief, I could have taken away the plate, but I have given up my place, to the satisfaction of Mr. Bragg and Mrs. Bragg. There was nothing even to show fraud against me. My wife had not the least knowledge of anything that was going on."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 69, Arundel-square, Islington—about 3 o'clock in the morning on 29th October, my wife awoke me—I got up, and spoke to a policeman out of the window—in consequence of what my wife said, I let him in by the back door—I searched the house, and in the drawing-room I found the prisoner lying behind the couch—the only remark he made was, "Don't disarrange me"—I saw how he had got into the house—my house is next to an iron church, and he had got over the wall across the garden on to a dust-bin, from thereon to the cistern to the staircase window; he then broke a square of glass, and had to put his arm through fourteen inches to undo the fastening of the window; he had then lifted the window up, and gently put it down—at that time my wife awoke me, and I heard footsteps go down stairs—all was quite safe the night before when I went to bed.</p>

Q.</hi> How large was the pane of glass that was broken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twelve inches by four—it made a noise that awoke my wife—nothing was removed but a cushion from the couch to the ottoman to enable you to step over the couch to lay behind it—you had not opened a door, you had not time—you were about half an hour from the time you began to get in till you were taken by the policeman—I heard your footsteps, and you must have heard mine, because I walked heavily on the floor above you—you could not have made your escape by the front door very well, because I was coming down stairs—I don't think you could have got away, as the police-sergeant was in front of the house, nor have got out of the house, you would have had bolts and locks to undo—I don't know that you had attempted it—my son sleeps on the same floor—you looked very dirty—I should think you were sober; a drunken man could not have got in as you did—I thought at the Police-court that you did not know what you were doing, because you had such a dirty appearance, as if you had been drinking.</p>

I live at Commercial-place—on Sunday morn<lb/>ing, 15th November, about 2 o'clock, I found the prosecutor at the police-station, bleeding from an incised wound on the left side of the neck—the flow of blood had been copious—the wound commenced at the upper part of the lobe of the left ear, passing downwards just over the jugular vein, which would have been divided by a little more force—it would not then have fetal, but he would have lost an enormous quantity of blood—they told me he had fainted—he had been drinking—it was a clean-cut wound, about two inches and a half long, such as a milk-jug would make if it was smashed with the blow—if the blow fractured the jug, the part that remained in the hand might produce the cut—it might also have been done with a knife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I met him and took him home—I asked to pay the landlady two shillings for the bed—he said he had no money, and gave me his coat to keep till next day, when he said he would get some—it was very old, and I should not like to take it—I took it up to the landlady, who told me to let him go. He cruelly ill-used me, and gave me no money, and I own I took the jug, and struck him. He scratched my face, of which I have the marks now, and hit me in the nose and mouth. I struck him in my own defence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 52, Dorset-street, Fleet-street—my late husband was a livery-stable keeper in Wilderness-lane, Whitefriars—ho died on 12th August—the prisoner was his ostler, and I made him foreman after my husband's death—my husband never kept books, but I have a slight book—in October, Mr. Redfern owed me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the balance of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was the original debt—Mr. Redfern had taken his horse away, and the prisoner was aware that I intended applying for the balance—he asked me to let him go for it, as Mr. Redfern had promised to give him something for having taken his horse from the Temple to Clapham—he said, "If you go he will not give you anything, but if I go and he does not give me anything, I shall ask him"—I said, "Very well, George, you can go," and gave him a letter to deliver—this was on Friday, and he was to go on Saturday—on 2d November, he came to me and said that Mr. Redfern said that I had made a mistake, and charged him one week too much—I said, "If that is the case, Mr. Redfern ought to have deducted 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more"—he then gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I held it out like this, and he said, "That is better than nothing"—I said, "Did the gentleman give you anything for your<lb/>self?"—he said, "Yes, ma'am, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "Well, that is better than nothing, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is worth going for"—he said, "Mr. Redfern is ill; his physicians say he cannot live three days—his mouth is all black with the black thrash"—I said that I was very sorry to hear of it, and gave the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the omnibus—I owed the prisoner nothing, but about a week or a fort-night afterwards, finding that he had been selling some clothes belonging to me, I went to Mr. Redfern—I never saw this cheque—I believe this writing on it is the prisoner's, he has slightly tried to imitate mine in some of the letters.</p>

I am a grocer, of 5, Ogilby-street—I was standing at my door, and saw the prisoner go behind his father and hit him with a stone at the back of the head—he would have fallen, but I ran and caught hold of him—his head was severely cut; it bled very much—I picked up the stone and gave it to the policeman—this is it.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I came from Ireland, I caught cold in the steamer. I went to my father, and was very bad in the barracks for about a fortnight. My father was not willing to keep me; he thought it was laziness, but I was not able to work. He was threatening every day that he would throw me down the stairs. He told me to go about my business; there was no accommodation there for me, and that Woolwich and England were wide enough for me. I was sitting by the fire, and he said, "Would it not be better for you to go out and work than be here? get up, you will have to walk out of <hi rend="italic">this.</hi>" He took hold of me, put me outside the door, and gave me four or five blows with a cane. He thought to hit me in the belly, only the women brought me into a room and would not let me out that night, as I had no place to go to, unless I walked in the streets. The next morning, he told my mother to go and sell my shirt and trousers, and to go to London and get into some workhouse there, and I should be sent home from there, and I took my shirt and trousers and sold them for fifteen pence. I was out in the streets two nights. I spent the money, and went into the barracks that night again. My father and mother had gone out to the lodgings in the town, and one of the soldiers came with me, who was in the same room, and brought me down to the guard-room, and got</p>

               <p>leave of the sergeant for me to stay in the guard-room till morning. I stopped there, and went up to the barracks, and they gave me breakfast. The sergeant-major told me to go to the Magistrate, and my father should keep me in till I was eighteen, and able to work. I afterwards went about the streets till I went to the relieving officer, and if it had not been for him, I should be dead; he took me in, and said that he would send me home. He gave me a loaf of bread now and then, and tea and sugar for four nights. He told me to go to my father and tell him to go down, and he would not ask him to pay any of the money; but my father would not. He said, "I do not want to do anything only to perish him about the streets, that he may die soon;" and he said that if I went up to that room any more, he would give me twelve months' hard labour. I went up last Sunday to the room, and my father and mother were within. I had come from Greenwich in the morning. It was very cold, and I opened the door and asked them to let me in to warm my hands. My mother said, "Come in;" my father said nothing, he was at his breakfast. In about ten minutes, my father took a shirt which was on the window, <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it in my mother's face, and said, "I told you before not to have the <hi rend="italic">light son</hi> coming into this room at all." He put his coat on to go to Church-parade, and said to my mother, "If you lay a finger on one <hi rend="italic">halfpeth</hi> of victuals that is here; I have everything marked; you may go about the streets with him, as I will be knocking you down." The women in the barracks said that he had said he would give me a dose, and that dose would be poison for me, finish me altogether, and put me out of the way. He was standing at the corner of Oakley-street; I had a stone; I had no intention of cutting him or hurting him, only to frighten him, as I know that it is said by the law of God that we ought to obey our father and mother.</p>
