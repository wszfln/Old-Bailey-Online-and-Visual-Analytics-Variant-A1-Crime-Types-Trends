             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. - I keep a hosier's shop, No. 81, East-Smithfield: On the 20th of June, my son brought me a five pounds note; I called in at Mr. Roebuck's, and shewed him the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the note? - A. I gave the note to Mr. Roebuck, and then came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you gave it to Mr. Roebuck, did you notice what the note was? - A. It was for five pounds, drawn from Bristol, directed to the Cashiers of the Bank of England; I observed the number particularly, it was No. 800; it is made payable to Robert Wilkinson, or bearer.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home, did you see the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; that is the man; I asked him where he had the note; I told him I had been informed there were a number of bad notes of that description; he told me had taken it on board a ship he believed, of a mate; I asked him what goods he wanted, he told me, two pair of stockings for himself, and two or three pair for a woman; I told him there was a friend of mine gone to the Bank, to know if it was a good one, and when he returned, I would give him the difference in change; he said, no, he could not wait, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200006"/>must be going, and seemed very much agitated; I said, wait a few minutes, my friend will return back presently, and we may as well settle it at once, and take your change with you; he said,no, he must be moving, he could not stop; I then asked him if he wanted any other goods; he said, no; says I, do you went a silk handkerchief; says he, I want one, but I do not see a good one; I desired my daughter to pull one down that was a good one, he liked the handkerchief, and put the stockings in the handkerchief, and tied them up, and ran out of the shop quite in haste; he would not give me leave to tie them up in a paper; I forgot to state one part of the conversation; I asked him what his name was, when he was in such a hurry, and would not stop till Mr. Rocbuck returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Roebuck was the friend that you sent to the Bank? - A. Yes; I asked him his name, and he said, Richard Barber; I asked him what ship he belonged to; he said, the Mary, of Yarmouth; I asked him when he would return for his change; he desired me to be sure to have it ready, and he would come at six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where the Mary, of Yarmouth, then lay? - A. Yes; he said she lay at Wapping old stairs; after Mr. Roebuck returned, I went down to Wapping Old Stairs, and enquired amongst the watermen, but could not hear of any such ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner after that, till you saw him before my Lord-Mayor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that be after he was at your shop? - A. It might be about three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask him what ship he belonged to? - A. He was in a sailor's habit, I thought he was a mate, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q.When Mr. Roebuck returned, did he return you the same note? - A. Yes; out of his hand into mine, in the street.</p>

Yes; I examined as many of the parish books as I could get at in the short time I was there, and there was no such name; I enquired at the office of the Town-Clerk, where the rates are returned; I enenquired at some of the inns, and I enquired at the Post-Office, where I saw all the letter-carriers together, but could not hear of any such name; in one of the parish books there appeared to be a person of the name of Betty Phillips, whether her name was Betty or Elizabeth, they could not tell; the best account I could get of her was, that she kept an old clothes shop; I went to the street where she lived, but could not find any such person there; I enquired at two or three other clothes shops, but could not hear of her; I also examined the Directory, but found no such name there.</p>

               <p>Q. You were in liquor you know? - A. I am very clear of that.</p>

               <p>Q.Where was the woman? - A. She was gone; when I came down, I enquired of the person, who I took to be the master of the house, and found the was gone; I told him what I had lost, and left the house; I know nothing more than that, till I understood she was taken up, this was of the Friday, and she was taken up on the Wednesday following, when my watch was produced, and one of my pocket handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that woman, and tell me if you can swear that is the woman you picked up? - A. No; I cannot swear to her.</p>

             sworn. - I am constable of St. Martin's in the Fields: On the 5th of August last, I was sent for by Mrs. Clark, the last witness, to take charge of a woman that had stole a watch; I went to take her backwards, and I conceived that she was hiding something between her legs, upon which account I called for a woman of the name of Mrs. Brown, to come and search her, she searched her, and said she could find nothing; there was a parcel of girls in the front parlour, and I believe a man or two might be there at the same time; there were three or four girls.</p>
               <p>Q. In the front parlour? - A. Yes; I took her up stairs, and stripped her, I could find nothing at all about her, and I told her, you have had the watch, and the duplicate is somewhere about you; Mrs. Brown said she had better own where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not tell us what she owned? - A. I went down stairs, and found a huswife with eighteen duplicates in it, lying behind the door, I think the must have kicked it from where she stood; amongst them was a duplicate of a watch, pawned at Battersea; then I went to Bow-street, and she was committed upon Mrs. Clark's evidence: I went to Battersea, and found the watch there by the duplicate.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that your duplicate that the constable has got? - A. Yes, it is; she said her husband and she had come from Portsmouth that day, and they did not like to pawn the watch till they got as near home as they could, and they made all the shifts they could upon that account.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure as to the person of the prisoner? - A. I am positive; on the Wednesday morning, receiving a hand-bill from Bow-street, I found that we had the watch; I went to Bow-street, and gave information of it; the prisoner told me he lodged at No.8, Belton-street, Long-acre; in consequence of which, I informed Croker, who went with me, and there we took him, but not at that number, there being no such number in the street, we took him at the Three-tons, in Belton-street.</p>
               <p>Q.What number was the Three-tons? - A. I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the value of it? - A. Thirty shillings; they went away then, and before they had got out at the door, I missed this piece of print; I ran after them directly, and brought the prisoner back; I found this piece of print concealed in her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. See if that is your master's property? - A. Yes; here is the length of it in my own writing.</p>

             sworn - Q.What are you? - A. A gentleman, an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at the time this business happened? - A. In the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Q. A prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Williams a prisoner there likewise? - A. Yes; the origin of this business was a quarrel at the game of rackets, about half after six o'clock in the evening, there were four people at play, the prisoner was one; the deceased interfered in consequence of some words passing; the deceased called the prisoner a rascal and a swindling thief, and said every thing that could exasperate a man; he held his list in his face, and kept on in that kind of way for some minutes; he came up to him and trod upon his toes, and the prisoner said, why do you tread upon my toes; he kept on that abusive language, and the prisoner struck him with his fist somewhere about the face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether his hand was open or shut? - A. Not particularly, but I think it was shut; there were one or two blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased return the blow? - A. I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us whether he did or did not? - A. I think he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How may blows did this man strike? - A. Two or three; it was all done in a moment, and to all appearance it was a blow that would not hurt a child of ten years old.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he fall? - A. No, he did not; nor he did not slagger; he did not appear to be affected by it in the least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Was there a wall near that he might fall against? - A. They were close to a wall, but I did not see him fall against it; he did not fall at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It did not last many minutes? - A. No; it did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether this man struck him at all, or only held his fist in his face? - A. I did not see him strike him at all; he held his fist very near his face in a very menacing manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure there were not more than three blows? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fidding. Q. After having made use of all that exasperating language, and putting himself in that insulting posture, you heard him say to the unhappy man, what do you tread upon my toes for, and then he struck him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Williams had been playing in a party at rackets? - A. Yes; and the deceased began with a volley of abuse, and he said he had no business with it, for the prisoner had given it up, rather than have any words.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200013"/>Q. It did not strike you at the time, that any ill consequence would follow, but the man was able to walk away? - A. Yes; I did not think it would have hurt a child.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before it was communicated to Williams that this man was ill? - A. A quarter of an hour, or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was communicated to him, he shewed every mark of sorrow? - A. Yes, perfectly so; he sent his wife out for a surgeon, and made use of every exertion he possibly could.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a man was he? - A.A perfectly quiet man.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw any tendency to a quarrelsome disposition? - A. No; the deceased took the part of another man, there were some few words; Mr. Williams said he would give it up, and leave off play.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS DAVIS sworn. - On the 8th of August, about half past six in the evening, several people collected together in the racket-ground, and there seemed to be a dispute, or quarrel, at which time I was going across the ground, and saw Williams come away from them; I went up to him, and asked him what was the matter, he told me, he believed it was a quarrel between the racket master and some of them, and that he had come away, that he had nothing at all to do with it; upon this the deceased came up to him, and began to abuse him, and called him a d-d rascal, and said it was a d-d shame, that they had been playing so long, preventing other people from play; Williams desired that he would go about his business, that he thought he had nothing at all to do with it, as the ground did not belong to him, and therefore wished he would let him alone at this time; I thought the deceased was rather intruding, and begged he would not use bad language, but go along about his business, as he had nothing to do with what we were talking about; and then Williams said, the two or three last games, the racket master had given them no white balls, and if he had thrown one over, he would not have paid for it; some people came up, and took off Williams's attention from him, but he kept on abusing him, and called him a d-d swindling thief; this irritated Williams, and he turned round from the other person, and then he came up with his list clinched in Williams's face; Williams said, if I was to strike you, I suppose you would take me down to the gate; upon this Payne answered and said, that he would; at this time, another person interfered, and exclaimed against his making use of their names, upon which Williams retired to some little distance, and stood up against the wall; as soon as this person had done speaking to him, Payne went up to the wall to Williams, and there he held his list in his face, with a volley of abuse and bad language; Williams stood against the wall with his arms folded at that time, there was a sort of a jostle, they pushed each other, upon which Williams said, d-n you, why do you tread upon my toes, and instantly the blow was struck, it was all done in half a minute; Payne staid there three or four minutes and then walked away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q.Williams actually retired from his abuse to the wall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then Payne followed him up again? - A. Yes; after another person had interfered.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the jostle appear to you to come from Williams, or from Payne? - A. It was done so instantaneously that I cannot say, but I rather think it was from Payne, but the whole of it was not half a minute.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you happen to see where the blow was struck? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He did not fall, or stagger? - A. No; I did not conceive any ill consequence could have followed, he was standing close to the wall.</p>
               <p>RICE BAYNARD sworn. - I am a surgeon in Newgate-street; I was sent for on the 8th of August, between eight and nine in the evening; I found the deceased in a stupid state, he could not speak, he had vomited much blood, there were several physicians there; I asked if any thing had been done for him, they said, they had bled him freely; I ordered some medicines which could not be got down him; and the next morning they sent me word he was dead; I opened the head on the ninth, and found a great quantity of extravasated blood between the dura mater and the cranium, to the amount of sixteen ounces, which pressing upon the brain, was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. What occasioned that extravasated blood, you cannot say? - A. It must be from the blow he had received.</p>
               <p>Q. To what cause did you attribute that blood that had been vomited? - A. It might come from ruptured vessels of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Without being informed that any blow had been given, did that simple circumstance indicate that it proceeded from a blow? - A. The blow was very evident upon the temple, and an instammation formed there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I take it for granted, there must have been some injury done upon the outside of the head? - A. Yes, upon the temple.</p>

               <p>Q. How far were you off when you heard the cry? - A. Not a great distance; as I was coming along the grass I heard the screams of this girl.</p>
               <p>Q. What man was it? - A. The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive as to the man? - A. I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it like the man? - A. Yes; I have reason to believe it is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was down, how do you mean? - A. He was by the side of her.</p>
               <p>Q. How by the side of her? - A. To the best of my recollection he was upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition were his small clothes? - A.When I spoke to him he got up, and buttoned his small clothes; to appearance they were down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - A. I called him rascal, and asked him what he was about with the child, or something to that effect; he said, what was it to me, the girl belonged to him, he knew the girl; upon that he got up, and the girl was listed up by her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Who listed her up? - A.Sarah Scott; I asked the girl if she knew any thing of him; she seemed to hesitate, and said, she knew nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the hesitation? - A. She said, no, Sir, I do not know any thing of him; the man then ran away, and I followed him; there were several people passing and re-passing at that time towards Hyde-park.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people passing and repassing where the child was crying? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Where the girl was down there were no people? - A. No People at all; I took him by the collar, and brought him back to the girl; and then, by the persuasions of the girl that was with me, I took him to the girl's mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. And you took the girl there too, I suppose? - A. Yes; there I left him, and a constable was sent for, who examined his linen; his name is Bligh.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the surgeon present? - A. No; not till we went to Bow-street, next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his linen examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any particular mark? - A. No, not any in the least.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I understand you, that you were not quite certain whether he was by the side of her, or at the top of her? - A. I have every reason to believe, to the best of my recollection, that he was upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked what he was about with that girl, he said he knew her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not then say that she did not know him? - A. No; there was no answer made from her till after.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined this man, and no sort of mark was found whatever? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it a clean shirt? - A. Yes; it appeared as if it was put on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you suppose he had worn it before you examined it; did it appear quite a clean shirt? - A. I should suppose it must have been put on that day, or the day before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. And it was perfectely pure, free from stain? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose, if a man had been connected with a girl for the first time, having a gonorthea upon him, it would not have left a stain? - A. I should think so.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He did not say any thing at all; I asked him if he was not a rascal for being connected with such a child; I told him there were plenty of unfortunate women that he might take his pleasure with, better than a child; he immediately got up, and I laid hold of him; I collared the man, and he told me that the girl belonged to him, not to me, and then he ran away; Mr. Smith pursued after him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine his linen? - A. Yes, I did, after I had taken him to prison; as we went up stairs, I had a light, and pulled his shirt out of his breeches; I desired Smith to come upto see it, I thought it was necessary; it did not appear to be stained.</p>
               <p>How long did the shirt appear to have been worn? - A. Not more than a day or two at most.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you observe? - A. Upon taking up her clothes, I observed great marks of violence; she appeared to have been much tumbled upon the grass, and her clothes were coloured with the grass.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks did you observe upon her body? - A. There seemed to have been a connection; to all appearance he had entered the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if the body had been entered for the first time? - A. There was no lasceration, no blood; but there appeared to be human semen upon the private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hymen broke? - A. There was no appearance of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if she had been entered for the first time? - A. To all appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. How should there be that appearance if there was no lasceration, and no blood? - A. From the smallness of the parts, and the appearance of violence, I could not suppose she had been a common girl; I cannot say, positively, that it was the first time; it is my opinion, that he had endeavoured to enter, and I observed the semen.</p>
               <p>Q. Without supposing her to be a common girl, do you think she might have had any man with her before? - A. No, not in my judgment.</p>

             sworn. - I am a surgeon; The first time I attended the girl, was on the 10th of August, I was called to her assistance by Bligh, the constable; I examined her, I found a considerable swelling, a great deal of inflammation, and a considerable discharge, arising, apparently, from an intercourse with some male person or other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any appearance of lasce<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200018"/>ration? - A. The parts were so diseased that I could not tell; I cannot pretend to say that the disease was infectious; the same appearances might have arisen from violence, independent of infection.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not undertake to say it was the venereal disease? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have attended the child; has she now a venereal disease? - A. No; I do not call it a venereal disease; my brother has attended her as well as myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You can now say, for a certainty, whether it is or not? - A. I am inclined to think it is, but I cannot positively say; the same appearances may have been produced by violence, merely; I treated it as venereal, in order to guard her constitution against any future attack.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if those appearances might proceed from violence, merely, could you judge from the parts whether there had been an entry into those parts? - A. I could not; the swelling was so considerable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. If you had not heard any thing about a rape you would have thought it was venereal, should you not? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe upon the labia pudorus any ulcer? - A. No; a general inflammation.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no doubt but recent inflammation will cause considerable swelling, and change the appearance? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it more likely that a venereal complaint would have abated from your treatment of her, or a complaint originating merely in violence? - A. The complaint that originated in violence, provided she was kept pretty quiet.</p>

             sworn. - I am the girl's mistress: She was brought home to me upon the 19th of July; I examined her about ten o'clock at night, there was a great deal of human nature upon her, and by the appearance of that, I thought she had been violently used.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any care of her that night? - A. I got her some brandy, and she used some pomatum; she got up at six o'clock in the morning, and I took her with me to the Park, my business wholly depended there; she staid with me there till between ten and eleven, and then I took her to Bow-street; she was never out of my sight all that time, not yet out of the hearing of my voice.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the girl behave before that? - A. She was a modest good girl, as ever came into a house; she used to put her cows in, and was almost always in my sight; she never had any followers, nor kept any company, I used generally to go with her to see her put her cows up.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not go to ale-house then? - A. None at all; I have had her ever since this happened always under my care, and very rarely out of my sight; the farthest she has been out of my sight has been to Mr. Drummond's the bankers to get some water for my breakfast, I serve them with milk, it is only round the corner of Spring-gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. And, when she has gone there, has she never staid an improper time? - A. No, she has not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to send for any body to attend her? - A. She walked lame, and was sick at her stomach, and I thought she might have overwalked herself, till I examined her, and found a swelling, and then I went to Mr. Bligh, and he got a gentleman to come; before this happened, she was as clean and fair a girl as ever sun shone upon, for I had examined her about the course of human nature, and she did not know what I meant, she was then perfectly clear.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she had any of her menses since this happened? - A. Once.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she had any before? - A. None before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I never saw him to the best of my knowledge, till he was brought a prisoner to my house; he is the person that damaged that girl, for a more virtuous girl never came into a house than she was before that, and a girl that I could trust with untold gold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have given this girl a very good character, how long has she lived with you? - A. About eight or nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with her before? - A. Yes; from No. 13, Pimlico.</p>
               <p>Q. That was where her aunt lived, was it not? - A. Where she lived servant, I had her character from.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not she quarrelled with her aunt, and for that reason was turned out? - A. No; I have seen her aunt twice since.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the aunt assisted in prosecuting? - A. No; I answer for the girl myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have not the Justices directed the prosecution? - A. I have not asked any advice from any gentleman whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You know the prisoner at the bar, do not you? - A. I never saw him till that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not he a milk-man? - A. His wife is a milk-woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it happened that this woman and you have had a quarrel about the loss of a customer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any words with her? - A. Not concerning any business at all; never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Never? - A. Not about my customers.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it about then? - A. I met her coming past the Horse-ferry road, since this affair, and she asked what I intended to do; I told her it should take the law, and she behaved very insolent, and called me an old bawd.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any quarrel with her be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200019"/>fore this? - A. No; I had never spoke to her in my life, nor did not know her till after I had been before the Justices.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to tell me, that before this, you never had any quarrel with her about any customer? - A. Never in the universe, in my life, I never spoke to her.</p>
               <p>Q. I tell you she is here? - A. I never spoke to her before.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that this girl was generally in your presence? - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. You go about the town with milk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the girl go about with you, when you are going about the town? - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you most usually leave her in the Park? - A. No; I have another servant, and I generally leave her there, and my daughter; at six o'clock in the morning she gets up, and gets the cows out of the Green-Park, and I meet her on the milk walk; if she is out of my sight, there is another guard over her.</p>
               <p>Q. This girl was a servant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To do your business like other servants? - A. Yes; when she was in health to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether it was not usual for her, as your servant, to go with the cows, and attend them herself? - A. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always go with her? - A. Or somebody else; there are three or four servants sometimes go together.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to go by herself that night? - A. It is very hard that I should be obliged to have one servant to guard another for four hundred yards for fear of that man.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us she never went into the ale-houses, you mean in your presence? - A.Nor out of my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. You will swear that? - A. I will not swear that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. She was not that sort of girl? - A. No, She was not; she was always a girl very particular to keeping her time.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I believe you are surgeon to the prison in which this man has been confined? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined him, and can you state whether within any recent time he has had a venereal complaint? - A. When I examined him, he had not the least appearance of having had a recent venereal complaint upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it possible for such a girl to have the hymen ruptured and no lasceration? - A. No; there must have been a discharge of blood, and appearances of being ruptured by force.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that depend upon the size of the girl, or upon her strength? - A. Upon her strength, and upon her youth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if in a girl, the hymen had been ruptured, must it not have been discovered when she was examined? - A. It would be impossible for long a time after.</p>
               <p>Q. But do you suppose it possible for the surgeon who examined her the next day, to have passed it by? - A. I should think impossible.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were in Court at the time Mr. Winterbotham was examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a surgeon, he is an apothecary; do you think it possible that he, not having much knowledge of the business, might overlook an appearance of that kind? - A. I should think it almost impossible for any person to have observed the parts but they must perceive whether the hymen had been ruptured, and whether such force had been used as to enter the body of that girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Consider this girl's age; might not the hymen have been ruptured by some accident before? - A. Most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. She was a hard working girl, and out early in the morning, supposing it to have been so, might she not have had those appearances, though it was only the first time of a man having been with her? - A. I do not conceive it possible for any man to have entered the body of a girl of that age, without causing a lasceration upon the parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Andrews speaks of marks of great violence that appeared upon the 10th of August, might not those appearances be where a girl had been entered by a man for the first time, three weeks before? - A. Those appearances, I should have thought, would have taken place at least in the course of forty-eight hours.</p>
               <p>Q. She was examined within fourteen hours after by Mr. Winterbotham? - A. She was then free from the inflammation which would increase in the course of two or three days.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Pollard). Q. How soon did you perceive any swelling? - A. I cannot say to a day, it might be between four and five days, that she could not be able to sit.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive any swelling the first night? - A. No; the first night about twelve o'clock, I carried her a bit of pomatum, and on her thighs I saw what was human nature upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her courses coming? - A. Something of that nature.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing of man's nature? - A. Yes, both; there was between two and three table spoonfuls of blood, or thereabouts, came from her; I gave her some hot brandy, and she said, help me, mistress, help me, mistress, for I am very bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200020"/>Q. Did you consider that blood as her courses, or in consequence of violence? - A. Violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it continue upon her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive any swelling till between four and five days after wards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Andrews). Do you suppose such circumstances as Mrs Pollard has described, likely to appear from violence? - A. Very probable.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Webb). What do you think of it? - A. It is certainly very propable.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was your cousin? - A. He was gone off for Bristol, and I was returning home.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you see her here about? - A. That is not the woman, that is not the woman, but that is her, that fresh coloured girl, (pointing to Bell;) I will take my oath again, twenty times, that that is the woman that was along with the prisoner, they were drinking a pint of ale, and when they had drank it, they went to the bar, and called for a glass of rum, and they had a glass of rum each.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long did they stay in the house? Not long; I was sitting and looking at them; what made me look more at them, was, that Kelly told me he had seen them the night before, and he said, see how forward that little body is, and I said, it was a pity; Kelly went to the bar and paid for the porter, we went away through the park, down Constitution-hill, and we saw them in the park.</p>

               <p>Mrs. POLLARD called in again. - Q.Had you been with the girl in the Park, on the 19th of July? - A. On the 19th of July, I was with her from between two and three, till nine o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. How much before nine? - A. As near nine as possible; we generally turn the cows off at nine, at that time of the year, and I had untied the cows myself with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You generally turn out at nine, at that time of the year? - A. According to the weather, if it is fine weather we stay out till the last minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at Spring-Gardens? - A. Yes; she parted from me at Spring-Gardens, at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the child on a spotted gown? - A. She had the same spotted gown on that she has at present, and a handkerchief very much like this, but not this, she wore no cap at that time, she had nothing but a hat on her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any apron on? - A. Yes, a blue apron.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had a good character with this girl? - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know you had a character with her? - A. Yes; she knew it, for I took her to the woman where she lived; and there have been people coming past, who had known her at Pimlico, and seeing her at the stall, have given her halfpence, because they had known her to be an honest girl; this woman in the dark gown, Mrs. Cusack, offered the girl five guineas, and a gown piece, not to appear, but what day of the month it was, I do not know; about three o'clock in the afternoon, I came up, and they were rioting the girl, and she stood a crying.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time of the offer? - A. I came up at the very moment, when she told her, if she would not appear against him, she should have five guineas and a gown-piece, but if she swore against him, she told her she would be hanged, she said so upon the milk stall; I cannot justly say when that was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say so? - A. Yes; it was not a month ago; it was at a time she was discoursing with the girl upon the milk-stand.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cusack. It is false as God is true, I never offered the girl any sum at all; I met the mistress, and they all stopped with the cows and sat down, and had a pot of ale, and I came up and said, what a dreadful thing it is, about this affair; bless your soul, says she, come along, I can reason with you better than I can with any body else; with that, I went up to the wall with her, and she up and told me how it was; now, says I, it will be a scandalous thing, if you swear as you have done, to prosecute this man; if you can make it up, I think it would be much better, says she, I am bound under forty pounds; says I, that is nothing, you will not be bound to pay it; well, says she, I will enquire, and if I am not bound by penalty, I do not know what I may do.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Bell.) Did Mrs. Cusack offer you any money? - A. Yes, in my mistress's presence, and my master was present to.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Pollard.) Did you give that girl any wages? - A. No; but I found her in wearing-apparel, both her shoes and stockings, and what I thought necessary; she would have had wages for her own jurisdiction before now, but I thought I had better lay it out for her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cusack. I had a young baby of seven months old in my arms, and she said, that she wished that child in my arms might be ravished.</p>

             sworn. - Last Saturday, about three o'clock, the prisoner was in my parlour, drinking a glass of liquor; I keep a public house; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, (repeating them); he was looking at the newspaper for about an hour and a half; about half after four o'clock, he went out; he had an apron on, like a tallow-chandler or a grocer; my wife went into the parlour directly, and missed the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sitting there alone? - A. There were some children there; he told the eldest that they might go out and have their gammocks, and he would rock the cradle the while; my wife went after him, she followed him into Mr. Ham's, a public-house; and there he made an excuse to go backwards; we followed him into the necessary, and there we found some frocks and a gown down the necessary, and some things in the crown of his hat; they were all in the parlour ten minutes before he went away.</p>

I told him, no; I had some suspicion of him, and instantly sent him prisoner into the guard-room; after he was confined in the guard-room, it was judged necessary to examine the bag; I opened the bag, and there were six fowls, six ducks, five geese, and one cock; we sent to the place where he was last quartered, and there we learned that they belonged to Mr. Allanson.</p>

I was not, Mr. Godfred, I was only rather sleepy; did you sleep in the coach? no, I did not; why then you were stupified, I suppose; he said, he was not; did she overhaul your pocket, or did she fumble about you in the coach; he said, no; did she take any money away from you in the coach; he said, no, she did not, Mr. Godfred, I took d-d good care of that; did you go into any house? yes; I went to a house, and we had some punch, and that I paid for; and we went into another house, and there we had another half-crown bowl of punch, and that I paid for; I asked him what houses, but he could not tell; then we came right home; home where? to Betsey's house, and there I had a shillingsworth of rum and water, and got change for a dollar; he said, he had five five-pound notes; did you give those five-pound notes to Betsey?

I went down into Narrow-street, to go to Peterson's house; I asked him why he did not knock at Peterson's door; he said, he did knock at the door, but he was not up; I said to him, why you tell me so many stories, do tell me the truth; says he, I will tell you the truth, if you will go along with me to Betsey's house; says I, if you will tell me the truth, I will go along with you, then I may have some ground to go upon? yes, Mr. Godfred, I will tell you the truth, I slept in the mast makers yard, right opposite Peterson's house, in Narrow-street; says I, if you slept there, you are certainly done; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200034"/>said, no, I hope not, Mr. Godfred; you are certainly robbed, you may depend upon it; no, I am not robbed; you go along with me to the house I speak of, and I think the money is in the house I went with him then immediately to the prisoner's house; as soon as he got in, an old woman saluted him, and said, well done, my lad, Betsey is gone out to market, she will soon be back, but she has left your watch hanging there, for fear you should come for it before she came back; yes, yes, says he, I know my watch, I know my watch very well, but never mind the watch; but there is some money left in this house last night that belongs to me; is not there, says I? I said to him, why do not you speak now? he said, never mind it, Betsey is not at home.</p>

I did not stop so long; says he, I will pay you one guinea if you will stop till Betsey comes; says I, I will stay no longer; I said to him, did she take the watch from you, and he said, no, Mr. Godfred, she did not, I gave it to her; I then said, did she take the money from you? no, she did not; then I asked him again, have you given the money to her? I do not know, Mr. Godfred, I think the money is in this house; I then told him I would stop no longer.</p>
               <p>Q. Your house is not far from her's? - A. No; I have known her four years; I always knew her to be a very industrious woman; and there are so many coming backwards and forwards to my house, that use her house, that I must have heard if she had been guilty of any thing of this kind; she lodged sailors in her house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a man of the name of Turbon Acres present at any part of the conversation? - A. Yes, most of the time.</p>
               <p>Turbon Acres, Samuel Hanson, and Abraham Hendersen, confirmed the evidence of Mr. Godfred, as to his conversation with the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave her a good character for honesty and modesty.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am an officer of the city.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember going to the house of Welchman on the 7th of September, in company with Ray and Armstrong? - A. Yes, and Jacobs went with us; when we entered the house, I think it was between twelve and one o'clock; I searched Jacobs before he went into the house for money, and there was none about him; he had a one pound note given to him by Mr. Powell, to purchase some money, and I marked that note.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Jacobs been in the house before he returned from it? - A. I think he had been in the house ten minutes, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched when he came out of the house? - A. I myself went up to my first man as soon as he came out of the house; I met him, and I took him immediately into the house; at my heels, another officer, Armstrong, came in; I gave him into the hands of Armstrong; he searched him, and I immediately went round the counter to the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you were not the person that searched him, but Armstrong was? - A. Armstrong searched him, and I searched Mr. Welchman, and found the note in his right hand waistcoat pocket, which I had marked before the Jew went in. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the note which you know as having been delivered to Jacobs? - A. It is; there are my initials on it, and there are Armstrong's initials on it; I searched him; I found nothing upon his person but that note; in the shop we found an amazing quantity of halfpence; seven bags I have here, to what amount I do not know; they were in the shop behind the counter, under some seats that were there; we found some done up in papers, in drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. To what amount? - A. There are seven bags; I suppose they weight half a hundred a piece; there was in the shop 130lb. of good money, which, he said, belonged to another person; it was returned to the person that he said it belonged to; we went up to the top of the garret stairs, and and found a vast quantity of counterfeit sixpences,(produces them); I told him we had an information, and after some interogation he went up stairs, and shewed us where they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sixpences in this condition when you found them, each in a separate paper? - A. Yes; we found it concealed under the top stair, going into the room; it was a sliding stair; in another paper here are eighteen guineas and some half-guineas.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200036"/>Q. There was a great deal of counterfeit money? - A. A great deal indeed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were not in the house at the time that Jacobs gave the Bank-note to Welchman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore that transaction depended entirely upon him? - A. Yes; I was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him so as to be certain that he had no money, did you search his shoes, and every part of his dress;? - A. No, I did not; I searched his pockets, and his body, but did not search his shoes.</p>

I did; I found in this bag six hundred and sixty sixpences, nine half-crowns, and fifteen shillings, here is another bag with 836 sixpences wrote upon, "cast unfinished;" here is another bag of sixpences and shillings cast as they came out, in their first state, and here are twenty half-crowns in another.</p>

               <p>Q. How came he to throw it down? - A. I believe he saw me coming to him; I went after him and brought him back; I asked him why he took it; and he said, he was not going to do any thing with it, but out of mischief; Stack did not go into the shop, but walked a little gently on; I took them both back into the shop, and they were taken to Bow-street.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to Marlborough-street office; I apprehended the prisoner at Camden-Town; she made many excuses, but I told her she must go with me; as I was taking her down Titchfield-street, she told me the spoons were did in the house; I took her back to the house, and the moment I entered the room, I saw her put her hand in her right hand pocket; I told her I would search her myself, and she dropped the spoons under her apron; I picked them up, and she said, that either me or the prosecutrix dropped them ourselves; I searched her pocket, and found this duplicate of a tea-spoon, (produces it); I took her to Marlborough-street, and then I went to the pawnbroker at Hamp-street, and got the spoon.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PAXON sworn. - I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner pawned three spoons with me, on the 16th, I am sure she is the woman; on the 28th, she fetched two spoons out, and left the other one; she pledged them in the name of Courtney.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is my husband's name.</p>
               <p>(The spoons were produced, and deposed to by Mrs. King). The prisoner put in a written defence, as follows: My Lord, and Gentleman. It was my great misfortune to work two days with Mrs. King, a milk-woman, as a carrier; I cleaned the kitchen, where, in raking up some old dirt, I picked up two teaspoons, and a little further, one more, which, from their colour, must have lain there some time; there are a great many lodgers in the house; I thought I would speak to every one in the house; I told Mrs. King to look if any thing was lost, before I went; and she looked, and said, no, she had lost nothing; and the same with the lodgers; thus finding there was no loser, I thought myself a fortunate gainer, if they were silver, for from their black appearance, I could not tell; when my mistress came to me, I did not deny having them, though I denied stealing them, for which offence I stand charged, for the first time in my wretched life. Oh, my Lord, look with an eye of benevolence and compassion upon your humble petitioner, and cast not away an unfortunate woman, who never intended to injured any one; and who once never thought to be reduced to such a situation.</p>

               <p>ROBERT BARWELL sworn. - I had information that there were some of my pots along with this gentleman's, at an iron shop in Shoe-lane; I went with a constable, and searched the house; Mr. Johnson, the prisoner, sat in the shop, and asked me what I wanted; I told him, I understood there were some pots of mine concealed there; he told me, he never bought any pots, nor stole any; I told him. I should search his house; and he told me I might do as I pleased; I told the constable to look into the bed, and there he found four quart pots. (Dutton, the constable, produced the pots.)</p>

               <p>Barwell cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He told you, you might ransack his house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some information which led you to the prisoner's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That information you had from Boss, had not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Boss? - A. He has been a recruiting-serjeant, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. In other words a crimp? - A. Yes, if you please.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar before? - A. I have known him for years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know that he is a married man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. His wife was a violent dispositioned lady, I believe? - A.I cannot say, I never heard.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of shop did she keep? - A. An iron-shop, in Shoe-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you know that they do not live in the same house? - A. As far as I know they always lie in the same bed together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the one keeps a cabinet-maker's shop, and the other an iron-shop opposite? - A. I have seen a few chairs at the house over the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard from Boss, that they were parted? - A. I have understood that they have parted for a week, and then made it up, and gone to bed together again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not believe, upon your oath, that this prosecution is a plan laid against the prisoner by his wife and Boss, to get rid of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard Boss declare that it was a plan of Mrs. Johnson's, to lay hold of her husband? - A. No; never any thing like that; I have heard Boss say, he kept a thieving shop, and a shop for receiving stolen goods.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Dutton.) The prisoner suffered his house to be searched very readily? - A. Yes; and when I found the pots in the bed, he walked about seemingly very much agitated; he went out at the back door into an alley, and I followed him through various turnings and windings, and called stop thief, till he was taken; Mr. Johnson then said, this is my made of a wife's doing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner read his defence as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, Owing to a disagreement between my wife and myself, I have no doubt that this was done for the express purpose of ruining me, as she has often threatened. I trust the Gentlemen of the Jury will acquit me, as I am conscious of my own innocence.</p>

               <p>ARTHUR HOWELL sworn. - I am a silver chaser: On Saturday, the 29th of July, I was in company with the prisoner at half past seven o'clock in the evening, and it was near one o'clock on the Sunday morning before we parted; and on the Sunday morning he and I went down to East Barnet together, and there we were in company with Mr. Fairbrother and another gentleman; I have known the prisoner four or five years; I never knew any thing to the contrary of his being an honest man; I used to spend the evening at the same public-house with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he and his wife live upon terms together? - A. Not upon terms of friendship, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if they lived in two different houses? - A.Latterly Mr. Johnson has slept in one house, and Mrs. Johnson in the other; the pots were found in the house where she slept.</p>
               <p>- FAIRBROTHER sworn. - I was at Barnet, in company with the prisoner at the bar and Mr. Howell, on Sunday, the 30th of July; we slept there that night, and walked to town the Monday morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear them have any conversation relative to this business? - A. Yes; a few days after Mr. Johnson was taken up, I met with an acquaintance of mine in Stonecutter-street going there, and we walked together till we met Boss at the corner; I asked Boss if Mr. Johnson was acquitted by the Justice, and he said, he was not; he should take very good care that he should not, for that he was a b-y thief; Boss and I then went over to Barwell's, and my acquaintance went to Mr. Johnson's; we stopped there for a little bit; Boss clapped his hand upon my shoulder, and said, he had fixed Johnson, he would take care that he should not get out till he was set at liberty at Botany Bay; I told Boss, that I thought he was the last man who ought to take away a man's liberty from him; Barwell, when he heard this language, shook his head, as much as to say, he must not say any more.</p>

            : On the 10th of August, about seven in the evening, the prisoner came into our shop, and asked for a watch in the window of the value of 3l. 13s.; I told him there was not one marked at that price; he went out, and pointed to one marked three guineas; he came in and looked at it; he said, he did not think it was a good one, and desired to see another; he went out, and pointed to one marked 3l. 10s.; he told me he would give me three guineas for it; I told him, as watches were not very saleable, he should have it; he then desired to look at another; he said, he did not know which he should have; he then took both watches in his hand, and ran out into the street; I went out and screamed; he was soon brought back; he went down upon his knees, gave me the watches, and said, for God's sake do not hurt me, the watches are here.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A. No; it was entirely a voluntary confession; the constable found some duplicates upon her which produced the sheets and the flat iron.</p>

Yes, very well; I went, according to Mr. Newman's orders at the Mansion-house, between nine and ten o'clock, to his house, the Half-moon public-house, Duke-street, Smithfield; I asked him if one Kilby was there; he told me, no; says he, I know what you want; says I, how do you know what I want; says he, what do you want then; I said to him, I want a guineas worth of dollars; I said, how many are there for a guinea; he told me there should not be but seven, but he would let me have eight; accordingly I had eight, I paid him a one pound note, and one shilling, for them; after I had paid him for them, he asked me if I wanted any yellows; I asked him, what yellows were; he told me they were half-guineas; I asked him what they were a piece; he told me three shillings and sixpence; I asked him if he could not take three shillings; he said, no, he would not abate a farthing; I gave him a one pound note, and he gave me half-a-crown out of it, and five half-guineas; then he says to me, d-n you, Jack, if I had known your temper I would have put three hundred pounds in your pocket in less than three months; says I, how would you do it; says he, I will fetch you something, and shew you; he fetched me down a five pound note of the Bristol Bank; says he, here is something worth two of the other; says I, I do not want any thing of that kind at present, but if I do, I will call upon you, (produces the half-guinea); I immediately went to Mr. Newman at the Mansion-house; we were going that night, but Mr. Newman sent word not to go till I got the note; next day I went with Mr. Hollier to the prisoner's house, and found five dollars in a pint pot, in his bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any counterfeit money about the premises? - A.

             sworn. - I went by the order of Mr. Graham, to pick some hay-bands, in doing of which, I found a small parcel, which I gave to Mr. Graham, he opened it, and seeing the contents, he placed it as it was before; Mr. Graham desired me to take notice if any one carried it away, but not to speak to any body; in about ten minutes, the prisoner came up, under pretence of searching for a knife, which he said he had dropped a few days before; I perceived him put his hand towards his pocket; in a few minutes afterwards he went down stairs; immediately after for my own curiosity, I turned up the straw to see if the opium remained there or not, and found it was gone, and according to Mr. Graham's directions, I staid there till he came, and I informed him that the prisoner had been there; Mr. Graham did not know, I believe, at the time, where the man's re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200047"/>sidence was, and his warehouseman, who had the only knowledge of it, was gone over the water; I waited there with Mr. Graham and the constable, till the prisoner returned; Mr. Graham and I went with the constable to his lodgings, and in searching his wife, he found it in her pocket; the prisoner had told me, that it was in a drawer in his apartments, but when we had searched and could not find it, we searched the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this man lived with you? - A. Upwards of twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave? - A. He behaved in general well, but a great number of thefts have been committed in the house since he came to it.(Abraham Bone, the constable, produced the opium, which was deposed to by Mr. Graham).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My wife has been very ill for a long time; I took it home, with intention to take a little bit of it for her, intending to take the rest back again.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of night was this? - A. Between twelve and one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the box in her hand? - A. Yes, and very near got it out of her hand, only the other was rather too nimble for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that day? - A. I had been upon the Queen's guard that day, and then I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200049"/>had to go round from public-house to public-house till between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A. As sober as I am now; she asked me to have part of the gin, and I would not, for I told her I wanted to go home to my wife and family.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I met this man and another woman, and they asked me to drink with them, and I took a glass of liquor with them, and wished them good night, and then he came and charged me with taking his money; I went with him very readily; I had no money at all about me.</p>

             sworn. - I am a peace-officer for Mary-le-bonne parish; I let furnished lodgings, and live in South-street, Manchester-square; I have known the prisoner Gladwell nine or ten years, but have had no intimacy with him till within these three years: On Wednesday, the 12th of July, he called upon me between two and three o'clock; I made an appointment to call upon him the next morning to go into the City with him; he stopped till between six and seven; he asked me to go with him to drink tea with Yates, at Mr. Morse's; he said, you know Yates is a very particular fellow, and he will be offended if I do not go, and I will not go without you; I had known Yates fourteen years; we went together; the maid-servant opened the door; Gladwell was going up stairs; I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200050"/>where are you going, I will not go up stairs; upon which Yates said, the maids are washing below, and we shall interrupt them; we then went up stairs; the first thing that took my attention was a painting of a dancer upon the top of a harpsichord; from there I saw a watch lying upon the chimney-piece at the other end of the room; some time after, Yates went down to get the tea, upon which Gladwell said, let us go and look at Mr. Morse's bed-room; we went into the bed-room; Gladwell said, let us wash our hands in Mr. Morse's bason; he washed his hands, and I washed mine; there was a pot of pomatum stood upon the chimney-piece in the bed-room, which Gladwell looked at; when I had washed my hands, I went out into the front room; when I returned into the front room, Gladwell was there; we drank tea, and left Mr. Morse's lodgings between seven and eight; we might have been there about an hour, or an hour and a half; I called upon Gladwell the next morning at Hartnell's, in St. George's-fields, at about a quarter after nine; when I went in, he was dressing his hair, and was using the pot of pomatum that I had seen in Mr. Morse's bed-room; I said, that was Mr. Morse's pomataum; he said, it was; I said, how could he take it; he said, Yates could manage that with Mr. Morse; a short time after, he went down stairs, and returned with Yates with him; when they came into the room, Gladwell said, here is a pretty piece of news Yates brings, Mr. Morse's watch is missing off his chimney-piece; Yates said, yes, my master placed it on the chimney-piece when he went out to dinner, and when he came home it was missing; Gladwell said, how does your master know the watch was there; Yates said, he always winds it up when he goes to bed, and he placed it there when he went out; Gladwell then said, is Mr. Morse sure the watch was there; upon which I made answer and said, that the watch was certainly there, for I had seen it there; upon which Gladwell said, you saw the watch there, are you sure you saw the watch there? why, says I, I think I am sure I saw the watch there; you think you saw it, says Gladwell; if you are not sure, you should not say any thing about it; I said, I don't know that I am going to say any thing about it, because I hope it will be found, but it I am to say any thing about it, I certainly saw a watch there, upon which I told him, I should not go into the City, I should go to Mr. Morse; Yates said, his master was determined to find out his watch; he said, Mr. Morse is out, but I dare say he will be at home by the time you get there; I said, at all events, whether he is at house or not, I will go; Gladwell said, he would go too; certainly, says I, it is very necessary; upon which we all three set out to go to Mr. Morse's; he was out; we waited till he returned; I proposed to Mr. Morse to go immediately before a Magistrate; Mr. Morse said, he could not go at that time; I gave Mr. Morse my address, and told him who I was, that I should be ready to come forward at any time, and Gladwell gave him his address; after that, Gladwell and I went into the City; upon our return, we talked a great deal about it; Gladwell asked me why I made myself so uneasy about it, what did it signify, they could not say we took the watch, the apartments are open to a great many besides us, they are open to every body in the house; I said, an imputation of that sort was enough to make me uneasy; he said, what does it signify, what can they do? I said, they can do a great deal, they can take us both up; what then, says he, we must be discharged, there is no proof against us; says I, they can do more than that, they can go into my house and search it, turn all that is in it upside down, and your lodgings likewise; says he, they cannot break our locks; yes, says I, they can; what, when we are not there? yes, says I, equally as much as if we were there; upon that, there was a complete change in his countenance, and so there was for the whole night; we dined together at my house upon bacon and cabbage; we were engaged to go that evening to Vauxhall, and there was an unusual dullness upon him all night; I parted with him about one in the morning, and the next morning he met me at Mr. Morse's lodgings, when he appeared very chearful.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had known Yates longer than you had known Gladwell? - A. Yes; about fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have called on Yates often? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. And received money of him for Gladwell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the money is not paid to Gladwell yet? - A. There is a part of the money paid to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you paid him all that you have received? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Gladwell went to Morse's lodgings to meet the charge as often as you did? - A.Exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. And from the time he was taken up, to the present hour, he has not been at large? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when he had left his lodgings, and was in custody, there was nobody to answer for him except the master of the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, no person who called there would be likely to see him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I dare say you never took the trouble to call at his lodgings? - A. No; I never did; I called on Mr. Hartnell there; the day after the first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200051"/>examination, Mr. Morse requested of me to make enquiries about the neighbourhood for the watch; as I went past, I saw Hartnell in his shop, his wife and his aunt were there; I never called at any other time.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a private door, is there not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not near his lodging? - A. No nearer than the butcher's parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go past his coal-hole? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the coal hole is? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he go for coals in the winter, when he wanted them, when you have been there? - A. How is it possible I should know when I was up stairs with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You used frequently to visit him? - A. I used to go upon his business, it was to oblige him.</p>
               <p>Q. You obliged him by keeping back his money? - A. No such thing, it is ready whenever it is demanded, he has got my note for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you follow any business whatever? - A. Yes; I am employed a great deal in my lodgings; my wife is a ladies' hair-dresser, and very much out; I attend sales frequently, and buy different articles, and sell them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Follett? - A. Yes; I have kicked him out of my house between two and three in the morning.</p>

             sworn - I am a butcher, in Marshall-street, Prospect-place, St. George's fields; the prisoner, Gladwell, has lodged with me two years: Last Thursday was a week, the 14th of this month, having a great deal of vermin about my house, a sirloin of beef had been destroyed by rats, and bearing a parcel of rats in the coal house, I took my dog into the coal-house, I had a candle in my hand, and saw a handkerchief with something glittering in it; I took it up, and found it to be a gold watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gladwell keep his coals in that place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was any thing kept there besides? - A. Yes; a pot or two, or any thing we wanted to put in; there was no lock upon the door, but I have not put any thing in these three months,(produces the watch and the handkerchief); the next morning I sent to Mr. Morse about it; the watch seemed to have lain sometime in the handkerchief; there was a mouldy or rusty appearance upon the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How far is the coal-hole from the private door? - A. About three yards, I suppose; it is under the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not White frequently call upon Gladwell, and come in at the private door? - A. Yes; his bell was at that door.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore a man that called often, would know where the coal-hole was? - A. I should think so; he used to call once or twice a week sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did White ever call at your house after Gladwell was taken into custody? - A. Yes; the Wednesday after, I was standing in the shop as he was going by, and I asked him to walk in and sit down.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not your eye upon him all the time, I suppose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came in, was there any thing to prevent his going to Gladwell's lodgings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Who was there at the time besides? - A. My wife and my aunt, my aunt is in her eighty-second year.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. What character does the prisoner bear? - A. I never knew but he was a very honest man.</p>

               <p>Gladwell's defence.

               <p>Q. Do you know Henry White? - A. Yes, very well; I knew him first of all about twelve years ago; I have known very little of him these three years.</p>

               <p>Court. (To White). Q. Did you ever kick him down stairs? - A. No; I turned him out of my house between two and three o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Follett. He did not turn me out, he opened the door and let me out; he had me at his house to write an inventory of his goods to the amount of 334l. and he told me I had not put down the linen or the plate; now I should like to know where he got money to buy all those things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To White). Q. Upon your oath, did you or not turn this man out of your house? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you turn him out? - A. Because he staid in my house at an improper hour; I had been in bed some time; I heard my children crying; I got up to see what was the matter; I went into the room to see if the servant was there, and she was not; I went down and found her below stairs with Follett; I told her to go to bed; I went down again about an hour and an half after that, and found them together; I told her again to go to bed; and between two and three o'clock in the morning, I went down again, and found her with him; I had no patience with him any longer, and I gave him a kick, and thrust him out of the house.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Had you ever had any quarrel with him? - A. Not previous to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Follet). Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did White ever assault you, or turn you out of his house? - A. No, he never did; he says it was between two and three o'clock in the morning, it was not ten o'clock; he stood in the passage with his arm out, it was in the dark, and I ran against his arm, he did not turn me out.</p>
               <p>White. What he speaks of, was on a Sunday evening; my wife and I had spent the evening out; I went in in the dark, and wondered what was going forward; I heard somebody creeping up stairs, and he ran against me.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Follett). Q. Do you remember this other business,sitting up with the nursery-maid? - A. Yes; I sat up, that was no harm.</p>

               <p>Q. There is no mark either upon the sugar or the bag? - A. No, there is not.</p>

               <p>Q.What is she? - A. Her husband is a cooper; I was informed of my loss, and I told her of it; she was very sorry for it; I saw the gown at the office last Thursday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You had not seen these articles for a month before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The box was not locked? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I assure you I do not mean to distress you, for I feel for every body who is in that unfortunate situation-your husband, I believe, became a bankrupt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband had not the good fortune to have his certificate? - A. I know nothing about it; I do not know what a certificate means.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, in consequence of the bankruptcy, remove this trunk to the house next to the prisoner's, in order to be out of the way, and after it had been removed from other places before? - (Hesitates).</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding your husband has been declared a bankrupt, you removed these things to an empty house? - A. We took that little house, being cheap rented.</p>
               <p>Q.What was the reason you thought fit to move your things to an empty house, after your husband was declared a bankrupt, and before he had got his certificate? - A. It was cheaper for us to have a house than a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that every thing you had was liable to be seized, your husband being a bankrupt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Notwithstanding that you moved these things to an empty house, gave your key to a person you had never before known, and the box open? - A. I always had the key from her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200059"/>Q.Before they went to this empty house, had they always been at one house? - A. No, they had not; they had been at Mrs. Atkins's, in Fleet-market, about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box at any time locked? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there in your own house, before it was removed to Mrs. Atkins's? - A. Four.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to the box while it was at Mrs. Atkins's, you don't know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Finch is a cooper, and your husband is a cooper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Finch was acquainted with your loss, she expressed her sorrow for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the box got to the house next to Mrs. Finch's, had you the curiosity to see what it contained? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from the time it was sent to Mrs. Atkins's, till it reached Mrs. Finch's, you knew not what was in it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand a misfortune has attended you, as it does many men; you have been a bankrupt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your certificate? - A. I have not asked for it; the commission was closed long ago; my wife's apparel was all allowed me, and all our linen; we had nothing that the commissioners or the creditors could claim; there were a few things at this house, a table and two chairs, that were given me by friends, since the bankruptcy; Mr. Finch was to have lent me a bedstead; he was an intimate acquaintance of mine, and I did not wish to have hurt his wife.</p>

             sworn. - Last Saturday week Mrs. Finch sent for me; I serve her with milk; she asked me to go of an errand for her to oblige Mrs. Holt, to pledge a gown for a little money for Mrs. Holt's use, which I did; I pledged it with Mr. Gough, in Red lion-street, for four shillings, and I gave Mrs. Finch the money and the duplicate; and on Monday I took it out again.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose desire? - A. By my own desire; I had a suspicion that all was not right, because I had burnt the duplicate by the desire of Mrs. Finch, and I took the gown out, and carried it to Mrs. Martin, the wife of Mr. Martin, a cooper; she lent me the money to take it out; and then I thought if any thing should occur concerning it, I could produce it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How could you get the gown out, if the duplicate was burnt? - A. I went to the pawnbroker, and told him it was burnt, and he said, I must make an affidavit that it was neither given away nor sold, but that it was burnt, and I did make the affidavit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You serve Mrs. Finch with milk? - A. Yes; I have served her a year and a half, and I had the promise of serving Mrs. Holt when she came to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you that promise? - A. Mrs. Finch.</p>
               <p>Q. And though you burnt the duplicate at the desire of Mrs. Finch, you went to another person for the money to take it out? - A. Yes; Mrs. Martin, a cooper's wife; I have known her three or four years; Mr. Finch, and Mr. Martin, and Mr. Holt, were all very intimate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of any quarrel they had had lately? - A. Not Mr. Finch and Mr. Martin, but Mrs. Finch and Mrs. Martin.</p>
               <p>Q. So Mrs. Martin was the person you fixed upon to get the money of, though you knew that she and Mrs. Finch had quarrelled? - A. I went to her because she was a particular friend of mine, and I knew she would let me have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Martin was not very much displeased at your coming to her, I take it? - A. I do not think Mrs. Martin thought any thing about it at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose she has thought of it since? - A. Yes; she has had reason to think of it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever a duplicate in your custody before? - A. Yes; a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. You think it a good thing, perhaps, when you have a great many duplicates, to burn them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Finch told you it was to be pawned for Mrs. Holt? - A. Yes; I pawned it in my own name; Mrs. Finch told me to pawn it in my own name.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Mrs. Finch desired you to pawn this gown for Mrs. Holt, did not you happen to know, from the intimacy that subsisted between these coopers and their wives, that the prosecutor was a bankrupt? - A. No; Mrs. Finch told me they were in distressed circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you did not think it very extraordinary that she should be obliged to pawn a gown? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else present when Mrs. Finch desired you to pawn this gown? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any thing in the situation of Finch and his wife, that would induce you to suppose they were in want of four shillings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He has a good deal of business? - A. He is a journeyman cooper.</p>
               <p>Q. He is foreman, is he not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are the people of very good reputa<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200060"/>tion and credit in the neighbourhood? - A. Of very good credit; he keeps a house.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been at her door since? - A. Yes, every day.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not you wish to have it explained, that Mrs. Finch, a woman in very good credit, should pawn a gown for four shillings, and burn the duplicate? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Were you ever in this empty house that Mr. Holt and his wife were to go into? - A. No; I never was.</p>

             sworn. - I was with Mrs. Holt when Mrs. Finch's house was searched, but there was nothing found; Mr. Finch told us that he had had his house searched in that way to exonerate himself, for there was nothing in the house; Mrs. Finch acknowledged taking it out of the box, and cording it up again.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Who was present then? - A. The officer and Mr. and Mrs. Holt; the officer asked her why she did it, and she said, she wanted some money to buy a piece of cotton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Was Mr. Finch present then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said by any body to Mrs. Finch, before she said that? - A. No, except what her husband said to her; he asked her how the gown came to be pawned by the milk-woman; she denied it at first, but after some considerable altercation between the husband and the wife, she said she had done it for want of money; and he asked her why she did it, when he had given her money; and she said, she wanted to buy a piece of cotton.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mr. Holt). Q. You were present at the time this conversation took place? - A. Yes; after she had confessed the gown, I told her if she would confess the rest of the things, I would freely forgive her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you said any thing of that sort before she confessed the gown? - A. No; her husband spoke to her about it; I said, I did not wish to hurt her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after she confessed the gown? - A. I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Cullen). Q. Mr. Finch was displeased about this transaction? - A. Yes; he spoke of the ill consequences of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not now believe, that what she said afterwards, having first denied it, proceeded from the continued perseverance of her husband stating what he did to her? - A. I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q.Was she not alarmed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not confess it in consequence of the perseverance of her husband? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I pawned Mrs. Holt's gown to pay for some coals, which she had ordered to air the house, and for a servant to clean it; I did not bid the person burn the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Mrs. Holt). Q. Do you know if there were any coals purchased to air the house? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were there any coals used? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who paid for them? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you give her any orders to hire a servant? - A. Yes; and I paid for it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, four of whom had known her from her infancy, and gave her an excellent character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. - I live in Manchester-buildings, near Westminster-bridge; I am a musician at the Theatre-Royal; I have known the gentleman at the bar twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a man in a decent situation of life? - A.Very respectable indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. He has a wife, and daughters grown up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What character has be home among his neighbours, for honesty and integrity? - A. He always bore the character of an honest man; I have been very intimate in the family.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to know whether this gentleman has at all times enjoyed his intellects in perfection? - A. I think, from some circumstances, for five or six years past, he has not been collected or in his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in any situation of necessity, that should induce him to take any little articles of this fort? - A. Very much to the contrary; he has been away from his family for a week or ten days, and more, at a time, suddenly, and perfectly unaccountable to his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he, when he had his intellects completely, an attentive husband and master of a family? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is he? - A. He has lived at Leominster in a very extensive way.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How does he live now? - A.Upon his fortune; he lived at Leominster as a shopkeeper fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What instances of his derangement have you known? - A. I think his taking five or six shillings worth of money out of his till, and throwing it among the multitude, is a proof of derangement; and taking these boots, when he had guineas in his pocket, and dismissing, for five months together, a favourite daughter from his own house, for no cause upon earth.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What cause did he assign for dismissing his daughter? - A.None at all; I never asked him the question; for he was so irritable in his disposition, that it was rather dangerous to enter into a detail upon his family concerns.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is his daughter? - A. The eldest about twenty, and the other turned of seventeen;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200062"/>no girls, I believe, were ever better educated; they have had a very liberal education.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN INSOLK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was house-steward to Lord Bateman, at the time I was acquainted with Mr. Croucher; I have now property of my own, and live upon my fortune; I have known the gentleman at the bar about seven years.</p>
               <p>Q.What has been his character for honesty and integrity? - A. He was a man of strict honesty and integrity.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you observed any marks of derangement in him? - A. Not so much in London as in the country, when I was with my Lord Bateman; I have been given to understand from Mrs. Croucher, that he is at times deranged; and from what has passed in the country at different times, and what my friends have communicated to me respecting him, I have reason to believe he is so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in that situation, with respect to circumstances, that he was in want of eighteen or twenty guineas? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was the state of the moon on the 23d of August? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It appears, from the almanack, that there was a new moon the day before.</p>
               <p>SAMPSON HODGKINSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a druggist, on Snow-hill, near Holborn-bridge; I have known the gentleman at the bar since the beginning of the year 1786; I have not known him so well since the year 1790; at that time I always considered him as a man of probity and honesty.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am collector for the stewards of the Sons of the Clergy, and several other public charities; I have known the gentleman at the bar twenty-two years; he is perfectly honest, and of perfect integrity.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any reason to know the state of his intellects for the last four or five years? - A. Yes; he has threatened to buy a pair of pistols, insisting that I should fire at him, or he would fire at me, for no reason upon earth; and his wife has been obliged to swear the peace against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any quarrel or cause of animosity with each other? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. In the general course of his life, has he been an affectionate husband, and a tender father? - A. Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>Q. From your observation of him, do you believe that he was occasionally deranged, or not? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q.Except upon those occasions, is he a man whose conduct and general character has gained your esteem or not? - A.It has.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. His wife has swore the peace against him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that they were an affectionate couple before that? - A. He has been in this kind of way for these two or three years past, jumping suddenly up from his dinner, and going away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he given to drinking at all? - A. Yes, very much so; I have seen him very often in liquor, and look as wild as he could possibly look; in fact, he was not bearable when he had any liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole of your observations of this man's conduct, do you believe him to be deranged in his mind? - A.Positively I do, at times; Some years ago, he collected rents for me of an estate that I have in Radnorshire; I was coming down Holborn, and met the waggoner; I asked him if he knew Mr. Croucher, and he said, what, mad Croucher!</p>
               <p>Court. (To Hawkes.) Q. Was the prisoner searched when he was brought back? - A. Yes, by the constable.</p>
               <p>Constable. I searched the prisoner, and found upon him about two or three shillings; I do not think he had more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober? - A. He looked just as he does now, rather wild.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you put any mark upon them? - A. No, I did not; when Shortland came in, he was desired to put his horse to the cart, and take out the goods; he put Mr. Buxton's in first, because Mr. Lucas's was the first place of delivery; I then desired both my sons to watch the cart to the house of Mr. Lucas; I did not see the goods put into the cart; I saw them put into the boxes; I had got a search warrant, and I went with the warrant and the constable, Donaldson, and one of my sons, William, to a house in West-street, Seven Dials, where I had an opportunity of seeing Mr. Parsons's door; the house I went to was Mr. Bradley's, within two or three doors of Parsons's, where I expected there would be a delivery of soap; I had not been there long, when I saw Shortland come with his cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Mr. Buxton live? - A. In Bedford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is West-street in the way from either of them to your house? - A. It is not the direct way, but it is not much out of the way; he came out of the cart, and went into Parsons's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did there appear to be in the cart at that time? - A. Nothing but boxes and baskets, and a tarpaulin; he went into the house, and stopped there about two minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he go there upon any business of your's? - A. None; he then went to the tail of the cart, and took out of one of the baskets a bundle tied with a dirty apron; he took it into the house of Parsons, and stopped, as near as I can guess, half an hour, or full that; he then came out, got up into his cart, and drove away; as soon as he was out of sight of Parsons's house, I went into Parsons's house with the constable, and a search warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner, Parsons, there? - A. Yes; and his wife and another very elderly woman; Donaldson said, we are come to search your house, Mr. Parsons; he asked, for what; Donaldson said, for soap; Parsons's reply was, that he had no soap, desired to know by what authority he came, and insisted upon seeing it; the constable produced the search warrant, and he and my son then proceeded to search the house; I stood at the door, and saw what passed; and underneath the counter, in one corner, the soap was found.</p>
               <p>Q.When the soap was found, was it found open, or in a cupboard, or in any thing? - A. I cannot say; the soap was produced; I examined it to find the plugs, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was Parsons at the time you were making this search? - A.Present all the while; after the soap was found, he said, he had bought it for his own use, he had given a fair price for it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200064"/>he said he had given ninepence halfpenny a pound for it.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that a fair price? - A. That was the price at which soap was retailing at that time; I then called for a hackney-coach, and conveyed him to my manufactory, in Tottenham-court-road, with intent to take my man; the constable took the soap under his care.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him take it in with an apron wrapped round it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the apron when the soap was found? - A. No; when we got to the manufactory, Donaldson and I got out of the coach, and left my son William in the coach with Parsons; I found Shortland in the stable, cleaning his horses; I then gave him in charge to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give Shortland to understand the nature of the charge against him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that time? - A. I do not recollect that he did; we put him into the same coach with Parsons, and went with him to Bow-street; they appeared total strangers to each other when they were in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your name upon the cart? - A. Yes, and where I live.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. (For Shortland). Q. You have several servants in your manufactury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the habit of suffering several of your men to have had soap, and then they accounted for it to you when they received their wages on a Saturday night? - A. I believe this man, and some others, may have had as much as seven pounds of soap for their own use now and then.</p>
               <p>Q.When they have it, whether they put it to their own use or sell it, it is equally their property? - A. They always have it in pieces when they have it that way, to have it cheaper; it is the same kind of soap, but not in cakes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have now, I believe, a man in your service of the name of Pugh? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you suffered Pugh to have fourteen pounds of soap in a week? - A. I cannot say fourteen pounds in a week, he has had several fourteen pounds at various times.</p>
               <p>Q. And accounted for it when they received their wages? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What day of the week was this? - A. I think it was on a Tuesday, I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not wait till the Saturday night? - A. Not with him, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. (For Parsons). Q.Ninepence halfpenny was a fair price for it? - A. For a single pound; if they take seven pounds; there is an abatement.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went to Parsons's, you told him you came to search his house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was alarmed in consequence of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as it was found, he said, he had bought that soap, and given nine-pence halfpenny a pound for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might there be of this soap? - A. I should imagine about twelve pounds, there were four cakes; they generally run about three pounds a piece.</p>
               <p>Q.And the parcel you sent out to Mr. Lucas, was one hundred and thirteen cakes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched the house thoroughly? - A. I was satisfied with what was found, but the woman was going up stairs, and the constable desired my son to follow her, and I followed her, but we did not find any; the woman did not behave quite as well as she might have done.</p>
               <p>Q. You had reason to suspect that you had lost a great quantity of soap? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. However you found nothing upon the premises of Parsons, that involves him in the suspicion of having any more than these four cakes? - A. Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you at once that he had bought it, and given that price? - A. Yes; when it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. You had directed your attention to the house of Parsons, and saw your cart stop there the first time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Parsons did not come out of the house to Shortland, but Shortland went into him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot say that Parsons could see what name was upon the cart? - A. It is impossible for me to say whether he saw it or not, but I have a bit of paper in my pocket, that if you will take the trouble to look at it, I am sure will convince you that he did see it.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the worth of the soap at that time? - A.Nine shillings; but he could never fell it for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Parsons a married man? - A. I understand so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any children? - A. I think there was one in a cradle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When you let your servants have soap, it was in pieces, and not in cakes? - A. Yes; but I understood from Pugh, that he had several acquaintances, and be would sometimes have it in pieces and sometimes in cakes.</p>
               <p>Q.But did you ever, when you let your men have soap, put plugs into it? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. - I am son of the prosecutor; I was present when the soap was plugged, and when it was put into the boxes; in consequence of directions from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200065"/>my father, I followed the cart into Bedford-square, then the prisoner, Shortland, got up into the cart, and seemed very busily employed about the boxes, sitting upon them and using his hands, but I could not perceive, being at a distance, what it was he was doing; I continued following of him, and in Hart-street, Bloomsbury, just before he got in sight of Mr. Lucas's house, he got out of his cart and walked by the side of his horses; he then stopped at Mr. Lucas's till he had delivered the soap; he left Mr. Lucas's house with the boxes in the cart; I immediately went in to Mr. Lucas, and assisted him in weighing the soap; we found twelve pounds short of weight, and four cakes short in number; I left Mr. Lucas, and went with my father and the constable to West-street.</p>
               <p>Q.When you got to parson's house, did he say any thing? - A. We told him we had a search-warrant to search his house; he said, what for, and the constable immediately made answer, for soap; he said, he had no soap; I found the soap under the counter, standing up end ways, as if it was put there out of sight, amongst some old iron.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with your father up to Tottenham-court-road, to take Shortland? - A. Yes; and while the constable and my father got out of the coach to take Shortland, Parsons said to me, he could take me to the shop where he bought the soap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q.Parsons seemed very much confused when he saw the constable and you? - A. Yes; he was very much confused.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity to search any chandler's shop in your neighbourhood? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lost large quantities of soap? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But you found no trace there of any quantity of soap? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What you saw him carry into Parsons's house was in a dirty apron, not as if it came from the manufactory? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. - I am the driver of the Gosport waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose waggon is it? - A.William Knight's; he lives at Alton, thirty miles on this side of Gosport; I set out from the New-Inn, about six o'clock in the morning of the 11th of August, with the waggon; when I came to Turnham-green, a man came to me, I am sure the prisoner at the bar is the man; he wanted to ride; he would be glad if I would give him a list; he said, he was going to Phillmore-hill, ten miles on the other side of Alton; he said, he would satisfy me; he had but a trifle of money, and as we were walking along, I asked him where he came from; he said, out of Essex; I gave him leave to get in the waggon and ride a few miles; and he got in about half way between Turnham-green and Brentford; when we got to Smallbury green gate, he got out; I watered my horses there; we went in and had a pot of beer, and he paid for it; then he walked with me up as far as Hounslow; that was about twelve o'clock; I had a pint of beer at the sign of the Bear, he did not go in then; and when we had got half way through Hounslow, he said, you may get up and ride now, if you like, and I will drive; I got up into the waggon, and fell asleep; I looked out by the Powder-mills, and he was driving along very well; I looked out again, at Bedfont, and he was upon my nag, driving on very well; about three quarters of a mile beyond Bedfont, I heard a cracking in the waggon; there was a crate of bottles in the waggon; I looked up and saw two men at the tail of the waggon, pulling the crate; I then jumped out at the head of the waggon, and ran after them; the prisoner was just by the horses, on the near side; they ran towards Bedfont; I went after them three or four rods, but not farther, because I thought I must not leave the waggon; he was driving the waggon on till I came back; when I came back, I I missed two trusses and a box.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know how those trusses were directed? - A. Yes; Paul, Gosport; I went up to him, says I, friend, I think you are connected with them; he said, no, I am not; I said again, that he was; and he said, he was not; I took the whip out of his hand, and I drove away as hard as I could to Bedfont-gate, that I might get back to look after my goods; the prisoner went on a little way the same way that I did, and then I lost him; I left the waggon at the gate, and came back again upon my horse, to where the two men got out of the waggon, and then I came gently along, and tracked them coming up to a field of barley; I rode up to the gate about a quarter 6f a mile from where the two men jumped out of the waggon, and looking over the gate, I saw a box that I missed out of the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the road? - A. On the near side; as I was going towards Staines, I tied up my horse, and brought the box out; I went and got some people to assist me; I went over the field of barley, and then over a field of peas, and then over a field of turnips, and then over a field of beans, and there I found one of the trusses.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that close to the side of the road? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the truss directed? - A. To Paul, at Gosport; I put them into another waggon that was coming up, and took them to my waggon at Bedfont-gate; the other truss was found in another barley field.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And you went on with your waggon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have told us this man was on the near side of the way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had drove on the left side, would you have trusted him to drive? - A. No; certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. On which side were the trusses found? - A. The near side of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in your waggon? - A. Near two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say, as you had lost something, you searched very closely, to see if there was any thing else gone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And though he had been in your waggon two hours, you missed nothing else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked out two or three times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was driving in a proper manner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These people, I suppose, got in at the tail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course they would get in as quietly as they could? - A. I suppose they would.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was your waggon closed so that a person who rode the horse, could see whether you were asleep or not? - A. I was just at the head of the waggon, he could see me plain enough.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You generally drive pretty near the fore-horse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Near the shaft-horse? - A.Sometimes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200067"/>Q.You charged him with being an accomplice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the whip out of his hand not very well pleased, I suppose? - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. And you drove away as fast as you could? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Much faster than he could have walked? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. At the time this man leaped out at the tail of the waggon, the prisoner was riding upon your horse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a labourer, I live at Bedfont.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the Gosport waggon coming through Bedfont, on the 11th of August? - A. Yes; at nearly three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember who was driving for him? - A. Yes; that is the man at the bar; I was sitting at the Black Dog, close to the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a green cart coming up? - A. No; I was not there then; I saw the cart afterwards going towards Ashford from Bedfont, soon after I had heard of the robbery; the road leads from Bedfont to Ashford, and then into the Staines road again; I saw this cart with two men in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the cart? - A. A furlong's length.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they going fast or slow? - A.Middling fast; after the goods were found and picked up, we were looking about, and this cart came up with two men in it, close to the road; they had both snuff-coloured great coats on; they walked the horse along till they came to the place where the first truss was found over the hedge; and then, seeing us, they set off full speed, as hard as they could make their horse go, with whipping and cutting.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sort of a field was it? - A. A bean field; we were looking after the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Did you observe them doing any thing as they walked along? - A. No, only looking over the hedge, as the other walked along.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You saw the man in the cart plain enough? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Did you observe any writing upon the cart? - A. Yes, but I did not observe what it was.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am ostler at the Black Dog, Bedfont: On the 11th of August, two men came in a little green cart to my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the cart? - A.Not when I first came in; after they asked me the way to Staines, I looked to see where it came from, and I rubbed off the dirt, and saw, upon a square plate, John Palmore, Kingston, Surrey; it was a good while before I could read it, it was all over dirt; they went into the house, and had something to drink, and they came out again, and said, how far is it to Staines, three miles and a half is not it? and I said, yes Sir; when they first came in, one man had a light coloured great coat, and the other had a dark coat; but I did not observe very particularly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did they bait the horse? - A. Yes; they gave him a seed of corn, and went away towards Staines; they left the cart and horse, and returned again, it might be in about half an hour; they came up the road again from towards Staines, and ordered me to put the horse to as fast as possible, and I did; they drank a pot of beer while I harnessed the horse; the mare was a little restive, and I took her by the head and led her out; they went off as fast as they could well trot towards Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing about the great coats, whether they had them on when they went back? - A. I did not know whether they had or not; but, after the robbery was done, John Teams brought in two great coats, one of which I know was the one the little man had on; the other I am not positive to.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. -Q. As soon as you heard any thing of this business, what did you do? - A.About two o'clock I went towards Staines, and overtook the waggon; he had found one box and one truss, and then he said he had lost another truss, and asked me to assist in finding it, and we found it in a bean field; he said, he did not know whether he had lost any thing else or not; he thought the best way was for us to look about, and in the next field, an oat field, I picked up these two great coats, and just as I picked the great coats up, the green chaise cart came up, and I took them up to the Black Dog.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Ives). Are these the coats you saw? - A. Yes; this, I am sure, was worn by one of them; the other, I cannot be sure of.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose were they? - A. They were several people's; I was to deliver them to different owners in Carnaby-market, and in the streets round; as I came up Holborn-hill, there was a parcel of men followed me; there might he twenty, or more; they surrounded me just before I got to Gray's-inn-lane, and turned one of them down Gray's-inn-lane; they found that bullock would not run; it turned round again to look for the others, and it came back again to the drove; I went on, and some of them followed behind me, till I got almost up to Queen-street, and then I met Mr. Johnson, the gentleman at the bar; he passed by me; there were two or three more; he was on one side of the beasts, and there was one dressed in black on the other side of them; between <placeName id="t17970920-66-crimeloc351">Queen-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Who is that young man? - A. Mr. Pitt; afterwards Mr. Johnson drove them down into Hart-street, and Pitt holloaed out to another butcher to stop those beasts, and he turned them down a gateway; his name is Watkins; and afterwards Mr. Johnson and two more ran down Hart-street away from them; we pursued them, and took Mr. Johnson in at a mercer's shop in Holborn; he went in there to look at a pattern-book; after that we took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoner before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the rest of those twenty people that were all together? - A. There were some before me and some behind me; three of them ran down Hart-street, two besides him; the other two ran down Holborn, and two made towards Bloomsbury-market.</p>
               <p>Q.How was the prisoner dressed at that time? - A. In a lightish coat, and a red waistcoat and boots.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. As nigh as I can guess, about nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Never having seen the prisoner before, and being in a different dress than he is now, are you sure he is the man? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never lose sight of him? - A. No, only while he went into the shop; he turned the corner, and the mercer's shop is a very little way from the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that the man you saw hovering about the cattle, was the same man that you took in the shop? - A. Yes, I am sure he was the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a servant to Steele? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He employs others besides you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he did on this day, did not he? - A. No; there was only a boy with me, George Jenkins.</p>
               <p>Q. He saw the whole of this? - A. No, he was not there the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. He was employed to assist you? - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Steel himself is only a drover? - A. He is a master drover.</p>
               <p>Q.How many heads of cattle had you? - A. I cannot tell; there might be five or six-and-twenty; sometimes I have more.</p>
               <p>Q. You desired this lad to assist you in driving the cattle? - A. I asked him to come along home with me.</p>
               <p>Q. For no purpose? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Not to assist you in driving the cattle? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear to that Jury, that you did not desire him to attend you home to assist you? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a drover in the City of London, attending Smithfield market? - A. I do not know how long; I have been off and on two or three years, to drive for Mr. Steele of a Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you drive for any body else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of a bullock being hunted before? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever enter into your mind, that because a parcel of young men hunted a bullock, they meant to steal it? - A. I cannot tell what he intended.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a nefarious practice, and I wish it was put an end to? - A. It is a pity but it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you believe this man meant to steal the bullock? - A. I cannot tell his meaning.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not your said since that time, that you believed be meant it for the purpose of hunting it, having no idea that he meant to steal it? - A. No, I did not say any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said so? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any thing like it, that he meant it merely for the purpuse of hunting, and not stealing it? - A. NO, I have not said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Never to any body? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you said nothing of that kind to any body? - A. I believe I told Mr. Hanson that I did not think he meant to steal it.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you have been denying it all the time-You know the brindle bullock you have been speaking of-Were you the person that told them to change that bullock, which was hunted out first in Gray's-inn-lane, for the brindle bullock, which was a fitter bullock to hunt? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, you were not the person? - A. NO.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear that said by any of your party at that time? - A. No, by nobody then; I heard it said in Hart-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was it not yourself? - A. No, it was one of the bullock-hunters.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How did you know in Hart-street, that he was one of the twenty that surrounded you at the bottom of Holborn? - A. He surrounded the bullock in both places.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do not you know that he has surrendered to take his trial; that he was bailed before my Lord Kenyon? -</p>
               <p>Court. He surrendered in presence of the Jury.</p>

             sworn. - I am a butcher: On the 24th of July, I was going to deliver bills out for my master; I live in Theobald's-road; going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200071"/>across towards Hart-street, I saw three beasts running along; I saw it was a lot of bullock-hunters, about twenty of them, with sticks in their hands; they were running along; I heard one of them say, d-n your eyes, turn him out, it is the brindled bullock; Mr. Johnson was in amongst the three beasts, with a stick in his hand, picking this brindled bullock out, and he would not go out; I took the stick out of the drover's hand, Mumford, I knew him, and said, you shall not have the bullock; the first man that comes up, says I, I will knock him down, let him be who he will; there was a young fellow that is here; I called to him to stop the beast, and upon his coming up, Johnson made off, and he turned the beast down into a gateway; I do not know who it belonged to, but I did not like to see any man's property run away with; I pursued Johnson down Bow-street into Holborn, and we found him in a house looking at some waistcoat pieces; he begged and prayed that I would let him go, and I said, I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the person you saw amongst the three beasts, was the man you saw in the shop? - A. The man that I saw driving the three beasts, is Mr. Johnson, at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he separate from the rest of the bullocks? - A. Two or three hundred yards, I suppose; I did not look to see where they were; I thought it my duty, if I possibly could save the man's bullock, to do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where was it you met Mumford? - A. In Bloomsbury-square, leading into Hart-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these bullocks ever out of your fight? - A. No; I was within about four or five hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the man, who was driving the other bullocks, might see it as well as yourself? - A. I do not know what the other man saw.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. It might be nine or ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a very busy time of the day? - A. No, it is a bye street; I suppose there were one hundred people surrounded us at least.</p>
               <p>Q. You took Mumford's stick out of his hand, and swore, that the first man that came up, you would knock him down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mumford was willing they should be drove away? - A. No, only he is not a young fellow of any spirit at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Your resistance was in itself sufficient to stop them? - A. No, they dispersed.</p>
               <p>Q. If Mumford had been as active as you, would not they also have dispersed? - A. He was as active in many things.</p>
               <p>Q. The little spirit that you used, was sufficient to disperse  them? - A. Yes; seeing us resolute, they dispersed.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us they appeared to you to be a parcel of bullock-hunters? - A. Yes; they meet people, and take people's property, and drive them at night, till they have been killed.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no idea that he meant to do any thing more than hunt it? - A. I do not know what he meant to do.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him to Bow-street, did not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you take him to his father's? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there is a penalty of forty shillings upon the conviction of a person hunting bullocks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard of it? - A. No; I never heard there was any panalty.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any conversation with the prisoner's father? - A. No; I was sent for to a house in Bow-street; Carpmeal and I were in company with the prisoner's father, and they treated me with wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the prisoner's father, that if he would give you as much as the penalty, you would not appear against him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not in the Brown Bear public house? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You have never laid a wager that you would convict that man here to-day? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not laid a wager that he would be convicted? - A. Yes, I have; I was in a public-house with a friend of Johnson's, and he began upon me, saying I had been bribed; that I had been offered forty guineas, and would not take less than one hundred; he would lay us a guinea to a shilling he was done nothing to, and I accepted the bet.</p>

             sworn. - I am a butcher: On the 24th of July, I was coming down Hart-street, about nine o'clock in the morning, I met three beasts in Bloomsbury-market, and Johnson was in amongst them, driving them along, and there were several more people cried out, turn out the brindled bullock from amongst the three; the last witness ordered me to stop the three beasts, and I ran before them, I stopped them, and turned them down a gateway; and when I turned them down the gateway, one of his companions seemingly, took out a knife, and swore he would cut me down, if I did not let the beasts go by; I said, I would not let the beasts out, and several people gathered round; and when they saw the people gather round, they ran away; we went after this young man, and took him in Holborn.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you desired by Mumford, to assist in driving them home? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Court while Mumford was examined? - A. Part of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You had perhaps attended bullocks from Smithfield before? - A. I never made a practice of it; I have brought home a bullock or two.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been your misfortune perhaps to see that improper practice of bullock-hunting, before now? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe now at this time, that this was meant as bullock-hunting? - A. I could not tell what was meant, but as there were but three beasts, it made me doubt what they intended.</p>
               <p>Q. But you told my Lord that it was meant to single out the brindled bullock? - A. Yes; they said so.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were in doubt before that time as with respect to the three, I suppose you had no doubt about it then? - A. I could not tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a doubt, seeing the three bullocks drove along together, whether that was for bullock hunting; now when you knew that single bullock was singled out, what did you think of it then? - A. I thought it was to be drove away.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear now that you believe it was singled out for the purpose of stealing it? - A. No; I will not swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take upon yourself to swear positively that it was not for the purpose of bullock-hunting, and bullock-hunting only? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. I am very sorry that he was rude enough, even, I believe, to assault you? - A. I gave the assault first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever till that think of pursuing him for robbing you? - A. I had been well informed before that he had robbed me.</p>

You know the tools are wanted where the organ is put up? - A.The tools that are here spoken of, are tools that we use for making our work; when we go to put up an organ, screw-drivers and pincers only are wanted; I have said to this man a number of times, that I have been told that he has hawked pipes about the trade, and he denied that he ever had done it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.What young man was it gave you this wood? - A. He was a German, named Frederick; it is five or six years ago.</p>

               <p>Q. How near was the public-house to Mr. Luffkins's? - A. A quarter of a mile, or more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming up the Angel-road, Islington; I met with a young fellow that asked me to carry it for him; I said, I knew the pig was Mr. Luffkins's, and Mr. Oborne did not know where to find Mr. Luffkins, nor whose pig it was, if I had not told him; I worked for Mr. Luffkins when I was nine years old.</p>

             sworn. - My husband is a shoemaker: I keep a shop for iron and old clothes, and brokery-goods; I had only been three weeks in that business, when this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know the value of things, if you had never been in business before? - A. The woman who kept it before was coming to instruct me.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner? - A. That is the man, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any doubt of it? - A. No, I have not the least doubt but he is the man; he came to my shop about a fortnight ago, and sold me one weight, a half-hundred weight, I gave him one shilling and sixpence for it; about a fortnight after, he brought me another, and I gave him one shilling and sixpence for that; that is all that I ever bought of him; his master came and took them away from my house, about a quarter of an hour after I had bought the least one.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the weight that Mr. Moffatt claimed, the same that the prisoner brought to your house? - A. Yes. (The weights produced).</p>
               <p>Mr. Moffatt. I can swear to one of them particularly, it is marked fifty on the side; it is the last weight that she said she bought; it is a fifty pounds weight, such as we send over to America, to pay for tobacco, and goods that they weigh by the next one hundred, and not the one hundred and twelve; the prisoner has lately come from sea; he has worked for me before; when I went into Mrs. Howard's shop, at first, she said, she had not got a half hundred weight in the house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time the prisoner accosted you, your coat was buttoned up? - A. Yes; and when I went into the house with her, as we were standing by a sofa, she said to me, what is the reason that you have your coat buttoned, and she took hold of the bottom part, and ripped it open; I am sure my coat had not been unbuttoned till then, from the time I left my shop, in Princes-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. When your coat is buttoned, does your pocket-book make an appearance on the outside? - A.

               <p>Read. This is my property, it has my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - A.Twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have more cottons of the same sort, I take it for granted, in your shop? - A. No, I have not; this is a gown-patch.</p>

               <p>Q.And when they are sold, you do not take out your mark? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then such a shawl might get into the world, and into another person's hands? - A. It might, but it is very unlikely.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had some meat and some plumbs when the gentleman laid hold of me; the gentleman said, that as the shawls were stained, I must have had them, for the stain of the meat had come through my apron on to the shawls as I stood at the counter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the house to whom that cellar belongs? - A. Yes; it belongs to the sexton, Mrs. Round; and the prisoner then ran up Aldersgate-street, and turned up Westmoreland-buildings; a man came up, and said, he was an officer; and at the bottom of Westmoreland-buildings, we took him; we carried him to a public-house, and searched him, but there was no sort of coin in the world found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200091"/>upon him; I never lost sight of him; the dollar that I had from the girl, I gave to the constable; if Mr. Meek had come, we should have taken him with all the money about him.</p>

            , whom they called Tommy, who was holding the candle, and doing what other things they might want him to do; seeing they were five, and we but two, I judged it imprudent for me and Mr. Wright to enter the soap-house; in consequence of which, I desired Mr. Wright to go and get some soldiers to our assistance, who were quartered in the neighbourhood; in the mean time I continued to make further observations; Mr. Wright was but just gone from me, when I heard a dog bark in the soap-house; in consequence of which, being fearful of being discovered, I drew back a short distance from the soap-house under a cart; the dog then came out, and Kiernan came out with a candle in his hand; upon which, another dog rushed out, and he called to the dog, and bid him be quiet; but instead of silencing the dog, it irritated him the more; I conceived myself to be in a perilous situation, and I went on the opposite side of the soap-house, and placed myself behind some timber that was placed as a fence on the other side of the road; I remained there till four o'clock in the morning, and then hearing very little noise in the soap-house, and the dog done barking, I approached the door of the soap-house, it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200092"/>partly open; upon looking in, I saw nobody there but Rooke, and I went in and examined the slate of the copper, it appeared to me to have been lately charged; I asked Rooke if they had not been lading it out of the copper; he told me they had not; I then looked round the soap-house, and found a box of soap in a fluid state, under two other boxes; I told him, I had taken an account of what there was, and was going towards the house of Kiernan, where Riley lived, to apprize him of these circumstances; in going there, I met Mr. Wright, and in consequence of what I heard from him, we went in to Kiernan's, his daughter saw us across the garden; I then went to the spot where I had received information from Mr. Wright, that the rest of the soap had been conveyed; while we were searching, Kiernan came out in a violent hurry, asked me what business I had there, took me by the collar, and threw me against Mr. Wright; I told him I was come about a quantity of soap that I was informed had been carried there; he told me the information was false, that I had no authority to come there, and at the same time, caught up a pitchfork, and swore he would stick me through, unless I quitted the premises immediately, making one or two thrusts at me; I then went out on the Common with Mr. Wright, and told him it was necessary he should go to get more assistance, he not having been able to procure any, as I was determined to see the matter through before I quitted the premises; Kiernan went into his house, and returned again shortly after, desiring me to walk in, that we might talk the matter over together, as he took me to be another sort of person; I told him, I came there to do my duty, and I was resolved on doing it; he went in again, and returned with the prisoner and his son; his son ran out on the Common, and caught a horse; while the prisoner entered into conversation with me, Kiernan harnessed the horse, and placed him in the cart; he then

             the cart towards the stable, took a key out of his pocket, and unlocked the padlock; upon which, Kiernan and Riley took out four boxes of soap, and put them in the cart; when the cart was loaded, and they were going to drive it out of the yard, I attempted to walk away to the lower gate, where the cart was to be brought out, when the prisoner at the bar sprung on me, and wrested a large stick which I had, out of my hand; he then struck me several blows, aiming at my head; which I caught on my arm; seeing two soldiers approach, I closed with him, to prevent him from striking me; and in the struggle, the prisoner being joined by Owen Rooke, who had a hoe in his hand, I fell to the ground; the prisoner falling on me, we struggled together for some time; at length I regained my legs; I kept pursuing the cart, Brady keeping close up with me; the soldiers being at this time engaged with the other two men, began to call out for further assistance; when I had got some way on the Common, the prisoner attacked me again; he struck me several blows with the same stick; when closing with him again, we both fell to the ground; he got his fingers inside my neckcloth, and gave it a twist; Rooke then came up with the hoe in his hand, and called out to him, to lay me out, and he would finish me; upon which, he made two blows at my head with the back part of the hoe; having on a high crowned hat, and one or two handkerchiefs tucked in the top of it, it broke the blow and prevented it doing me any injury; one of the soldiers then coming to my assistance, Rooke was drawn off from me; I begged they would not murder me, and having committed one crime, add to it another of a more heinous nature; I reasoned with them as they lay upon me; the prisoner then got off me, and I went on; Rooke then pursued me, having left the soldiers, and made several blows at me with the he, which blows I avoided by doubling forward; upon which I put my hand into my great coat pocket, and drew a pistol out; I told him, if he struck another blow at me, I would fire at him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your pistol loaden? - A. Yes; but I had not produced it before; I passed him, and then the prisoner, whom I threatened, if he attempted to strike at me I would do the same by him, Kiernan was some way on, engaged with one of the soldiers; I then came up with him; he struck at me with a pitchfork; I told him to be careful how he struck again, as I was determined to fire at him if he aimed another blow at me, when, seeing some more soldiers coming to my assistance, he desisted from striking any more at me; I pursued the cart, and came up with it; Kiernan's lad, who was driving the cart, struck me with a supple-jack that he had in his hand; I immediately jumped into the cart, took the cover off one of the boxes, and found it to contain soap in a fluid state, quite warm; I took possession of it accordingly; I should suppose there was about seven hundred weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the duty upon soap? - A.Twopence farthing a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you much hurt by these blows? - A. Very much about the arms; I could not put on a close-bodied coat for several days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you taken any measures to find out this man, and the others? - A. Yes, as long as I remained in that part of the country, but I was never able to find them; I indicted them the July Sessions of that year, within a month or two after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Runnington. Q. How long have you been in the service of the Ex<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200093"/>cise? - A.Upwards of seven years, in different departments.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the 20th of April, 1795? - A. On the night of the 20th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I arrived at the soap-house, and, about four in the morning of the 26th, I went in; it was a little after day-break.</p>
               <p>Q.You went to a spot of which you had received information from Wright to search? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what did you go to search for? - A. A quantity of soap which had been conveyed from the soap-house that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. I presume being an officer of Excise, you sent for a constable? - A. I told Mr. Wright to get proper assistance.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Baron. There was no occasion for it, brother.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Runnington. Q. When Kiernan first had you by the collar, he asked you for your authority? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course I presume you produced one? - A. Not having a warrant about me, I quitted the premises; I thought having seen the goods in the soap-house; we thought the goods would be conveyed away if we waited for a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not obtain a warrant to search these premises from any Magistrate? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You went for no other object at all but the fair exercise of your duty to discover this soap? - A. No other.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't doubt but you were grossly ill used; but do you really mean to state, upon your oath, that you believe he meant to strangle you when you were struggling? - A. I do not know what he intended; I believe he had no other intention.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Two young women came out, and screamed out, that you would hurt the prisoner? - A.They were acquainted with him, and were afraid of his being hurt in the struggle; one of them was a young woman, the other was going on towards fifty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay any information against Riley, or state to the Board that he was the owner of the premises? - A. I acquainted my supervisor of it, and I went before a Magistrate, and made an affidavit.</p>
               <p>Q. And Riley was condemned in the penalty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of which you received a part? - A. No penalty has ever been obtained from him yet.</p>
               <p>Q. But you would have had it if you could-Have not all his effects been seized? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were well acquainted with the prisoner, I suppose? - A. I had seen him twice before; I have heard, since I have been in London, that he has a large family.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, you have been absent for sixteen months? - A. Yes; as an Excise officer, at Plymouth.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you gave immediate information to the Board? - A.Information was sent off that very morning to the supervisor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Have you seen those women about the Court here to-day? - A. No, I do not know that I have.</p>
               <p>Q. You have come up from Plymouth to give evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have done all in your power to find these men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Riley is also gone off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I understand the learned Serjeant does not mean to controvert the fact, and therefore it will be needless to call other witnesses to confirm Mr. Whately.(Mr. Serjeant Runnington having addressed the Jury very briefly, addressed the Court as follows:)</p>
               <p>My LORDS,</p>
               <p>I take it, that standing as this case now does, it is clear to demonstration, that this is a case exclusively an offence within the Excise laws. When that has been proved in evidence, and when I look to the foundation of this indictment, I, for one, feel extreme astonishment what man in the profession could have framed it as applicable to any existing Excise law. It has been proved, unequivocally, that the witness went, in the fair exercise of his duty, as a Revenue-officer, for the purpose of hindering the concealment of soap, and that, in the exercise of that duty, the obstruction took place. I asked whether in point of fact, when he was asked for his authority, he had any; his answer decidedly was, No. I asked him, upon that, if he had taken the precaution to obtain a search-warrant; he answered me, No. It was his duty, as an Excise-officer, to clothe himself with that authority.

            . cap. 21. sec. 34. it is expressly required, I contend, therefore, that he was not in the due execution of his office; but was, in point of fact, a trespasser; insomuch, that if he had been put to death, it could not have been constructed into murder. I therefore contend, that this man is entitled to an acquittal. But, perhaps, before I sit down, I have a right to ask, and I do ask with confidence, how this particular offence can be deemed an offence against any written or known law of Excise now existing in the country? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What statute do you indict upon? -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The 24th of Geo. III. cap. 47.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Runnington. I need not state to your Lordships that this indictment, being framed upon that Act of Parliament, your Lordships will look with eagles' eyes to this record, and see whether, in point of law, looking to both, and attending to the evidence, it is possible, for one instant, that this indictment can be supported. We all know, with respect to the Revenue laws, the Customs, and Excise, have each a distinct code of laws, as much as two persons can be distinct. That being the case, and your Lordship being now told, that this is an indictment framed upon the 24th of Geo. III. cap. 47. I call upon your Lordship to look<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200094"/>into that Act of Parliament, and see whether it can possibly attach to this case, this being an offence against the Excise. In the very title of it, it is an act for the more effectual prevention of smuggling. It then goes on to slate, in direct and positive terms, what is meant by this Act. It then enacts a vast number of clauses which relate, in express terms, to smuggling only, and to foreign commodities, or such contraband goods as are for smuggling only. I need not slate to your Lordship that, in construing an Act of Parliament, if a doubt arises, you are to construe one part by the other. Now, if that be a correct principle, look at this particular Act; it is, unequivocally, an Act to prevent the abominable practice of smuggling; then, I ask, how a domestic situation, like this, can possibly be applied to this Act. I therefore trust the Court will think this a strong additional argument in support of the former; if so, I contend upon both these grounds, that this man is entitled to an acquittal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This Act, it is true, is made for the prevention of smuggling; but I do not say that this is not the very practice of smuggling alluded to here. The 10th of Ann, cap. 19. sec. 19. says, that all soap, oil, tallow, and other materials for manufacturing soap, which shall be found in any private boiling-house, work-house, warehouse, or other place; and all private coppers, kettles, furnaces, troughs, and other vessels, for which no entry shall be made, or notice given, shall be forfeited and lost; and the same, and the value thereof, shall and may be seized. Now where is this found; is it found in a place entered? - It is actually seized upon the open common, conveyed in a cart, concealed from view, it is in the cart, out of the proper place where it ought to be, and, therefore, liable to seizure; and, if liable to seizure, the officer was correctly in his duty, and in the fair execution of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Runnington. I really ought to beg pardon for replying to such an observation, when I am told that this is an indictment founded upon 24

               <p>Lord Chief Baron. I have carried on an hundred such prosecutions, when I was Attorney General, upon the general law, but it is one of those cases which are so common, that one forgets the authority for them; I own that I am ashamed at not being able to recollect it. The other appears to me the strongest objection, whether a warrant is necessary. It is very necessary that a warrant should be had when any place is to be entered; but the present case is, that coming to search these premises, he sees the soap in the act of carrying from the proper place, not having been in a place that required-entry at all; and at the moment it was carried, out being in no place of concealment, it required nothing but pursuit on the part of the officers; it is, therefore, my private opinion, that a warrant was not necessary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Asbburst. He would not have been justified if his suspicions had been unfounded and vague; but the soap being found in that situation, the fact justifies him; however, you shall have a <rs id="t17970920-95-verdict510" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. (Produces a copy of the record in the action, LYON V. YOUNG.) I am clerk to Mr. Hodgson, attorney for the defendant in that action.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the postea entered up? - A. Yes; (it is read); at the Guildhall of the City of London; verdict for the defendant; tried the 9th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the trial of that action? - A. I was; the present defendant was examined as a witness on the part of the plaintiff.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you desired to take down the question put to him, and his answer? - A. I was, by the Counsel;(reads.) Question put by Mr. Garrow. - "On the 12th of October, was the barge, that was under your care, made fast to the ring at Bell-wharf? - A. She was, at first, when I came there, and when Mr. Young's people came there." The next question -</p>

               <p>"Was it made fast to that ring at the time when Mr. Young cut the rope at the end of his barge? - A. She was not made fast there then." Mr. Garrow again repeated - "Was she at the time when he cut it? - A. No."The next quesstion - "Was there at that time any rope made fast to the ring? - A. No."</p>
               <p>Q."What was the barge made fast to at the time Mr. Young cut the rope? - A. A loose stick;" he explained that by saying" a stick that had not got a fastening put on its end. Mr. Wardell's premises were wrote right over it when it was put down; Mr. Wardell's is the adjoining wharf."</p>
               <p>Q."How long before Mr. Young cut the rope had you loosened it from the ring of Mr. Young's wharf, and made it fast to the stick at Mr. Wardell's? - A. I won't speak to swear it; it might be half an hour, or more."</p>
               <p>Q."Do you believe it was as much as half an hour? - A. I wont say."</p>
               <p>Q."Was the rope that Mr. Young cut, fast to the ring? - A. Not when Mr. Young cut it."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. That you took down by the desire of the Counsel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Harris swore that, was he counselled by any body? - A. He was, frequently, by Mr. Garrow; there were other persons who saw the transaction; he was counselled three or four times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Do I understand you right, that these are the notes you took at the time? - A. No; but these are. (Producing another paper).</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this man under examination? - A. Halt an hour, for any thing I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200095"/>Q. Perhaps an hour? - A. Not so much as that.</p>
               <p>Q. At that examination, this single page and a quarter is all that you took down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took it down in long hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>NICHOLAS GRAHAM sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I attended the action between Mr. Lyon and Mr. Young, at Guildhall, before Lord Kenyon; I saw the prisoner sworn as a witness. I am clerk to Mr. Young, the proprietor of Bell wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present the evening that this matter happened? - A. Yes; Mr. Young had a lighter coming up that was loaded with goods from a Scotch vessel to a large amount, and when they came up to the wharf, we could not get the lighter along side of the wharf, in order to be landed, on account of the prisoner having his barge made fast to Mr. Young's premises.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A.About ten o'clock at night, or a little after, on the 12th of October last; he was in Mr. Lyon's barge, he is servant to Mr. Lyon, who brought the action against Mr. Young; five or six of us were standing by to unload the lighter, and we solicited him to flack out his headfast, in order to get our lighter along side; we made several attempts to prevail upon him, but he would not; he told us that he would not flack her, and if any of us entered the barge, in order to flack her, he would shoot us, and he loaded his blunderbuss before us so to do; we stood with him in that situation for about ten or fifteen minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. To what was this barge fastened? - A. It was made fast to the ring on Mr. Young's premises; then Mr. Young came upon the wharf, and he asked the prisoner to flack out, in order to get Mr. Young's lighter along side the wharf, for if he did not, he must be under the necessity of cutting his headfast; he positively refused, in the same manner that he had done before; Mr. Young called for an adze, and went into his barge, and cut the rope from the ring.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could not he have done it upon the wharf? - A.No; it might be about a yard from the wharf down to the barge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. At the very time that Mr. Young cut the headfast, where was it fastened to? - A. To the ring on Mr. Young's premises; after that we shoved his barge about twenty or thirty yards out, and got our lighter in, and made his fast to ours, and he was in her in his business the next morning, as well as if she had been where Mr. Young had cut her from.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man? - A. It was dark at that time of night, I can only say from his voice.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any lights upon the wharf? - A. There were lanthorns and candles.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Might any body on board the barge have seen what Mr. Young did? - A. Yes; I was on board the barge, and Mr. Thompson, at the same time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Did you see this man sworn and examined as a witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What did he say there? - A. That he was a watchman on board Mr. Lyon's barge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Mr. Wardell's wharf and Mr. Young's wharf adjoin? - A.No; there is a common sewer between.</p>
               <p>Q.Vessels may lie opposite the common fewer, may they not? - A. No vessel could lie there without trespassing on Mr. Young's premises.</p>
               <p>Q. How wide is the common fewer? - A.About twelve feet.</p>
               <p>Q. It is arched over? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose premises are those over this common fewer? - A. Mr. Wardell's.</p>
               <p>Q.The ring to which this headfast was tied, was at the extreme of Mr. Young's premises? - A. Within a foot, or a foot and a half.</p>
               <p>Q.How far off these premises is there or has there been a pile? - A. Within about a foot and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not likewise another pile about two or three feet off that? - A.No, there is only one.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a now a pile about a foot and a half off this ring? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am the proprietor of Bell wharf; the night that I expected the goods, I desired all my men to attend.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to your wharf, how did you find Mr. Lyon's lighter? - A. It was made fast to my ring; I asked the man the reason why he had made it fast there, or if any body had given him leave to make it fast, as the premises were mine; he said, he had had leave frow nobody, but that the barge should continue there; I told him, if she did continue there, it was not possible for me to get in my lighter; he still refused moving her, or permitting my people to assist in moving her; I told him, if he did not, that I should certainly cut the headfast; he said, that if I came on board the barge that he had the charge of, he would shoot me; I told him, my lighter is come here on the outside, with a very valuable cargo, which I suppose might amount to 20,000l.; although he told me he would fire at me, I told him, I am determined, at all events, that the barge shall go out, and I immediately jumped into the barge; one of my clerks immediately followed me; I then cut the headfast, which was made fast to my ring; I gave charge to my lighterman to take care of the barge, and make it secure on the outside, which they did; the prisoner was then standing at the head of the barge.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he see what you were about? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any ring whatever fixed to Mr. Wardell's premises? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had a long conversation with him? - A. Yes; I wished to persuade him very much, and he insisted he had a right to come there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At the time of cutting the rope, one or two of the clerks came in at the head of the barge? - A. Yes; there were Mr. Graham and Mr. Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe they were employed in holding him, to prevent him in obstructing you in cutting the rope? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Could this man by possibility be ignorant where the rope was fastened? - A. He could not; I told him several times it was made fast to my ring.</p>

               <p>In this case, the only venue that is stated, is the Guildhall of the City of London, which is certainly a distinct mark not easily mistaken; but it is not that which the law requires, it is not a parish or a vill, from which a Jury can come; it is a place distinctly known, but is not a place from which a Jury can be summoned.</p>

            732, Forth and Harrison: "a debt on a bond demurrer and error, and it was contended there, that the plea was good enough for the payment alledged apud London, in his house at Cheapside is good, and it is not of necessity to alledge a parish or a ward, no more than where a thing is alledged to be at Bristol, or any other city, and all the writ of right and preciptes, are of a messuage in London, without naming any parish or ward. It was contended on the other hand, that it ought of necessity, to be alledged in what parish or ward the house is for the trial, as where payment is alledged at his house in any country, it ought to be alledged in what vill it is, for the venue to have a trial. And so is 7 Henry vi. 36. that a parish and ward in London, are as a vill or hamlet in other counties, and what hath always been used and observed, is to be taken for law, and of those parishes and wards, the Court may well take conusance. And the Prothonotary of the Common Bench, and Kemp, Secondary of the Queen's Bench, certified that their course always hath been to plead any act done in London to be done at such a parish and ward, for the venue, and for this defect they held the plea to be ill."</p>
               <p>This case is in Croke Eliz. and the same doctrine is followed up in Croke James 150, Normanvile and Pope. This case was moved again in Arrest of Judgment, and an exception taken, which was not taken before; because it is not alledged to what Parish in London he returned, but to London generally, which is not good, but it ought to have been to a parish from which a venue might have been, and for this cause, all the Court held the declaration to be ill.</p>
               <p>There is another case in the same book 307. Error of a Judgment in the Common Pleas. Several Errors are assigned, the 4th Error assigned is, that the Vemire Furint is awarded, de vicineto cvortetis Coventria which ought not to be, the Court much doubted, and caused a search to be made of the Precedents in the Common-Please and King's-Bench for this point, and upon view of precedents in all places, except London, no mention is made of the parish or ward. In that case the Judgment was affirmed.</p>
               <p>And, my Lord, this doctrine is recognized in 3 Hawkins 336, where there is a long discussion upon it; and upon this ground it hath been adjudged, that a venue may come, not only from a town, but from a ward, parish, hamlet, burgh, manor, castle, or even from a forest, or other place known out of a town: He goes on to stare, "Also, if a fact done in a vill, within a parish, which contains drivers vills, be in the Count, in an appeal alledged generally in the parish, or a fact done in a city, which contains drivers parishes, be in the Count, in an appeal alledged generally in the city; it seems, that the defendant may plead such matter in abatement, for otherwise he could take no advantage of the insufficiency of the allegation, because the place named, as it stands on the record, must, till the contrary be shewn, he intended to contain no more than one town or parish, on which supposition a visne may well come, de vicineto civitatis, which does not exclude the city, but takes in the city and its neighbourhood within its jurisdiction, whether such city be within a county, or be a county of itself, excepting only the City of London, from whence it seems, that no visne can come, not only by reason of the largeness of its extent, but also because it hath been the constant usage of pleading, to shew the ward and parish, in which a fact alledged in London was done."</p>
               <p>Court. These are all in civil actions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. This is a case of appeal. In 4 Hawkins 47, under the head of indictments, he says, "it hath been adjudged, that a fact laid in a parish of London, with some other addition, as in the parish of St. Michael, Wood-street, London; or in the parish of St. Lawrence Jewry, is good, without shewing the ward in which the parish lies." Therefore, from that I am entitled to argue, that if the indictment does not state both the parish and the ward, slating the parish generally is not sufficient, but they must go on to fix and describe that parish beyond doubt, as in the parish of St. Michael, in Wood-street, London, or in the parish of St. Lawrence Jewry."But these matters having been more fully treated of in the chapter of appeals, and also in the foregoing part of the chapter, relaring to the certainty of the time of the offence, I shall refer the reader thither."</p>
               <p>Court. That proves that the ward need not be inserted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Yes, but the parish must be inserted; but here they have not only stated no ward, but they have stated no parish whatever, nothing more than the Guildhall of the City of London.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This objection comes upon me by surprize. In the first place, I was not the person who drew this indictment. I should, certainly, if I had been drawing it, have inserted the parish and ward, though I believe it has been held. that the City of London is sufficient, but the law is not clear from the cases put by my learned friend, Mr. Gurney, for Hawkins expresses himself with great uncertainty about the law, that be here gives to the public. He says here, "except the City of London, from whence it seems that no venue can come, not only by reason of the largeness of its extent, but also because it hath been the constant usage of pleading, to shew the ward and parish in which a fact alledged in London was done." Now, therefore, Sir, you know perfectly, that Serjeant Hawkins wherever he ties himself down to this expression, it seems to be so and so, does not give that as a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200097"/>thing so unequivocally ruled, as that it may not be the subject of discussion hereafter, and I am more inclined to see this as a matter of doubt, because he has given the authorities upon which he goes. He says, "excepting only the City of London;" and here is a reference to "I Sidersin 178, Croke James, 307. 2 Rolls Abr. 622, Croke James 150, Query Croke

            732, Contra Stannford's Pleas of the Crown 154. 2 Rolles Abr. 617," therefore, most undoubtedly, this was not in the opinion of the author who wrote, a clear point, and he is speaking only of cases in the nature of civil actions. That there is a case which has ruled, that the City of London is sufficient I am certain, though I cannot recollect the case, it comes upon me by surprize, not only because I was not the drawer of the Indictment, but my brief does not even furnish me with a correct copy of the indictment. Hawkins says, a venue may come from a castle, now, if a castle is a place from which a Jury may be summoned, so may Guildhall, where the officers reside.</p>
               <p>Court. It is certainly a point of great consequence; the only idea in my mind is, that the City of London is sufficient, and I am confident there is a case that goes the whole length, but I certainly will not decide it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. In 2 Hale 262, chap. 34. he says,"If the murder be alledged, apud civitatem, Bristol, the venite sacias is most properly de Bristol, and it is good became a city." And here he quotes 7 Henry 4, title Inquest 36,</p>
               <p>"but if it be from a place, not a city, it must be de vicineto de D. but though it be a city, the unire sacias de vicineto civitatis Bristol, is good, though it be also a county as hath been often resolved against the opinion of Staunford."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The following paragraph in Hale is very strong,</p>
               <p>"If a murder be laid in quadam platea vocat. King-street, in Parochia Santla Margaritor apud Civitatem Westminster, the visne shall be neither from King-street, because it is alledged to be only plataa, nor de vicineto civitatis Westminster, but de vicineto parochioe Sanctoe Margarita."</p>
               <p>Court. In answer to that, Westminster has not a Jury distinct, but it is a Jury of the county. The prisoner at present must stand committed, and I shall look into it.</p>
