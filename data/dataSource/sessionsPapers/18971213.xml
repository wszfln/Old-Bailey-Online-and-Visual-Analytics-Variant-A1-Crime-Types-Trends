I live at 18, Redwald Road, Clapton—the defendants took one room in my house on November 14, 1896, and con-tinued to live there till the present time—when they came they had five children—one died a few months ago—the eldest was nine years old—there were four children when Julia Price was confined of male twins on September 8th—I saw them when they were three weeks old—they seemed fairly well and healthy—they progressed a few weeks—about a month before they died, on September 16th and 17th, they became very frail, and threw their food up—Julia used to say she had not sufficient food to keep them on; that she was short of money—the husband went out and returned after eleven or twelve at night, generally the worse for drink—when he was going away in the morning she said, "Are you going to leave me with a few halfpence again, what are you going to do for the children?"—sometimes he would make no answer and sometimes he would say, "You can do the best you can."—that happened before and after the twins were born when the wife was kept short of money—Julia used to go to the City to fetch work and do it at home—I looked after the children in her absence—she was a ladies' velvet hat and bonnet maker—she left a little milk in a bottle for the twins—if the babies cried before she came back I gave them a little of mine—on November 8th one of the twins had a fit—I advised her to go to the doctor—she went to the doctor and the relief officer, who came on the 16th, when Frederick William died—I saw the children when Julia fetched her work, not when the prisoners were there—the first three weeks Julia fetched condensed milk and Ridge's food—about the Friday before they died I noticed them fall away—they only had clothing that a neighbour gave them—the room was furnished with a chair, a broken chair, a bed and bedstead, a small table and a small bed, the children used to sleep on—one bed had a bolster and pillows, two old sheets and an overcoat, from what I saw the day before Mrs. Price was confined—the mother and father slept on the bedstead, the others slept on the floor on a small bed in a piece of coarse sacking, and pillows—when the babies were three weeks old the wash hand basin was broken and they</p>

I am Relieving Officer for the Hackney District—on November 16th I went to the prisoner's room in consequence of the female prisoner's application—I saw the twins—I called the male prisoner's attention to the serious state of the children, especially Frederick who was apparently blind and dying—he said he was all right and enjoying himself, and it would be a good job when they were both dead—I asked him what his earnings had been for the previous week—he said £1 13s.—he was the worse for drink—Dr. Turtle came a few minutes afterwards, and said that in his opinion it was a case of murder and, "What have you to say to it, Price?"—the male prisoner said it was a case of murder, and imputed blame to his wife, and said he was happy, he was all right and enjoying himself—he said his wife had not looked after the children, properly: that they had been neglected—the wife was present—she had told me when applying for medical orders that she had earned 9s. the the week previous—that was for the same week that the prisoner had earned £1 13s.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statements before the Magistrate: Charles Price says;</hi> "These children have been very much neglected by the mother, not for food, but they had not been kept clean. Occasionally she has had to go to the City to her employment, then the children were in the hands of Mrs. Morgan. She used to have to give them milk to feed them. Very often after that the children were very bad, vomiting, so I took the children in hand myself for a week during the day. In three days they left off their vomiting and took their milk properly. I went to work on a Friday about a fortnight before they died. I told my wife not to let Mrs. Morgan take the children in hand again. When I came home that night I asked after the youngsters, and she said Mrs. Morgan had been giving them more of her milk, and from that day they kept nothing on their stomachs-and gradually wasted away. I sat at home on the 16th when Dr. Turtle came, I had only had one half-a-pint of ale. I may have been excited. I was very much upset. I told Dr. Turtle I believed the children had been murdered, and I believe it now." <hi rend="italic">Julia Price says</hi>: "The child the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> was held on was sick for a fortnight and kept down nothing. The Saturday week before they died I went to the City and left them alright. When I came home I found Frederick William had been very sick and the balls of the eyes looked as if they had been pressed. No one was in the room but my little boy James. I asked him if he had touched the baby's eyes, and he said "No." From that time its eyes began to go bad, and the child was sick from that day."</p>

I am a detective-inspector of the Cardiff Police—on December 9th, 1895, I took Rees in custody on a charge of which he was subsequently acquitted—he was in custody on December 10th, and on that day he asked me to send to the female prisoner at Wyndham Crescent—he called her Mrs. Williams—he wanted her to see what she could do for him—I saw her on the same day at the same station about ten a.m.—I told her that Rees was in custody, and she had been sent for because he wanted to see her about getting a solicitor to defend him—I took her down to No. 5 cell—she saw Rees—he told her his trouble, and asked her what she could do to get him a solicitor—she said, "I will do my best; I will go and see Mr. Rees"—he is no relation, but the name is spelt the same—he said, "Yes, do," and took hold of one of her hands with his, and with the disengaged hand he caught hold of her shoulder, and then kissed her—she then went away, and in about 20 minutes Mr. Davis, a clerk to Mr. Morgan Rees, a solicitor, came to the station and saw the prisoner Rees—they were appearing that day at the police court, and Mr. Morgan Rees appeared for him—i saw Mrs. Williams there—there was a remand till the 17th—I was there, and saw Mrs. Williams there again.</p>

On November 8th, about 8.30 p.m., in consequence of information, I went with Detective Dore to a house in Webb Street, Plaistow, to the top floor occupied by the prisoner and Jane Farratt, and found on the top of a cupboard a mould, with the impressions of the head and tail of a florin, also some plaster of Paris in this bag at the side of the fireplace, also this ladle, a knife, and a small</p>

I did not speak to him then—he was alone and so was I—it was not Captain Rushbrook's wood, but about two miles off—I always called him "Budd,"—I told the police he was called "Budd" and" Lurcher," those are his nicknames—Croft was near enough to hear me say, "I know you Budd," and he knew him as well by sight, the prisoner was then in the shrub—that was the first time I called him "Budd"—the other men were at his back, T could see them but could not identify them, they were too far away—he was 47 yards away when he fired, they might have been some yards at the back of him then—I distinguished the prisoner from the others because I knew him well—the others were 20 or 30 yards away—all this occurred in about 10 or 12 minutes, not more.</p>

I am a fully qualified medical man of 50, Broad Street, Lambeth—on November 16th, in the middle of the day, I went to Mrs. Snelling's shop, and saw the prisoner there, with the child Rose Ethel about two years old, lying on her lap—life was extinct—it had on a chemise, a grey shawl and a black shawl somewhat similar to what the prisoner has on—that clothing was not sufficient for it—I examined it, it was fairly well nourished—the face and body were dirty—the face had apparently not been washed—I cannot say whether it was habitual dirt—I will not say that it had not been cleaned for days, but there was continuous neglect—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination and found that it had been suffering from acute pneumonia before death for three or four days judging from the state of the lungs—it would be obvious to the mother that the child was suffering, there would be certain symptoms, first cough, secondly, quickened breath, thirdly, fever and increased heat of the body—I heard the way it was clothed when the police went into the room—that would be injurious—it ought to be very different in regard to clothing—it was "most improper to take it out in that condition.</p>

On December 4th the last witness came to the station—I saw on his neck a very red mark—I could see where finger marks had been—he said he had been robbed—on the following day I was near the Gordon public-house, and saw the prisoner—I arrested him in consequence of a description—he said, "This is all right on a Sunday; God strike me dead, guvernor, I did not have it, but I heard the old man had been robbed"—at the station this cap lay on a stand, and he tried it on, and said, "This one fits me, but I have not had it on for months"—at the station before he was charged he said, "I never see the man," pointing to the prosecutor, "You make a great mistake, Mr. Cowley, I have never been near his stables, and I do not know where his stables are; I never saw half-a-sovereign, let alone £4—you are charging me for nothing—that cap has nothing to do with me"—Cowley brought the cap to the station, and handed it to me—I found on the prisoner 6d. in silver and 2 1/2d. in bronze.</p>
