                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Buckingham-street, Strand. Mr. Thomas Holt is a client of mine—I have known the prisoner twenty-five years, but not to be on terms of communication—on 31st Oct., last year, he applied to me to know if I could raise 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the furniture and household effects of a gentleman of first-rate standing—after some little debate, I told him I had no doubt I could—he then said, "Then it is for your humble servant"—I made some little hesitation, but he had got his carriage at my door, and urged me to go over and look at the property—I went with him in</p>

               <p>his carriage to Holly-house, New Kent-road—I was shown the furniture, and from my previous knowledge of the prisoner, I was perfectly staggered to see him in such a position of life—it was a large house, elegantly furnished—he said it contained twenty-two rooms—I did not go over them all—I agreed that 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be advanced—I in point of fact agreed that the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be advanced, but he was to produce his plate first—he made a communication to me the following day, saying that 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would answer his purpose; and, as I had no doubt about the value of the furniture, I assented—I told him that as this must be a matter strictly conducted on principles of business, I should require him to make a solemn declaration, under the Act of Parliament, that the property was not in any way encum<lb/>bered—(on my first going to his house, I asked him if the property was not settled on his wife—he said, "Oh! no, my dear fellow, I have been doing excellently, I have been getting 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the last three years")—he appointed to call at my office, in Buckingham-street, on the Tuesday morning prior to the appointment to make the declaration at the Bow-street police-office—he did not call—he agreed to make the declaration—it was prepared, and he was to have sent me the inventory of the furniture—on the Tuesday morning, instead of calling on me, he sent his carriage for me, and I took the declaration and other papers with me to his house, and found him there waiting, Mr. Holt had not arrived—he arrived afterwards, and in his presence I read the declaration over to the prisoner, who had gone out in the mean-time between my arrival and Mr. Holt's, to declare to it at the Southwark police-office—I had read it over to him first—he brought it back to me—I said, "We can't complete the business to-day, you never sent me the inven<lb/>tory of the furniture"—he said he had sent it by a friend of his, and he concluded that I should come with the securities perfect—I did not go with him to the Southwark police-court—he returned with the declaration, and said he had been—he said, "Here is the declaration"—I examined it, and it appeared to have been perfectly made—after Mr. Holt arrived, it was read over again in his presence and the prisoner's—320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced on that day on the urgent application of the prisoner, he giving me his assurance that the deed should be executed as soon as the inventory was attached to it—this is the bill of sale (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have not got a farthing of the money back.</p>

A. B.," and this "G. A. B." is in my writing—I do not generally put the Magistrate's initials myself, but my attention was called to it a few minutes after the declaration was made—Mr. A'Beckett was absent for a few minutes, and I changed the county from Middlesex to Surrey, and put the initials, but he disapproved of it afterwards—these other two are in the Magistrate's writing, and this is mine—sometimes declarations are brought signed, the Magistrate then asks the party if it is his signature, and certifies to it on its being admitted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor to Mr. Thomas Holt. On 31st. last year, the prisoner applied to me for an advance of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he proposed the security of the household furniture, plate, &amp;c, of the gentleman upon whose behalf he professed to apply, which he afterwards declared to be himself—he had his carriage at the door, and at his solicitation I went with him to his house, called Holly-house, in the New Kent-road—I went over the prin<lb/>cipal rooms of the house, the drawing-room, dining-room, chief bedrooms, and so forth—I then told him. that my opinion unhesitatingly was that the property had cost him more money, but I could not advise any client to lend 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it without the valuation of an auctioneer an to what it was likely to realise—he had spoken of having a large amount of plate, and I said, "If you will let me see the plate, I shall be able to judge without any difficulty"—he said the plate was locked up previous to his wife going out of town, and she was then at Herne Bay—I saw the furniture, linen, china, glass, and other things, except the wine—I said to him, in rather a familiar manner, "Why, my dear fellow, you have got into a very splendid position here; it this at all settled on your wife?"—he said No; that be had been doing a very successful business, amounting to 3,000. a year, for several years past in the law agency, and that he had got far above the world; but he explained to me that the alterations then in progress in the law had rather interfered with the coming off of some negotiations which he had on hand—he distinctly Stated that it was his own property—I asked him; and he stated that after applying the money an he proposed, which he was seeking to raise through me, he should not owe 20/. in the world; when I asked him if there was any settlement upon his wife and family, and when he declared there was nothing of that kind, I afterwards told him that I must treat his application strictly as a matter of business, and I must request him to make the usual statutory declaration that the property was free from any incumbrance whatever, and he said, "Oh, my dear Sir! I will make it with the greatest pleasure, without any hesitation whatever; when I apply the money an I propose, I shall not owe 20/. in the world"—it was in consequence of the representation that he was possessed of this property, and that it was not subject to any charge or incumbrance, that I got the money for him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But he had not, at that time, told you that there was no en<lb/>cumbrance upon it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he bad not in direct terms told me that, but on my proposing the declaration he distinctly stated that there was not any encumbrance of any sort or character—the words he used were, "Oh my dear Sir! there is not any encumbrance, no man has a claim of a shilling upon it; and when I have applied the money I am seeking to raise through you as I propose, I shall not owe 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the world"—in consequence of that I advanced him 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in one 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—note and one for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was the money of Mr. Holt.</p>

               <p>position here;" I did not say that the property was worth more than the sum he asked me to advance upon it—I said it had no doubt cost him more—the property appeared to be in very good condition; but I spoke of his splendid position with reference to my knowledge of his previous state of things—I went there to satisfy myself as to the value of the property, and I refused to lend him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—I dare say it might have cost him more, but I did not think it would realise 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not employ an appraiser, but I suggested so doing, and he in consequence abated the amount of his demand from 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at our first interview, in answer to my observation with regard to the furniture, he was to have made arrangements to let me see the plate—it is not for me to say why he did not carry out that arrangement, but he called on me next day, and said he should only want 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not wish the property to be seen by an appraiser, bnt he said, "My dear fellow, when I show you my plate you will be perfectly satisfied"—that was when I told him I could not advise any client of mine to advance 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the furniture with<lb/>out the appraisement of an auctioneer—he did not tell me that he did not wish to have an auctioneer—he deemed it unnecessary—he said so—in answer to my suggestion, that I would not advise any client to advance 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with<lb/>out the valuation of an appraiser, he said, "Oh! my dear Sir, there is no occasion for that when I show you my plate"—he did not on that day, or the next, express any desire that an appraiser should be sent.</p>

                  </hi>. Mr. Stafford was acting as my solicitor in the early part of Nov. last year—I saw the prisoner at his own residence, in the presence of Mr. Stafford, on 5th Nov.—Mr. Stafford said that the inventory of the furniture, plate, &amp;c, had not arrived at his office when he came away, and in consequence of that nothing could be done respecting paying the money,. but he would read over the declaration to me in his presence, which he did—I then told Mr. Stafford, to save me the trouble of coming again I would pay the money to him, which I did in the prisoner's presence—I gave 320/. to Mr. Stafford—I have never received a farthing of that money back again—(looking at the declaration) I do not remember this paper; it appears to be the same that was read over to me—if I were to hear it read I should know whether the contents are the same (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—it is quite the same—it was read over before I handed over the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I was lodging at the Cock, New-street, Bishopsgate, on 7th Oct. I came up with the prisoner from Newcastle—on Tyne to see the Exhibition—I knew him very well, we came up together as friends—we went to the Punch coffee-house early in the afternoon—I bad a carpet-bag and a basket with me, containing wearing-apparel and books, and six sove<lb/>reigns and six half-sovereigns—the prisoner said I might as well leave my things there, and when the servant Connolly brought the coffee, the prisoner said, "Will you take care of these things? we shall be here and call for them again presently"—she took them away—I and the prisoner then went to different places, and we went to near Astley's Theatre to inquire for a friend of mine—I went into a shop to inquire, leaving the prisoner waiting outside, and when I came hack he was gone—I inquired for my things at the Punch coffee-house about 9 o'clock the same evening, and they were gone—I have not seen them since—the prisoner had more hair on his chin then than now.</p>

On 10th Nov., about half-past 2 o'clock, I was on duty on Ludgate-hill, in company with Rowe—it was on the occasion of the celebration of the fete on Lord Mayor's-day—I saw the prisoners on Ludgate-hill, in company with another man—I did not know them of my own knowledge, I had never seen them before—I saw them all in conversation together—I watched them for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I saw them hustle against several gentlemen—my attention was drawn to them from their appearance and manners—at the bottom of Ludgate-hill by Bridge-street, I saw Rogers look towards the waistcoat-pocket of Mr. Williams, the prosecutor—he immediately turned and spoke to the other three who were behind him—they then all rushed on Mr. Williams; Smith in front, and the other three pushing Smith up behind—that was at the corner of Ludgate hill, on the footpath—I saw Smith put his left arm up against Mr. Williams's breast, with his right hand underneath—he did not lift up Mr. Williams's arm, be pressed it against his breast, and was pushing him back<lb/>wards, and the other three were pushing him behind—I should say the effect of that would be to take away the use of Williams's arm; I mean it would confine his arm—I then saw Smith with his right band take a silver watch from Mr. Williams, and push immediately into the crowd with Rogers—at the same moment Lind put his band into Mr. Williams's waistcoat pocket—I collared Lind, and took him into custody—he said, "I have not got the watch, let me go, I will show you the man that has got it, they are all gone up there"—he did not point anywhere—I had bold of his hand—he was looking up Ludgate-hill at the time; with that I took him out of the crowd with some difficulty to the station, where I searched him and found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

The prisoner came there on 14th Nov., near 8 o'clock in the evening, and asked for a glass of gin-and-water—he was sitting on one of the tables of the coffee-room—there were some coats on the coat-rack—I do not know how many—when I came back with the gin-and-water, he had got a light-coloured coat on, and two or three others—I told Roberts, my fellow-servant—he handed me three coats—I kept them while he went to the bar, and gave them to him again in two or three minutes—he gave them to a policeman, in my presence, about five minutes afterwards—there were three or four gentlemen in the coffee-room, but they did not notice it.</p>

In consequence of information that I received of a highway robbery, I was on the look out for the parties that evening—I proceeded with Bailey down a lane, which leads into the Uxbridge-road, from East Acton—when we had got down the lane about two hundred yards, I saw two men standing under the shade of the trees; I went towards them—as I drew near, I could see from the light of the moon that their faces were covered with something black—I instantly seized one of them, which proved to be the prisoner, Round, by the collar with my left hand, and with my right hand I stripped the mask from his face—I said, "Halloo! what are you doing here, with your facet covered?"—at that instant a shot was fired, and I fell down—I could not swear which of the two fired the shot; I supposed it to be the prisoner, Round.</p>

On Wednesday, 8th Oct. about eight o'clock in the evening—I met Earthy, at East Acton—I went with him down the lane, leading to the Uxbridge-road—it is called East Acton-lane—I had received information of a highway robbery, which induced me to watch—when we had got about 200 yards down the lane, I saw the two prisoners standing by the side of the road, on the pathway, with their faces covered with something black—I saw Earthy go to one of them—he laid hold of him by the collar, and pulled the mask from his face, and said, "What are you doing here, with your faces covered?"—I then observed the flash, and heard the report of a pistol—I am not able to say which of the men fired the pistol—one of them decidedly did—I immediately sprang upon Harris, and threw him to the ground—I was struggling with him on the ground, and sergeant Earthy called to me to mind the pistol; at that very instant, I noticed a pistol in Harris's hand—he had it close to my belly, he pulled the trigger, it flashed, but missed fire—I saw the flash—Earthy then caught hold of the barrel end of the pistol—I drew my staff, and hit Harris across the wrist—and Earthy, wrested the pistol from him—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>ducing it</hi>)—I was not able to see the other roan at all during the struggle, he got away—I am only able to speak to Round from his general height and appearance—Harris was never out of my hands, I took him to the station, we got more assistance at the end of the lane—Earthy went home—when we got Harris to the station at Acton, I searched him, and found on him three new silk handkerchiefs, three bullets, a piece of rough lead, a knife, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and a canister containing some gunpowder, which I produce—the bullets are not regularly cast, they are pieces of rough lead cut with a knife, and then chewed—these are the bullets which were in the pistol, and these were found in Harris's pocket—they are all made in the same way—I examined the pistol that Earthy wrenched from Harris, it was loaded with powder, and the two bullets I have produced—on the Saturday following, from information I received, I got a bundle from a person of the name of Squires, a barber of New-street, Houndsditch.</p>

On Thursday night, 9th Oct., about half-past 8 o'clock, I took the prisoner Round into custody, at the Paddington terminus, for uttering a medal for a sovereign—I searched him, and found on him this loaded pistol (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), it had in it a piece of paper, two slugs, or bullets, another piece of paper, and some powder—I gave the pistol to Mr. Collard, and saw him unload it next morning, and take these bullets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from it—the bullets are not made in a mould, they are similar to the others produced—I also found on Round two sovereigns, a shilling, three halfpence, and some cards—he had put down the medal at the station in payment for a ticket going to Southall station—I believe that is the nearest station to East Acton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Great Western Railway police. Lee handed me this pistol on Friday morning, 10th Oct.—I have compared this pistol with the one found on Harris, it exactly corresponds, they appear to be a pair—I recognised it directly I saw it as the fellow to the one I bad seen the day previous, produced by Bailey—I went with Round to the police-court on Friday morning, 10th—I was in t <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I stopped the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and told him I had a much more serious charge to prefer against him than that for which he had been detained all night, he must use his own discretion as to whether he said anything or not, if he did it would be my duty to repeat it to the Magistrate—I then said, "I am about to prefer a charge against you of being concerned with a man named Harris, now in custody, with shooting at and wounding a police-sergeant, at Acton, on Wednesday evening last"—he appeared startled, and said, "I? do they say I did it?"—I replied, "That is the charge I have to prefer against you"—he then again said, "And they say I did it?"—he then immediately, or very shortly after, said, "Where is Harris?"—I answered, "Where I expect you will be before the day expires"—he asked, "Is the police-sergeant dead?"—I replied, "No"—I afterwards withdrew the charge from the pistol, and found in it, powder, paper, two bullets, and paper again—I took these two bullets from the pistol, which correspond with the other bullets that were in the pistol that was taken from Harris.</p>

On Friday, 10th Oct., when Round was brought to the station, at Hammersmith, I was placed in the cell with him—prior to my going into the cell, the station-sergeant, in my presence, had cautioned him two or three times—he told him that he might answer no questions he put to him as regarded his asking what his name was, and so on, but anything he did say would be taken down against him—he asked me, when in the cell, if the sergeant was dead—I said, "No"—he said it was his own fault his being shot, as it occurred from the constable knocking up his hand, and when it fell, the pistol went off; that he was not aware it was on the full cock, that it must have been low down in the body that the sergeant was shot; that he thought it useless to remain to assist his comrade as his pistol was discharged, as he bad no means of making any defence, although he heard his mate call after him, that he went a short distance and reloaded his pistol (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

On Wednesday night, 8th Oct., I was called on to attend sergeant Earthy—I found he was wounded in the left thigh—the wound passed from the front of the thigh inwards—it crossed the large vessels, but did not go deep enough to injure them—had they been injured it would most likely have been fatal; had the main artery been injured he would probably have bled to death before assistance could be pro<lb/>cured—the bullet passed through the trowsers of the right leg, grazing the right thigh in its posterior part—about ten days afterwards I extracted from the wound a piece of cloth which was a portion of the trowsers that bad been forced in by the ball—he has been under my care from that time to the pre<lb/>sent—I should hope he would ultimately perfectly recover from the injury—at present he is suffering from various pains, the result of that injury, and he is likely to do so for some little time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a packing-case maker, and live in Ring-street, Kingsland-road. On Friday, 31st Oct., between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, I was going home along Kingsland-road—a woman spoke to me, and wanted me to treat her with drink—I did not stop with her—she asked me to turn down one or two bye streets, which I refused—we got over the bridge to Dunstone-street—I turned down there, and she followed me, and wanted to pull me about, which I would not allow—I was instantly pulled by a person from behind, not knowing any one was near me, and pulled violently down on my back; and he placed his hand over my mouth the moment I was down—the woman kneeled on my knees, unbuttoned my coat, and tried to get my watch—I felt her try to draw it out of my fob, but I think my fob was twisted, and she could not get it—I struggled bard to get the man's hand from my mouth, which I succeeded in doing, and called "Police!" as loud as I possibly could—the man said to the woman, <hi rend="italic">"Step it</hi> Emma, <hi rend="italic">step it!"</hi> I caught hold of the woman's visite, thinking she had my watch—I held her so tightly that she left the whole visite in my hand—the woman got away—the man ran away as hard as he could—I jumped up and ran after the woman—the man held me for an instant or two, till the woman got away, and then he ran in the opposite direction—I jumped up and ran after the woman, and called "Police!" as loud as I could—while this was taking place, I bad not an opportunity of seeing the man—I could not see him at all, he was behind me—I saw the policeman take him, he could not escape, the policeman was coming down the turning—I had him in view the whole of the time from when he left me, till he was brought back—the distance was very short—I never lost sight of him from the time he jumped up—the prisoner is the man—I was sober—I had had part of two glasses of gin and water.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a stock-broker, at 1, Shorter's-court, Throgmorton-street. The prisoner was my clerk—on 17th April, I had occasion to sign a check for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is the practice in my business almost invariably for my clerk to prepare the check, for the purpose of my signature—when this check (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) was produced to me for signature, it was not in the state it is now—it was for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the counterfoil of the check, which is in the prisoner's writing—I believe the check was prepared for his own salary—I am quite certain that on 17th April I gave bin no check for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I signed it, it was for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not aware of this circum<lb/>stance till the prisoner was apprehended—I took the prisoner myself, and delivered him up at the station at Whitechapel—this check it in the prisoner's writing, and when brought to me was for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the twenty which is now in it before the word five, I believe is the prisoner's writing—I have no doubt of it whatever (<hi rend="italic">looking at five other checks</hi>)—these are entire forgeries, signa<lb/>tures and all—on this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the name, "Robert F.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is it that in the counterfoil the figure seems to have been erased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That may have been a mistake in the number—the counterfoil is made to correspond with the check—I did that a few nights ago at my own house,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185111240036"/>
               <p>and I did it in blue ink, that I might know it—no doubt he had filled up a wrong number—I had no idea that the check had been altered; I never was indebted to him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and never gave him a check for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for himself—I have given him a check for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for other parties—I was in some difficulties in May—I did not go out of town, I remained in London—I did not go to Glasgow at that time—I might go after the temporary difficulty I was in—I have no recollection of it; in fact, I don't remember going there at all—I was often in Glasgow this year, but I don't remember being in Glasgow in May—it was not while I was in difficulties that I went—the prisoner was at my place—he never drew a check for me—the prisoner drew my checks under a special provision—I gave him authority to draw for James Colquhoun, signed Robert F. Mackrill; but signed by Mr. Lermitte, another member of the Stock Exchange, without which they were not to be paid—he had autho<lb/>rity under these conditions—I think that was during the latter end of March, or the beginning of April—it was necessary that some one should give checks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell him that they would not be paid by the Bank, unless they were signed by Mr. Lermitte? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I directed him to get the signature of Mr. Lermitte—he had authority to sign the checks, and there were instructions given to the Bank not to pay them till they were signed by Mr. Lermitte.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I have a literary occupation, and live in John-street, Bedford-row. On 10th Nov. I was walking from St. Paul's Churchyard to Farringdon-street—I arrived at the corner of Ludgate-bill, but was not in Farringdon-street—the crowd pressed against me—there was a lady with me, who was parted from me by the crowd, and we were trying to get through singly—the prisoner and another woman drove against me—I do not know whether they came of their own accord, or were pushed against me, the crowd being behind, which was increased by carts coming round the corner—the procession had passed about twenty minutes—there was no ostensible reason why the crowd should be there—the lady who was separated from me was just behind me—presently I observed that the prisoner and the other woman held my coat, the prisoner on the right, and the other woman on the left—I said, "My good women, if you are pushed by the crowd, there is no reason why you should hold me by the collar"—they said a man pressed behind them—I said, "I don't 6ee any reason for your holding me in this way," but I could not shake them off—I had a gold watch and chain in my waistcoat-pocket, and presently the lady with me said, "Your watch is gone, and this is the woman, I saw it in her hand," pointing out the prisoner—the prisoner was the woman who had held me on my right aide—the other woman, who had held me on the left side, was completely gone, vanished in an instant—there was a cry of "Police!" and the policeman came up—the prisoner was taken to the station—I valued the watch at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had had it many years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. John Nicholls, of Ponders-end. On that Monday morning I was called up at 4 o'clock—I went with the officers to the yard-gate, and saw the prisoner and his two horses and cart loaded with potatoes standing outside the gate—I did not know that the policemen were on the premises that night—I saw the hay and corn and chaff—I allow the prisoner a peck of oats a day, and they have as much chaff as they can eat—that is a very good allowance—on the Saturday I had given out the usual allowance to the prisoner, a bushel and a half for three horses for two days—he was to have gone to Spitalfields Market and to the dairy at Islington that morning—I told him he had got almost half as much again at he ought to have—the policeman opened the bin in the stable, and I was sur<lb/>prised to see so much corn—the prisoner said he had saved it, he did not feed his horses always alike, they had plenty of grains—they have what grains they like to bring from the dairy when they go there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at 85, Bartholomew-close. I have known the prisoner two years and a quarter, and have occasionally em<lb/>ployed him to clean knives and boots—on 30th Oct. he went with me on business to the West-end, and we came home together—it was between 12 and 1 o'clock at night when we got home—we went into the front parlour, and remained there about half an hour, when I was knocked down by the prisoner—when I recovered I made for the parlour-door, and found it locked—I then went and opened the shutters and windows, and called "Murder! and police!" and while doing so he knocked me down a second time by a blow behind the ear, and I became insensible—my wife was in the room, and my child in bed in the back-parlour—when I recovered I saw my wife was all over blood—after I was knocked down the second time, I do not remem<lb/>ber anything till I found myself in the hands of two officers—I was hurt very much about the head and ribs—my ribs are now as black as my hat; the back of my head was nothing but bloody matter; I shall feel it all my life—my wife is about six months gone in the family way, and too ill to attend to-day—I hear my little boy was assaulted by the prisoner while I was insensible—I saw him in the hospital next day—there was nothing the matter with him before.</p>

I reside at an establishment called the Good Shepherd, at Hammersmith, where women who have lived in prostitution, and evince a desire to reform are received—there are other ladies beside me, who devote our<lb/>selves to endeavour to reform them—the prisoner came there, on the 15th Oct., bringing a letter from the Rev. Mr. Connolly, the minister of the Roman Catholic church, Moorfields—I believe that letter has been burnt—she came between two and three in the afternoon—no gentleman accompanied her—she was received into the Asylum, slept there that night, and was discharged on the following day, in consequence of giving a wrong Dame, and saying she had not been there before—she gave the name of Angelina Adams—it was discovered she had been in the house before—I cannot positively say when it was, but I think it was about ten months before—she certainly had not been there three months prior to 15th Oct.—I did not cut her hair, or give any directions for it to be done—no persons called nuns held her while I did it, or desired it to be done—I am called in the Covent, sister Mary Joseph—no other person there is called by that name, or by the name of sister Joseph—there is no other person of the name of Joseph there—persons are eligible to be admitted into the Asylum, whether Protestants or Roman Catholics—we understand the prisoner to be the same as ourselves.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 47, Upper Seymour-street, Euston-square. I am a Catholic, what you distinguish by calling a Roman Catholic—I occasionally attend the Catholic chapel, in Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell—one night last Feb. I met the prisoner there—it was not service time, but I had been to see the clergyman, as a duty of our religion—I found her there, and when I left, she asked me if I was not going in her direction—I asked her which way that was, she said, "towards King's-cross," and I said I was going towards Somers-town—she told me she had been in service, and had saved a few shillings from her last service, she was then living in the neighbourhood of Tottenham-court-road; her money was exhausted, and she expected to be turned away from her lodging—I told her if that should take place, she might have a share of my room, if she had no better place to go to—she afterwards came—on 10th March I moved to another house, and she moved with me—after a little while she became acquainted with a woman in the next room, and went and lived with her—she afterwards disappeared, and I next saw her by my steps, some time in July—she asked me to take her in again—I looked at her, and saw she was looking very miserable, and said, "Where is your hair?"—she said, "I have been very bad, and they cut it off in St. Pancras workhouse"—she had a lock of it in her hand, but none on her head—she was very ill afterwards, and on 17th July I took her to the Free Hospital, in Gray's Inn-lane, and afterwards to Charing-cross Hospital—I saw her while she was. in the hospitals, every Sunday—I think I visited her four Sundays—on the next Sunday I sent, and beard she had left—I went myself on the Monday and found she had gone—that was some time in Sept.—she followed up the duties of our Church—we went to the same altar, and took the sacrament together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the surgeon of St. Pancras workhouse. I know the prisoner by the name of Mary Ann Burke—she was admitted into the workhouse infirmary on 11th April, when she was suffering from scrofulous symptoms, and an enlargement of the abdomen; and I apprehend from the appearances that the glands of the abdomen were scrofulously affected—she remained till 11th July, when she left of her own accord—when she came in she had her hair—it had not been cut in any way—about a month before she left, it was cut as close as it could be, by my orders—it was not shaved off—I considered that was necessary to be done from the state of her disease—her hair is now grown as much as I can expect it to be from that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why did you order her hair to be cut off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was suffering from fever, and a good deal of derangement about the brain—she had then only been suffering from it a very short time—the derangement of the brain was brought on by the illness under which she was labouring—scrofulous illness is very painful, and calculated to produce great excitement consequent on the pain—the excitement consequent on the pain produced the derangement of the brain, which induced me to have her hair cut off—there was no particular danger, but I had the hair cut off to relieve the symptoms under which she was labouring—her hair was cut off by the barber, in the infirmary on the ground-floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Vosper. On 20th Oct. I was residing at 36, Milton-street, Cripplegate—I have been an inmate of the workhouse—on the evening of 20th Oct. I went to the tap-room of the Flying Horse public-house, about half-past five o'clock, to call my husband to his tea—the prisoner, his wife, and several friends, were there—my husband was tossing the prisoner for a pot of porter, and then a young man tossed him—the prisoner pressed the young man's knuckles open, to see what he had—my husband said that was not fair tossing—the prisoner called him a b—<hi rend="italic">snob,</hi> and said if he did not mind his own business he would put him on the fire—the prisoner held up his hand, as if to strike my husband—his; hands were clenched, and my husband struck him—I did not see him strike my husband with his fist—the next thing I saw was the prisoner's wife pass him a poker—it was a good-sized poker—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—he held it in his hand, and flourished it round the room for a few minutes, and I acciden<lb/>tally received a blow—I firmly believe the blow was intended for my husband, but I stepped in between them—I do not believe he intended to strike me—the prisoner was at one end of the room, and my husband at the other, with Mr. Mansel trying to part him from the prisoner—I believe the blow that struck me was aimed at my husband, and I went in between them—I received the blow across my head—it bled a good deal—I am suffering from it now—I had a baby, ten months old, in my arms—I was taken to Mr. Simpson's, a surgeon, who dressed my head—I went to the hospital on the Wednesday evening, and remained there a fortnight—I am still under the doctor's hands.</p>

The prisoner has been one of our warehousemen about four years—his duty was to attend to customers—if he sold goods he would make up parcels, or he might direct others to do so—if a warehouseman makes a sale to a customer, whether he makes up the parcel himself, or has it made up, it is his duty invariably to have the goods checked by the invoice by some other person in our establishment—there is no mark put on the invoice—in consequence of having had some articles stolen from us about ten months ago, we made an alteration, and prohibited our shopmen purchasing goods from us—the prisoner was aware that we had done so—I was sent for to the station, and when these parcels were opened I examined them—this purse, these pens, and these tumblers, are not in the invoice—I am quite sure of that—this invoice is the prisoner's writing, the prices here named are lower than the articles ought to have been sold at—these goods are taken out of parcels which are marked—the outside of each parcel is marked with the price in our private mark—the prisoner knew the private mark—these goods in the invoice are at lower prices than the marked price, and some of them lower than the cost price to us—I am not able to tell from this invoice, whether the prisoner bad had the goods checked to him—this purse is worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the pens, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and the tumblers, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on opening the parcels, and finding the goods were charged under cost price, I said to the prisoner, "Mr. Hunter, did you have these goods checked?"—he said, "No, Sir, I did not"—I then charged him with stealing—the custom of our establishment is, that if a gentleman comes and purchases a parcel of goods to take with him, the person serving him would make the invoice, and then make out a ticket to his number, and call "Cashier!" and the lad attending in our shop would come to him, see that the check was signed, and take it to the cashier in the desk—the invoice would then be stamped as this is, by the cashier—each of our shopmen has a check-book—they make the amount on the check, get it signed by some person, and that check with the amount of cash is then taken to the cashier—this invoice has not been exa<lb/>mined by any person in the establishment, because it is 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. below the worth of the articles; and if any person had examined these articles with the invoice, they must have seen these tumblers and other things, and that would have been another reason why it would not have been passed—this letter is the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"To Mr. W. H. Graveley, 21, Gloucester-terrace, 6th Nov. 1851; Dear Sir, I am surprised I did not see you when you came; I was looking out for you all the morning; will you come this evening between 7 and 8 o'clock; if you do not see me ask for me, do not be afraid; the things are all looked out, the invoice is all ready; later than this evening will be useless. In haste. W. Hunter."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. A.</hi> Was anybody present when you spoke to the prisoner at the station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Graveley and the officer were there—I cannot exactly tell the words I said to him—I said, "Have you had the goods checked?" or, "Have you ticked them off?"—and he said, "No, Sir"—I am not sure that I did not say, "Have you had them examined?"—I do not think I said, "Who ticked them off?"—I cannot undertake to swear I did not say that; I am certain the prisoner did not use the words, "I don't remember, Sir"—I really cannot answer whether he said, "I can't tell you, Sir"—when goods are invoiced, they ought to be examined by some person—not any particular person, by any one of the persons in the warehouse; and if the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185111240059"/>
               <p>goods are paid for, the person who examines signs the check, but if they are entered in a book, the book is signed—our cashier would not be entitled to take money, unless a check were produced—there was a check produced when the money was paid by Graveley—I have not that check; it was destroyed the following day, as is usual after the books have been examined—the prisoner was given into custody the same day; but we close our accounts at 4 o'clock in the afternoon—what is done after that, goes into the next day's account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But if you gave this man into custody on Thursday night, why was a document destroyed which was connected with the goods stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because we were not thoughtful enough to keep it—it was destroyed with others—the prisoner may have been in our service four or five years; I do not think it is as long as five or six—we have seventy, or seventy-five men and lads in our establishment, in different parts, and a large amount of business going on—our stock is very great—we sell a great quantity of jewellery, articles of very small bulk, but of considerable value, to the whole of which the prisoner, in common with other warehousemen, would have access—supposing the pri<lb/>soner were to sell articles, it would be his duty to pack them up, unless he were busy, and then somebody under his directions would pack them up—we have not employed a person under him to pack them up—we have a per<lb/>son named Holgate; he is not employed to pack up things, but he might do it under the prisoner's directions—the prisoner would not say, "Pack up these," and go away—he would stand by his side while he did it—I have seen warehousemen order things to be packed op, and go away—these things do not lie about very much—each of these articles was in its proper place, or should be—one article might be taken out to show—I do not know how long these parcels were left on the counter before they were taken away—I had not seen them there—I do not know that they had been packed up and left on the counter, with the invoice on them—we have had complaints about goods getting into parcels which ought not to be there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were those complaints from persons who purchased things in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; from such a house as Morrison's, who would purchase perhaps 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods; and they would send word that there was, perhaps, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of goods that were not charged—there may have been such a tiling happen in a small way at times—if these parcels had been examined, I do not think it possible that these three tumblers could have been overlooked—we take out articles from parcels to show, but they are generally put back in their places—we should never take three tum<lb/>blers out to show—there was a ticket taken to the cashier, which was destroyed after the prisoner was in custody—I had a search made for it, and it was not to be found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to the prosecutor; I have the cash-book here. On 7th Nov., here is an entry to No. 6, which was the prisoner's number—the amount is 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is the custom to enter all sales after 4 o'clock in the day to the day following, so that this might have been paid after 4 on the evening of 6th Nov.—that is the only amount I have on 7th Nov. to the prisoner's number—the prisoner gave a ticket, which has been destroyed—it was thrown away in the usual manner—I have looked for it, but could not find it—I recollect it was signed by Mr. Hunter—he had no business to sign his own ticket—when a person signs a cash ticket to me, I understand that it has been examined by him; and that he was not the per<lb/>son who sold the goods.</p>

               <p>on the ticket, and it was signed by the prisoner, why did you pay it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I did not notice it—after I heard about Mr. Hunter, I looked at the ticket, and I spoke to Mr. Davis, one of the firm; he made no reply, and I thought nothing of it—it was then thrown with the rest—they were brushed over Mr. Davis's desk, and swept away—I should not have taken—the cash for it at all, if I had noticed it at the time—I have been cashier about sixteen months—I know the counters on which these things are packed up—there is not often a great deal of goods on the counter where they generally serve, and where they tie up parcels—the persons who sell the goods tie up the parcels—it is very rarely that other persons tie them up, unless they are asked to do it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Gloucester-terrace, New-road—I am traveller, for the firm of Gray and Son, Engineers, at Lime house—I know the prisoner—he spoke to me on this occasion, and requested me to come and purchase a few articles for him, at his master's—I received this letter from him, on 6th Nov., and in consequence I went to Mr. Hyams, about a quarter before eight, in the evening—when I got there, I found the parcels were done up, and were on the counter—I had not been there to select the goods—I did not know what the parcels were to contain—the invoice was ready made out—I had not previously given any orders about the goods—I gave the prisoner a sovereign, which was handed to the cashier, and the cashier handed me two shillings change—the sovereign was my own—the prisoner requested me to pay for the articles when I fetched them, and he would return the money to me again—I took the three parcels away—I was not aware of their contents till they were opened at the station-house—I had arranged with the prisoner, that he was to meet me in the parlour of the public-house, in Bishopsgate Church-yard—I was to go there at once, and wait till he came—he told me that the young men were not allowed to pur<lb/>chase for themselves, and that was the reason be wished me to purchase these things—he came to the public-house—I was sitting in the parlour, and he joined me—he said to me, "I will help you to carry your parcels"—I had selected a doll for my child, and a pencil-case for myself, which were added to the invoice, and paid for at the same time—they were the only two articles which I had selected—we went on, and I looked into Whitechapel Church, where my wife was—I then carried home two of the parcels—one of them contained the doll—I had the pencil-case in my pocket—the other two parcels belonged to the prisoner—I saw the parcels opened at the station—I remember Mr. Hyams coming there—I don't recollect whether he said anything to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon, and live in Sackville-street, Piccadilly. I saw the deceased at her own house on 22nd Oct., and she was at my house on the 20th, and my assistant had seen her—I attended her on the 22nd for an injury on the hand, from which she had erysipelas of the hand and arm—there was a black mark on the outside of the hand, which was very much swollen all round, and inflammation proceeded up the arm—on the hand there was an indentation, about the size of a half-crown: it was a bruise—she told me how it was caused—I continued to attend her from 22nd Oct. till the time of her death—the cause of her death was erysipelas, the primary cause of which was the wound on the back of the hand—I bad attended her for twelve months, and I never saw her tipsy.</p>

I am house-dresser at the London Hospital—the deceased was brought there on 29th Oct.—I found a wound in his back opposite to the fifth and sixth ribs, descending obliquely, and entering the thorax between the ninth and tenth ribs—the wound was about three inches long and one wide—such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) might have produced such a wound—he lingered till 4th Nov., when he died—I was present on 30th Oct, when he made a statement to Mr. Yardley, the Magistrate—it was taken down, read over to him, and he put his mark to it—he was then in a hopeless state—I had not told him so, but he seemed to be aware he could not recover—the prisoner was present, and heard the statement—the deceased was intoxicated when he was brought in. (<hi rend="italic">James Brebar's deposition read:</hi> "I was stabbed the night before last at 9 o'clock—it was dark—it was in a street leading to the Regent's Canal Basin—the man that stabbed me, a ship<lb/>mate, and two men, had been drinking with me at the Liverpool Arms—we were all coming away together, and the man that stabbed me asked me to go with him to his ship in the Regent's Canal, and as we were going along the street he pulled out his knife—I asked him what he was going to do with it—the prisoner is the man—he said, 'You will see what the mate will say to me when you get on board'—I said, 'If you do not put up the knife, I will not go with you'—the prisoner said, 'I will let you see what I will do to the mate with it,' and on that he plunged it into my back—I fell down, and was carried into the public-house—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner, not a word—I was a little the worse for liquor—the prisoner was much more drunk—before the prisoner stabbed me in the back he was flourishing the knife about—I am quite sure when he stabbed me he struck at me purposely—I have no more to say—we were in the same house the night before, and parted on friendly terms, like two brothers—there was no cause of quarrel between us."</p>

                  </hi>. I am by profession a surgeon; I purchased a share in a patent for silvering glass; Mr. Varnish was my partner. In the autumn of 1849 I engaged the prisoner Hellish for the purpose of carrying out some views I had, some methods of making glass for the purpose of em<lb/>ploying the silvering process—I had strong recommendations with him, and believed he understood perfectly the directing the making glass at Powell's glass-works—I knew nothing of engraving or staining glass, and Mellish was engaged to superintend that part of the arrangements, to overlook the men engaged in that portion of the business—there was an agreement in writing (<hi rend="italic">The agreement was here produced by Mr. Cookney, the attesting witness; it was dated 26th Dec.</hi>, 1849, <hi rend="italic">between Messrs.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185111240075"/>
               <p>where the articles are sold is in Regent-street—the glass-cutters and mounters engaged by Mellish were placed by him in shops on the premises; and he employed, for various purposes, several outdoor workmen, who I did not even know by sight—I was not acquainted with the proper rate of wages for articles of that kind, and I engaged Mellish on that account—Douglas and Mellish had at first one office between them, with a large double desk, at which they sat side by side—some months afterwards an inner room was prepared by Mellish, what he called his own room; a large table was got, and it was fitted up as his private room—he had boxes made for the purpose of keeping the vouchers and bills in, as he said, when they were returned to him—I have frequently been through the room in which the double desk was when Douglas and Mellish were both there—I have done so daily, from July to Sept., but more frequently even than that—I used to go and see how the work was carried on—Mellish was continually at the desk, and Douglas like<lb/>wise—I saw the wages-book constantly on Mellish's desk—he had the work<lb/>men's names entered in it, and the rate of wages—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have seen it daily on the double desk—it was the rule to enter in that book the amount of wages earned by the out-door servants, and the in-door like<lb/>wise—my instructions to Mellish were, that as he undertook the sole manage<lb/>ment of the wages-book, and paying the wages, he should be answerable to me for the accounts and documents, which he undertook to be—I used gene<lb/>rally to go up the first thing in the morning, and inquire how he was getting on, what return he was likely to have for the men, who were in considerable numbers at work, and what return the business was making—he invariably told me the business was going on most satisfactorily, be only wanted time to carry on the thing; and if I would leave the matter to him till the World's Fair opened, I should have ample remuneration for what we were doing; and I left it entirely to him—I have remarked to him that the accounts were very heavy, that a great expense weekly was incurred—he always said it was essential that such expenses should be incurred before returns could be expected, and I should be satisfied if I left it to him—I do not recollect that I spoke to him about the vouchers—I did not know of there being a couple of bills made out by the men who work out of doors, I knew nothing at all about it—I am speaking of the first period when Mellish was in my employ; the second period was after it was discovered that frauds had been committed—I had not been informed of the two bills, up to the time Douglas was given into custody.</p>

               <p>did not learn from Mellish that Mr. Lund had made him a present of his interest—I have not silvered any ink-bottles myself of that construction; my first experiments with Mr. Lund's inkstands were perfectly successful, as far as the silvering went; they were perfectly silvered, but the ink being poured in upon it, took off the silver—Mellish did not invent the plan of a double glass—I took out a patent for that very purpose; that was not the patent in which I had purchased an interest in the first instance—I never knew Mellish make any experiments in putting the silver between two glasses, he took my directions to make glass suitable for my patent which I had been at work at months before I knew there was such a man as Mellish in the world; I hired him for the purpose of going to Powell's glass-works, and making hol<lb/>low glass for the purpose of the patent which I had been at work at for months—the first patent in 1848, was for silvering glass and other surfaces—I got the second patent for introducing silver between two glasses, in Dec. 1849, two months after Mellish had worked for me—previous to getting out that patent, I had tried the experiment, and had shown it; it was perfectly well known—Mellish was engaged in making those experiments before I took out the patent—the inkstands sent by Mr. Lund were not with a double hollow—I do not remember that a second set of inkstands were sent by Mr. Lund when the silver was introduced between two plates of glass so as to prevent the operation of the ink—Mr. Varnish was the active man, and looked after the mercantile part, but had nothing to do with the silvering, he knew nothing about it—I knew something about it; I was the only person who did, I patented it—I suggested after conversing with Mr. Varnish, that we should take out a second patent to protect the silver entirely, by hermetically sealing it from the atmosphere, introducing it between two coatings of glass; but I want to explain to the Court, if I were to take this inkstand, silver it, and then drop this little glass-holder into it, it would be an inkstand silvered between two coatings of glass, but that is totally distinct—preventing the air from getting to it is what I call hermetically sealing it—I took out a third patent in the conclusion of 1850, in my name, and that of Mellish—it was for improvements in staining and cutting glass for the purpose of silver<lb/>ing cutting it in a peculiar manner—I did not make articles under that patent—I am not aware that any were in the Exhibition. I exhibited some articles of double hollow work of every description—Mr. Deane has got the list of articles exhibited from our firm—Mellish had no joint-interest in any manufacture connected with the silvering of glass, that I am aware of; it was never carried out—I saw the patent that I and Mellish took out; the agent who took it out for us was Mr. Cartmell—I believe I and Mellish saw him previous to taking it out; we asked him his opinion; it was in the autumn of 1850—I cannot swear which of us described the patent to Mr. Cartmell, it was taken out conjointly—it was described as a patent for cutting, staining, silver<lb/>ing, and fixing articles of glass—I cannot speak to the very words—I believe I understood the invention thoroughly when I went <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Mr. Cartmell—I thought I did at the time—I had gone through the matter myself—I do not know that anybody told me what it was—I swear Mellish did not tell me the whole process, he might have suggested some portion of it, and I believe he did; he suggested some portion of the cutting, as a practical man—he had not been engaged in the silvering of glass for eighteen months; he had nothing to do with the scientific part—I did not direct Mr. Cookney to draw up a paper and present it for the signature of Mellish; the matter was talked over by Mellish, myself, and Mr. Cookney, but I am not aware that I gave any special instructions on the subject—Mr. Cookney did draw up a</p>

               <p>paper for Mellish to sign after I bad got the last patent; Mellisb refused to sign it—I did not tear it op, I believe it is in Mellish's possession—I did not present it to him, I cannot say whether Mr. Cookney did—Mellish eventually refused to me to resign his interest in that patent, after telling me two or three times that he would—I was present when the agreement was presented to him, but whether it was tendered to him to sign, I do not know—I was not present when it was thrown on the fire—I did not say I had thrown it on the fire—it was about the spring of 1851 that he refused to relinquish his interest in the patent; it was at Berners-street—I think it was in May this year that he left my service, about a month or six weeks after he had refused to relin<lb/>quish his interest—after he bad refused to sign a paper, in Berners-street, I believe another paper was drawn up for him to sign—I really do not recollect whether that was presented to him for signature, or whether be refused to sign it—I do not remember being present when it was presented to him—I believe a second was presented two or three weeks before he was discharged—the second paper was not prepared with a view of my taking Mr. Cookney in as a partner in that patent, not that I am aware of; no such understanding ever came to my knowledge—Mr. Cookney had an interest in the glass silvering long before that patent—I never made any proposal to take him in as a partner in the patent which I and Mellish had taken out; but I believe it was understood thus, that as he had an interest in the patent of the silver<lb/>ing, he must have an interest in the patent now—it was not proposed that Mellish should relinquish his interest in the patent of Thomson and Mellish, and that Cookney should be introduced—it was not arranged that as soon as Mellish relinquished his interest, Cookney should be a partner; I know nothing of it—Cookney had an interest in it previous to the two prisoners being taken up—I never heard of its being proposed that when Mellish relinquished his interest, Cookney should become a partner in Mellish and Thomson's patent—it was not proposed that Cookney should come in at all—it had long before 1851 been understood that if a partnership was drawn up, that Mr. Cookney's name would be included with mine, and Mr. Varnish's—I never heard that it was proposed in 1851, that we three should become partners and get the relinquishment of Mellish's right in the patent of Mel<lb/>lish and Thomson—Mr. Lund has two shops, one in Fleet-street, and the other in Cornhill—he spoke very well of Mellish to me—he said he had known him some considerable time, and he was a very painstaking man—Mr. Powell, of Whitefriars glass-works, recommended him to me as a man who would carry out what I wanted—I do not know where Mellish lived at the time be entered my service in Oct.—I believe he had workshops in Great Portland-street at the time he first came to me—I have been to them two or three times—I believe he continued to have them the whole time he was with us, and that was one of the grievances why I wished to part with him—I never went there latterly—I understood that workmen were sent by him from the one house to the other—I do not know how many workmen he had; at one time he had between thirty and forty on the premises at Berners-street—I am not speaking with certainty—there was not a steam-engine erected—he brought a great quantity of machinery when he came into my service, and put it up at my expense—he afterwards employed a carpenter to erect some machinery for the glass-cutters, Mellish attended to the account!—a shop was also taken, and Mrs. Mellish was sent there to keep it—I really do not know exactly when that was—Mellish and his wife managed the shop—it was not me that made that arrangement; Mr. Varnish, I believe, can tell you all about it—the shop was kept in the name of Mrs. Mellish—I used</p>

               <p>to send glass there invoiced to her, and she and some assistants attended to keeping the accounts and selling the goods at the Regents-street shop—Mellish lived there, he went there in the evening—I do not know that when he undertook that his wife should go there on my account that he relinquished his residence in Great Portland-street, and sold off his furniture—the real accountant in the business was Mr. Deane, Mr. Varnish attended to the mercantile part, he went to mercantile men about the shipping and the sales—Mellish regulated the cost and selling-price of the goods; he put a profit on as the selling price, that all belonged to his department; I believe he con<lb/>sulted with Mr. Varnish on the subject—I do not recollect his going three times to Paris in our service—he was absent a fortnight in Paris once, I believe—I cannot say whether he went twice or three times, I believe he went twice, I am uncertain about three times—he was absent about a fort<lb/>night each time—Mr. Varnish was with him once, I believe—Mr. Deane, the accountant, kept the books in Berners-street—I cannot positively swear that I know the cost-price book when I see it, I believe I do—the books were not in my department, and I did not examine them—I believe I can tell the sale-price book when I see it—I must have looked into the books—I am convinced that I did occasionally—I can swear I looked into the book where the entries were made of goods that went abroad to different people—that was during the eighteen months Mellish was with me—there are so many books that I cannot say whether that was the only one I looked into—it does not belong to my department to look into the books, mine is the scientific depart<lb/>ment—Mr. Varnish conducted the commercial department, assisted by the clerk—it was not my duty to examine the books till I discovered the frauds—it was about four or five months after Mellish left that I caused Douglas to be taken into custody—I swear I heard Mellish say he wanted a clerk—I believe Mr. Varnish was present—I am not aware that Mellish was in ill health from his attention and labour at the time Douglas came—I am not aware that he had worked for us continually, day and night, and that his health was affected—it was not proposed then by me and Mr. Varnish that he should have assistance, not in that department—I will not swear it was not said to Mellish—I am not aware of it—I am not prepared to swear that I proposed it, or that I did not—Mellish proposed Douglas as his clerk—I had not proposed that he should have assistance, not as a clerk—I should say Mr. Varnish was present when Mellish spoke about Douglas; I do not posi<lb/>tively recollect, but he was there every day—it was at Berners-street that Mellish mentioned it—I cannot recollect in what room—I suppose it must have occurred in my library, or in Mellish's room—I believe it must have been in my library, that is my impression—I cannot say whether it was night or day, it was some weeks before Douglas came—I left it to Mellish to make inquiries as to who Douglas was, and I believe Mr. Varnish left it to him—I think. Mrs. Mellish was keeping the shop at the time Douglas was spoken of, but upon my word I cannot be positive on that point—I do not recollect having a conversation with Mellish about his health, about May, 1851, just before he went away—I do not remember his saying he did not feel inclined to sacrifice his own and his wife's health any longer by remaining—I cannot swear distinctly that he did not—I believe just before he went he desired me to send some person to take charge of the stock in Regent-street, on the following Monday morning; in consequence of which Mr. Varnish and Mr. Deane sent somebody to take charge of the stock in Regent-street—I believe that conversation was at Berner's-street—I believe his wife left on the following Monday—I do not know the exact day, for I did not go near the</p>

               <p>only two books I saw—I first looked into the wages book when it was first established, which was in the beginning of 1850, soon after Douglas came.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that Mr. Douglas, by any steps he took, was the means of reducing your expenditure at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know he has checked Powell's bills, and after Mellish left he did the same, and he reduced the bills cer<lb/>tainly—we dealt in a small way with a person named Sago—I cannot say whether or not that it was at Douglas's suggestion, that we should save a considerable per<lb/>centage, but we did get some things there, and saved a con<lb/>siderable per<lb/>centage—I do not know that we got them seventy per cent below the price we were paying Powell's, but it was considerably less—Douglas had no authority to reduce the expenditure while he was under Mellish; but after Mellish left, I remember an instance of his checking a bill of Powell's, when there was a mistake of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was immediately allowed, and I believe he was the means of reducing other expenditures after Mellish left.</p>

Thomson's establish<lb/>ment, in Berners-street, about two years ago, I went to the premises in Wells-street—I there saw Mellish, and he employed me to work for the prosecutors—Mellish arranged the price of the work that I was to be paid—I never saw Mr. Thompson on the matter until this job happened—when I did</p>

I am clerk and cashier to the prosecutor—I became so after Mellish was employed—it was my duty as cashier to pay the amount of money necessary for the wages—for the purpose of ascertaining the amount that would be required, a wages book was produced to me; it was the custom to have the wages book produced; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Douglas was in the habit of producing that book to me; he paid all the workmen—this book includes both the in-door and out-door workmen; Douglas paid them both; I gave him the money to pay with—the book was handed to me after the money was given—I gave the money on Saturday, and the book was produced on the Monday or Tuesday probably—it is in Douglas's writing—I suppose it would be Mellish's duty as general manager to look over it, and see that the men were paid properly—I have never seen him looking over the book—I sat in another office, in a different part of the building—the book was pro<lb/>duced to me with vouchers; the receipts from the different persons—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the receipts produced</hi>)I find here a receipt for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 16th Sept.—I can tell that that was produced to me; it has my initials on it; it also has Mellish's initials to the best of my knowledge: that is to certify that the voucher is correct—I should not have passed it without his initials after July or Aug., '50—previous to that time, the accounts came up I thought rather loosely; and either Mr. Thompson ordered the initials, or it was done at my</p>

               <p>suggestion; I cannot now recollect which, but for regularity's sake, I said I would rather the manager signed them first—I cannot recollect whether I said so to Mellish; but after a particular period I would not pass the bills with<lb/>out those initials, without inquiry—that 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is entered in the book as paid—I have seen all these receipts, except the one of 30th July for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that has not passed through my hands, or it would have the folio of the wages book upon it, which it is my habit to put—I find in the wages book the sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., entered on 16th Sept., in Douglas's writing—it is charged as having been paid to Lee—on 17th Aug., I find 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. charged as having been paid to Lee; and on 27th July 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., all in Douglas's writing—on 19th July, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is charged, as paid to Lee—I "do not find 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 80th July entered in the wages book—I am not able to point out that item—the other items were paid by me to Douglas included in a lump sum—I never saw any of these other bills for the smaller amounts; the only vouchers produced to me contained the altered amounts.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBBRS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you the accountant to the firm now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am: I first became so at the beginning of April, 1850; there was no accountant previously, I believe—I believe one of the partners had acted as such; I occasionally used to sign vouchers—I did not put my initials against any vouchers or bills, except as to their examination, not as to their correctness, only in comparing the bill with the book—if Douglas brought me a bill not vouched by Mellish, I should return it, and ask why it was not so—there are two accounts here which do not bear Mellish's initials—they have been passed and paid by me; my initials are upon them, as having passed them—one is dated 19th July, and the other 27th July,'50—I put my initials to them, because they agreed with the wages book which Douglas brought to me; finding they agreed with that, I put my initials—I cannot recollect the circumstance of passing these two, or when I paid them—I have no recollection of having done it—I have put my initials to several others which had not Mellish's initials, previous to a certain date, upon finding that it agreed with this book—I put my initials for my own satisfac<lb/>tion, to vouch that it was a correct payment, as represented by Douglas, that it agreed with the book—if I had had any idea that there was anything wrong in the representation, or in the book, I should certainly not have put my initials to the vouchers—I did not keep that set of vouchers in the counting-house; when I had looked at them, and compared them with the book; I returned them in the book—in consequence of the irregular way in which the accounts had been kept, a new arrangement was made somewhere about July or Aug., 1850—I did not keep or attend to the cost-price book—Mr. Mellish did, and the sale-price book also—those books are here—I have not looked at them lately; it is not my business to look at them; I have seen them, but not examined them; they were left behind when Mellish left the service—I do not know enough of the business to know how the entries are made in the cost-price book—I should think the mode of doing it is, to know the cost of the labour, and what has been paid—I cannot recollect who was present when the new arrangement was made about July; I cannot recollect the circumstances of it; I have tried to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not arranged that Mr. Mellish should have a set of detailed accounts, so as to make out the cost-price book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they were kept back for that purpose, I believe—he kept back one set of the detailed accounts to make out his cost-price book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not quite understand this; what was to be kept back?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One copy for the price-book; I believe the arrangement was, that two sets of Touchers were to be mode out, one a detailed account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not Mr. Mellish to have the detailed account to make out the cost-price book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was what he kept the account back for—there was a detailed account, and a bill delivered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it pursuant to an arrangement made on behalf of the firm, that there should be two sets of documents kept for every workman's bill, a detailed account, and a general account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was Mr. Mellish's arrangement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it in July that Mr. Mellish made that arrange<lb/>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Either July or Aug.—he said he was to keep back one of those accounts, for the purpose of making out the cost-price book—one of the accounts was handed to me as a voucher—the one in a lump sum was sent to me—I believe this small account is a detailed account, such as it was arranged Mellish should have delivered to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not the other one that has had the figures altered the general account, which it was arranged should be delivered to Douglas to pay on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> it was the arrangement of Mr. Mellish; he stated that he would do it in July—I always received the general accounts from Douglas in settling the books with him from the commencement—the double accounts were put there before that time; it was only regarding the initials I spoke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How early were the double accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think almost from the first commencement of my term—the double account was not an arrangement made in July or Aug., that was merely the initials to be put on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then from your first coming was that the course of business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe so, from the beginning—the only alteration made in July was, that Mellish was to put his initials to the general account to certify its correctness—Douglas used to bring me the book with these general accounts; I used to look at them to see that they tallied with the book, and then return the book with them in it to him—Mellish had the general management—the moneys I gave Douglas I considered were sent to Mellish—he received his own wages from me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that Douglas was the person to whom you delivered the money, is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on account of Mr. Mellish; on account of that department which was under Mr. Mellish's con<lb/>trol and management—I treated Douglas as Mr. Mellish's clerk—I used to apply to Douglas on the Thursday and Friday, to know what money would be required for the wages for out door-work on Saturday, in order to make up my accounts; and what I call the lump amount was the whole amount that was required—here is the entry in the wages book of Lees, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on, 14th Sept. (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—I believe this is in Douglas's handwriting—all the entries are in his writing—this entry is dated 21st Sept. here, which was the Saturday; the wages were always paid on the Saturday—this contains the wages of the prior week—I could not tell the exact amount I paid Douglas in a lump, on that occasion; perhaps it might be 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that week—there are a great many entries on 21st Sept., relating to the wages of the week ending on that day—there may be thirty-five or thirty-six entries on that day—I gave the money to Douglas in a lump, and he furnished me with a written memorandum, or I O U for the lump sum—that was destroyed on the Monday when he made his book up—he would sometimes have a balance to pay back to me out of the lump sum; that would depend upon the amount made up in the book—I did not examine the vouchers</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185111240085"/>
               <p>before I gave him the lump sum—I did not get the vouchers till the following week—Douglas did not give me forty, fifty, or sixty vouchers at a time; perhaps there would not be above half-a-dozen of these vouchers in a week—these are out-door accounts—I had no vouchers for the men's wages, except the book—I have never been present at the payment of the wages—my office was in the same establishment, but in front of the house—I had the entire control of the cash—it was not to me that Douglas pointed out an error of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as against my masters—he has never pointed out any errors to me—I was not under Mr. Mellish's control at all—I did not retain the vouchers—they were returned back to that department in the book, to Mellish, I con<lb/>sider—they were delivered to Douglas as Mellish's clerk—I am aware that from time to time advances have been made to the men out of the ordinary payments—there used to be a certain sum of money advanced on the Wed<lb/>nesday for that purpose, and then on the Saturday we made up the full lump sum—I advanced that sum on the Wednesday to Douglas, to be advanced to the men as a portion of the Saturday's moneys—it was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or some<lb/>thing of that sort—I took an I O U from Douglas for it, which was after<lb/>wards destroyed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mellish has ordered money to be paid to the workmen by way of bonus sometimes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I see by the wages book that gratuities have been paid to the workmen from time to time; I believe by Mellish's order—those gratuities came into the wages book—we employ a number of men from week to week—some of the men would sometimes go off work from illness, or other causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known when that has been the case, and men have supplied their place, that the wages were entered to the names of the men gone off work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The wages of the men have been entered to the names of the men, during the time of their absence—if four men went off and four others came on, I never noticed that the wages were entered to the names of the four men that had gone off work; that has not occurred to my knowledge; I have not heard of anything of the kind—I do not know that Douglas has been in the habit of advancing wages to the men himself, nor that Mellish has—after Mellish had left, I remember Douglas calling my attention to deductions in Powell's account; I do not recollect to what amount, some-where about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a mistake of that sort—if he bad not called my attention to it, I should have paid it; not to him, but to Powell's—it was an overcharge—he could not have got the money, it would be paid direct from me to Powell—he has not, to my recollection, called my attention to any other errors as against my employers—I confine my attention solely to the cash and the books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked about arrangements, did you know of anything, in the nature of an arrangement, either about the two accounts, or in respect of the mode of keeping them, except what Mellish himself told yon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—when I spoke of an arrangement, I meant what Mellish told me he should do—it was Mellish's duty to tee that the accounts that were brought to me by Douglas, were correct before Douglas brought them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was said, and by whom, as to the initials being put to the accounts before they were paid; you say after July and Aug., you would not have paid unless Mellish's initials had been put on the bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yet, for regularity's sake—something was said by me to Mellish on the subject—I cannot recollect what, or whether it was by Mr. Thompson, or myself, it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185111240086"/>
               <p>was said by one or the other—it was explained to Mellisb, that it was for for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of the accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any person to your knowledge, whose duty it was to see that the accounts Douglas submitted to you were correct, before Douglas brought them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, Mellish—that was his duty at all times, both before and after July, hut after July he was required to put his initials indi<lb/>cative of it—I know nothing on the subject of gratuities, except what appears in the wages book—if Mellish paid gratuities, I should not inquire about them, I had no means of knowing whether Mellish or Douglas had paid them, except from what appears in the wages book—I never inquired how it happened—my duty was merely to see that they were in the wages book—I know nothing of absent workmen being substituted by others—I always paid Mellish his wages, six guineas a week.</p>

               <p>I was at one time in partnership with Mr. Frederick Halle Thomson—I was present when Mellish was engaged—I know of the agreement which was afterwards entered into—Dean came some time after Mellish was engaged—I think a wages book was had then, for the first time—I am not aware of one before—I have seen Mellish, both at the desk and table—I think I have seen the wages book there, when Mellish has been there—I have earnestly and anxiously inquired into it, and have very little doubt I have seen him with the wages book—I have a doubt about it—I think that it was Mellish's duty decidedly to see that the wages were correctly entered in the wages book, because he stipulated to have the whole and sole control over that department—he has not said anything about my interference; he has as to Mr. Thomson, he said he had no business with the workmen (the glass cutters), if he had any questions to ask he ought to ask them of him, Mellish, and not of the men, and said, "If I find you interfering with my men any more I will throw up my situation"—they were all in-door men—I have seen Mellish at times with a pencil in his hand, at the desk, drawing different patterns, such as were required in the business—I am not positive whether I have seen him with any book before him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On many occasions has he had quarrels with Mr. Thomson, or only once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three times—I recollect Mr. Thomson had some machinery erected in the fore part of the house where Mellish had no connection, but he accidentally went up and saw it, and complained of its being a breach of the engagement with him, in giving him the sole control of the business—that was about six weeks or two months before Mellish left; he left early in May—I had just joined Mr. Thomson in partnership when Mellish came—Mr. Thomson was in treaty with him when I entered into partnership, and concluded it afterwards—Mr. Cookney was in partnership with us at the same time that was about 15th Oct, or thereabouts, in 1849—Mr. Cookney is an attorney—I knew of the patent being taken out by Thomson and Mellish together; Mellish as our servant proposed that a certain patent should be taken out; I think it was in my name—I can hardly tell when that was—it was before I went that he failed in silvering the inkstands for Mr. Lund—I know that Mellish afterwards succeeded in doing so, that was in consequence of the glass being inverted in such a way that it presented two surfaces, and the solution of silver was put in, Mellish at my suggestion tried the experiment and was successful, and that was the reason my name was put in—I think some of the inkstands of Mr. Lund were done so, but I suggested a mustard-pot or cream-jug—Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185111240087"/>
               <p>Lund had a patent for the inkstands, which failed—I think Mellish had an interest in them with Mr. Lund—afterwards at my suggestion, we found we could put silver on inkstands of this description by making the double glass; it was perfected and you may see them to-day—I believe the patent was taken out in my name, I am not quite sure—I know nothing of the glass trade—Mellish had no interest in it, he carried it out for his master; he was not one of the patentees—I think it was in the name of Thomson and Varnish, but the patent will show—Mellish may have suggested or carried out something, but I do not know that he had any interest in the patent—I never consented to any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you instruct Mr. Cookney to ask him to sign a paper relinquish<lb/>ing his interest in the patent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was proposed, for the sake of avoiding any future difficulty—I was present when he refused to sign it—Mr. Thomson was there, and Mr. Cookney too; it was in Mr. Thornton's library—I cannot tell the date, I think it had been lying over several weeks before this thing came on the <hi rend="italic">tapis</hi>; and Mr. Mellish went to his house for the paper, which he had left at home; he brought it back and said he would never sign it for this reason, that Mr. Cookney's clerk had put it down that in consequence of his poverty he could not carry it out himself—I do not know what was done with the paper, I believe Mellish carried it away with him—I do not recollect a second paper being prepared and presented to him, or his refusing to sign it, or any paper being burned—I recollect Mellish going away from Regent-street—the shop there was kept in the name of Mellish; his wife managed the business in consequence of his absence at the glass-works; she was always in the shop—she had the shop about a twelve-month—they went away on a Monday—before that I think he bad told me that he had made up his mind that he should leave—he said the business was not managed according to his views; he did not see that anything of a profitable nature to him could arise to make it worth his while to stay—I was" not present when he said it was too much for his wife's health, and his own; or when he said anything about sending to Regent-street for a person to take charge of the goods—I did not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> on the Monday to take charge of them myself—I cannot recollect going on the Saturday when Mr. Thomson was with me—I might have done so—I think the furniture was removed in the course of the Monday—I was there a few minutes; Mr. Thomson was not there on the Monday; I think I went alone on Monday—Mr. Thomson has not spoken to me since he was examined about what he said, nor has any<lb/>body else—I have been outside in Mr. Clark's room—I went to Paris two or three times with Mellish; the last time was just before Christmas last—we went from Brussels to Paris, and were absent a week—the second time was April or May 1850; we were absent rather less than a week, because we were never absent on Sunday—the other time was in the year before, we went to make purchases of glass—I am not quite positive, but I think we went three times; we went to the first establishments in Paris—purchases of glass abroad were very small in comparison of purchases of Messrs. Powell—I did not transact the business with Messrs. Powell, they sent in their accounts and were always paid by check of the firm—I went to France the first time to take out a patent there for the double hollow work—I attended at the police-office on two examinations; there was a third—I do not think I was at the first—I do not think I was there when Mellish was charged the first time—I was not there when he was allowed to go away on his own recog<lb/>nizances alone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I have seen the accounts in which the altera<lb/>tion of amount is—I believe the alteration in the figures in this account of 14th Sept. to be the alteration of Douglas—these second accounts of 27th July and 19th July appear to be in Douglas's writing—he writes a freer hand than Mellish—I hardly know what to say about this one of 17th Aug.—the figures are very much like Douglas's, but hardly so free as his—my belief is that they are his; and this of 30th July, also.</p>

Douglas was taken on Saturday, 4th Oct.; and on the Monday afterwards I discovered some vouchers in the boxes in Mellish's private room, and others in the table-drawer, which was locked—I employed a locksmith to force it—I showed them to Mr. Thomson, and they were in my possession some time, and were handed over to Mr. Wakeling—these vouchers were amongst those I found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in the same house as the prisoner did—he occupied the back first-floor room, over my head—on 23rd Oct., I was sitting in my room with the door open, and heard him come home between 7 and 8 o'clock—he went into his own room, and I heard him slap and beat the child, and throw it, like as if he had dashed it on the ground two or three times—I heard the child scream very loud, and in about five or six minutes heard the prisoner say, "If anybody interferes with me, I will b—y well serve them the same"—I have heard his voice before that night, but only on the stairs—I heard no more till between 12 and 1, when I was-in</p>

In consequence of information, on 24th Oct., about 12 o'clock in the day, I went to Douglas-street, West-minster—the last witness fetched me—I found the woman Reynolds there—there was a bed-tick lying on the floor, with a very little in it, and the body of the child was lying on it, covered with a bit of sack—it was quite dead and cold—I lifted up the frock and saw a great many bruises, and there was fresh blood on the tick in several places—there was a wound near the child's eye, from which the blood appeared to have proceeded—the child only had on a frock, nothing underneath—I found this child's shirt, which has been pro<lb/>duced, underneath, the tick, saturated with blood, quite wet—a little lower down, underneath the tick, I found the man's shirt, with marks of blood on different parts of it—I found two large pools of blood on the floor, close against the hearth, as if something had been dashed down on the boards—the fire-place is right opposite the door of the room—the room is about eight or nine feet square—there were marks of blood on the floor in two places, and there was one place where some had been attempted to be washed off the floor—there was a smear—I went with the woman to the gas-works, found the prisoner just coming out, and I told him I should take him into custody on a charge of wilful murder against a child, at No. 6, Douglas-street—he said what he had to say he should say at the station when he arrived there—I took him to the station, he there said he left off work about half-past 5; he went and had some beer with some men; he went home about half-past 7, drunk, fell over the child, and he did not know what he had done—the child's body laid on the bed on the left hand as I went into the room—I searched the prisoner at the station, and found blood on his smock-frock, and on his trowsers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Westminster. On 24th Oct. shortly after 2 o'clock, I was called to this house in Douglas-street, and found the body of a female child there—Millerman and the superintendent of police were there—I examined the body, and found sixteen bruises on the surface and extremities—they were severe bruises, most of them, and appeared to be of several days' standing—the left arm and right leg had been recently frac<lb/>tured—there was a contused wound under the left eye, and the head and face were covered with bruises—there was one very extensive one covering the whole right side of the head, and there was blood extravasated under the scalp—the wound and contusions on the head were of recent date—the contusions were such as might have been produced by the child being thrown violently down—on 30th Oct. I made an internal examination, but before doing so, I found an old fracture of the left collar-bone, and some bruises of a circular character on the calf of the left leg, and on the instep, with indentations, apparently occasioned by the marks of teeth—those marks were recent—they were from the teeth of a human being—on making the internal examination, I found a large clot of blood, extravasated, beneath the scalp, covering nearly the whole of the right side of the head, "and on opening the head I found blood, extravasated on the brain, corresponding with the external injury—that was the cause of death—the external injuries would, in my opinion, cause that extravasation of blood, which produced the death.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Maidstone, and am a general dealer. On 19th Aug., between two and three o'clock in the morning, I was in a booth, erected in a meadow, near Maidstone; there was a fair there, Ford was there sitting on the counter of the bar intoxicated—the prisoner was there—there was a pot standing at the bar, and one of them offered me to bet, and after I had drank, the prisoner said, "If I had known you were going to drink out of that pot, you should not have drank out of it"—he called me an Irishman—I turned round to Golding and asked him if I was ever called an I rish<lb/>man—the prisoner struck me twice on the lips—the deceased said it was a shame to strike an old man, old enough to be his father—he said, "What have you got to do with it?" and struck him twice, somewhere about the face, I cannot say exactly where, and as he fell back on the counter, the prisoner lifted up his legs, and threw him over into the bar—the counter he fell from was between two and three feet high, and between three and four feet wide—as he fell back his legs came up, and he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him over—the prisoner was not drunk—I cannot say but what he had bad something to drink, because I saw him drink, but he was no way the worse for liquor—I did not remain to see Ford picked up—the prisoner went away, and I followed him—soon after he went across the fields, and I went up the high road—I was present at the Inquest, and saw the body there.</p>

I was on duty in the Old Kent-road—about 7 o'clock in the evening I saw the three prisoners, but Williams and Simpson were together first—they walked along looking into different shops, and Reynolds was on the other side of the way—I fol<lb/>lowed Williams and Simpson from twenty minutes to half an hour to the Bricklayers' Arms station—they stopped a minute, and then walked on very fast towards New Cross—about 150 yards from the Green Man public-house Reynolds joined them, and they walked about 250 yards towards New Cross—I still followed them—Williams went in front about thirty or forty yards—she then walked behind them—I went on as far as the Kentish Drovers, when I met two constables in uniform (I was in plain clothes)—I then stopped Reynolds, and asked him what he had about him—he said, "Nothing"—Simpson was stopped by a constable in uniform—their pockets were searched at the place where they were taken, but nothing was found—just as I had done searching Reynolds's pockets, Williams came along on the same side of the way—when she got within about two yards of us she crossed the road—I followed, and took her by both her wrists—I asked her what she had got—she said, "Nothing"—she tried to put her left hand behind her—I took it, opened it, and found something wrapped up—I said, "I thought you said you had got nothing?"—she said, "You have got it now"—I opened the parcel at the station, and found it contained these eleven shillings and four sixpences—I searched Reynolds again, and found two good shillings on him and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Simpson.</p>

I was on duty on London bridge, at 5 minutes before six o'clock in the morning—I saw a butcher's cart pass me—the prisoner and the deceased were in it—the pri<lb/>soner was driving it with reins—he was going twelve or fourteen miles an hour, as near as I can say—they were trotting—there were other carts on the bridge—the prisoner was going towards the Borough—I watched the cart, because it was driving so fast—it ran against the right side of a four-wheeled wagon, which turned the cart over, and both the men were thrown out—the wagon stood close against the kerb-stone on the left hand side, coming into the City—there was another wagon with three horses in the centre of the road; and instead of his passing it on the right side, he went on the driver's side—I went up, and found the deceased lying on his belly on the road bleeding from the left ear—he was not sensible—I got a board and took him to the hospital—it was just beginning to be daybreak—it was dark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live at Stoke Newington. On Tuesday morning, 11th Nov., I was coming over London-bridge towards the City, driving a light four-wheeled van with a horse in a rein—I was on the near-side, about a foot and a half, or it might be two feet, from the kerb—when I got just over the top of the bridge, I saw the butcher's cart coming over the bridge towards the Borough, meeting me—it was driving at a very fast rate indeed, at the rate of twelve or fourteen miles an hour; a very fast trot—there were two men in it—it was on the wrong side, and on the off-side of my van—there was another wagon before me—he passed on the near-side of that—I cannot say whether there was room for him to pass on his proper side of that—it was rather dark—after he had passed that wagon, I think if he had been going at a steady rate he would have cleared my van; but his horse was going at such a rate he could not stop it—his wheel ran over my fore-wheel, and caught my hind-wheel, and that turned him over—both the men in the cart were thrown out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How near were you to the cart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Within, about two feet—I moved my van on after the accident, to let others pass me, but as to going any nearer the kerb, I do not think I was an inch nearer—you were going at such a rate that I do not think your horse was within your power, but if you had been going a steady rate you might have cleared me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the horse running loose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but he was coming at such a rate that the horse had got the power of him just for a moment—the prisoner was taken to the hospital—I did not see whether the wagon that was before me had struck him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of St. Thomas's Hospital—William Stopford was brought there—I saw him first on 11th Nov., about six in the morning—I examined him and saw it was necessay for him to come</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185111240105"/>
               <p>into the hospital at once—he was bleeding from the ear, and he had a scalp wound just over the left ear—he was sensible at the time, but I knew be would shortly become insensible, and he was taken into the hospital—he had a fractured collar-bone, and complained of great pain in his chest, that would proceed from the fracture of the collar-bone, and of the ribs which we discovered at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—he became insensible very shortly after he was taken in, and died on the following Sunday—he recovered his senses, but very imperfectly—he knew his wife—that was the only person he did know—he saw her shortly after he came in, just before he became insensible—I examined his body after death—it was generally healthy—I discovered fracture at the base of the skull, broken ribs, and broken collar-bone—the fracture at the base of the skull was the principal, and there was a great quantity of blood effused in the chest—the fracture was deep in the skull, and was not visible outwardly—it was within the ear as it were, and that would account for the bleeding of the ear—there was blood effused on the brain—in my judgment the cause of his death was that blood on the brain, and the effusion of blood in the chest, which com<lb/>pressed the lungs—those injuries were such as might be occasioned by a fall from a cart—I saw the prisoner, he was shaken and slightly bruised—nothing more—I sent him out immediately.</p>
