I know the prisoner—he came to lodge in our house for three or four days—he slept in the same room with me, in the next bed to me—it is a lodging house—he got up before me in the morning—I missed my shoes the moment I got up—I saw him looking under my bed, but I had no idea he would have taken my shoes, for he was pitying me the day before, being an old man—he went down stairs, and went out at the back door—I never saw any more of him for five days afterwards, till he was taken up on another charge—he never came nigh our house after that—I afterwards saw my shoes at Arbour-square police-court.</p>

I put back the purse in the same pocket; I am quite sure of that—that was the left trowsers pocket, and I buttoned it up—I afterwards went with the prisoner to a house that she called her mother's—she said nobody stopped there but her mother and a little niece; we went up stairs to a small room—that was three or four minutes after I had changed the half sovereign—there was a little girl in the house—she was not in the room when we first went in, the prisoner called her up—when we went into the room the pri<lb/>soner told me to pull off my trowsers and stockings; 1 did so, but I insisted on her stripping a" well—I put my trowsers on two little shelves by the window—the prisoner did not strip—she went down stairs with the girl and had some communication, and came up again, and called the girl up—she only took her shawl off—it was before she went down that I took off my trowsers—she was gone about a minute and a half—nobody came into the room while she was away—when she came up again she called up the girl to put the window blind to rights—that girl is not here; she was</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 158). I am stationed at Brentford. I saw the prisoner there on Monday last, near the waterworks, about half a mile from Mr. Woodley's—he had a sack on his shoulders, which I took very particular notice of—in the course of the same evening I, with Mr. Woodley, saw the prisoner again—Mr. Woodley asked him what the sack contained that he took to the brewery—he said sawdust—he asked him where he got it from—he said, "From Scott's"—I took him in custody—I went with Mr. Woodley to the brewery, and Mr. Allen showed us this sack, which I said I could swear to—it was the one the prisoner had in the morning—it contained two bushels and a half of malt.</p>

The prisoner was in my service from Oct up to last Monday; he was fore-man at one of my malt houses, and had the charge of everything there—in consequence of what I heard from the last witness, I went on Monday even<lb/>ing to look for the prisoner, and met him; I said to him, "You were seen to-day with a sack; what was in that sack?"—he said, "Sawdust"—I asked him where he brought it from—he said, "Scott's"—I detained him, and vent with the officer to Mr. Allen's brewery—I was there shown this sack—it was taken to the station and opened; it contained malt—I examined it, and I believe it is mine—I had a considerable bulk of it, about eighty quarters—I have examined it since, and there was some missing—it was Irish malt—I have had similar sacks to this in my possession—the malt comes in sacks, and they remain there—I believe this sack to have been on my premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, in Messrs. Westenholz's office. On Monday, 6th Feb., shortly after 1 o'clock, I went out of the office, and met two foreign gentlemen on the staircase, followed by the prisoner, who was with them—they asked me for Mr. Westenholz's, and I showed them into Mr. Westenholz's room, and asked the prisoner to go into the clerks' office and take a seat; he declined at first, but I told him it might be a long time before the gentlemen came out again, and opened the door, gave him a chair and made him sit down—I then went out, and returned in about half an hour afterwards, when the prisoner was standing outside on the landing, a little distance from the door—I said nothing to him—the next time I saw him was on the following Thursday, the 9th, outside the Mansion-house—I asked him if he knew me again; and</p>

               <p>after some hesitation he said, "No"—I then asked him if he did not accompany two foreign gentlemen to the City last Monday, but did not mention any house; he said, "Yes, to Mincing-lane;" I said, "No, to Mark-lane," and he said, "Yes, to Mark-lane"—I then asked him if he did not meet me on the stairs; he said, "Oh, yes, and you showed me into the room, and told me to take a seat"—it was Mr. Ogilvy's duty to open the bill-box twice a day; the slit on the outside measures about eight inches by an inch and a half—I have once or twice taken letters out through the slit; not by using any instrument, but the letters were very large.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a native of Germany, but a naturalized Englishman by Act of Parliament—I quite understand English—I am a commission agent, of 33, Seckeford-street, Clerkenwell—I was a publican in Clerkenwell for fifteen years in one house, and for six or seven years I have carried on a commission business—I have known the prisoner eighteen months or two years; when I first knew him he kept a chandler's shop, but latterly he was at the Royal Hotel, Blackfriars-bridge, as night porter; he was there within these two months to my recollection. On Wednesday, 8th Feb., between 10 and 11 o'clock, I believe, he came to my house, and said he wanted to speak to me—I asked him if it was anything particular; he said, "Yes"—I said, "I will fetch my hat, and we will go to a public house "—I went with him to the Anchor, in St. John-street—when we got there, he said his master had discharged him; I said, "Why?" he said he was accused of not doing any work that night; that must have been Tuesday night, the last night—he said, "I have spoken to the porters about it; my master is very hasty, but I dare say it will be all right again"—he then said that two Danish gentlemen who he had been cleaning clothes for, and who had come from Denmark on diplomatic service, and who had fourteen or fifteen pairs of boots, ten or twelve coats, and so on, asked him what he would charge if he went out with them, and cleaned the boots, and brushed the clothes; and that he said he would consider about it, and let them know; and that he was to go out with them as interpreter and show them the town—he then said, "I think I can buy a bill very cheap;" I said, "What bill?" he said, "I think it is a bill of the Bank of England"—I told him that there were a great many different bills of the Bank of England, and if I could see the bill I could tell him what it was—I asked him if he had got it; he said, "No, but he could buy it for a few shillings"—I said I wished I could see it; "Well,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270015"/>
               <p>he said, "I tell you now, I have got it," and produced it to me; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I asked him where he got it; he said he bought it of a bricklayer—I asked him whether he knew the bricklayer; he said, "Yes"—I asked him where the bricklayer found it; he said, "At the Post-office"—I told him that it was a very strange place to find a bill like that—he asked me whether I thought I could negotiate the bill; I said, "I should advise you to take it to the Bank of England, you can take it yourself; or I will go with you if you wish me, and by so doing I have no doubt but that they will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" and I said, "Honesty is the best policy," and told him that as his character was very black in London previously, it might be a great advantage to him in future if he took it to the Bank of England; that it would be a benefit to him—I spoke it in a friendly way, friendly advice—he said, "No, I will go down to White-chapel to the Minories, and see if I cannot negotiate it among the Jews"—I said nothing more; but in a minute or two I asked for the bill again, he gave it to me, and I noticed it particularly, so that I knew where to apply to; I then gave it back to him, and we made an appointment for the next day to meet me at my house, 33, Seckeford-street, to go to Mr. Saunders, a house agent in New Oxford-street; he then left, and I went to Smithfield, got a Directory, found out where Messrs. Westenholz lived, and went to 26, Mark-lane, where I saw one of the partners—on the following day I spoke to Spittle, the officer—next day, Thursday, the 9th, the prisoner came to my house, about 10 o'clock, I believe it was; I then went with him to Mr. Saunders; on the way there, I told him I thought I could get it discounted at Messrs. Reid's brewery, in Liquorpond street—he said, "Whatever you get, I will give you half"—I asked him for the bill; he said he had not got it with him, he had it at home and would fetch it; I said, "Very well, I will wait for you at Reid's tap, at the brewery;" there are two taps there, one for the draymen and the other for the clerks—he left me in Holborn, at the corner of Gray's Inn-lane—I met him at Reid's tap, three quarters of an hour afterwards—he said, "l am very hungry, I want some luncheon;" he had some bread and cheese and a glass of stout, and after that he gave me the bill; and said, "Now you can get it"—I said, "What name? you must endorse the bill when it is paid;" he said, "I will not put my own name"—he told me he gave the bricklayer 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; I said it was very cheap—he said that anything I got for it he would give me half—he gave me the bill in the tap; I took it into the counting house, and gave it to Spittle, the officer, who was there by previous arrangement with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When the prisoner first came to you, being an old acquaintance, you adjourned to the public house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was my proposition; he was agreeable—I have been a licensed victualler for some years—the prisoner was formerly a countryman of mine; I hear that he came from the neighbourhood of Frankfort—I had known him about a year and a half, or it might be a year and nine months, or two years—I do not know that it was through my means that he got the place at this hotel; I take in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> in the morning, and I saw the place advertised—I assisted him so far in getting it—the hotel is kept by a Belgian—I know that this is the same bill—the amount of it is 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and, I believe, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or some<lb/>thing like it; I could not swear to the shillings—I have seen it since several times, I did not see any acceptance; I looked at it—I noticed the amount of the money when I looked at it—I am sure of that; I am not sure as to the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I am sure as to the 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know the date for payment,</p>

               <p>but not the date of the bill—I might have mentioned before about the prisoner going to the Minories, and getting it changed among the Jews, or I might not; he said he would go to Whitechapel or the Minories to have the bill negotiated, to get some money—I do not know whether I men<lb/>tioned it before to-day—there are very likely many things that I have not mentioned that I could mention now—I believe I have mentioned before about going to Mr. Saunders, the house agent—I believe I mentioned it when the solicitor of the Bank of England took the evidence down; I can undertake to say that I have rejected the conversation accurately—I took him to Reid's by design—he told me that he had bought this bill—he never at any time said anything different from that—he had told me the previous day that he could buy it—he said, "I can get it for a few shillings, and I think I will buy it"—when I met him on Thursday, I never mentioned anything about the bill—I had not made an appointment with him about the bill, my appointment was to go to Saunders, not for the purpose of getting it dis<lb/>counted—he had taken a house of Saunders, and I had been there several times with him—he had said, the previous day, that he would see about getting the bill discounted; and as soon as he saw me on the Thursday, he said, "I don't think I will have anything more to do with the bill"—the principal appointment we made was to go to Saunders about this house, to have the agreement made out—I did not imply that it was for any pur<lb/>pose connected with the bill—I took him to Reid's for the purpose of having it discounted; he said to me at first he would not have anything more to do with the bill, but at last he said, "I bought the bill; how much do you think I bought it for?"—I attempted to deceive him about negotiating the bill, or else I should not have made the appointment—I have seen him at times while he was at the Royal Hotel; I was in the habit of associating with him.</p>

On Thursday, 9th Feb., about 1 o'clock in the day, the prisoner was brought to the Bank of England, by Spittle—Spittle asked me to take charge of the prisoner, and said in his presence, that he was charged with stealing a bill, or words to that effect; Spittle went away—the prisoner afterwards said to me, "I did not steal the bill, I bought it of a man of the name of Goldsmith, in Petticoat-lane, and gave him 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; I was buying some slippers of him in Petticoat-lane, and the man Goldsmith saw that I had so much money in my purse that he asked me to buy the bill; I went with him into a public house in White<lb/>chapel, and paid him for the bill"—he said Goldsmith lived in Goulstone-street, but that he had never been to his house—I asked him how he came to buy the bill—he said he saw "Bank of England" on the bill, and he thought it was all right; he said he paid 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I afterwards took him to the station, he there gave his address as living in a court in Water-lane, but he did not know the number—I have since been there—in fact the pri<lb/>soner showed me the house, it turns out to be a house in Huish-court, in the neighbourhood of the Royal Hotel.</p>

               <p>was superintendent of large farms at Bathurst, over the Blue Mountains, in the same colony; at the latter period I had a wife, and family of young children; the former, a most amiable partner, I had the misfortune to lose in 1838, leaving me with seven young children; my connections are most respectable; my late father was an officer of rank, and of very meritorious services; my eldest brother is at present a major in the Royal Marine corps; I was convicted in October, 1846; was three months in Millbank Peniten<lb/>tiary, at which period fears were entertained that my intellects would become impaired in solitary confinement; subsequently I was three years and two months in the <hi rend="italic">Warrior</hi> convict ship at Woolwich, during which period I was employed on the Government works in the dockyard; I was sent abroad in March, 1850; at Millbank and the Hulks I had the best possible character, as also on my arrival at Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land, after a passage of four months—on my arrival I received a ticket of leave, which I retained until I left the colony, never having forfeited the game for a day by any kind of insubordinate conduct; my motive in leaving Van Diemen's Land was to proceed to the gold-diggings, in the hope I might be successful, and better the condition of my family at home, who are in very impoverished circumstances, but, although my exertions were very great in California, Victoria, and New South Wales, I was unsuccessful; it is true I made occasionally some money, but I was robbed of it on the road by armed bush-rangers, and frequently ill-used and robbed at Mel<lb/>bourne and Geelong by the worst of characters; I was shipwrecked twice, and once burnt out at sea, the first time in Torres Straits, between New, Holland and New Guinea, on a reef of coral rocks; upon this occasion I lost between 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and all my luggage; eleven of us only got ashore, out of a ship's company of twenty-seven, chiefly Lascars, Malays, and Chinamen; after thirty days great suffering and privation, we were picked up by an American whaler, and ultimately reached Sydney, New South Wales; I was subsequently wrecked in a brigantine, called the <hi rend="italic">Triton</hi>, going from Melbourne to Adelaide, and lost all I possessed in the world, having another very narrow escape of my life; in returning from San Francisco to Melbourne in a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">White Squall</hi>, she caught fire about 350 miles from Tahiti (formerly called Otaheite), we were obliged to abandon her, and took to the boats, but a great number of the crew and passengers perished by fire and water, the survivors in the boats reaching Tahiti in about eight days, in a state of great exhaustion, many of whom died from the effects of the same; I had the misfortune to lose nearly all I possessed upon this occasion; on reaching Melbourne I was very ill, and went into the hospital; I left in about five weeks, intending to go again to Mount Alexander diggings, but owing to ill health, bad state of the roads from the floods, and limited means, I abandoned such; I had a twelvemonth before been to Ballarat, Mount Alexander, Forest Creek, Bendigo, and many other diggings, but at this time no police was organized, or gold escort troopers, consequently nearly all the unfortunate diggers were robbed of what they got, by hordes of bush-rangers, well mounted, and armed with revolvers and other weapons to the teeth; in returning to Melbourne from Forest Creek the last time, I was beat, stripped, and robbed of all I had, in the Black Forest, about half way between Melbourne and Mount Alexander; I left Melbourne in the brig, <hi rend="italic">Kestril</hi>, for Sydney, New South Wales, at which place I was acquainted with many respectable parties, some of whom I had known as far back as 1829, when I first went to Sydney with my</p>

I was in the shop when this happened—I saw the prisoner there, and the last witness—I saw Mr. Bolton take a sixpence from a shelf at the back of his counter; he showed it to the prisoner, and told her she tendered it to him some nights before—he showed it to Mr. Jones, who placed the sixpence on the counter—the prisoner directly put her fingers on the sixpence, and took it up and put it in her mouth—I did not notice what she did with the shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Eyre-street, Fitzroy-square. On 21st Jan., Simpson came, about a quarter past 5 o'clock, for a bonnet shape—she gave me in payment a half crown—I took it in the parlour; I thought it was not good; I gave it to my sister, she thought it was good; I left it with her—I gave the prisoner change, and she left the shop—I afterwards got the half crown again—my sister left it on the table, and I took it up—I tried it, and bent it—I put it in a drawer, where there was no other money—on Wednesday, 25th Jan., the prisoner came for a bonnet shape again, and she gave me a half crown; I looked at it and saw it had much the same look as the other—it looked dull—I rang the bell, and called my brother down—he took the half crown to the public house, he brought it back, threw it on the counter and said it was bad—Simpson was at the counter at the time—the half crown was bent at that time—I told my brother it was the same woman that was there on the Saturday, and told him to fetch a policeman—he went, but could not find a policeman—he went a second time, and when he was gone the second time the prisoner Day came into the shop—he asked Simpson how much longer she was going to keep him there—she said she had given a bad half crown—he said if his wife had bought any<lb/>thing he would pay for it; and he took out a shilling, I believe it was, but I declined to take it, and they both went out—I put the second half crown in the drawer with the other one—the officer came to the shop with the prisoners the same evening, and I gave him the two half crowns—I had not left the shop in the interim—no one else had put anything in that drawer or taken anything out—there was other money in the till, but not in the drawer.</p>

On 9th Feb. the prisoner and two other men came to my house—I was not present when they came in; I came in while they were there—there was no gin before them—my barmaid had taken it away again—she told me that the prisoner had put down a bad shilling that she had broken up, and thrown the pieces down, and the other two men, who came in with the prisoner, took the pieces up, and one of the other men put down another shilling, and said, "Is that a good one?" and she found that to be bad, and broke it up—I saw the pieces of the last broken shilling—I told the prisoner and his companions to go out, and they went away—I gave the pieces of the shilling to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City police. On 14th Feb., I was in Oxford-street—I saw the two prisoners in conversation together, near the shop of Mrs. Gower—Jones went in the shop, and Beard remained outside, near the shop door—before Jones went in the shop, Beard went to the shop door and looked in; he then went close to Jones, who was a few yards off, and appeared to give him something—Jones then went in the shop, and when he came out, Beard was a few yards from the door—I went in the shop and got this sixpence, and when I came out they were walking together along Oxford-street, about fifty or sixty yards from the shop; I followed them, and saw Jones and Beard both occasionally looking in shops as they passed, and Beard opened the doors of several public houses and looked in—they walked on sometimes together, and sometimes apart—they went on to the St. Alban's Hotel, in Charles-street; Beard went to the door, opened it, and looked in—he then turned round, looked towards Jones, and raised his hat—Jones was a few yards from the door—he then came forwards, and went into the public house, and Beard walked across the street towards the Opera Colonnade—I went into the hotel while Jones was there; he was being served with some gin—I saw him put down a sixpence; I said to Mrs. Smith, "I think you will find that is a bad sixpence;" she took it up and put it to her mouth, and bent it, and gave it me directly; this is it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270035"/>
               <p>—Jones was then taken in charge—I left him there, and I went out and saw Beard standing between two columns; I took him into custody, and told him I charged him with being concerned with another in passing bad money—I found on him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and copper, and on Jones, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I took them both to the station—all the money found on them was good—Jones gave his address at No. 12, Albert-street, Stepney; I went there, but no such person was known—Beard gave his address in Green-street, Hammersmith; I went, and there is no Green-street there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant and commission agent, and carry on business in Old Broad-street. I had dealings with the prisoner previous to the month of Dec. last—he placed goods in my hands for sale, for which I have accounted—on 17th or 19th Dec. he called upon me, and inquired if my friend Mr. Freese would discount a bill for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at six months' sight, on Messrs. Van Notten—he did not leave the bill then—I saw him again on the same afternoon (19th Dec), I think about 3 o'clock—he called to inquire if Mr. Freese could discount the hill of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Yes, Mr. Freese could do it"—I next saw the prisoner at 25 or 20 minutes to 1 o'clock on Tuesday; I cannot exactly recollect the time; it was a little before I—that was on the 20th—he said he had been to Mr. Freese's office, and made an appointment to be there at half-past 1 o'clock, and asked me to accompany him there, as he wished to buy a bill on France—I accompanied him towards Mr. Freese's office, and we met Mr. Freese by the Mansion House—I told Mr. Freese that the prisoner wished to buy a bill on France—Mr. Freese said, "Come back in a quarter of an hour"—just as Mr. Freese left, the prisoner said, "But I want 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash," and I stopped Mr. Freese, and told him that the prisoner required 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, in order to buy a bank post bill—Mr. Freese then left—the prisoner and myself walked towards Lombard-street, and during the walk he said that Mr. Freese could deduct the cost of the French bill from the balance of the 2,480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—the prisoner and myself then parted—at 2 o'clock I went back to Mr. Freese's office—I saw the prisoner, after we left, turning into Williams and Deacon's, banking house, but did not speak to him then—I saw him again at half past 3—he came accompanied by Mr. Freese and two other parties, one of whom was Forrester, and the other Mr. Clark—Mr. Freese inquired for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said there was no 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there—the prisoner came forward, and stated that he had given instructions for l,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be left at my office, and that when it did come I was to hold it at Mr. Freese's disposal, which I said I would—the prisoner then said to Mr. Freese, "Let us go to my office; perhaps we shall find the money there"—they then left—I saw no more of the prisoner.</p>

Van Notten—I should have had no hesitation in entering into any mercantile transaction with him—if he had given me his own bill upon a first rate house, of course I should not have objected—I have not had any transactions with the house of Van Notten—I never saw the bill in question; I had nothing to do with it in any way—the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was spoken of, I heard was paid to Messrs. Van Notten in exchange for a warrant—I had several transactions with the prisoner after he was introduced to me, to a considerable extent—they were mercantile transactions, in reference to produce, rice, and that kind of goods—the first transaction we had was, he gave me a consignment of cochineal to New York, upon which I gave him an advance—that was in the month of April—that was not a large operation; it was about 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was cochineal consigned from the port of London to New York—it was not warehoused—he gave me bills of lading—the cochineal was to arrive, and to be sold in New York, and the produce to be accounted for—no bills of exchange passed in that transaction; I gave him money—the transaction about the rice was in Nov. last—I had several parcels—he gave me, at different times, about 8,000 bags of rice, and I gave him an advance upon them, and sold them—that rice had come from Montmeuil and Bengal—no bills of exchange passed then; it was cash—I gave him advances of money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an exchange, discount, and insurance broker, carrying on business at No. 16, George-street, Mansion House. Previous to 20th Dec. I had a communication from Mr. Ryder, with reference to a bill of exchange, of about this amount, to be discounted for the prisoner—on 20th Dec. I received from my clerk, Mr. Green, a bill for 2,480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this produced is it—I took that bill to Messrs. Over end, Gurney, and Co.—on my way there I met Mr. Ryder and the prisoner—he then gave me instructions to get 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—I got the bill discounted at Messrs. Over end, Gurney, and Co.'s—I got a check for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I gave it to my clerk to get cashed on purpose that I might give the 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash to Anderson—my clerk gave him the 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my presence—before that, while my clerk was gone to cash the check, the prisoner and I had a conversation with reference to a bill for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Havre or Paris—it was arranged that I should send the balance of the money to Mr. Ryder—about 3 o'clock the same day I received some information from Messrs. Over end and Gurney with respect to the bill, in consequence of which I went to Mr. Chapman, the managing partner at Overend and Gurney's—he told me that I should find the prisoner at Messrs. Womersley and Burt's offices, in Cle<lb/>ment-lane—I went there, and found the prisoner in custody of Forrester, the officer—I demanded of him the 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I had given him—he said that I should most likely find it at No. 76, Old Broad-street, which is the counting house of Mr. Ryder—I merely asked the prisoner for the money that he had received from me—I did not say why I asked for it—I had been instructed by Mr. Chapman to ask for it, and therefore I demanded it—Mr. Chapman had told me it was a forgery when I saw him at his office—I went to Mr. Ryder's—the prisoner went with me and Forrester, and another person with Forrester—I did not find the money there—upon that, the prisoner said that most likely it must be in Billiter-street, which was his counting house—we went to Billiter-street—I went up stairs with the prisoner, Forrester, and the other person, and the prisoner decamped down another staircase, Forrester in pursuit—he went through some counting house, and down another staircase—Forrester followed him—I also followed—the other staircase led into Billiter-street and into Fenchurch-street—I overtook him in two or three minutes—he ran away, and there was a cry of "Stop thief!" and when I came up with him he was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with Forrester—I went with them in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Mansion House, and there he was searched—600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was found upon his person, besides other documents.</p>

               <p>of the bill—I believe he said that if he saw Messrs.

Van Notten, the accep<lb/>tors of the bill, and it would be all right—he appeared to be anxious to see Messrs. Van Notten about it—there was a genuine anxiety to see them on the subject—I cannot say that I know Messrs. Van Notten—I had seen Mr. Anderson before; I had had transactions in business with him, through the introduction of Mr. Ryder; I had not fulfilled any transactions—Mr. Ryder had some previous conversation with me about a bill of about that amount, whether I could get it discounted, before I received the bill—I had no knowledge previously of Mr. Anderson's being concerned in large transactions with Messrs.

On 20th Dec. last, I received this bill of exchange for 2,480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Freese to be discounted, I gave him a check for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—(<hi rend="italic">bill read:</hi> "Calcutta, 4th Oct, 1853.

(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) on 20th Dec.—I know we got the bill—I gave the money for it—the bill for 2,480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was with myself personally—the bill for 3,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was taken on the Saturday previous by my house, I being out of town—the bill for 2,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was with me personally—I received it I should say between 11 and 12 o'clock in the day, from Mr. Womersley, Mr. Freese having previously left the bill for 2,480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my suspicions were immediately excited—I made a communication on the sub<lb/>ject to Mr. Womersley, he left the bill with me and left the house—upon this, seeing this second bill offered by a second broker, it seemed so extra<lb/>ordinary, I made a communication to Messrs. Van Notten, and in conse<lb/>quence of what I heard from them I took other steps—the first step I took was to stop the check at the bankers, to prevent its being changed for bank notes—the next was to send to Mr. Freese to acquaint him with the cir<lb/>cumstance,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270040"/>
               <p>and the next was to send to Forrester, the officer, to endeavour to apprehend the last endorser—Mr. Womersley came back and I acquainted him with what I had ascertained, namely that his bill was a forgery—I very soon afterwards went to his office—I there found Mr. Womersley and his partner Mr. Burt, the prisoner, Mr. Freese I think was there also, and Forrester—I cannot speak as to what was said, for I was not in the same room—I saw the prisoner sitting down in the room, but I heard nothing said to him, nor did I hear him say anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you succeed in tracing out 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that had been advanced upon the bill by way of discount on one of the bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps I had better explain what I did advance—the best answer I can give is this, that we succeeded in tracing the whole of the notes—the first thing we did was to send to the Bank, to know whether those numbers had been come to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not ask your mode of doing it, did you trace them to Van Notten's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. no doubt went to Van Notten's; but that is a step which I cannot answer—as far as we are concerned, we gave Freese a check for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of this bill, which he changed and gave the prisoner as I understand 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account; I sent afterwards to the Bank to stop those notes, and eventually found that 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid (this is only hearsay) to P. and C. Van Notten and Co., by the prisoner—I know Van Notten's very well—the firm consists of Mr. Charles Pole, and Mr. Lambert Pole—I suppose Mr. Charles Pole is the senior partner, he is the eldest brother and I suppose he stands first—I have known them many years—I have had very many transactions with them—very few in the way of dis<lb/>counting bills, it has been chiefly depositing money with us at interest, to make use of when they like, to draw it when they please—that was the chief nature of our transactions with them—we are bankers as well as bill brokers—I did not know Anderson—I believe Van Nottens have two places of business—I really do not know where they are—you will think I do not answer straightforward, but I really do not know—I seldom leave our own house; I have reason to think they have one house somewhere about Billiter-street or that direction, and another house in Token-house-yard—we have acted for them in money transactions generally, but banking has been the chief nature of our account with them—their accounts with us have been to a considerable amount—bills were never paid into our house, it was only cash that was lodged with us—we answer their checks—you will understand if you please that I give you the general character of our transactions with the house, that being the prominent feature, but we have had other transactions; we have lent them money occasionally, and we have occasionally discounted bills for them, but the chief feature has been depositing money with us, perhaps occasionally discounting bills for them—we have very rarely indeed discounted foreign bills for them, that has not been a feature of our account together—we have sometimes discounted foreign bills, very likely as high as 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that is not of any import<lb/>ance in our commercial transactions—I should doubt very much whether we have taken so large an amount with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you do not know Anderson; can you venture to say that on many occasions you have not discounted bills for them upon which Anderson's name was on the back, as endorser? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware of a single transaction of that kind—I should think it extremely extraordinary if such a thing had taken place—I should say certainly not—the bills we have discounted for them have had their own endorsement—they have been the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270041"/>
               <p>last endorsers; it would be a most unnatural thing if it were not so—I should say we have not discounted a bill for them where Anderson's name has appeared as the previous endorser—I certainly can say that I did not know that Anderson was mixed up in very large mercantile transactions with them, for I never heard of the man's name before I saw these bills, and that is very easily proved—will you allow me to explain? when Mr. Freese brought me this bill, which was the cause of the discovery of the forgery, I would not take it because of its amount without Mr. Freese's assurance—I asked him who this Mr. Anderson was—he assured me, three times over, that Mr. Anderson was a person of the highest respectability, and had been well introduced to him, and upon that I consented to discount the bill; otherwise I am not aware that I ever heard of Mr. Anderson's name before—I have not since this affair occurred looked through the account to see the extent to which we have discounted for Van Notten's—I should doubt very much whether we have a single bill running on discount—I may just say, in answer to your inquiry (and mercantile persons will easily understand what I say), that the transactions of our house are so exceedingly numerous and large, that it would be perfectly impossible for us to look to the previous endorser—if a house of Van Notten's respectability and credit bring us bills I should pass them without looking at the endorsement at all, therefore I tell you candidly. I have not looked at any endorsement preceding Van Notten's—I should not look at the prior endorsement because I should take it on the respectability of Van Notten's—we have discounted Van Notten's acceptances on foreign bills—we have discounted two or three of their acceptances; that has been a very remote and very occasional thing indeed—that has been direct from them—we have also discounted some of their acceptances through bill brokers, foreign bills—I believe there is no Van Notten actually in the business—Mr. Charles Van Notten Pole is the senior partner—he transacts business with us, and his brother also—I am not acquainted with Mr. Hill—I have seen Mr. Lambert Pole to-day—I have not seen Mr. Charles Pole almost since this has taken place—I have not seen him here to-day—I cannot tell you who used to draw the checks—I should presume either of the brothers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever look at the endorsement when you discounted the acceptance of Van Notten and Co, or did you simply act upon their acceptance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Simply upon their acceptance, and I shall be very happy to do so again—I mean to say we should take the bills simply upon the credit of the acceptor.</p>

Overend and Gurney's to get discounted about half an hour after the prisoner brought it to me—I there saw Mr. Chapman—some communication took place between myself and Mr. Chapman, upon which I left the bill with him, and went back to my office—I afterwards saw the prisoner; I asked him what the bills were for—he said that Dupont, of Paris, sent him orders to buy tartaric acid, iodine, and other things, and remitted him those bills in payment—I was then coiner back to Messrs. Overend and</p>

               <p>Gurney's, to tell Mr. Chapman, when Mr. Chapman, Jun., and Mr. Pelly came into my office—they told me something—Forrester came in immediately afterwards, and I then went with Forrester into my inner office, and said to the prisoner, "I am very sorry, Mr. Anderson, to be obliged to give you in charge for forgery"—he said, "What! I do not understand what you mean; I will soon satisfy you that that is not the case if you will go on with me to Messrs. Van Notten and Co."—I said it was useless doing so, as they had seen the signature, and denied its being their acceptance—Mr. Freese came in afterwards, and the prisoner, Mr. Freese, and Forrester went away—the 2,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was given to Forrester—it was never discounted I have seen the prisoner write—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the three bills</hi>) I should say the endorsements "W.

I have known the prisoner previous to the month of Deo.—I knew him as a merchant, carrying on business in Billiter-street, and also as principal manager to Mr. Major, the Custom-house agent—the acceptance to this bill of exchange for 2,480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is not in my writing, or that of my partner—it was written without my authority—I never gave any authority whatever for my name to be used; I never gave the prisoner any authority to use my name—I have looked at this part of the acceptance, "Accepted for 2,480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payable, when due, at Messrs. Martin and Co."—there is a clerk in our firm of the name of Hill; he is one of the principal clerks—it would be his duty to write so much of an acceptance that we are going to accept—that portion to which my attention has been called some<lb/>what resembles his handwriting; portions of the signature, "P. and C. Van Notten and Co.," resemble my handwriting—the signature to the acceptance of this bill for 3,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not mine; it is not the handwriting of my partner—it was not written by my authority—portions of it resemble my writing—the prior part of the acceptance resembles the handwriting of Hill—the acceptance to this bill for 2,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not my handwriting, or my partner's—it was not written by my authority—portions of it resemble my hand<lb/>writing, and the preceding part resembles the handwriting of our clerk, Mr. Hill—we bank with Messrs. Martin and Co.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that 2,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill; who showed you that for the first time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe that I saw it first at my office; to the best of my belief, it was Mr. Chapman who showed it to me—upon first looking at that bill, I did not say it was all right; I said nothing to that effect—Mr. Chapman did not show me any other bills at the same time—the 2,480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill I think I saw at the Mansion House—it was Mr. Chapman, jun., who showed me the 2,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I did not say to him, when I first saw it, that it was all right, nor any words to that effect—Mr. Chapman, jun., was with me about five minutes, it may be, I cannot say exactly—nobody besides him was present at the first moment; Mr. Hill came in—I have not examined these bills over and over again; I have not looked at them—I saw them before the Grand Jury—I can hardly say in whose custody they were then—they were put into my hands in the Grand Jury room, who by I cannot say—I do not know that I have ever been asked before to-day about portions resembling my handwriting, not to my recollection—a conversation has passed with my clerk on the subject of the words previous to the signature resembling his writing—I have conversed with Hill upon the subject—that was a day, or two, or three, after the meeting at the Mansion House; it might be before or after Mr. Anderson was committed, I cannot say very positively—my brother Charles is here—I can hardly say how many years I have known Mr. Anderson, eight or ten years, possibly; I cannot speak with certainty—I have done business with him quite as many years, as clerk to Mr. Major; first of all as clerk to Mr. Major, and then we had transactions on our and his account, independent of Mr. Major—I really do not know what his age was when I first knew him—of course, ten years ago he was ten years younger looking—I cannot answer the question whether he appeared quite a young man when I first knew him—I cannot form any opinion what his age was—Mr. Major is a Custom-house agent—Mr. Major used to act for us through his clerk, Mr. Anderson, as our Custom-house agent—the transactions of our house with Anderson on his own account commenced in 1850—they have been large; certainly not some hundreds of thousands of pounds—I have got our books</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270044"/>
               <p>here—I should say, in round numbers, it was rather above 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it may be between 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 150,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not so high as 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in one transaction that we had we shared profits with him—that was among the earliest—that was a transaction of dried fruit—we bought and sold, and gave him half the profits; that was in the autumn of 1852—my brother Charles was not the principal partner carrying on these transactions with Anderson—we have two branches of business; they are in adjoining houses, Nos. 2 and 3, Lime-street-square—it was with No. 3 that Anderson had his transactions—our house carries on various kinds of business—we are general merchants, trading in commodities coming from all parts of the world, and drawn upon—Anderson got us a last number of consignments—bills have been drawn without our having any advice through Anderson—being his own goods, he had the direction of the sale; as a matter of courtesy to him, we gave him the power to advise as to the sale—when goods were shipped to our house upon consignments to his account, and they arrived, we spoke to Mr. Anderson as to the price to be taken for the goods on arrival—the bills would be drawn upon our house—bills were not frequently drawn without our knowing anything of the consignments—in most cases, where there were consignments, advices of drafts accompanied every consignment—there were not many cases where it was not so; there might be a case or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not he over and over again arrange the whole transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Under our control; we had a commission of sale upon them—the brokers effected the sale, employed by us, through the instrumentality of Anderson—I am not aware that he always named the brokers—they were our brokers as much as his—one of his brokers was a Mr. Leask—a vast number of these transactions were carried on through his broker, Mr. Leask—Mr. Richard Witherby was another of his brokers—Mr. Witherby was one of our brokers—he was his broker as well as ours—he was introduced to the house by Anderson before he commenced his transactions with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a good deal of bill of exchange business between you and Anderson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not understand the question; we negotiated his bills on Change for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When consignments were drawn upon, or foreign bills were drawn, used they to pass into your hands, or continue in his? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They came into our hands for acceptance—we did not occasionally send him to Hamburgh to draw bills—I do not recollect sending him to Antwerp purposely to draw bills—when he went over to Antwerp he had repeatedly to draw on the house against documents of goods that he was shipping for his own account—the last transaction was in March, 1853—he had been over to Antwerp before, and had drawn upon us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you never looked for the goods; he himself came and attended to that, did he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As our Custom-house agent, he would enter the goods—Mr. Major was our Custom-house agent; and he being Mr. Major's principal clerk, the business naturally passed into his hands—we had a banking commission—our acceptances were in the shape of advances—I do not know who discounted those bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who used to accept them; your brother or you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Whoever hap<lb/>pened to be in the way—a banking commission is a per-centage upon the amount drawn, a per-centage according to arrangement; sometimes half per cent., sometimes one per cent.; not more—in most cases the bills were to run three months—the half or one per cent, was the commission—we did not charge him a further commission—that was the commission.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean to say there was no ether commission? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> These bills that you used to accept were not his; he was not the drawer of them, was he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they were drawn by foreign houses—it was a very rare thing for him to be the drawer—he had dealings with these foreign houses—we have not bad one of those bills to the amount of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., certainly not—when we shared profits, they were foreign shipments, from the Continent; some from Hamburgh, some from Antwerp, and many from Rotterdam—they ran over a period between the autumn of 1852 and the middle of 1853; perhaps earlier than that—they did not run down to Nov.; I should say not later than July—I recollect the transaction of the raisins; it was a very large quantity of raisins—the last transaction of raisins belonged, I think, to a French house—that was in Nov. last year—that was 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was drawn upon, I think, on 14th Nov.—to the best of my belief, it was a foreign bill—of course, we have not got it—La Fontaine, of Paris, was the person who drew—it was accepted by me, by the house—it is among our other bills as can<lb/>celled bills, as paid bills—we have it; it is in Court—my clerk has the papers—(<hi rend="italic">after the Court had adjourned for some minutes</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">handed three bills to the witness</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are those the bills that relate to the transaction of the raisins? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mention the sum of 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., why, in the month of Nov. last year, was there not 1,860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 840<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I dare say 875<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 763<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—without knowing from whence the bills were drawn, I can hardly say what the transactions of 1,860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were—the 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the extent of that one transaction—there were very probably two others in Nov. of 1,860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but, without seeing the bills, I cannot answer anything about them—these three bills are as advances against fruit—I have no doubt I could answer as to the 1,860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I had the bills before me—I have not any recollection from my memory—as far as my memory serves me, they were bills drawn from Hamburgh, against fruit, currants, and dried fruit—I never myself saw any of the goods against which the bills were drawn—samples were occasionally sent up—the sales were made to pay our bills, our acceptances—the sales were made on the prisoner's account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you and Mr. Anderson keep accounts against each other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We had an account against him; I suppose he kept accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How used you to settle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When the bills were matured and were paid he generally provided the funds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, in point of fact, your acceptances were given for his use and accommodation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were acceptances given for goods consigned to us for account to Mr. Anderson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But he provided the money to pay them when they became due, did not he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the goods when they were sold, the imports for his account, the goods themselves, paid the bills—we had the accounts of sales sent to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And how often used you to balance accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, we have not balanced accounts—we have not balanced them yet, not finally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the plan, as I understand you, was this, that when the goods were sold, he would send in an account of the sales; was that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The account of sales would come to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They would come from the broker through him, in all probability—the course of business was to send up the account sales to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270046"/>
               <p>the house: in his case they passed through him—I am not aware whether he ticked them off with his initials—the cash concerns with him fell under our head clerk; the commercial transactions were with the two partners, my brother Charles and myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The cash concerns were what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The cash concerns passed under the immediate control of our head clerk; the general manage<lb/>ment of the transactions was with ourselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not understand what you mean by the "general management;" you told me that he had the general management of the commercial transactions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Under our control—I knew the names and the houses that used to draw upon us—I will swear that I knew the names of all the parties that shipped on his consignment account, because they are many of them our own correspondents, and most of them—there were not many that were not our correspondents; I cannot say how many there were who consigned goods to him, although they drew upon us (<hi rend="italic">looking at some bills handed in by Mr. Huddleston</hi>)—the 1,860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a Paris transaction; it was an advance against goods; dried fruit, I think—the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a Paris transaction, and the 840<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was a Paris transaction—these bills are accepted by my brother Charles; the other three that were produced just now were accepted by me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the first of your dealings, as far as you know, with Mr. Ander<lb/>son on his own account, I believe the course of business was that the invoices of the goods were sent over to him invariably, and not to your house direct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not invariably; it was not the general course of business that the invoices were sent to him, and not to our house; I think the reverse—it was the general practice for him to agree with the consignor—it was not the general practice that the invoices were sent to him instead of direct to our house; I think the general practice was to send the invoices to our house—the invoices were not sent to him in all the transactions in which Mr. Witherby and Mr. Leask were the brokers; I believe the general rule was that the invoices were sent over at the time of apprising the drafts—I cannot say that that general rule was departed from; my own impres<lb/>sion is that it was not—I do not think, when you asked me just now, whether it was not the general rule that the invoices should be sent over to him, that I said, "No, the reverse;" I think you are mistaken; I do not recollect making use of that expression—I do not think that the invoices were almost invariably either sent over to, or submitted to him, to put his initials to them—I have no doubt the invoices are here; all the papers are here—I have not stated that we were frequently called upon to accept bills before we got advices of consignments—I will swear I did not say so half an hour ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did say that you left all in Mr. Anderson's hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Subject to our control.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since you have been out, have you been talking to anybody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have had no conversation about what my evidence was; I have been to relieve nature—I spoke to my own clerk, and desired him to get all the papers and things into the Court immediately—that was Hill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you speak about what you were saying? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, very little in<lb/>deed; I said very little indeed—I might have said I should be very glad when it was over—he said nothing to me—he said nothing about the course of business—I was not talking to Hill two minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you talk to anybody else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I just spoke to Mr. Tilleard, my solicitor, just for two minutes.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270047"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What! is your solicitor here; you are not the prosecutor, are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose I may have my own friends here—I suppose I have got a solicitor here; he is here to watch the case, I have no doubt—I dare say it is for me; I must have somebody here to refer to, to get anything I want, papers and documents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said "to watch" for you; what is he watching? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I can<lb/>not tell you—I have not given him instructions of any kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Don't you pay him for coming here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe most lawyers require payment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not engaged him to come here to attend to your interest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As a matter of course, he would come here without being instructed to come—of course I engaged him to come here to attend to my interests—I am not the prosecutor in this case—I have instructed him to retain counsel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I was going on to ask you about the ordinary course of business; the goods used to come over; then as to the receiving them, and as to the sale of them, Mr. Anderson conducted all that, did he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Under our control—I cannot help putting in those words, I must do it—he was to come to us for directions—we certainly reserved to ourselves a discretion and a judgment as to the rates at which he should sell the goods—there was no necessity to exercise it—he laid before us, as the owners of the goods, his views as to the sales, and if we approved of the prices, we gave him authority to sell—when I say before us, I mean before the house—I think it was chiefly before me—I used to give my judgment as to the pur<lb/>chase and the propriety of the selling—we did not get anything for that beyond our commission upon the advances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During all the transactions up to, as you say, July, 1852, what share of the profits used you to get, running over all the period you have men<lb/>tioned, where you shared profits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Where we shared profits, we gave him one half, and we took one half—we did not get our commission besides, not for advances—he did not supply money as well as us—we were to supply the means—we were to be the persons to supply the means on all occasions in which we dealt—those means were sometimes by the acceptance of bills at three months; not sometimes at six months, certainly not—I know of no transaction where bills of exchange have been, accepted at as long as six months—the purchases during the time when we shared profits were made on our account; it was agreed that he was to have half—I say the purchases were made on our account, because the transaction was entered into by us; partly through him, and with our brokers—our own broken; we had the selection of the brokers—the amount of the transactions upon which we returned him one half the profit would have reached somewhere about 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 33,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was profitable—that closed the joint account—I have not got the joint account—our accounts are made up, and gone into the estate—he got the consignments, and the purchases in a great measure were through his instrumentality, from the foreign houses—we are general merchants—all the correspondence with the foreign houses did not pass with the prisoner; I should say a great portion of it did—it was not a very rare thing for any of the foreign houses with whom he negotiated for the con<lb/>signment of goods to write to us; they used to write to us, advising the drafts—we have not yet attempted to prove our accounts at the Bankruptcy Court; they are in the hands of the official assignee—in those transactions in which we were to supply means, I did not represent to the prisoner that we were able to supply to a large amount; certainly not—the prisoner did not supply the money to pay the bills; we paid all the bills; the goods</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270048"/>
               <p>themselves supplied the money—we advanced money on goods lying in the docks, not upon the invoices—we took a valuation of the goods—we judged of the value of the goods ourselves, and, to a certain extent, from his repre<lb/>sentations of what they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You never advanced cash, did you? you never advanced him a half, penny in solid cash? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes! a great many thousands of pounds—our transactions were not always through acceptances—we did not give accept<lb/>ances over and over again—sometimes the goods were not sold, we paid the acceptances, and he repaid us, he took the goods—we sometimes charged one commission, and sometimes another—we used not to charge as much as six per cent. when we advanced on goods, and gave acceptances—we have charged six per cent, per annum, and commission also—I cannot say whe<lb/>ther we have sometimes received as much as 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission at a time; I should think not, I cannot answer the question without reference to books.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who keeps the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Hill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The prisoner always furnished the money to take up the acceptances, did he not, although you supplied it in the first instance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We supplied it in the first instance—he very rarely supplied it before the acceptance became due—my clerk, Mr. Hill, generally settled with him about what he was to pay—he will be able to tell you all—we first paid him either money, or if they belonged to his foreign correspondents, they drew upon us at three months date, sometimes at thirty days date.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect having a dispute with him a long time ago, when your brother and he were together, about some accommodation bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We never had an accommodation bill—there is a firm of the name of Dewhurst and Co., of Manchester—they are very highly respectable—they are to a certain extent our correspondents—they are still our correspondents—I do recollect that there was some conversation about a Bill of Exchange of theirs—I think it was between Mr. Anderson, my brother, and myself—I have no recollection of coming into the room whilst he was talking to my bro<lb/>ther about it; whether I was there first or last I do not know—I cannot say whether it was in May, 1853; it was some time in last year—the con<lb/>versation bore reference to a bill drawn upon us which we did not believe was in the market—he asserted that it was in the market; it was a bill drawn by Dewhurst upon us at six months—that did not lead at all to a question about our credit, or about its being a bill that ought not to be in the market, because it was of so long a date—I really think my brother may have been the first person he spoke to about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say there was something said about a bill drawn upon you at six months, being in the market? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I do not know whether it was in the market or not—I had accepted such a bill—the transactions with the prisoner, with reference to which there was a partici<lb/>pation of profit, were upon one description of article.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> One description of article, but a great many separate trans<lb/>actions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so; those transactions originated with both myself and my brother.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be kind enough to tell us very shortly, what took place with reference to that occurrence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the autumn of 1852, the blight had attacked the dried fruit in the Ionian Islands; Mr. Anderson came to us, and said, "Gentlemen, there is a large business doing in fruit, the market is going up, there is a good deal to be got by it, and there are a great many persons going into the article, and I should recommend your</p>

               <p>turning your attention to the article"—we refused, it being Hot our busi<lb/>ness to speculate generally—we declined it for a long time, but he being very urgent in his recommendation, stating that he had been under great obligation to the house, and that he would wish to have an opportunity of returning it; and as in this instance he could give a good deal of informa<lb/>tion upon the subject, we were induced to make some purchases in the fruit, he being a man thoroughly conversant with the article; and knowing he had a good deal of knowledge of the article, we availed ourselves of the benefit of his knowledge—he had one half the profits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was not a separate transaction, it was several transactions in the same article? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; amounting altogether to from 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 33,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., split up into many more than five or six transactions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When were they concluded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Those transac<lb/>tions concluded, I think, as far as my memory serves me, somewhere about June or July, perhaps, last year—to my knowledge no bills have been accepted in respect of consignments until we have had the warrants, or the bills of lading, in our possession; I speak for myself only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the course of practice, after you had received the bills of lading and the warrants, and given your acceptances, as to giving up the bills of lading or the warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the case of the bills of lading, when there were goods consigned to our house, the bills of lading, as a matter of course, were given to Anderson as the clerk of Major, who was our Custom-house agent, to do that which was necessary with regard to the entering of the goods; in the case of the warrants, when the loan on the warrants was repaid, the warrants of course were handed up—the course of business, when the goods were sold, was for the broker to sell the goods, and when the prompt fell due the money to be received—sometimes the goods were sold and paid for before the maturity of the bills, sometimes afterwards—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) I received this letter from the prisoner in reference to the three, bills which have been referred to for 861<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 875<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">letter read:</hi> "London, 21, Billiter-square; 17th Nov., 1853. Gentlemen,—Herewith, I beg to hand you warrants for 300 barrels of raisins, ex <hi rend="italic">Louisa Henriette</hi>, and 102 barrels ditto, ex <hi rend="italic">Haddington</hi>, making together 402; against which, with your permission, the following drafts have been made upon yourself, say at three months' date, 14th Nov.: 763<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 861<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 875<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making together 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In consideration of your accepting the same, I engage to cover you in the amount thereof before maturity; failing which, you are authorised by the present to effect sales in order to reimburse yourselves. The commission to be charged upon this transaction is 1 per cent, unless a sale is made; and, in that case, the rate to be 2 per cent. I am, gentlemen, your obedient servant, W. B. Anderson.—P. S. It is expressly understood that the goods to which the present refers, are to be withdrawn on or before 19th Jan., 1854; failing which, you are fully empowered to effect sales to cover your acceptances.

HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that letter, dated 13th Dec., and tell me if you received that letter also from the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I received that letter—it is Mr. Anderson's handwriting (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Messrs. P. and C. Van Notten and Co., London, 21, Billiter-square; 13th Dec., 1853.

I am, gentlemen, your obedient servant, W. B Anderson.") I think, from Antwerp and from Amiens, Mr. Anderson drew upon us altogether about five times—the state of the money market at the time quite justified the charge of 6 per cent.—since the prisoner's committal, I have had a conversation with Mr. Hill, my clerk—I have heard of a conversation that took place between him and Mr. Anderson.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you the senior partner in the house of Van Notten and Co.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am—we have had numerous trans<lb/>actions with Mr. Anderson; they were not generally arranged with me; sometimes with me and sometimes with my brother—we have two houses of business—our dealings were in merchandize generally, all sorts of articles which could be profitable—very often making advances on goods, and accept<lb/>ing bills—I had confidence to a certain extent in Mr. Anderson—I cannot say I had great confidence, excepting in his honesty, I believed him to be honest—I should think our earliest transactions with him were about 1850—that was not in a joint speculation in goods—it was a loan upon a security, upon a guarantee of a third party—I think the amount of the loan was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say that that was with a view of his starting in business for himself; it was to assist him in his business, Mr. Major was the Custom-house agent with whom he was—after that, we from time to time entered into transactions with him with reference to foreign consign<lb/>ments for his account to a considerable amount, our profit was a commission thereon; an advance for a certain time, and bills drawn from the continent against those consignments—I should think the advance was never for so short a time as a couple of days, or three days, I should think more than that—we take our commission just the same, if the advance is only for a day or two—I should say it was generally Mr. Hill that managed that, now and then myself quite as much as Mr. Hill—I imagine Mr. Anderson generally knew the consignors—if it was represented to me that he knew the consignors, then we engaged in the transaction, if we liked it, if it was considered prudent—we had our commission upon the transactions—we did not always find that we made a good thing of it, quite the reverse—we were tired of the thing altogether, as far as the commission went, it was really no very great thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then being tired of the commission you went upon the division of profit system, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; except in one single instance—that was arranged with me, and I think with my brother, and Mr. Hill was also present I think, but I am not quite sure—that was in currants—I cannot say that it has turned out either profitable or unprofitable, for the accounts are not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270051"/>
               <p>made up yet—there was apparently a kind of profit on it; but the accounts are not made up—it was in raisins or currants or dried goods, raisins come from Smyrna, currants come from Zante I suppose, it is an article I do not understand much about—we saw samples of the currants and raisins—Mr. Anderson brought them to us—we saw samples before we entered into the transaction—we most certainly did not entirely rely upon him—those currants have been sold a long while ago, and the raisins also—I had nothing to do with the transactions in Oct. and Nov. last, there were one or two consignments that we had to do with, but nothing else—I cannot say that they went down as far as the beginning of Dec, for I was not in business then, I was unwell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you begin to be unwell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Dec., but I was not in business in Dec., because my turn of duty was at an end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you give us any idea of the extent to which you have accepted or negotiated bills for Anderson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that I cannot, for I have not been in business for some time, and I cannot give you a correct idea, certainly I would not bind myself to it—I should say it was not very large; in the aggregate it might be considered large, but small in amounts—I think it very likely there may have been as much as 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one month—very probably it might be as much as 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one month—I cannot tell you whether Anderson constantly got the advices from abroad from his own consignors—they were his consignors—I cannot say that I recollect an instance of our accepting bills before we got any advice—the consignment was left to his management, under our control—I cannot say we gave him express directions, because as the consignment wan for his account we had the power, as the parties making the advance, of selling the goods if the bills were not paid—the consignments were to us, or we should not have accepted them—I cannot recollect an instance of bills coming for acceptance and our accepting them upon his representation, that the cargo was coming, or that the consignment was made—it was his consignor who sent over the currants and raisins—they were consigned to him—we never had any advice direct from the house—we did not accept upon his representation, but on the security of the bills of lading.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will see about that, and be very careful how you answer; upon your oath, on many occasions before you ever saw a bill of lading, did not you accept the bill that was drawn by the foreign house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say I ever did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But will you swear you did not, over and over again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Let me understand your question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will repeat it again; on many occasions, did not you, before seeing any bill of lading at all, accept bills that had been drawn by foreign houses on the representations made by Anderson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think we may have done so—he would not then bring us the bill of lading, and take up the bill we had accepted—he gave us security, to enable us to accept the amount of the parties consigning, to be taken up by the bill of lading when it arrived—I will name the kind of security he gave, warrant; that was invariably the case—we never accepted without the security of warrants if the bills of lading were not in our possession—I cannot say that I remember an instance with reference to the currants and raisins, of accepting the bills before the bills of lading came—I would say we may have done it in 1852, possibly—I think we did do it then—it did not go on—during the currant and raisin transactions we did not go on over and over again, accepting bills of exchange before any bills of lading appeared—I will swear it did not—I cannot</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270052"/>
               <p>recollect an instance—whenever we accepted, the plan was that he was to supply the money to meet the bills if the goods were not sold; if they were sold, then the goods met the bills if there was enough to meet them; if there was not enough, he was to pay the amount—I think in one instance in 1852 he brought bills to me which had been sent over by a foreign house, and they opened a credit in his favour—I think the bills of lading did not invariably pass through his hands in every case—I think there were some cases in the current transactions in which they were delivered by a third party to us for his account—in the course of last year he did not render us a very essential service with regard to some bills of Dewhurst and Co.—he mentioned that bills were in the market which we did not expect to be in the market, but I could never trace the circumstance as a fact; I strove to trace it—I think that may have been in May—it was said to be a bill at six months' date—it is the usual East India custom to draw bills at as long a date as that—it was their habit—Dewhurst and Co. of Manchester are manufacturers—we were not sending goods to the East Indies; it was for an East Indian account, one of our correspondents—they were in the habit of drawing bills at that long date—it is a very usual practice that such bills should be circulated in the market—the prisoner stated to me that one was in the market—I was annoyed at hearing it, because it was contrary to the information that we received that it should not be put upon the market—that was the arrangement with Dewhurst himself—we objected to a bill of this long date being put upon the market, because it is the practice of our house not to have long dated bills—I may have said to the prisoner on that occasion, "I have been deceived if that is the case most shamefully"—I cannot say that our conversation on that occasion was particularly long—I expressed my obligation to him, because he had mentioned the circumstance which brought to light that which I should not have known otherwise—I had no conversation with him on that occasion about his other transactions with us, not at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say to him that you had always confided in him, and that he had always acted with fairness towards you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Upon my word, I cannot say that I ever said anything of the kind, but I may have said so; I will not say that I did not—I certainly did not say that he had never deceived me, and that he might rely upon my confirming all his transactions—I did not say anything at ail to that effect—I said he had not deceived me—I said nothing about confiding in him to a very great extent, certainly not—I am perfectly clear that I said nothing of the kind—I trusted to him—I cannot swear that I used any such expression as that I would confirm his transactions—I certainly did not say that many of the transactions he had made abroad I had confirmed, nor that I had taken upon myself to confirm his transactions—I could not have said that I had taken upon myself to confirm his transactions, and had always found them right, because it was only some few transactions that I ever did confirm—those few had run over 1852, I should think, or 1853—the confirmation was not that bills had been drawn before the bills of lading had come, it was on the receipt of the bills of lading—our letters of confirmation were, "On receipt of the documents, such and such bills would be accepted"—we sent letters of confirmation in that way, for specified consignments—upon the occasion you refer to I do not think I stated that I had confirmed everything that I had been required to confirm—I am sure I did not—I stated that I had confided in him—on the occasions when this confirmation has taken place he has come to me prior, and spoken about it, and then I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270053"/>
               <p>confirmed it, after the usual and proper consideration of it, acting for ourselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was it you confirmed? I do not understand. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mercantilely speaking, confirming is stating that a credit is open: for that extent, acceptable on receipt of the shipping documents for which the bills are drawn—that is what we term confirming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that to the amount of several thousand pounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think so, taking the whole together—on my oath I cannot say to what extent, but I think about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should certainly say it was not 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, not on those letters of confirmation; but I cannot pledge myself—I am not quite clear whether he communicated to me that there was this advantageous speculation in currants, or whether my brother was present at the time—it was with me, as the senior partner, that the matter was first discussed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He came to you as a gentleman who had been very friendly and kind to him, did he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not think it was that—I cannot say that he ever said anything about my having been very kind to him in advances, and all that—I certainly took the information be gave me about the bill being in circulation as an instance of friendship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And also the recommendation of the currants and raisins, believing that he was a man of judgment and skill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I did—in Oct last I recollect meeting him at the Bedford Hotel, and having some dispute with him—the conversation did not end with my saying, "Well, Anderson, I am quite satisfied with you"—I said this, "The explanation that you have come down to give me of the non-payment of a certain sum of money that we had understood was due to us, certainly has satisfied me that there was a mistake"—I had certainly been rather angry at first; that was respecting a consignment of currants—I did not, on that occasion, say, "Well, I will confirm your operations," or words to that effect—the dispute was, that the bills were drawn, and prior to the falling due of the bills we asked the question; in fact, it was an agreed undertaking on our part that we would not accept the consignment if the advance was to be prior to the realizing of the produce for which the bills were drawn, and before the bills came due we sent to inquire what time the prompt fell due, and the time was specified on the 22nd—the 22nd, if I remember right, was on a Saturday—the money was not forthcoming, and we sent the broker to know why the prompt was not paid, why he had not sent the check in—the currants were sold, and the prompt was not paid—it appeared, from the statement of the broker, that the prompt was not due till the following Saturday, 29th, which, as I was anxious to get out of town, I felt extremely hurt about, and I went out of town with that feeling—at the interview, when Anderson explained the matter, I did not say, "Well, Anderson, I am satisfied with you, and I will confirm your transactions"—I said nothing of the kind—what I said was this, "You have explained away what I felt was extremely detrimental to you, or rather injurious to the impression I had of your regularity"—his explanation was a long one, in which he stated that it was entirely his mis<lb/>take; that he had made the mistake, the prompt foiling on a Sunday—he thought the prompt falling on a Sunday ought to have been paid on the Saturday prior, whereas it was not due till the following Saturday—that was in Oct.—I think there was one other consignment of currants after that, or there may have been one or two or three, but that I really cannot pledge myself to say—I did not accept the bills for those, that I am aware of.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that a mere friendly loan, or did you receive any interest for the advance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a matter of business, the interest thereon, and com<lb/>mission on the advance—the commission might have been a half per cent, or a quarter, and I believe 5 per cent, for interest; I cannot say exactly—I do not think I had any transaction with Anderson afterwards—I was very unwell on the day he was taken into custody—my brother was at the office that day—I do not know that my brother was not so kind to Anderson as myself; I cannot say that that was the case—I do not think I was par<lb/>ticularly kind—I cannot say that Anderson frequently came to the office and saw me while I was transacting business—he came when there was any business which he thought we were likely to undertake for him, but that was not very often.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you allow me to ask you, without offence, whether since Ander<lb/>son has been taken up, you have drawn a good many checks, which you have afterwards torn up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—there is certainly no reason for saying that I have drawn checks and torn them up—I should be very sorry to hear that my checks had been stopped at the bankers'—I am sure they have not—I am hot aware that they have—I have not been to business since Anderson has been taken up; I was under the necessity of leaving altogether two days afterwards, from illness, and confined to my bedroom—Hill, my clerk, knows where I was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and carry on business in Castle-court, and No. 20, Lawrence-lane. The prisoner was from seven to eight years in my service as porter—the latter part of his time his salary has been 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and his tea; that was about the last two years—before that time it was rather less—on account of something I heard, I was induced to watch his movements—on 24th Feb. I came home about 2 o'clock in the afternoon; I saw the prisoner with a bag in his hand, coming out of the back warehouse into the passage, which connects it with the front ware-house—I turned my back for scarcely a minute to cross the court to our opposite warehouse, and on my return the prisoner was gone, and the bag was gone—I followed the prisoner down Aldermanbury, where I was informed he had probably gone—I met him; and I proceeded to Mr. Abel's, a marine store dealer, in Aldermanbury, where I found the bag with some lengths of rope in it, some travellers' patterns, and some canvass—I am able to identify the bag as the one I had seen before, from the peculiar make of it—I identify it as my property—I identify the travellers' patterns; they have a private mark on them; I could not identify the rope—this is the bag; it is differently sewn at the bottom to what it is at the side—these are the travellers patterns; they have different numbers corresponding with what we have at home—this one has a private mark, as the price on it—the others have different numbers—there was in the bag this length of wrapper—here is no mark on it—I called in Malyon, the officer, and gave him charge of the bag and its contents—I returned with the officer, and met the pri<lb/>soner—I gave him in charge, and proceeded to the police station in Bow-lane—when I was giving the charge, I said to the prisoner, "You know I saw you, with the bag and its contents in your hand"—he said, "I know you did"—the bag was then open before him, and the wrapper and the patterns were out-—he gave his address at No. 1, Regency-place, Mansion House-street, Kennington—I went with Malyon and Storey, another officer, to that direction, and the officers, in my presence, searched the house—we found there property which I identified to be mine—I found sixteen yards of printed cotton; part of it was made up into a dress, part was in a drawer, and part of it was at a pawnbroker's—I think in the whole there was more than sixteen yards—it was a piece of Hoyle's five-quarter print—he is a clebrated printer, in Manchester—I have every reason to believe it is my property, but there is no mark on it—I had the same article in stock—it is rather common—here is another piece of printed cotton, which is a more particular pattern—this was delivered to me either the last day of Dec, 1853, or the 1st of Jan., 1854—this other one was delivered in the former part of 1853—these twelve yards of sheeting were found locked in a box on the prisoner's premises—it is a make of sheeting we have had by us, which is rather peculiar in the finish and make—we had got the same thing in stock—it is not made up into sheets—we found two yards of damask, I believe, in the same box—I believe it to be a portion of our stock—we had the same pattern and the same manufacture—it is not made up into any<lb/>thing—I did not get the key of the box—the policeman broke it open—I found six yards of silk; I cannot identify it precisely, but it is precisely the same as we had—we found this in the front room—we found ten yards of alpaca; it is of a particular pattern, which we had in the spring of 1853—I can identify it by our having the same goods—the pattern and colour are</p>

               <p>rather unusual—I believe we found this in the box—we found two blan<lb/>kets—this one has a very remarkable stripe—the ordinary stripe is about one nail wide, and this is about two nails wide, and we are deficient in this particular class of blankets—these blankets were in the back room, the same room the box was in—they were laid on the bed, but were not in use—I found two counterpanes, which I cannot identify; we have the same goods—we found two shirts, which have no mark; I can only say we sell the same goods; they have not been used; they were in the same box—here are two nightcaps; I cannot identify them, but we sell them—here are six cambric handkerchiefs; these I know particularly by the pattern; we had the very same pattern; it is a particular sort of pattern—we found these in the box—five of them have never been used; one has been used, and cut—here are two other handkerchiefs; the colouring of them is rather remark<lb/>able; we had them in stock; we sold part of a piece to a customer—they kept the one that was washed, and brought the other two back, because they would not wash—we had two just the same as these; they are a very peculiar colour, and we missed these from stock—here are four pairs of stockings, and four pairs of socks, which I cannot identify—many of these articles I can swear I have not had two years, where there is a pattern to them—the plain goods I cannot tell how long, I may have had them as long as seven years—I saw Mr. Abel when I went there, and saw the bag and its contents.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee shop, in Chiswell-street. On the last Thursday in Jan., the prisoner was there from 7 till about 10 o'clock at night; I did not see him go out of the shop, he was there when I began to shut up the shutters, and when I had closed them I did not see him there—I went to bed about 11 o'clock, I heard a noise in the course of the night, got up and listened, but thinking it was some of my lodgers I went to bed again—I was afterwards aroused by a policeman ringing the bell; I found the front door open, and one of my lodgers standing near it; I did not miss anything till the morning, when I missed about 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper; a packet containing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two half francs which had been in the cash box—I missed about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I found this pair of pliers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and gave them to the police.</p>

Fenwick and Kean's back kitchen; he said we need not search him, he threw open his coat, and pulled out this bag, and these four skeleton keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); they are of a make which is very seldom seen—another constable picked up these other keys, and this rope of handkerchief, in the direction in which the prisoner ran (<hi rend="italic">three or four handkerchiefs tied together</hi>)—I examined the fanlight; there was an aperture large enough to admit two men; three feet by twelve feet had been cut away, by cutting the putty with a chisel—the whole pane was cut out except one corner—when the prisoner threw down the bag, he said, "That bag has had more property in it than you or your masters are worth."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Bramwell, and live at the St. Pancras saw-mills.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Walter Jackson; he keeps the St. Pancras-road post-office, near King's-cross; I attend to the duties of the post; my husband is absent in his business during the day. On 30th Jan. the prisoner had been in my service between six and seven months, as near as I can recollect—I had occasion to give her notice to leave; I had given her warning on several occasions, for neglect, I think about three weeks before 30th Jan.—she was to leave on Monday, 30th Jan.—I saw Mrs. Bramwell at my shop that day, before the prisoner left—she came, I think, for two postage stamps, and she asked me to give her a wafer at the same time—I did so; I did not take particular notice what she did with it; I was engaged in other business, serving other persons in the shop—we keep a stationer's shop—I think she had a letter with her—I did not observe what she did with it after I gave her the wafer; she left the shop—from that time until 8 o'clock I only left the shop to go into the parlour—I went down into the kitchen once during that time—the prisoner had access to the shop while I was in the parlour—she went into the shop to serve postage stamps several times between 2 and 8 o'clock—I was not aware that she was gone when she left—she had not said she was going at that time—I had occasion for her services, and rang the bell, and she was not in the house, she did not answer—that was, I think, about 8 o'clock, or a quarter after—she was to have gone that evening, but she did not say, "Good night," or anything, before she went—I knew that she had a cousin or a relation living at No. 11, Little Camden-street, and, finding she was gone, I went there—I saw a young person, answering to the name of Mary Ann Busnell—I asked her for Mary Ann Clark, and asked to see the bundle she had brought—she showed me a bundle; it was the prisoner's—I opened it in Busnell's presence, and found in it this letter—I thought at the time it was three letters—there are three pieces of paper, and two envelopes—it is addressed to Mrs. Joseph</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270071"/>
               <p>Swannell, and the envelope inclosed is addressed to Mrs. Bramwell, at the saw-mills—the letter had been opened, and it was all crashed—the papers were all separate, and crumpled—I also found in the bundle a pair of stockings belonging to me, but they were of no use—I took the letter home to my husband—I did not leave any message with Busnell for the prisoner—I made some observation in her presence—I got home between 9 and 10 o'clock, and gave the letter and papers to my husband—next day, at near 1 o'clock, the prisoner came to our house—I told her she had been a very bed girl to take letters out of the box; that my character was at stake by her doing such an action—she said she had not done so—I told her that there were some letters in her bundle, and something else belonging to me—a letter posted at our office at 2 o'clock, on 30th Jan., would be forwarded to the chief office at a quarter to 4 o'clock—I made up and despatched the letters for that delivery—a letter put into our letter-box for that delivery would be taken out and stamped, and would bear the stamp of our office—this envelope does not bear our stamp—if it was put in at 2 o'clock, it must have been taken between 2 and 4 o'clock—the prisoner had occasion to go into the shop several times between 2 and 4 o'clock—if this letter had passed through my hands it would have borne the stamp—the prisoner had no authority to interfere with the letters at all.</p>

Q.</hi> Where is the letter box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Under the window board, at the right hand side; it is locked up, until I take out the letters and stamp them—it was not locked on the day in question; I had omitted to do so—I think I could not omit to stamp a letter; I can be on my oath that I did not—I think I can say positively—perhaps I omitted to lock the box, having to leave off to serve a customer or something; I have so many duties—I mean as to serving customers—I generally lock the box directly I take the letters out—there had been a stamping for delivery at half past 1 o'clock—the box was locked in the morning—my husband is a law clerk, and is not at home in the day—I manage the Post-office—I happened to leave the box unlocked on this occasion—I saw the prisoner's bundle done up in the kitchen, half an hour before she went away, or before I missed her; I had seen her a very short time before—I cannot say where she was at the time I saw her bundle in the kitchen—she was not in the kitchen—I did not look in the bundle—there was no stated time at which she was to go—when she had done certain duties she was to go, which she did not do; it was to take up some ashes that she had taken down into the back kitchen, instead of taking them into the yard, and to lay the cloth for our suppers, and to fetch the beer for supper—she was not to have gone a few days before—she was to have gone about three weeks back, but she promised me to be a good girl, and I kept her on that condition—she had neglected her duties—I cannot say her age—when she came next day at 1 o'clock, she said she had come to know what I wanted with her—I cannot say how long I was with Mary Ann Busnell, while I was looking over the bundle—I am not aware that she is rather a weak-minded girl—I never exchanged a word with her before—I have not had any communication with Mrs. Cant, the prisoner's cousin, not till this morning—the prisoner remained about ten minutes; when she came to know what I wanted, and Mr. Jackson took her on to the General Post-office in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he had been to the Post-office, and came back with the Post-office authorities concerning this, and then he went to Camden-town, and while he was gone, the prisoner came—he returned while she was there, and took her in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Post-office—she merely</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270072"/>
               <p>said that she had not taken it; I did not hear her say that somebody must have put it into her bundle; I cannot exactly swear that she did not say so, but I do not recollect it at all; I cannot say more—she said she did not put it there—the letter was open when I found it, all crushed up together inside a dress—I remember Mrs. Bramwell saying something to me before the Magistrate, about a letter that had been lost in June last; I said it was wrongly directed, and that I supposed was the reason it had not reached.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that it would be unjust, if the witness was only required to read the defendant's evidence, as what had passed before he was examined, should also be read.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated, that he would put in evidence any part of the days proceedings which the Court thought just, but at present would confine himself to the Defend<lb/>ant's evidence.) The witness then read the evidence, as follows:</hi> "Mr. Jere<lb/>miah Smith having been sworn, was examined by Mr. Merewether, as follows: I believe you live either in Rye or its neighbourhood? In the parish of Rye—I believe you interest yourself in elections at Rye? Cer<lb/>tainly.—Possibly you may have shared in the general regret at Mr. Cur<lb/>teis's resignation? I did at the time.—That regret was mitigated possibly at finding you were to have an admirable substitute, Mr. Mackinnon? Exactly.—I must venture to ask you, was there a period before you were quite off with the old love at Rye and on with the new? I beg your pardon.—Was there a period when you were hardly off with the old love and quite on with the new? Yes, there was.—Before Mr. Curteis had quite retired, and before Mr. Mackinnon was quite a candidate? Yes, there was some time between.—Let me bring your recollection to the 2nd of July; were you present at a dinner? Yes.—Given by Mr. Curteis; it was very kind of Mr. Curteis giving a dinner? Very.—You attended? I did.—Possibly you may have heard of it before it took place? I did.—Were you surprised to see Mr. Mackinnon present at it? Not at all—A dinner does not get into a booth of itself; may I venture to ask you if you know who ordered the dinner? I did.—Mr. Lancaster has told us that he helped eat it, and Mr. Davie also, and others; so that we have now the orderer of the dinner and the eaters, and then there is the important part, the reckoning; do you happen to know who paid for it? I did.—Was it supplied by one person? By one; I made my contract with one person.—Your principal contract was with one; do you happen to know whether there were sub-Contractors? I am satisfied he called in three others to his assistance; he stated at the time he should not be able to supply it, he thought, wholly himself.—Therefore, you are pretty con<lb/>fident that he called in three sub-contractors; did they happen also to be publicans? Yes, of course.—That seems to be a phrase at Rye, "of course;" you took your bill to whom? I beg your pardon.—With reference to the ultimate payment, you ordered it for Mr. Curteis? Yes.—You took the bill to whom? To myself, and paid myself.—What did you say to yourself, if I may venture to say so, when you took the bill to yourself? I had an authority from Mr. Curteis to pay the bill—And you told yourself all about the authority, and paid it? I exercised myself upon that Authority.—In any further communication which you have had with yourself has Mr. Curteis paid the bill to you? I beg your pardon.—Has Mr. Curteis repaid you? He has not.—He has retired from the representation, we know? Yes.—And another gentleman at the close of the election reigned in his stead? Exactly so.—Mr. Curteis has not paid that bill; may I venture to ask you, as by the list handed in, you act as agent for Mr. Mackinnon, are Mr. Mackinnon's bills paid? I do not know; I had nothing to do with the paying of any of the bills.—Then, as far as you know, those things are unpaid; but you.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270077"/>
               <p>know, as a fact, that this, though paid by you, is not repaid la you? I do. <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COMMITTEE</hi>. Not repaid to you by any one? By Mr. curteis, nor anybody.—It has not been repaid to you by anybody? No, it has not been repaid. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MEREWETHER</hi>. We have been told by Mr. Davie, that Mr. curteis invitations were in Mr. Mackinnon's Committee-room? They might have been.—He says he is quite sure they were? I think they were sent there to me; I ordered them to be printed, and they were sent there to me; I had the authority from Mr. Curteis; he wrote his own note, and from that note I had it printed, and they were sent to me in a bundle in the Committee-room; at least in the room where we assembled to carry on the election.—To carry on whose election? Mr. Mackinnon's.—They were directed to parties from that room? I think they were, some of them; but the principal part were taken away to the George, and directed there under my superintendence.—And there were some that were directed from the Committee-room? I think some of the friends took some few of the notes, and directed them from there; I think they did to the best of my recollection.—Some of your friends took upon themselves to direct the notes there? To invite some of their own friends.—Then the invitations did not proceed direct from Mr. Curteis? They did; they proceeded direct from Mr. Curteis to me, and then he begged me to take the list of his friends to carry out, and some of our friends who were in the room begged to invite some of their friends to come, and I gave them permission.—Then it was a blank warrant for a dinner from Mr. Curteis, with liberty to yourself and other gentlemen to fill them up? No; Mr. Curteis gave me the full authority to give the general invite, and therefore, what I did there was done by my own act and deed.—That is in point of fact the case, is it not, that Mr. Curteis gave you authority to have the dinner, and to act according to your own act and deed with the dinner? I No; he did not; he did not say I was to do so, or not to do so, but he gave me authority to send out the invitations.—That is what I mean? Yes.—There are two views of things at Bye, I suppose, like other places? Upon what points?—Upon points of politics? Decidedly.—Were the invitations directed to both sides of politics, or did they hap<lb/>pen to take one? Quite indiscriminately; many without any votes at all—no distinction as to party at all.—Of those that accepted, which party do you think predominated? That I can scarcely answer you.—Try. I should suppose that the liberal party predominated; that is merely a sup<lb/>position—For instance, we will test the sentiments of the majority; the meat and those things were discussed, and then there was, as Mr. Lan<lb/>caster tells us, port and sherry afterwards: Did Mr. Mackinnon address the meeting? He did.—Did he indicate liberal opinions? He did—Was that indication favourably received by the majority? It was; by the whole party.—You would possibly deduce from that, that the large majority of the party agreed with Mr. Mackinnon in opinion? I have nothing else to guide me but that.—However, there was that unanimous assent to Mr. Mackinnon's views which makes you think that the attendants were chiefly liberal? Yes.—You say that these invitations were at the Red Lion; were there other gentlemen at the Bed lion, as Mr. Davie has told us, besides yourself? Yes; many.—The gentlemen who managed Mr. Mackin<lb/>non's election? Yes.—You say that some friends of yours directed some of these letters; were those persons to whom I am referring the managers of Mr. Mackinnon's election? They begged to be allowed to invite some of their friends.—Those friends probably were of the liberal view? I do not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270078"/>
               <p>know at all; I do not know to whom they sent them either.—Were you safe as to the senders' views, the gentlemen who directed them? They were our friends; they were our liberal friends; I do not think we should send them to the enemy's camp.—Then I think the probabity is, that if Mr. Mackinnon's Committee directed the letters, they were most of them sent to Mr. Mackinnon's friends? I did not think it necessary to question them; there was no mistake about that. <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COMMITTEE</hi>. Do you consider Mr. Mackinnon responsible to you in respect of that dinner? Certainly not.—Either on employment or in any other way? None; I have never received a shilling.—You have not received a shilling from anybody, I understand? I No; and I have not even seen Mr. Mackinnon's money, nor has he ever pro<lb/>mised me a farthing.—Whom do you look to, to be remunerated for that dinner? Mr. Curteis.—During the period that Mr. Curteis was the member for Rye, did you act as his agent? Yes, I did.—Did his election expenses pass though your hands? Yes, they did.—Have you been in the habit of making payments for Mr. Curteis? Yes, many years; all the time this young man has sat in the House, and his father before him.—Have you applied to Mr. Curteis for payment of the expenses of this dinner? No; Mr. Curteis and I have an open, unsettled account.—When do you expect to receive payment? Whenever it is convenient to him; I am not particular myself; it is not an object to myself—Of what nature is that open account with Mr. Curteis? is it an account for expenses, or an account for private transactions? I am a tenant; and private transactions; both; his rent is credited on the one side, and there are debits on the other.—Are you his private agent, as well as his election agent? No, I am not.—How often do you come to a settling with Mr. Curteis? Once in one, two, or three years, according to his convenience.—Are you now referring to the expenses of preceding elections? His expenses have been nothing; not the present young man; he has been returned twice, and a petition was lodged against him, which was declared as vexatious, and the expenses were thrown all upon the petitioners to pay; and I should think his whole expenses (I am speaking now from memory) were something less than. 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till he was petitioned against, as I have already stated.—Were you speaking of the young Mr. Curteis when you mentioned the open account? Yes.—Then if you are not Mr. Curteis's private agent, and Mr. Curteis has had no election expenses, of what nature is this open account? Kent and charities, and things of that sort, which he subscribes to.—That is one side, and what on the other? Rent on the one, and subscriptions of a variety of kinds on the other; rates and one thing and the other, which I pay for land which he has in the parish very many times, and many charities to which he subscribes, which I pay for him.—If you are in the habit of paying his local rates and his local charities, what do you mean by telling the Committee that you are no private agent for him? If you term that a private agent, I have an open account with him of that nature.—If an agent pays for his principal his local rates, do you consider that in the nature of an election account? Certainly not.—Do you consider it in the nature, in any degree, of a public account? No; it is a private running account between him and me, as landlord and tenant.—Then why did you tell the Committee that you had no private account with him? I have already stated I am a tenant; I give credit for the rent on the one side, and the different payments on the other: it is a private account between him and me, most assuredly, as land-lord and tenant.—For what land are these rates paid? For lands in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270079"/>
               <p>parish of Rye, principally.—Whose lands? His: in his own occupation, some.—Why do you pay them? Because it is more convenient to get it from me than it is from him.—Are you a solicitor? No; I am a former.—Then what do you mean by saying you are not an agent, if you pay all his local rates? Not all; only a very small portion.—Them if it is a very small portion, to what extent is this open account? I cannot tell at all what my account may be; I cannot speak off-hand; perhaps 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no desire to inquire into Mr. Curteis's private affairs, excepting" as they are connected with this public inquiry; but after what you have said, I must ask you how does that account now stand? He is in my debt—To what extent? It may be 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I will not say; something less than that—How much did the dinner cost? 226<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—And Mr. Curteis now only owes you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? Something less than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think it was—Then how was it that you stated that you had not been paid for the dinner? I have not been paid; only my running account: I have an open account with Mr. Curteis.—What is the amount of each of the two sides of that account at this time? I should say about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am speaking now entirely from memory.—On which side would the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. be? The 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be on the credit side, and the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be on the debit side: I am speaking now entirely from memory.—How long have you been in the habit of paying these charities and rates for Mr. Curteis? Ever since he has paid them, and for his father before him.—How long is it that Mr. Cur<lb/>teis has paid? This young gentleman?—Yes. Ever since the death of the father.—How long is that? I do not know how many years he has been dead; five or six, I should think: I really do not know when he died.—Was not Mr. Curteis returned in 1847 at the general election? Yes, he was.—The young man? No, the old gentleman; the father. I think, if I am not mistaken, that Mr. Curteis, the late member, was returned in 1848 first; I really can<lb/>not be positive.—What is the amount of these charities which you pay annually for Mr. Curteis? I really cannot tell you.—Have you no idea from memory what the amount is? They may be 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; I really cannot tell you off hand.—You think 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year? I should think 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year might be something like the amount but I really cannot say, because they vary according to his instructions.—Did you say that Mr. Mackinnon's bills had been paid 1 I do not know anything about them.—Do you know who paid them? I think Mr. Butler, but I am not sure as to that; a portion of them; I think he paid the printing, and so on; but that I cannot speak to of my own knowledge.—You have no knowledge of it? No. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MEREWETHER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">through the Committee</hi>), As a fact, was this 2nd of July after the teste of the writ? The writ arrived in Rye on the 3rd of July. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WELSBY</hi> stated that the teste of the writ was the 30th of June. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SMITH</hi>. We have always been given to understand that the teste of the writ was when the Mayor had received it and signed it, and whatever occurred we were in total ignorance but what that was the law."</p>

I have not the least objection.—There was a dinner, we understand, for which you paid a bill of 226<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? I should much rather acknowledge my error in this respect; I feel deeply as to the mistake which I made at the time: I stated here that I had paid the bill for Mr. Curteis, which I did.—<hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COMMITTEE</hi>. You stated that you had not been repaid? Yes, I did.—Would it be an assistance to you, in making your explanation, if the learned Counsel, who has the short-hand writer's notes, were to read to you what you have said? I am quite satisfied, when I make this explanation to you, that it will satisfy all his inquiries.—It will be better for you, before you make any statement to the Committee, to know what was taken down by the short-hand writer?

I received a bundle of money from Mr. Reeves, which I learned afterwards was from Mr. Mackinnon. I had no idea of saying what I did, till I made one false step; that compelled me to make a second, which I have been very much grieved about ever since; it has very much relieved my mind to have an opportunity of contradicting what I originally stated. I regret exceedingly that I should have said what I did: it was from a great desire to screen Mr. Mackinnon from the trans<lb/>actions; I do not know any other reason why I should do it. I feel exceedingly sorry that I did it. I should have made the same statement last Thursday which I have now made, had the subject been referred to. I have been very uncomfortable, and did not wish to lose the opportunity.</p>

               <p>of stating it; it will be a great relief to my mind to think that I have cor<lb/>rected the statement: it is a very great load off my mind.—Who was Mr. Beeves? A tenant of Mr. Curteis s.—A connection of your own? No.—What is his Christian name? Mr. Laurence Reeves; he was a very active man with us in the election.—Is that the only money transaction which you had with reference to that election? That was all I had pass through my hands in any shape or form. The moment it was put into my hands I could not say that it was Mr. Mackinnon's money; but I knew it was afterwards."</p>

I produced this punch and piece of lead—the prisoner said he left them on purpose for me to see, to know whether I would do them for him, and the price—I told him the price would be 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was to engrave a leopard's head, which was the impression on the lead on the punch—it was to be done on the following Saturday—the prisoner did not call on Saturday, he called on Monday evening, and a person with him, whom I did not know at the time, but I afterwards heard his name was Groves—the prisoner wanted to know if it was done; I told him to come up because I did not exactly under<lb/>stand about the size—he said how he wanted it done, and I said it would be done between 1 and 2 o'clock on the following day—he said if I pleased him with this, there would be another to make of a crown—he did not show me a crown then, but it was to be a size similar to what he had shown me some months ago—he was to come the following day for this punch and lead—the prisoner and Groves both came on the following day—there was not time for them to ask if the punch was ready, for the officer was there at the time—on the Monday I made the excuse for the punch not being ready, that the die was hard, and the prisoner said his man had filed it up, pointing to Groves, who was with him, and he was not aware but that it was soft.</p>

The prisoner lodged in the same house, as near as I can say, between four and five years—some weeks ago he asked me if I would make some watches for him—I said I would make the cases—he told me he would find the frames—he asked me if I struck the Hall mark; I told him if I did, I should be under a heavy penalty—I did not agree to strike the Hall mark; I refused—the prisoner said he would strike them himself, and he would carry the punch to Mr. Porter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is it you get the impression on the lead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It comes by hammering this lead on the stamp on the stake, which is a piece of iron—the Hall mark goes down in a hollow, and we have to take some lead, cut in a square, or in an octagon shape, and lay it on, and strike it with the hammer to get the case in shape, and the impression will come on the lead—this punch was in the shop in my father's time—he died thirteen weeks ago last Thursday—I saw the punch lying in the shop with other punches before he died—we have our own private mark on punches similar to this, only the punch is square—when this punch was taken from my shop it was plain, and it is plain now.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a public house in Thayer-street, next door to where the fire occurred. A little after 10 o'clock that night I heard a knocking next door, and ran out to see what it was, and saw the flames coming out from the shutters underneath; I could distinctly see that they were flames—as soon as I saw the flames, I and one or two others went and broke open the door to see what was the matter—we found the door fast—we broke it open, and found a lot of shavings all in flames—they were strewed about the shop—the shop had been used lately as a carpenter's and trunk maker's; the prisoner carried on that business—they were new shavings—when I went in, they were all in flames; there was an old carpenter's bench there, and the flames were coming up underneath that from the shavings—the flames were in different parts; they appeared just set alight to—I was there before it became one body of flame—I noticed the gas—the main pipe comes in just alongside the story post, or door post—there was a main cock there; that was turned on full—there was no other pipe—all the other pipe, the lead pipe, appeared to have been taken down, I mean all the gas fittings—the main cock was turned on full, and the gas was alight, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270102"/>
               <p>protruding out, I should say, two or three feet—the flames came in contact with the doorpost—they were close to it; they had caught the doorpost, and the doorpost was in flames—I should say that the shavings had been set on fire in different parts; I do not think it could have happened from the gas burning from the main cock—the furthest patch of burning shavings was about three or four feet from the gas; there were other shavings about the shop—directly I saw what it was, I ran back and got some water, and we got a cork and put in the gas pipe and stopped it—I threw some water on the shavings, and turned the bench upside down and trampled on the shavings, before the firemen came—I could not turn the cock, so I got a cork, and the fire escape man put it in—the prisoner has lived there about two or three years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say anything to you some time ago about insuring? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was something said about it—that was two or three days previous to the fire—he wanted me to purchase the lease of his house, that was how it came out—he came in and asked me if I liked to purchase the lease of his house—I said no, I did not want it—he pressed me very hard—he said the lease was lying at another neighbour's—he said if I would lend him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and get the lease away from Mr. Howland's, it would be very handy for the lease to be at my house for persons to come and look at it—he showed me his policy of insurance, and said it would make no differ<lb/>ence to him if the house was burnt down; he had insured it—lie was vexed at my not buying the lease.</p>

Q.</hi> How far is the fire station where the engine is from this house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five minutes' walk; there was no crowd when I arrived at the house—there was a female knocking at the door; I think it was Mrs. Bubb—she continued knocking when I went out—I did not see the prisoner that night; but he was about there all the evening—I went into the shop before the flames were extinguished, before the engine arrived—I suppose it was five or ten minutes before the engine arrived; it was not burning for that time, we had put it out—we put out part of it before the engine arrived; but a person came in with a candle and the gas caught alight again, and we had to put it out again, and to put a cork in—there was a flood of light from the main pipe—the shavings looked as if they had been lighted in different parts of the shop—the carpenter's bench was not a good deal burnt, we put it out too quick—all the windows were broken; the sashes were getting on nicely, if we had let them alone—the panes were broken by the fire, and the fire had reached the frames—there were sixteen or seventeen panes broken; I did not count them, I only speak from the appearance—I know they were broken by the fire, because I had seen them previously, about 12 o'clock in the daytime, and they were not broken then—I heard them breaking as the flames went up—I have known the prisoner ever since he has been there; I have not had any quarrels with him, more than if he has come into my place drunk I would not serve him—there was a bit of a quarrel about a bill—he came one day and asked me to lend him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would bring it back next day—I lent it him; and when I asked him for it again, be told me be would pay it me when it suited him—I sent him in a bill for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that was the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>next day, and put a new one in—the prisoner used to live in the house—he did not come home that night—I know that, because I was afraid he would come back again, and I sat up all night in my own house, and there was a policeman in his house to watch whether he did come back—I do not know whether that policeman is here—I saw a policeman there—I went back<lb/>wards and forwards to the house; I did not go to bed till 5 o'clock in the morning, when the house opened—it was about two or three days previous to the fire that I had this conversation with the prisoner; there was no one else present; it was in my parlour, about 11 o'clock in the day—the quarrel I speak of is the only quarrel we have had, except when he has been drunk, and I would not serve him—we had a few words about the money he bor<lb/>rowed; it was twelve months before he paid me—I said I would summons him—I never said I would serve him out—I swear that.</p>

On Tuesday evening, 17th Jan., a little after 10 o'clock, I was called to the fire in Thayer-street; it was about two and a half or three minutes' run from the fire escape—the shop door had been broken open when I got there—I found the shop all in flames—there was a great quan<lb/>tity of shavings alight; they were partly burnt when I got there—there were some in one part, and some in another—the fire might have gone from one to the other—there might have been a good sized basket full of shavings, I mean those that were alight.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Enfield-highway—I have a stable there. On Sunday afternoon, 19th Feb., between 3 and 4 o'clock, I saw then boys (<hi rend="italic">the prisoners</hi>) standing against the window of the room where I was washing and cleaning myself—they could see me-—I could see the stable as I stood there—it adjoins the house; the window looks into the road—the boys stood looking at me all the time I was there, till I had done washing myself, and went into the next room—I saw nothing more of them at that time—about two minutes afterwards, my attention was attracted by hearing a plunge from my pony; my wife got up and went to the door; in consequence of what she said I went to the door, and saw my stable on fire—I went to the stable, and got my pony out as quick as I could, but it was burnt very much indeed—part of the stable was burnt down, the result of this fire.</p>

On Sunday afternoon, 19th Feb., about 4 o'clock, I saw the two prisoners standing against the prosecutor's window for a short time, and then they moved from the window to the corner of the stable—I could not see what they were doing there; they had their backs to me—there were no other persons with them, or near the stable, that I saw—I was walking down the road; if any other persons had been there, I think I should have seen them—they stood at the corner of the stable for about half a minute, or it might be a minute, and then they ran away—after they had got a little way, I saw some smoke coming from the corner of the stable where they had I stood; it was very trifling at first, but as I walked along it increased, and I ran towards it, and gave the alarm of fire.</p>

On 12th Feb., about 11 o'clock at night, I was called up stair—there was a person there who had broken a wine glass—it was not one of the prisoners—he asked me the price of the glass; I said, "Sixpence;" he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went down, and brought up 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—it is a large room, for refreshments—when I went up again, one of the females was com<lb/>plaining that one of the persons had spilled some spirits on her bonnet; I told her she should not <hi rend="italic">kick up a row</hi>, I would give her money to buy another one—one man, an Italian, then struck me in the eye, and I went down to call for the police—(the man was locked up, and was after<lb/>wards discharged)—when I went to the door, Squarralino came, round; he had a large knife, and stabbed me in the right side—it was inside the room—I am quite sure he is the man; I knew him before—my nephew came to rescue me, and the prisoner Mattie was trying to hit me in the face—</p>

I live at No. 49, Alfred-street, Harrow-road, Pad<lb/>dington, and am town traveller and agent to Mr. Thomas Bushell, a spiced cordial manufacturer, of Hoxton—I have been about twenty weeks in his employ—I know the prisoner; he is a licensed victualler, and keeps the Coach and Horses at Kensington—I have been in the habit of supplying him with cordials on behalf of Mr. Bushell—at the latter end of Dec. I received from him an order for half a gallon of ale spice, to be sent to his brother at Ramsgate—they make ale hot, and then put the syrup in, and it makes a very nice drink—I sent it on 3rd Jan.; and on the 5th I called on the prisoner on my regular round, and told him I had sent it; he gave me the money for it, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him a receipt; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the stuff and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the bottle—after that I received a letter from his brother, George Stupple, in consequence of which I sent two more gallons of ale spice to Ramsgate on the 10th—I do not know what train it went by—I wrote the bill on the 9th, in the evening, put a letter inside, and the porter posted it—the body of this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing it is the one I put into the letter, it was not receipted—I saw the prisoner</p>

               <p>on Thursday the 12th, and told him that I had sent the two gallons of ale spice and the bill for the whole; he said, "I am very glad of that, it will be a great deal off my mind, for I have quite sufficient to pay my own debts;" I said, "Then I shall be indebted to you 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I have not sufficient in my pocket to give it you now, but when the carman brings the peppermint, which will be to-morrow, I will send you the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by the carman;" he said, "That will do very well;" he then gave me an order for half a gallon of ginger spruce—I did not go to my master's place on that evening, as I had had very severe walking, about thirty miles a day, and it wan severe weather, and I had a bad heel; I went there at 10 o'clock next morning—the carman was then gone his rounds to Kensington, and of course I could not send him the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on Thursday, 19th Jan., I met my master at the prisoner's house—I had not sent the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., because I had not had an oppor<lb/>tunity—I think I had been to my master's very day after the 12th; my master gave me a holiday on the Saturday, to see if that would do my foot any good, but it was no better, and I was away until Thursday morning, the 19th; when I went to the prisoner's house, and said to him, "What charge have you got against me?" he said, "You know all about it;" I said, "I know nothing about it; I hear you say I have been receiving a bill of you for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for goods which were sent to Ramsgate?—he said, "So you have," pulled out a file and pulled up some of the other bills, and held the bill up some<lb/>way from me on the other side of the bar on the file—I was outside the bar, some distance from him—I said, "I will swear that that is not my handwriting; he then went into the parlour, and I saw no more of him—I had asked him to show me the bill—I left the house—I was to meet my master there—I have not received the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the receipt was not in my writing, or written by my authority—on the following Monday, I was given into custody for embezzling the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was immediately discharged by the Magistrate; who said it was a very suspicious case, and he should detain the bill in case he should hear anything further of it—the prisoner said he had received the bill from his brother at Ramsgate, and had paid me at 10 o'clock on the morning of the 10th—the Magistrate said, "How can that be, when the letter was not posted till 8 o'clock on the 9th?"—the prisoner answered, "I did not mean to say that, I meant to say Wilkins brought it to me"—he said, "Wilkins brought me the bill"—I was then discharged directly—the prisoner was afterwards given into custody.</p>

               <p>him who I received it from, nor did I for the other money I paid him with it—I have no occasion—if I pay a couple of pounds, it is taken off my account—my master puts it on a slate—I never saw him write, nor have I ever read any of his writing while I have been in his service—I am perhaps indebted to him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have not had a settlement yet—I never render any account of the customers' names—it is trusted to me—if a customer goes away or fails I should be at the loss, and should have to make it up, because my employer trusts no one—they are not his customers, they are mine—I got most of them myself—my master had a small business before I went—I deal with them as if they were my own—I occasionally look out the goods myself—Mr. Stupple's goods were sent by the carman—there is no entry of them, except in the delivery book of what the carman takes—if there is anything left it is put down to my account—I paid Mr. Bushell the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid me by the prisoner, with other money—I cannot say I paid him that identical 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then there were two 19th in the month? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, certainly not; it must have been 23rd Jan.—it is not a pleasant thing to recollect—the Magistrate said that it was a suspicious case—I was discharged, and nothing further passed—before the Magistrate said that, the prisoner said, "I received the bill from my brother at Ramsgate," and then the Magistrate said, "How can that be?"—I did not particularly notice anything in the prisoner's hearing when before the Magistrate—some people can hear at times quicker than others—I cannot say that I ever observed that he was deaf—when I first knew him he was a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. buss driver—I have been a gentleman, but I lost about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one year—on 11th or 12th Jan., my heel became nipped with frost—I walked about thirty miles a day during our busy time—that is not why I reside so <hi rend="italic">near</hi> my master—I reside more in the centre of his customers—I have lived in Paddington for the last fifteen years—I have not been in the habit of writing in the prisoner's presence—I saw no woman in the bar when I was there on the 12 th—it must have been on the 12th, because his wife had gone over to a wedding, to give a woman away at Kensington Church—I did not see a charwoman in the bar—there was no one else in the bar during the whole time I was there—I never saw a customer there in my life—there was nobody but the wife there that I saw—I was there perhaps a quarter of an hour—I never made a practice of stopping long—this is my signature to my deposition (<hi rend="italic">this being read, stated</hi>, "I was not in the prisoner's house on 11th, 12th, or 13th Jan.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—on the 12th, when I was there, I saw the prisoner and his—I think that was the day—whether it was 19th Jan. or not when the receipt was shown to me, it was on a Thursday, and it was on the fol<lb/>lowing Monday that I went before the Magistrate—if I pay my master 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he wipes it off the slate—he trusts me with it, he does not keep an account of the goods supplied to my orders—in our busy time the account amounts to from 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I was in the police eleven years, and was dismissed for receiving 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the woman's husband was tran<lb/>sported—it is contrary to the Orders of the police for a policeman to receive money—the inspector got me a situation directly—I did not go before the Commissioners.</p>

Wilkins has been in my service About twenty-one weeks, as traveller—sometimes he has to deliver goods, and occasionally to receive money—he has to make out all bills, and correspond with all parties—he has 200 customers to wait on every week; the prisoner is one—on Saturday, 31st Dec, I received a letter from him, requesting me to send half a gallon of spruce to his brother, at Ramsgate—I cannot see whether this produced is the letter (<hi rend="italic">the witness was partially blind</hi>)—I executed the order on Tuesday, 3rd Jan.—I did not despatch the goods myself; Wilkins has a quarterly salary to discharge those duties—I sent the goods by my porter—I afterwards received the second order, and directed Wilkins to write to Mr. Stupple of Ramsgate, on the 9th, and to send the bill with the note—in consequence of something that was said to me, I went to see the prisoner at Kensington, on Saturday, the 14th, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, but he was not at home—I went again on the following Thursday, the 19th, having made an appointment with Wilkins to meet him there—I saw the prisoner and his wife—he said Wilkins had been there, and attempted to tear the bill—I was going away—I was somewhat disap<lb/>pointed at not finding Wilkins stop to see me, and declare his innocence—I said to the prisoner, "When did you pay this bill?"—he said, "On 10th Jan."—I am positive he said the 10th, because of my reply—he showed me the bill on the file, and likewise another which was torn, but my sight is very bad—I said, "When did you pay it to Wilkins? what time in the morning?"—he said, "Between 10 and 11 o'clock"—I said, "Have you received any letter from your brother, at Ramsgate?"—he said, "No"—I said, "It is, very strange; your brother received these goods, and he sent no Answer"—I then said, "I had occasion to send Wilkins this way this morn<lb/>ing; surely, he did not betray his trust, and keep this bill out of the letter"—he said, "That's it; we will hang the b—r!"—I said, "He does not lay in your hands; it must be me that must prosecute"—he then produced a bill on a file; he did not take it off—I cannot recognise it—on the follow<lb/>ing Sunday the prisoner came to my house, about 11 o'clock; he seemed to manifest great anger—he said Wilkins had told him he had received a great deal of money, or wages; that he, the prisoner, was going to let his house it Kensington, and he should like to take Wilkins's situation—I said, "That requires a great deal of consideration"—I gave Wilkins into custody myself—the prisoner told me he had paid Wilkins 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Wilkins was very lame—he left my house on Tuesday, and generally used to return on Thursday—I did not see him till after the cart started on Friday morning.</p>

I am a detective officer, of the City Police—I was with Webb on Friday 10th Feb., about twenty minutes past 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw the three prisoners together in Princes-street, walking together in conversation—I saw them go to the right hand side of several ladies, who were passing along Princes-street—I saw Bushby walk to the right hand side of a lady, and Taylor and Shelly were close behind him—they then went a short distance, and Bushby stopped and spoke to the other two—shortly afterwards they all three went to the corner of Princes-street and Mansion-house street—I saw Bushby go by the side of the prosecutrix—Shelly placed himself a short distance from him, with his back to the wall, in Mansion-house street—Taylor stood close by the side of Bushby and the lady—as I passed, Shelly looked towards me, and appeared to recog<lb/>nize me—I passed on towards the European—I turned my head, and saw Bushby running—at that moment I saw Webb, and he stopped Bushby, who at that moment threw this purse in a doorway—I picked it up—I then went to the corner of Princes-street, and in eight or ten minutes I saw Taylor coming from the direction of Lombard-street—I took him, and told him the charge against him—he said I was mistaken—I handed him to Webb, and immediately after I saw Shelly going along with his coat collar up towards his face and his cap pulled over his eyes—I took him, and told him the charge—he said I was mistaken—he had before had his collar turned down and his cap up.</p>

I am single—I live in Bancroft's Alms-houses, Mile-end—I was at the corner of the Mansion-house on 10th Feb.—this purse was shown to me; it is mine—I had had it safe about five minutes before it was shown to me—I had missed it before the officer spoke to me—I saw Taylor, he stood in front of me before I missed my purse; he was there when I crossed—I was waiting for a <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—I came to him, not he to</p>

On 26th Jan., I went with the prisoner; we left my master's premises between 10 and 11 o'clock—we had a wagon and four horses—we took about five bushels of forage; it was composed of chaff, beans, and oats; a kind of black oats; and in addition to that, the nosebags were full—we called at the Green Man, which is on the road to Bromley—we stopped there in going, and we stopped there when we returned in the afternoon; I should think about 2 o'clock—we then had the five bushels of forage in the sack—the sack had not been opened for taking out provender, from the time we received it in the morning till we came back at 2 o'clock to the Green Man—when we got there, I got up in the wagon, and threw the sack down to the prisoner—the wagoner and he filled the nosebags from the sack; I helped to hold them while the prisoner filled them—the four bags would hold about a bushel and a quarter—there was then about two bushels and a half left in the sack, and the sack was placed against the fence, near the stable yard—I placed it there—I buckled two nosebags on, one on each of two horses, and left the prisoner to buckle on his two, and I went in the taproom—I left the sack against the fence—the prisoner came in the taproom shortly after me—we remained there about an hour; we had a pot of beer, which the prisoner paid for—when we came out of the tap-room, the sack was thrown on the side of the wagon, with about a peck of forage in it—I took the whip to drive home, and the prisoner said, "Stop a bit;" and I saw the horse-keeper, or ostler, give the prisoner some coppers—I drove along towards home, and the prisoner said we would stop and have a pint of beer on the road—as I had gone before, I asked him for a penny, and he said he had no money; and when he said we would have a pint of beer, I said I supposed it was the money he got for the horses victuals; and he said, "Yes, it was"—I drove right away home—I did not stop and have any beer—I gave information to the next witness.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the sack was produced before the police Magistrate, were there not observations made that the quantity in the sack then was different to what it was when it was taken from the wagon, in Mr. Child's office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember that—I was present during the whole examination—there was no observation made, to my knowledge, that the sample produced on the second occasion was different to the sample produced on the first—the sample produced on the first occasion was much moister and darker than it was on the second occasion, because it had been a very wet day on the Saturday; and it had been kept in the dry all the time after that—I was about an hour and a half in the Green Man before the wagon drove up—I should say Grantham was at the Green Man baiting his horses for fifty minutes or an hour—I was not in the parlour all the time, I left and went down the road after I saw the nosebags filled and put to the horses' heads—I was down the road about ten minutes before I saw Springett walk down the road—I went into the Tiger's Head to avoid being seen—I went back to the Green Man in about twenty minutes—the crib to which Springett alluded is in front, at which horses are baited—there are several cribs that are used in front of the road—it is a sort of halfway house—it is a regular stopping house on the road—it is open day and night, and is a house at which a great many people stop—when I took Grantham into custody, he at once denied that he had been misappropriating his master's property.</p>

On Saturday morning, 28th Jan., I remember Grantham leaving the yard with a wagon and three hones—I delivered to him about five bushels of forage in the sack, and the three nosebags, which were full—I delivered five bushels in the sack, because I did not know whether he was going to have three hones or four—we do not put them quite so much for three horses—five bushels is the quantity we put for four horses—I saw the wagon return in the afternoon, between 3 and 4 o'clock, as near as I can tell—I saw what quantity of forage the carman brought back; it was about a peck—this is the quantity, and this is the sack it was in—it is composed of chaff, oats, and beans—I have examined the forage found in the bin, and the forage that was brought home; I believe them to be Mr. Coles Child's property—I believe the beans in the two to be both one sample—I have compared the oats; they are black oats, and are both the same samples.</p>

               <p>keeper to Mr. Coles Child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eight years—I cannot tell how many sorts of black oats there are—black oats are commonly given to horses—the beans are common beans, I never heard any name for them—this chaff is red clover chaff—red clover chaff is commonly used to make up this mixture of forage—the wagon was to go to Bromley; it left the premises between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning—I did not assist in harnessing the horses; it is the carman's place to do that—I gave five bushels of forage, besides the nosebags full—I did not measure the quantity that came back—between my master's establishment and Bromley it would be necessary to stop and bait; once going down, and once in coming back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the Oxford Arms Inn, in Warwick-lane. On Sunday night, 29th Jan., I was at No. 5, Bermondsey-street, about 11 o'clock at night—my brother was with me—we had had a glass or two of ale together—I was sober—I was going to take a Hackney <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I was standing at the door of it, on the off side, and some one came behind me and <hi rend="italic">bonnetted</hi> my hat over my eyes, and struck me a severe blow, which knocked me down in the middle of the street—I endeavoured to get up, and the prisoner hit me several times in the face with his fist; he cut my lip, and it bled a good deal—I had a watch with me, and I felt a pull at my watch; the prisoner took my watch out of my pocket, and ran away—the watch was hanging down by the guard—he did not get it; I called out—he ran away, and my brother pursued him—he was overtaken</p>

               <p>I had never seen him before; he was never out of my sight—I saw my brother overtake him, and lay hold of him—there was gas light—my brother overtook him, I should say about 100 yards from me, at the corner of Bermondsey-street—I had not had anything to say to him before he <hi rend="italic">bonnetted</hi> me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with my brother on Sunday evening, 29th Jan,—I came out of the public house in Bermondsey-street, about 11 o'clock at night—after my brother came out I saw the prisoner knock him down—he hit him on the back part of his head, and then on the mouth, and he bled very much—he hit him three or four times—my brother cried out—the prisoner ran away, and I ran after him—I hallooed out, "Stop thief!" and the policeman stopped him—the person he stopped was the person who struck my brother—I did not lose sight of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What were you about while he struck your brother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was in the street, and I was on the pavement—I was three or four yards away from my brother—I ran round the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> when I saw the prisoner strike him—it was a patent safety <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—there was a female and a man came out of the house with me and my brother, but they did not belong to us—we were a couple of hours in the public house—we were sent for to come over—it was at a friend of ours—we had some tea, and after that some ale, no spirits—there were four of us, and the landlord, who drunk—we went there between 8 and 9 o'clock—I paid for some that was drank, and my brother paid for some—the landlord did not treat us—I do not know whether anybody else paid—I do not know how much I paid, about 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot tell how much my brother paid—when we came out of the public house the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was standing at the door—there was not an altercation between some persons and my brother before he was struck—there were not some words between him and some persons standing in the street before he was struck—when he was struck I was standing on the foot pavement, and he was in the highway, on the other side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was between me and my brother when he was struck—when the person who struck my brother ran away, there were no persons ran but the prisoner at the bar—my brother ran in chase—the cowman did not run—the man who came out of the house with the woman did not run—I do not know where he was—he came out of the house, but I do not know where he was—I have not seen him since—my brother was very much knocked about—the first blow brought him to the ground—after the man had struck him, I saw his watch hanging dangling by the chain.</p>

               <p>"Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner running away from me—I ran after him and caught him—I asked him what he had been at, he said, "Nothing"—when I took him back, the prosecutor charged him with assaulting him with intent to rob him of his watch—I told the prisoner I should take him on that charge—he said, "It was not me; I have done nothing."</p>
