Some people came about him; when they were near the cellar door that has been mentioned; the prisoner made a stop; I carried him home to my own house.

I went about the 7th or 8th of June with my family to Hampstead: I secured my house in the strongest manner I could; the doors were barred and bolted, and all the windows were fast; I examined the windows of the kitchen myself; I saw the screws safe; one of which was afterwards broke. I came to town occasionally, and then I looked at my house and saw that all was well. A message was sent to me on the 20th of June that my house was broke open; I came immediately to town, and found one of the bars wrenched, and found the screw of the window taken; it was screwed in the inside and could not have been taken out without some person having put their hand into the window; the sash of the window was up and a pane of glass was broken; I myself picked up a chissel in the area next morning, and there were marks of violence on the door; and on the other windows, the area is twenty feet deep.</p>

               <p>On the 20th of June, at eleven at night, I went into a fore garret in a house in the neighbourhood, near the house of Mr. Morrill; the window was open; I saw a man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150005"/> walk by Mr. Morrill's house; I observed that when, any body was there, he walked on; when nobody was there, he clapped his hands; I heard Mr. Morrill's window shutter wrenched and the glass fall into the area; the noise continued till half after twelve; then a servant of Mr. Baldero's came home and I alarmed him.</p>

               <p>A WITNESS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; I found the pistols and tinder-box in the area; when I went down, the prisoners were sitting under the arch in the area, about a yard from the window; there were remains of violence on the kitchen door, on the street door, and likewise the other window. I took the screw up in the window; it lay by the pistol and tinder-box.</p>

               <p>About half after twelve at night, I saw Mr. Baldero's coachman watching the house; I asked if there was any fire, he said no, but thieves; I saw the window-shutter loose; I put down my stick; the sash was up and a pane of glass broke: the prisoners were taken out and carried to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COX's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>All I have to urge in my defence is this, at the time the burglary was committed, I was clerk to an attorney in the city, who, I believe, is in court now to give me a character. I left the office at eight in the evening; I spent the remainder of the night with a friend, with whom I drank rather too free; I left him; I believe, it was past twelve o'clock, in order to go home; coming along Hatton-street in my way home, I heard an alarm, and understood by a woman who was at a window, that there were thieves in the area; I looked round in order to see if I could get any assistance; I saw my fellow-prisoner coming towards the place on the other side of the way; I called to him, and told him what I had heard, and asked him, if he would go over the area with me, to see if there was any body there; he readily complied, and we got over, which, I believe, we should not have done if we had been in our proper senses; for he was also in liquor; we were hardly down but we were surrounded by the watchmen; we called to them, and told them we could not see any body there, or any thing like thieves, and desired to be helped over; that man came over and used me ill. I desired to be helped out, and said, I would readily go wherever they should take me; they helped us out and took us to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>WATSON's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The evening the robbery was committed, I had been at Sadler's Wells, after the entertainment was over I drank pretty freely; I met some acquaintance that kept me rather<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150006"/> late; coming along Hatton street, Mr. Cox called to me over the way, and said here is an alarm of thieves; I can find no watchman to come to detect them; he said, if you will get over the area I will go and see if there i s any body there; I complied with it; I saw no body there; the windows were shut when I went down.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner:</p>
               <p>Mr. SPOTTESWOOD sworn.</p>
               <p>Cox has been clerk to me since November 1775.</p>
               <p>What has been his behaviour? - Exceeding regular; he married a year or near two years ago; he was then absent about a month from me.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know him guilty of any such crime before? - Never, he was always exceeding regular and honest; I have often trusted him with two or three hundred pounds at a time to carry to my banker; and he never wronged me in his life.</p>
               <p>Mr.TODD sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known Cox and his parents and their connexions twenty six years; they live in a reputable way, and give him a good example; and in my own knowledge of him and his family I never heard any ill thing of him till the present affair.</p>
               <p>(All the witnesses for the prosecution were asked whether the prisoners were intoxicated with liquor when they were taken out of the area.)</p>

               <p>You did not see any fire arms upon either of them? - No, only this great stick; he said that would not do; I drew my pocket up with my hand; the other man put his hand to my pocket to feel if I had left any money in my pocket, but the pocket being drawn up he did not feel it; I went on to a public house that adjoins the Palatine houses.</p>
               <p>What is the sign of the house? - I believe it is the sign of the Hare and Hounds, I am not positive as to the sign; they refused to lend me any assistance. I thought they would see my watch, I concealed it; the next morning I gave information at Mr. Wilmot's office that I had been robbed; they sent me word in the evening to attend; that a number of people were apprehended, I was so much hurried there that I could not at first say any thing to them; when they came to be arraigned at the bar the prisoner struck me instantly, then I knew him directly; but I rather chose to see him a second time before I swore positively to him; he was committed the first time for further examination, because the man whom I suspected was along with him was not then taken; on the Tuesday following the justice told me to attend again, which I did, then they had apprehended<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150007"/> the other man, there were many circumstances that would have induced me to believe the other to be the man, but they were not sufficiently satisfactory to myself.</p>

               <p>Were you certain on that day to the prisoner? - Yes; though the prisoner had taken some pains to deceive me in his dress, yet I was satisfied from a particular circumstance.</p>
               <p>What created a doubt the first time? - The difference of his dress; I had rather a little doubt, but I was then pretty certain he was the man.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to swear now that is the man? - I can positively.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bishop gave an information at Mr. Wilmot's office that he had been robbed on the third of June, and according to the intelligence he left, we suspected the prisoner and the other man; I apprehended them, and when Mr. Bishop saw them he swore positively to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When I was taken up at Robinson's, this and another man desired me to go with him, I went directly to Mr. Wilmot's office; I sat in the public house there with some more men; this gentleman came in, he said he believed me to be the man that robbed him; I was ordered to go down to prison; they let me go to and fro as I pleased; I went away and went home; knowing myself to be innocent, I directly went down to New Prison for fear any thing might come of it; I asked there if any thing was alledged against me; they said no there was not; I staid at Mr. Bond's for some of Mr. Wilmot's men for two hours; I left word with Mr. Bond where I was going to; and if I should not be there, I should be at home, and if there was any thing against me, I would come up the next morning on Tuesday; accordingly this Yardly came to my house next morning, and knocked at my door; I let him in; he asked me how I came to go away, and if I would come after him to the justice's; I said I would, I went and washed myself while he waited an hour for me in a public house; when I went there was no prosecutor to be seen; I was ordered down to New Prison; I came up on Tuesday, the prosecutor came up; then he ordered me to put the coat of the man on I stood at the bar with, which I did; all my other clothes which I had were produced; when I put it on, he directly swore to me; he said he saw me ten minutes after ten with a handkerchief over my nose; and that he knew me well by my eyes.</p>
               <p>Jury to the prosecutor. I think you said there was a particular circumstance that induced you to believe that he was the man; what was that circumstance? - I thought it would not be favourable to the prisoner to mention it; and I thought it not altogether evidence; the person that was taken with him that they called his partner had the great coat on before the justice that the prisoner had on when he robbed me; I said to the justice I was sure that was the coat the prisoner had on when he robbed me, the prisoner swore many oaths that he would not put it on; the justice insisted on his putting it on; he said they should cut his arms off before he would put that great coat on; I afterwards told the justice I was very well satisfied as to his person without it; then the prisoner said, to satisfy me he would put it on; he put it on; though I was sufficiently satisfied before, yet that made me exceedingly more satisfied afterwards.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BOND sworn.</p>
               <p>What I am subpoenated for, is to prove that he came on the 5th of June to New Prison and knocked at the gate; he wanted the key, I said you cannot get in Stewart, it is after the time of the bell ringing; why said he I should get in as a prisoner; there was a jew young fellow that I never saw before with him; he came in a coach; the prisoner told me he had been taken up for a footpad robbery, and had been examined before Mr. Wilmot; I asked him where the commitment was, he said he had none; I looked upon it that he was only in joke, so did the turnkey at the gate; I asked him where it was that he ran away from the constable; he said he got over the wall, and went from there to Whitechapel and got in a coach, and came down; I kept him in talk a good while; by and by one of our men who attends at Mr. Wilmot's office, and two men came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150008"/> in search of him; I said he has been with me above an hour and half; I could hardly credit what he said, he told me that if the men that attend justice Wilmot's office came, they would find him at home; they went afterwards and found him at home.</p>

               <p>How came you to remember the day? - Because the next day was the king's birth day, which made me take the more particular notice of it; he staid there from between seven and eight till half past twelve; I lit him out of bed then, I mean out of the street door then.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he use to come to the house? - Very often, just to have a pint of beer, or such a thing.</p>
               <p>How often in a week might he come there, four or five times? - Sometimes more, sometimes less, I never made any particular remark of that.</p>
               <p>What can make you fix upon the 3d of June as the particular day more than any other? - Because the next day was his majesty's birth day.</p>
               <p>Was he there the next day? - Yes, in the morning he was.</p>
               <p>Did he use to sup at your house? - Not very commonly.</p>
               <p>How came you to say it was seven o'clock? - Between seven and eight I cast my eye to the dial in the house to see when they would be boiled enough; that was a few minutes after he came into the house.</p>
               <p>Was any body with him? - Nobody but his spouse.</p>
               <p>They came together? - No, he came in first, she afterwards.</p>

            , a bill of sale would be possession; but it is material to say in whom the possession was, in the case of larceny. Possession was delivered on the 1st of April of all the goods in the house; and thus described, Mr. Pope becomes intitled to the property of the house during that term; he likewise becomes intitled to every thing in the bill of sale. Sir Alexander agreed to quit; and as I understand, did quit the house; perhaps, one or two of the servants were permitted by Mr. Pope to remain in the house, which will make no difference, for b oth the property and possession of the goods were in the person of Mr. Pope.

It is observable, that Mr. Watts, an upholsterer, should make this bargain for two months. Mr. Pope accordingly delivered over the house and the possession of the goods to Mr. Watts, the consequence of which was, which probably was the view in it, Watts lets Sir

               <p>As to the facts, I don't know that they can be disputed; I shall prove them as I have already stated to you. I have learned, that it is said, on the part of Sir

               <p>That is for a stout sum; 3610 l. I believe was the sum borrowed. Now you let this house then to Watts in the presence of Sir Alexander on the fourth of April? - On the first of April.</p>

               <p>We will speak to the property afterwards; you had nothing to do with the goods from the first of April, I mean as to the possession? - I gave Watts possession of the goods, upon the terms of the agreement.</p>

               <p>What do you mean by saying that Sir Alexander quitted possession on the 4th of April? - I said he went out of town on the fourth.</p>

               <p>Why? - Because I thought he had a right to the whole of it.</p>
               <p>But he only rented the wine, he could not touch it, for he could not draw a cork of the wine for that would spoil it, the Champagne particularly. When you had let this to Watts on the first of April, it was understood that Watts was to let it to Sir

You was to quit possession to Watts; but Carter, Watts's servant, was to be put in possession for you, to make the world believe you was in possession? - With my consent and Carter's, Sir Alexander was suffered to stay.

               <p>Court. There never was a more scandalous prosecution carried on in a court of justice. If this gentleman had been convicted, he would have been liable to be hanged; now you hear from the prosecutor himself, that he never thought of this prosecution till after the bill in Chancery was brought against him, and an action for usury. It was agreed upon, that Sir Alexander should have any part of the goods at an equitable price; and it appears, that a regular inventory was taken; and now the prosecutor confesses, that it occured to him, that if he convicted this gentleman, there would be an end to the action in Chancery.</p>

I have the honour to appear at your Lordships bar, on behalf of a gentleman of great consideration and much reputation; a gentleman unfortunate in being connected with this infamous man the prosecutor; the least I can do, in order to bring this delinquent to justice, is to desire a copy of the indictment.</p>

My lord, after having so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150018"/> candidly stopped in the prosecution, upon my word, I think it is too much for them to ask a copy of the indictment. Mr. Pope applied to a justice of peace upon the circumstances of the case, and the justice was of opinion it was a felony. The property, most undoubtedly, is Mr. Pope's. He lays the case before a justice; the justice has a doubt; he admits him to bail, and binds over Mr. Pope to prosecute.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Nares. If the opinion of a justice of peace was to be a bar to any remedy, there might be the most villainous prosecutions carried on with impunity. I presume in this, as in every other instance, the justice of peace acted fairly, according to the facts before him. What was in the private knowledge of the prosecutor, and what he concealed from the justice is not before the court. I never saw a case in my life where there was so little colour, or pretence, to make it a criminal prosecution. I think there never was an instance where a court ought more to interfere, and grant a copy of the indictment.</p>

               <p>(The handkerchiefs were produced in court, and deposed to by Mrs. Sibley.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner came to my house for a clean shirt, rather before eleven than after. on last Friday. I live in Queen's-head-Court in the Strand, opposite the Adelphi; he came rather before eleven than after; he stayed in our house playing with my little girl till half past twelve; I believe, he did not go away till near one; he had on a nankeen waistcoat and breeches.</p>
               <p>Is that a nankeen waistcoat that he has on now? - No, these are not the clothes he had on then that I am positive of; the waistcoat and breeches were new nankeen. He was at my house again about six and stayed there till eight; he came again that night and stayed at our house with my little girl and me till twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>What was he doing at your house all this time? - He drank tea, and played about with my little girl and went into my yard.</p>
               <p>He came to your house before eleven and stayed till twelve at night? - No, he went away little before one in the forenoon, and came back about six and drank tea with me.</p>
               <p>Which was the truth; did he go away at six or return at six? - Returned at six and drank tea with me; that was the real truth.</p>
               <p>He went away before one? - Rather before one; I cannot say how many minutes before one; that was at noon; if he had done any mischief, it was before he came to our house.</p>

               <p>What did he stay at your house from six till twelve? - Yes, he went to the fore-door backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>That is not leaving the house? - He did not leave the house from six till twelve.</p>
               <p>What did you mean just now when you talked of eight o'clock? - He went and sat down at the fore-door with my little girl; I went backwards and forwards about my business; and he came backwards and forwards from a little before eleven till one; he never was out of my room, which is an under apartment.</p>
               <p>The whole employment he had there was playing with your little girl? - No, it was not; I had several books which were in the window, which he took about and read; he went into the yard and took up the ax and cut some wood.</p>
               <p>Jury. How old is your little girl? - Five years old the 2d of last June</p>
               <p>Jury. And did she sit up till twelve o'clock? - No; she lies in the same room.</p>
               <p>Court. With whom? - With me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150028"/>Did you lie in the same room where the prisoner was? - No, I have a bed that turns up; I did not let it down; I put her in a little bed by the side.</p>
               <p>What time do you put your child to bed? - Sometimes by eight or nine.</p>
               <p>Are you married or single? - Married.</p>
               <p>Where was your husband? - Upon watch.</p>
               <p>What became of him in the morning? - He carries coals about; he is not at home from eight in the morning sometimes.</p>
               <p>Was he at home any of the time that day? - Yes, at home to his dinner.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner dine with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Then he was not there at any time that your husband was? - I cannot recollect, whether he was or no.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was there; I treated him with a pot of beer? - My husband shuts up shops; he might see him; I cannot tell whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did not you see him; he says, he drank some beer with him? - I might be absent up stairs; I had rooms up stairs.</p>

               <p>Groves. What people do you mean?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The ladies - I saw Mrs. Maxwell and the postillion at Sir John Fielding's, would you have me say what they said?</p>
               <p>Court. Yes, by all means. - Mrs. Maxwell did not then swear positively, not so point blank as she has done; to say I am certain, I am sure he is the man; but you are certainly the man to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
               <p>What did Miss Master's say? - There was no second lady there at the time I was there; I mean the Wednesday's examination, that was the first.</p>
               <p>Was the post-boy there? - There was a postillion there; he is now disguised he was then in a postillion's dress; I believe he is the man, the first account he gave was in my hearing; and he picked him out I believe from eight or nine men; and when he came before Sir

               <p>Carpenter. There were nine men put into a back room; I was one of them myself, the postillion was put into the room; he looked round; he then turned his eyes to the prisoner; he touched him and said that is the man.</p>
               <p>Groves. That is the fact; when Sir John questioned the postillion which he then did, and frequently reminded him of the nature of an oath; he then lowered a peg, and said he believed the clothes were the clothes the man was in that robbed the ladies.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you merely there as a spectator? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you no business there? - None at all; at the first time when they picked him out I was there as a spectator; the second time I was there upon business.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you subpenaed here? - I came this moment into court; I knew nothing at all of it, and if I had thought I should have been called upon, I should have kept out of court; because I knew very well I could say nothing to serve the man.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner and the public are entitled to your testimony, if you can say any thing upon the subject. - It is a disagreeable business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, the advertisement in the Daily Advertiser the day after I was examined at the Justice's, says, that the ladies could not swear to me. I beg your lordship will see the advertisement.</p>

               <p>Court. Will you point out the advertisement.</p>

               <p>Court. It is an anonymous account of what passed at Justice Fielding's office.</p>

               <p>Did he ever pawn the coat and waistcoat he has now on with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When? - On the 27th of June he pawned a coat for two shillings; but I cannot say whether that is it or not; we have had that coat in pledge before.</p>
               <p>Did he pawn any thing on Friday last? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I fetch out this coat on Tuesday? - On Tuesday last; he serched a coat out for two shillings.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is this the coat? - I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Jury. Why you lent the money upon it? - I cannot say now; last Tuesday he pledged a coat and nankeen waistcoat and breeches for 16 s. and took a coat out; I never remember his having any other coat but this, and that we have now; he had a coat out for two shillings at the time he pledged them.</p>
               <p>Did he ever pledge more than one green coat with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The other coat that I have is a different coloured green coat; the ladies did not look at my eyes when they were robbed; here is a surgeon in court, he may see how bad my eyes are.</p>
               <p>Mr. KITCHEN sworn.</p>
               <p>Were you before the justice? - Yes, there was another coat produced which he had at that time; and this was brought then by somebody.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Maxwell. The other coat is a green coat, but it is more upon the brown, with brass buttons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kitchen. This coat was brought; the ladies were of opinion that the coat he then had on was the coat he had on when he robbed them; he said he was not the person, and would prove that coat was then in pawn; and that he wore this coat that day; that he had fetched it out of pawn, and pledged the other coat; as that coat fetched more money.</p>
               <p>Did he say when he pledged it? - I think not on Friday, I am certain to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The lady said she was robbed in this coat; I have proved this coat to be in pledge at the time; the ladies did not swear to me the first day; I believe Sir John's people persuaded them to it.</p>

               <p>From the prisoner. Did you see me put the purse on the ledge? - Yes, I did see her put the purse upon the ledge. The aunt was walking off and Mrs. West was following her; I pulled my glove off, put my hand in my pocket and found my purse was gone.</p>
               <p>What passed in the lobby? - Mr. Lucas drove her down to the lobby; after Mr. Lucas had secured the prisoner, he went to see for the person she called her aunt: the prisoner was taken to Sir

               <p>Court. What led you to distinguish at the time, whether it was her hand or her aunt's? - She was close to my right side; her aunt was before me; I felt her hand in my pocket; I could have taken her hand in my pocket, but I pulled my glove off, and then when I put my hand in my pocket my purse was gone.</p>
               <p>[The purse and its contents were produced by Mr. Lucas.]</p>

               <p>This purse and the pieces of money I saw the prisoner lay on a corner of a kind of ledge, at a door-way that enters into the Board of Works; I immediately laid hold of her; I had before seen her in the painted chamber where Lord Chatham lay in state; I told her she had no business there, and desired the officer to turn her out, and said, if she came there any more I should order the officer to take her into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Lucas was not in the place at the time the lady said she lost her purse; another woman and me were together.</p>
               <p>Lucas. As I came down stairs, the prosecutrix and the prisoner were by the door of the Board of Works. Upon hearing a contest between them, I took Mrs. West up into a corner that she might not get near any body till the officer came.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I saw Mrs. Bastin, he was not near the place; I was not near the ledge; I never had the purse in my hand. I have a material witness that is not come to town.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing happening on the 30th of May last, the night the man was killed in Rolls Buildings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you see? - I had just began to cry the hour ten; I was in Fetter lane; I met the deceased sitting upon his horse; I held up my lanthorn, I said what is the matter; he said, he was shot; I asked who shot him; he said, the man that was gone down Rolls Buildings; I said stop, I will see for the man; I met another man who had got him by the collar; he said Turner, this is the man that shot the man; I said bring him along; I took hold of one arm, he took hold of the other, I brought him up to the deceased; the deceased said that is the man that shot me; the prisoner said, yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner; is that the man?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. There is no doubt of that; that is not disputed.</p>
               <p>Witness. We carried the prisoner to a watch-house, till the surgeon came and dressed him. The prisoner was very badly cut, you could not see a bit of his face for blood; he had a great many cuts, one on each side of his eye, and the back part of the right ear; I did not see any others; he stayed at the watch-house about an hour and half before they could stop the blood to get him dressed.</p>
               <p>Did you see the horses come up Fetter-lane? - Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>Who was the first? - The prisoner, and he led a horse.</p>
               <p>Did you see them go into Rolls Buildings? - They did not all three horses go into the buildings, the two horses did; the other Forrester's horse did not enter the buildings; the man with the led horse, the prisoner, turned into Rolls Buildings.</p>
               <p>How long after turning into Rolls Buildings was it that the pistol was fired? - They were not above a couple of minutes after leaving me before the pistol was fired.</p>
               <p>Where was Forrester at the time he was shot? - At the front of the horse's heads when he was shot.</p>
               <p>Was he going on or standing still, or what was he doing? - They went a great pace indeed, as hard as horses could lay their legs to the ground.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner first went into Rolls Buildings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Forrester follow him? - The horse over shot the building; Forrester rather turned in the length of the horse on more.</p>
               <p>The deceased had a whip in his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he hold that up to the prisoner? - He held it up towards him when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Did he hold it up before the pistol was fired? - I did not see that.</p>
               <p>When he turned in before the pistol was fired, did you see whether he held it up then? - I was not near enough to see that.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you in Fetter-lane on Saturday night the 30th of May when the man was shot in Rolls buildings? - I was; as I was coming up Fetter-lane about five or six minutes after ten; I heard some horses come galloping up the lane; I was at Mr. Read's, the pawnbroker's door opposite Rolls Buildings; I saw one man turn in first with two horses into the Building's; they made a stop first; the deceased was almost thrown off his horse by a jirk in stopping; about ten yards down the building I saw one man turn his horses about; I saw him draw a pistol from his side and shoot the other in the breast.</p>
               <p>In what position was he when he was shot? - On horseback.</p>
               <p>Doing or attempting to do any thing? - No; he turned his horses head round directly after he was shot.</p>
               <p>What did he do before, did he past the end of the lane with him? - No; he turned in after the man with the two horses.</p>
               <p>What was that owing to his giving a sudden jirk? - His stopping the horse short.</p>
               <p>Was the horse going right up the lane, free of every thing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the man that was shot stopped the horse himself? - They were so close together.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the prisoner's horses stopped Forrester's horses? - Yes, by stopping in a jirk they were so close together.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150033"/>Was it the nearness of the prisoner's horses that was the cause of his stopping with a jirk? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Was the man that was shot going up Fetter-lane, or going down Rolls Buildings? - Down Rolls Buildings.</p>
               <p>That is your opinion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near was you to him? - Six or seven yards at the farthest; the deceased was brushing something off his stomach when he turned his horse round; I said what is the matter, he could not speak to me the first time; I asked him again what is the matter; he said; I am a dead man; I am shot; directly as he said that I pursued the prisoner and catched him down in Bond's Stables.</p>
               <p>How far is that from the place? - About two or three hundred yards; no it is not so much, I believe it is about two hundred yards, the length of the place, the prisoner was standing by the horse pond upon his horse.</p>
               <p>Did you search him? - Yes, I found two pistols upon him; one was loaded, the other was discharged; I went with the prisoner to the watch-house and delivered him to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You live in that neighbourhood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know that there is no thorough-fare there for any horse? - One horse might go.</p>
               <p>There is no thoroughfare, horsemen do not ride through Rolls Buildings to go any where, except they go to the stables? - No.</p>
               <p>These horse were galloping as hard as they could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was going first, he turned sharp up the corner into Rolls Buildings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you pretend to say that the deceased's horse did not over shoot Rolls Buildings some way? - No; it did not.</p>
               <p>How far did he go down the Buildings? - Eight or ten yards.</p>

               <p>Court. The prisoner was not at the end of the Buildings when he shot? - No; after he had shot him he rode away and called out for his master; when he shot he was about eight or ten yards down.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the deceased close enough to him to have struck him with his whip if he had chose it? - Yes; but there was no blows struck that I saw.</p>

               <p>Who went first into Rolls Buildings? - I don't know; I believe the man with the led horse was on the side next the Buildings, and the other on the other side towards Fetter-lane; they were both nearly abreast, but he with the led horse was next the Buildings; then I stepped down between the horsemen and asked what was the matter, one was holding his hand at his right breast; he said; I am shot, I am dying; I stept up to the other man and asked him if he fired a pistol at the man; he said he did; I was rather amazed, I stood a little while to look at that man; he got off his horse holding his hand to his breast, and said he was dying; I went to Mr. Read's the pawnbroker's shop; I opened his clothes and his shirt and saw the blood running out of his breast, he said he was dying; and desired to be taken to the Blue Boar in Holborn; then I went to see after the other man; the watchman had him in the Buildings.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>In the deposition that you made before the coroner relating to what your brother told you, he talked of it as if he hoped he should survive? - When I first when to him it was on Sunday morning; I was called up at three o'clock, I went down there, I asked him how it was; and how it happened; he told me how it began:</p>
               <p>What I ask you is this; whether in the course of that Sunday morning he did not say that he had some hopes of recovering or surviving? - No; nothing of that kind was mentioned on Sunday morning that I recollect.</p>
               <p>What time in the week was it that he entertained some hopes of recovering? - I was with him every day, I cannot say what day it was.</p>
               <p>But there was a period of the illness in the course of that week when he himself entertained hopes of surviving it? - Yes; he did say he hoped he might get over it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown.</p>
               <p>I called you to give an account of some declarations of your brother, made by him of this unhappy accident; at the time the declaration was made was he of opinion that he should die or live? - At the time I spoke to him on Sunday morning he thought he could not live, and every body about him thought so.</p>
               <p>Court. I think this evidence ought to be received; I shall tell the jury that if afterwards the deceased thought himself better; and there was a difference in the story he told; I shall lay the whole declaration out of the case.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>So that the evidence of the declaration is received with that caution, I can have no objection to it.</p>
               <p>Forrester. I asked him how it happened; he said, he was coming just by Black Friars Bridge when Brice and his man over took him, they crossed him, two or three different times.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Brice? -

               <p>Court. Did your brother know Brice? - I don't know that he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Because you said he told you Brice was there by name? - Yes; he said Brice and his man; he said, they crossed him two or three times coming up the Bridge; that at the end of Fleet-market. they attempted to lay hold of his horse, and he struck at them, and blows ensued; and that he called out to the people that were standing round, as there was a mob got round; that these two people either intended to rob or murder him, and begged their assistance; upon which Brice rode off; that he rode down Fleet-street, and Brice's man followed him and got before him; that at the corner of Rolls Buildings he turned round upon him and said d - n your eyes I have got you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150035"/> now, I will do for you, and fired a pistol immediately; I asked him if he was willing to make oath to what he told me, and mentioned the dangerous situation he was in; that there was not a probability of his living; he said he was; I then went to Justice Girdler, and got a gentleman in the neighbourhood to go with me; I saw Mr. Minors the surgeon, he advised me not to get a magistrate, for he was in a very dangerous situation.</p>
               <p>Had your brother a whip? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know what whip your brother had at that time? - No; only that he had a whip.</p>

               <p>Do you know that was his own opinion then, whether he would live or die? - He did not tell me, I did not put that to him; he was, at that time very ill in a very languishing condition.</p>
               <p>Court. And he was sensible of it himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What declarations did he make to you? - He sent his man in the afternoon, and desired I would come and speak to him; I had seen him before several times, but never had spoke to him, for fear it should hurt him, or set him a bleeding; I sat down by him and asked what he want ed; he said, he wondered that Brice was not taken into custody; I said how did this happen, tell me as gently as you can, and the heads of it; because I told him it was proper a justice should be brought to take his information; he said, he was coming very gently, for he had given his horse a quantity of water, and so was riding very gently between the Magdalen and Black Friars Bridge, when he was overtaken by Brice and his man; that they crossed him two or three times and looked very hard at him; upon which he asked them what they wanted; and they said d - n your eyes we know what you are; he said, that they passed on till they came on this side the Bridge near the turnpike; there he said they stopped him; one laid hold of his horse's bridle, and they insisted upon his going with them; he said he would go with them to the Bell Savage, and no where else; upon that Brice ordered his man to draw his pistol or pistols; that the deceased up with his whip and struck the man; and believed he brought him along side his horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you whether the pistol was drawn before he struck him? - He did not; he said, upon the strength of that, bearing a pistol was ordered to be drawn, he up with his whip and struck the man that had hold of his bridle; that he got loose and turned his way up Fleet-street; I heard no more of him; I asked him no more questions, fearing it would hurt him; and I made that reserve till I could get Mr. Girdler.</p>

On the Sunday after, I met the prisoner in Drury-lane; I watched him to Brown's; I told my master of it; he went and he was then gone; at half after nine we watched him to Wild-street; he trembled very much; he was taken up on the Monday following; none of the things were found again; he gave before the justice very different accounts of where he lodged; he would not tell where he really lodged.

               <p>I live next door to Mr. Harris: on Sunday morning the 7th of June, I heard Mr. Harris had lost some fowls; I suspected the prisoner Rayson; I acquainted Harris of my suspicion; by his desire, I got a constable, and went to Rayson's lodging; I met him coming down stairs; the constable laid hold of him; we secured him, and searched his room, where we found two hens without, and one with a head; we took them to the White Hart at Battle-bridge, and sent for Mr. Harris. Rayson said, he bought them of a man at ten o'clock on Saturday night.</p>

               <p>I live at Westminster, as I was going home disguised in liquor, I was picked up by Dun and Gardener at the Horse-Guards; they took me into their room and locked the door; and both got about me to persuade me to stay all night; they asked me what I had got for them; I said but one shilling in the whole; they insisted upon having that; and drew my watch out of my pocket before I had time to give it them; then they went to the window, threw up the sash, and called out to a man whose name was Biddle, and said, you may come up we are ready; he came up, they let him in; the first words he said was, d - n you, you rogue, what do you do with my two wives; that man was taken up and bailed for an assault in striking me; when he had beat me as long as he pleased, he ran down stairs, and I ran to the window to call the watch; I then asked the two girls whether he had got the watch or they had got it; they said he had got it; I ran down stairs to call the watch; I lost him in the street; I went to the watch-house and he was afterwards brought there by a gentleman; I got a constable in the morning and took him up; he confessed being with the girls over-night. I never got my watch again, it was a silver watch with a landscape on the face, and the initials of my name were engraven on the back of the case in a cypher; the maker's name is Dunstaff, at Newborough, Leicestershire.</p>
               <p>Did you stay with them all night? - No; I did not stay ten minutes.</p>

               <p>I keep a public house, Dunn and Green came to my house about a month ago; I know nothing of the other two; they had a watch, and were disputing who should have the possession; I did not make particular notice of the watch; I believe there was something remarkable in the dial plate.</p>
               <p>Was there a landscape on it? - I believe some such thing.</p>

               <p>Dunn and I were coming along together; the prosecutor asked if he should go home with us, we said yes; he said he had but one shilling; when we came home we said it was too little; he said he would leave his watch for five shillings and fetch it next day; and he gave me the watch.</p>
               <p>DUNN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>He had but one shilling; he said he would leave us his watch for five shillings; and when he brought the money he should have the watch; he went to bed two hours, and then got up and demanded his watch; we did not choose to let him have it without the money.</p>

               <p>Did they say any thing to you about your pledging the watch for five shillings? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you let them have the watch for five shillings or any other sum? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed for two hours? - No; in the morning they handed my watch about, and

               <p>Did the two women give the same account then as they do now? - No; to the best of my recollection they said the man picked them up at Whitehall; that they took him home, but denied knowing any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150047"/> thing of the watch; the soldier (Waitcroft) said he had taken the watch, and hid it under some stones, but thought some person had seen him; for when he went to look for it, it could not be found; the prosecutor has told your lordship the same story he told me.</p>
               <p>That Waitcroft had hid it for them? - Yes; he said so.</p>

               <p>I have known Underwood two years; she lives in the same neighbourhood; she walks the streets; I know nothing of the other, only I have seen her go backwards and forwards.

               <p>In what manner did they throw you down? - They pulled me down backwards both together; I saw no body but them; I am sure the prisoners are the two women. I was stunned with the fall; I did not know what way they took.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I had an information that two women had committed a robbery; the prosecutor said, one was Underwood, and the other Cut-throat Sall; and he believed they were at a public-house.</p>
               <p>Did she go by the name of Cut-throat Sall before? - Yes, I did not know her other name; I found her sitting with two or three men at the Bull in Whitechapel; he said that was the woman; I asked her what she had done with the man's watch; she said, she had no watch; I searched her; I felt something under her left breast, I said, I thought it was the watch; she said it was only a bit of rag; I put my hand into her bosom and took out the watch; about an hour after that, I heard that Underwood was in Bell-yard, Wentworth-street; I went and took her. The prosecutor described the watch before he saw it.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Did you then, or at any other time, offer to make it up? - No, I did not; she said before the justice if I would make it up, she would give me five shillings, I said I would not, she should have the regulation of the law.</p>

               <p>Did you see that he had a bayonet? - I cannot say, I suppose they are not without a bayonet when they are on duty.</p>
               <p>You are certain he was on duty? - I believe he was, because as I went past, he was standing by the box; there was no other person there, and he wished me a good night; I believe, he had a musquet in his hand then.</p>
               <p>Was his box in St. James's Park? - No, in the Green Park.</p>
               <p>Did he take the watch from you, or did you give it him? - He insisted upon the whole, stock-buckle, watch and money; he insisted on my pulling my stock off, I did; I took the buckle out and was going to pin the stock on; he d - d my eyes, and said, he would have the stock likewise; I gave him the stock and came away; he told me if I made any resistance in going off, he would murther me. I went the next day into the Park, and enquired how I could find who was on duty at such an hour in that box; I at last found one

               <p>On the 12th of June as Honeyball and I were coming down St. Dunstan's hill, we met the prisoner Swift with the salmon on his head; I went across the way and asked him where he got it; he said from a man on the Keys; I asked him to go and show me the man; when we came to Thames-street, he threw the salmon off his head upon me; one kit cut my eye; the other stunned me. Honeyball pursued him, and I recovered myself and went round the gateway and stopped him and carried him to the watch-house; one of the kits broke in the fall; from that mark I know it: we did not see Pearce at the time.</p>

             was dead.</p>
               <p>What time was the blow given? - On Wednesday; she died on Saturday morning; I found her dead upon the floor when I came down.</p>
               <p>Court. Who attended her? - No one; the parish sent a surgeon to examine her after she was dead, but she had no attendance while living that I could see, nor no manner of nourishment given her.</p>
               <p>What time on Wednesday did you see this? - The gentlemen gave me the money between nine and ten on Wednesday morning; at about nine or ten at night the accident happened.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see her fall? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to call it a push before the coroner? - I said before I could not tell whether it was with a clinched fist or no; I saw her lift up her hand towards her, and with the other hand she shut too the door; the door being a heavy door and shutting too pretty fast, hindered me from seeing her.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. What country woman are you? - My Lord, I am not come to inform the court of that; I beg pardon for lording you; (speaking to the counsel) I will not tell; it does not concern the cause.</p>
               <p>Are you ashamed of your country? - That is a matter of no concern.</p>
               <p>How long have you lodged in this house? - A fortnight and a day I believe.</p>
               <p>You say two quakers came to you? - There were.</p>
               <p>Are you a quaker? - I am not to tell.</p>
               <p>Court. If any of these circumstances should happen to be material you will be obliged to answer? - But they are not material my lord.</p>
               <p>Court. You are not to judge of that, if the court insist upon your answering, you must.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Because she has worn.</p>
               <p>Court. You took the oath very willingly and freely, you made no scruple? - None; because I have nothing to say but what is truth.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. You lodged there about a fortnight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This evening after this accident happened, did you go into the next door? - I did not; I went by the next door.</p>
               <p>Had you been at the next door the next morning? - I had never been within side the next door in my life till Rock was taken prisoner. I stood at the window, and had been speaking to them how cruelly Rock used the maid, and ill used me in scolding me, because I did not give her part of my money.</p>
               <p>How came you to swear now that the prisoner gave the deceased a violent blow, and before the coroner you said a push, can you reconcile that? - She lifted her hand, and gave a blow, I told his Lordship I could not tell whether her fist was clinched or no.</p>
               <p>Have you had a quarrel with the prisoner? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>You speak warm against her? - Nothing but for justice; what I do is against my will that I was ever brought an evidence; I was kept prisoner some days in the Compter, but I must tell the truth when called upon.</p>
               <p>The steps are very near to the door? - They are.</p>
               <p>A small push I believe would push any body down at the door? - I don't know but it may; I am not to tell that, I never tried it.</p>
               <p>Whether a small push would not push a person down into the alley from that door? - I don't know but it may, but I never tried.</p>
               <p>You swear positively that there was a push? - Positively I swear that there was a push.</p>

               <p>I live in the neighbourhood; I have known the prisoner and the deceased going on three years; they were very friendly and sociable; they lived like two sisters; I came home that night and found the deceased very much in liquor in my house; she said her friend and she had fallen out, I said be of a mild temper; she said she would, and would go home; she went out of my house at about a quarter before ten, somebody came and said, Mrs. Young was pushed out of doors into the alley; I went out to see, and Lutwyche and another man were helping her up; I asked Lutwyche what was the matter, he said Mrs. Rock had flung her down, the deceased said it is no matter to you, Mr. Lutwyche; whatever Mrs. Rock has done to me is nothing to you; I went into the house afterwards, and she was examining<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150063"/> her knee; I asked her if her iron was broke or any of her straps broke; she said no, if I would send some brandy in to do her leg, she would be obliged to me; I did not understand at that time that her leg was broke; I knew the person that helped her in and the prisoner were not on good terms; he asked what she shut the door for, she said that was no business of his and bid him go out, and he civilly went out; I sent in the brandy by the watchman to do her leg, and bid him not come out till she was in bed; they were both in liquor; he said afterwards I had given him a hard task, but he had got her to bed; I asked in the morning how she did, the prisoner said, she believed pretty well, all her cry was for liquor; she said, she was a little feverish; I said if she could not do for her, she had better send her to an hospital; she said why did I say that; while she was with her she should want for nothing; I heard no more till Saturday, when the prisoner told me she was dead.</p>

               <p>To Mr. Benyon. Are you positive that there was a fracture of the leg? - I opened it and there was; it was a simple fracture, not a compound one; both bones were broken.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Then as there was a great swelling, ignorant people might not be able to judge whether there was a fracture or not? - No man I think could be so ignorant as to over look it.</p>
               <p>Does it not frequently happen that an inflamation must be got rid of before the fracture can be dealt with? - By internal and outward applications.</p>

               <p>Do you remember the sums or dates of either of them that were brought on Monday the 15th of June? - I have it set down in my pocket-book.</p>

               <p>What did you do with that note of forty pounds? - I got it changed by Mr. Lawes a baker, opposite my house.</p>

               <p>Had that trunk any name upon it? - No; the first thing I saw was two suits of brown clothes with plain silver buttons on them; a quantity of other clothes, and five pair of new shoes, and in the foot of one of the pair of shoes was I think forty-two guineas and two half guineas; and I found this pocket-book in it, (producing it.) Allen owned that that pocket-book was his; in that pocket-book there is a bill and receipt of the purchase of some buttons. (The bill and receipt was read in Court.) He said before the justice, that what was written in the pocket-book was his own writing. They both lodged in that room and lay together; there was all their clothes in that one box in that room. I found thirty-nine guineas upon Voiture.</p>

I have a room in the inn yard where I sleep; there is a room parted off that room which is a kitchen, where I keep and dress my victuals; I board myself; the ostler sleeps in an apartment over me; the warehouse into which I put the plate is on the ground floor; it was locked with two locks; I left it safe and secure when I went to bed, and there was a dog left loose in the yard that night: I did not hear the dog in the night. The ostler called me about five in the morning and said, the warehouse was broke open; I went to the warehouse and found it had been broke open with chissels; the staple was wrenched, the bar was bent double, and the padlock lay on the ground, and there was a great deal of plate gone; we found three of the pacquets broke open. A bricklayer came in the morning and informed us, that there was a great quantity of plate at the watch-house.</p>

On the 4th of June in the night, just as I had been my rounds and returned into the watch-house at about two o'clock, a watchman came and said, he had for some time seen some suspicious people looking very hard at him. I went up Paul's-alley, which leads from Red-Cross-street to Aldersgate-street; I met two men in the alley; I took no notice of them, but went through the alley through Hare-court, into Aldersgate-street; I saw nothing amiss; I waited in Paul's-alley, and in about ten minutes Philips came to me; soon after we saw

I was pretty sure he was one, so I seized him by the collar; he dropped a large parcel of plate out of his hand, done up in a green cloth like a bundle; and Mr. Negus seized

            ? - I have seen him at the Bricklayers-Arms; he used to call there at a house I lived at as waterman; I met him in Grays-Inn-lane, and drank part of two pints of beer with him at the Green Man in Purpool-lane.</p>
               <p>When was that? - Last Friday was a week.</p>
               <p>What time of day was that? - It might want a quarter of ten o'clock, and I believe I was there with him till a quarter or half past ten; then I walked with him into the Strand, to Queen's Head-court, and then parted from him.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave him in the Strand? - Near upon eleven, I believe.</p>
               <p>And are you positive this was on the 10th of July? - It was last Friday week; I cannot say any further.</p>

               <p>Q. to Briggs. Was you present at the trial of Meadows? - No, I was in the Borough with a custom-house officer.</p>
               <p>Did Meadows send to you? - He desired I would appear upon his trial; when I came the night before, he said, he did not think his trial would come on till Saturday: I came to him in Newgate the night before his trial came on.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any person that you was to be witness for him? - I cannot say, I did, any particular person.</p>
               <p>Do you know that young woman at the bar? - I never saw the woman, so help me God in my life, till I saw her since Meadows was cast for death, that was in prison; I heard when I came to see him, that she was committed for perjury.</p>
               <p>What was the business that detained you? - He told me that he did not expect his trial to come on till the next day; he told me that the night before his trial came on: I was stopped upon a seizure; a man desired me to fetch a custom-house officer for a seizure of run goods.</p>
               <p>Could not an hundred people have done that? - They might, but Meadows did not think any thing of his trial coming on then; he said, he hoped I would come and speak in his behalf, of drinking with him where I did.</p>

               <p>Briggs. Meadows told me Green was the man that committed the robbery: that was in the bail dock immediately after he was tried. I came here to give evidence but was too late; I left the custom-house officer in the Borough, and told him what I was coming on. Meadows said he was an innocent man, and that Green committed the robbery; what I say is true; else, I hope I shall never move my feet.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Messrs. Noton and Ewer. On Wednesday the 1st of July, the defendant came with a note to our house, as from Mr. Axford, for eight loaves of sugar; I opened it and read it; I looked in his face and asked if he came from Mr. Axford; he said he did; I went up and showed it to one of the partners, who ordered me to deliver the sugar, which I did. I should not have delivered it, if he had not brought that note.</p>

               <p>[Mr. Axford deposed, that he did not sent the prisoner to Messrs. Noton and Ewer's, for any sugar, and that no person of the name of Lucas lived with him, and that the note was not sent from their house.]</p>
