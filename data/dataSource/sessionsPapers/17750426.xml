On the 23d of February, between seven and eight in the evening, there was an alarm of fire, and my house was in danger. I took my writings and carried to a neighbour's. I returned in about five minutes and found about a dozen soldiers in my house: they assisted me to carry off my goods, some to one place and some to another. The next day, the prisoner, who is a <rs id="t17750426-1-deflabel4" type="occupation">drummer</rs>

               <p>Mrs. Edmonds. That box was kept in a closet. I remember seeing the prisoner take it away; I told my husband that the prisoner had taken this box: he charged a constable with him: we got a warrant, and searched the prisoner's lodging, in Rochester Row, Tottlefields; there I found a part of my property, (some of the things produced in court and deposed to) part of the box was found, and the prisoner confessed he had burned the other part. Rochester Row is about a quarter of a mile from Pye Street.</p>

               <p>I removed the goods to my wife's aunt's for safety, they were afterwards conveyed to my lodgings without my privity or knowledge by my wife.</p>

Soon after that I saw the woman come out with something under her cloak; I took hold of her arm, and asked her what she had got; she said, nothing at all. I told her, she was a thief, and then she dropped the lead. When I saw the prisoner in the house, he seemed very busy, and had his shirt sleeves tucked up above his elbows, and his hair tied behind.</p>

On the 21st of January, between the hours of six and eight at night, returning from the city, passing by this house I observed a light; I looked through the keyhole, and saw the prisoner with his shirt sleeves up above his elbows cutting lead up in the kitchen: the woman, who is admitted evidence, was standing with a candle in her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260004"/> hand by the dresser. I got some neighbours to watch the house, and soon after the woman opened the door, and came out with the lead in her apron: we stopped her, she dropped the lead: being asked how she came by it, she said, the prisoner gave it her: the prisoner was taken as he was endeavouring to escape out at the back of the house.</p>

I wound the watch up just before I fell asleep; there was nobody in the room with me but the prisoner and the landlord. When I awaked the prisoner was gone: having a strong suspicion of him, I had him taken up, and a pawnbroker's duplicate of my watch was found upon him; he had pawned it in his own name. I was rather in liquor. (The watch was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

The prisoner offered a pair of shoes to pawn on the 1st of March: knowing he worked with the prosecutor, I suspected the shoes belonged to him; I went and informed him of it. The prisoner had pawned a pair at our house before.</p>
               <p>- Priestman. The prisoner pawned four pair of shoes at my master's.</p>
               <p>- Wilson. I am a pawnbroker. I took in four pair of shoes of the prisoner in January and February. The shoes were produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>I kept a shop in Little Poultney Street. I rather failed, and then I removed to Wardour Street, where I worked sometime for my own customers. These shoes were my own property; I pawned them because I wanted a trifle of money.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who had known him a great many years, and gave him a good character.</p>

            . On Sunday was five weeks the 19th of March, I was coming to London from Bath; I called at Patridge's at Salt Hill, and desired him to let me have a good pair of horses, that would carry me over <placeName id="t17750426-8-crimeloc37">Hounslow-heath</placeName>

                        targets="t17750426-8-off35 t17750426-8-crimeloc37"/> before dark, I intended to take fresh horses at Hounslow; he said he would help me to a pair that would carry me in 60 minutes; he said I need not be afraid, I should have time enough to stay tea: we set out from Salt Hill in the chaise between five and six; we were robbed just after sun set, but, it was very far from dark. The boy drove at the rate of a mile in three minutes and a half and four minutes Mr. Penwarne was in the chaise with me, and his servant rode behind the chaise; I delivered him a pistol; we were stopped just at the enterance of the last heath towards Hounslow; which I find since, is called <placeName id="t17750426-8-crimeloc38">Butcher's Grove</placeName>

I saw at a distance two men coming from the Heath into the road, they road, they rode on at a moderate rate towards the chaise, it was between the two Heaths; we were going at the rate of fourteen or fifteen miles an hour, they were coming moderately on at the rate of five or six mile an hour: when they came within about five yards of the heads of the horses, one dropped on one side of the chaise, and the other on the other, and came up to the body of the chaise; just as they were about the windows of the chaise, the man on the right hand of the chaise cried Holloa, stop, and the chaise immediately stopped. I find since that that was Barret , by his being taken in the situation in which he was with his hair over his shoulders, I laid hold of a pistol and dropped my own glass, the glass on that side was up, we were going so fast I suppose it was all done in two or three seconds before they came to the chaise door; as soon as the man upon the right hand side cried holloa stop, he said d - n you down with your door, as soon as my glass was let down, the man on the left hand side run a pistol into the side of the chaise, and said, d - n your blood deliver your money, or I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a pistol was it.</p>

               <p>Pike. It appeared to be a short pistol, the lock was on the side of the barrel in the old fashion way, I leaned forward to look at him, he cried G - d d - n you, he swore very much, he appeared very drunk. I told him not to behave ill, and he would have what he wanted presently; after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260006"/> that, he swore very much; he was not I suppose pleased at my looking at him; he said God d - n you be quick or I will blow your brains out; at the instant, I was lifting my pistol to fire at him, for I thought myself in great danger from him as a drunken man: at that instant the pistol came in at the other door, and the other man said d - n you deliver your money instantly; finding there was one on each side, I thought I had better desist.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that pistol was presented to the other gentleman in the chaise?</p>
               <p>Pike. It was in the chaise door; they endeavoured to avoid shewing their faces a good deal, but I saw the faces of both of them. I gave them more than five shillings: Gregory was on the left hand, my side of the chaise, Barrett on the other side. I gave my purse to Barrett, and so did Mr. Penwarne.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to give your purse to the man on your side?</p>
               <p>Pike. He appeared to be drunk, he reeled upon his horse, I imagined he was in danger of falling from his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give your purse as well as the five shillings?</p>
               <p>Pike. Yes, Barrett said, when I gave my purse, let the gentlemen off. Barrett behaved exceeding well, very decent; he did not appear so violent, nor did I apprehend myself in so much danger from him as Gregory; I thought that, as a drunken man, he might have inadvertently fired, and his pistol was within a few inches of my head. As soon as I had delivered my purse, and Barrett had left me, Gregory said, Now G - d d - n you, now for your watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both demand your watches?</p>
               <p>Pike. Yes, I told him I had none: he said, G - d d - n you, say upon your honour. To comply with his whim, I said, I had none upon my honour; he bid me say so again, which I did; then he said to the driver, D - n you go on, or I will blow your brains out. The driver drove on to Hounslow: when we came to the corner, there were some lusty young fellows standing there. I said, my lods, I am this moment robbed, there is forty pounds a piece reward for you, and I have a brace of pistols, and you may have the horses. They swore they would go after them. I ordered the driver to get fresh horses, and go to London. I was a good deal fatigued, I had come from Bridgwater, which is near a hundred and fifty miles that day; and I got into London about eight o'clock: I went to the coffee house, and sent for one of Sir

               <p>Q. Was there light enough to distinguish a man's face so as to know him again?</p>
               <p>Pike. Perfectly so, I verily believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not undertake to say positively that they are?</p>
               <p>Pike. I beg to be excused saying that; the one rode upon a bay horse, the other upon a black horse; the person that was upon my side upon the left hand, was upon a black horse or a more: the person on the right side of the chaise, rode upon a bay horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they be at the chaise?</p>
               <p>Pike. Five or six minutes, as near as I can recollect. I have received a letter respecting the prisoners, from one Littleton.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Pike. I mention it with respect to the person that wrote it, that it might be found out, but I don't mention it as a circumstance of any disadvantage to the prisoners, not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Pike. We came to town on Sunday evening, the 19th of March, I believe it was last Sunday was five weeks. Sir

             had sent to several people in town. That letter was left for me at Mr. Reddington's, in Fenchurch Street; and in consequence of that letter I went to Bow-Street, I saw Barrett<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260007"/> in the room: he had flaxen hair; he had irons over his hands: this was about eleven, next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both at Sir John's, or only one?</p>
               <p>Pike. I saw but one in the room at that time. Barrett, who I thought to be the same person that was upon the right hand side of the chaise: the other was brought to Sir John Fielding's before they were examined.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Barrett there, did you recollect, that, that was the man that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Pike. I did verily believe it was; I said so at the time:</p>
               <p>Q. Had you such a recollection of him, that you could say with a degree of certainty that he was one of the men?</p>
               <p>Pike. I do verily believe that he was the person that was upon the right hand side of the chaise; his hair was then loose about his shoulders, as it was when he robbed us. I was introduced into the back room, where Sir John was sitting: Barrett was in the outer room, with his hair down. I sat about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour in Sir John's room, when they were both brought in, and examined together. I had a bad crooked sixpence in the purse, I received it in change; I put it into my green purse, and gave it altogether into his hand. When Sir John ordered them to be searched, there were two farthings taken upon them, about eighteen or nineteen shillings in silver, and a bad sixpence. Sir

               <p> Q. You took the chaise at Salt Hill.</p>
               <p>Pike. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, it was between five and six; might it not be near six?</p>
               <p>Pike. I apprehend it was nearer six than five.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very fortunate to get a good pair of horses; that went at the rate of fourteen or fifteen miles an hour?</p>
               <p>Pike. We were drove a mile in three minutes and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be coming from Salt Hill to the place where you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Pike. I do suppose we were not quite fifty minutes coming: I had my watch in my portmanteau when we were robbed; but when I came into Hounslow I asked what o'clock it was, they said, between six and seven; it was not quite seven.</p>
               <p>Q. If you set out at near six, I suppose it must be pretty near seven when you was robbed. This was pretty near Hounslow?</p>
               <p>Pike, Yes, we drove pretty fast, as we did all the way. We came from Salt Hill to Hounslow in less than sixty minutes, and were robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Partridge's is about the twenty-second mile-stone, I believe?</p>
               <p>Pike. Yes, I paid him twelve miles, from Salt Hill to Hounslow.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you saw these men upon the road some time before they came up to you?</p>
               <p>Pike. They came into the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Your chaise was going at a prodigious great rate, and the glasses were up: it was impossible to make much observation upon them then?</p>
               <p>Pike. I could see them clearly through the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said, they avoided shewing their faces?</p>
               <p>Pike. They passed the chaise, and immediately cried, holloa stop.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe you give your evidence with great caution of the sixpence, and as to the persons of the men; that you will not be positive they were the men?</p>
               <p>Pike. I should be very sorry to prejudice the court, I would rather go on the other side. I feel a great deal in my own mind upon this occasion.</p>

            . I was in the chaise with Mr. Pike on Sunday evening, March the 19th. When we came to Salt Hill, Mr. Pike seemed to be dubious of our going over the Heath; we did not stay, I believe, at Salt Hill five minutes. It was nearer six than five when we left Salt Hill: we desired Mr. Partridge to give us a good pair of horses to put us over the Heath as quick as possible; we asked for four, but he said, there was no danger in the world, and he would give us a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260008"/> pair of horses that would carry us over exceeding well. We passed over the greater part of the Heath very safe, till we came to the latter part of the Heath, towards Hounslow. Just as we were entering the latter part of the

             saw two men; one came on one side of the chaise, the other on the other: I saw him that came on my side of the chaise take a pistol out of his pocket, he could not be two yards from me, when I saw him take the pistol out; he immediately turned his horse short round and came up close to the glass and bid me put it down; he said, put down your glass, then he said, I want money, and money I must have. I put my hand in my pocket and gave him, to the best of my remembrance, about eight shillings, though I think rather more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you delivered your money to either of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. I can positively swear Barrett is the man I gave my money to; I took a good deal of notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. In a light colour beaver surtout coat; I did not observe what cloaths he had under it, as it was buttoned; his hair hung about his ears, and was pinned at the sides; his hair hung down very strait. I saw them at Sir

               <p>Q. How long might he be at the chaise?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. He did not detain us above five minutes: he behaved as civil as could be.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at Sir John Fielding's, was his hair in the like condition as when he robbed you?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. Yes, I remarked his hair a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of Gregory?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. No, I never so much as looked at him, I heard him swear a good deal, and thought he was drunk, by his talk.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening was it, that you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. I suppose it might be before seven; we drove at a great rate. I did not observe him till I saw him put his hand into his pocket and take out a pistol, then it struck me a good deal; I thought what his errand was immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured horse was Barrett on?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. It struck me that it was a bay.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his face clearly?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. I could distinguish very clearly.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you set out from Partridge's at near six o'clock in a chaise and pair?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many miles did you come an hour?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. I should suppose twelve or fourteen miles: the horses set off a gallop, and never stopped galloping till we came to a little town, I don't know the name of it, I believe it is Cramford.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be before you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. About fifty minutes, I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, it is about twelve miles?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you came it in an hour?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. I had not a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You took no notice of these men before they came to the chaise?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not surprised at all?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be at the chaise?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. I believe, about five minutes; he was not there so long as Gregory; Gregory was not easily contented.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. No, very good light.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him eight shillings, did you give him the money directly?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he went away directly?</p>
               <p>Penwarne. No, he asked me for my watch, he stood at the chaise door still.</p>

               <p>Penwarne. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Valentine Crew. I was behind the chaise on the 19th of March. When the chaise was coming to town, it was stopped at Hounslow Heath: just as we got to Butcher's Grove, I saw two men coming up to the chaise; I took particular notice of Barrett before he came to the chaise. Barrett rode a brown bay horse: when they came to the chaise, Barrett twice cried, stop; the driver pulled in; and he said, down with your glasses: the other was up close by the driver's side. He cried, down with the glasses; which they immediately did; then he said, I want your money. He was on the right side of the chaise: in less than a minute Gregory came from the driver with another pistol, and said to me, D - n you, if you stir I will blow your brains out. I had a single pistol, with which I was going to blow Barrett's brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was Barrett?</p>
               <p>Crew. Yes, I am certain of it. I did not take the pistol out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you was going to fire?</p>
               <p>Crew. I did not take the pistol out of my pocket; I unbolted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gregory see what you was going about?</p>
               <p>Crew. I do not know; he came round by the wheel of the chaise, fronting the hind wheel, and said, if I stirred, or to that purpose, he would blow my brains out, and said, Deliver, deliver, or I will blow your brains out directly. Barrett, I believe, had got the money, and Gregory demanded the watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Barrett demanded the money of Mr. Pike?</p>
               <p>Crew. Yes, and said, D - n your blood deliver directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the two prisoners: what do you say as to Barrett?</p>
               <p>Crew. I say, he is the person, but his hair was not done up as it is now. Barrett was on the right hand side of the chaise. I am positive as to Barrett; his hair was hanging strait over his shoulders, in the same manner as it was when he came before Sir

               <p>Q. What cloaths had he on?</p>
               <p>Crew. A light coloured great coat.</p>

               <p>Q. The money was given directly as the glasses were put down?</p>
               <p>Crew. No, it might be a minute and a half after. When they had got the money, Barrett asked, if they had any watches? Mr. Pike, and Mr. Penwarne said, they had no watches: the prisoners said, have you not, upon your honour. They said, they had not, upon their honour: then they bid the driver drive on.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Barrett, you saw his hair?</p>
               <p>Crew. I saw his features before he came to the chaise, just as he came to the horses head, before the chaise stopped.</p>

            's. I was returning to town, about eight in the evening. I stopped at the Sun, at Hounslow; the landlord informed me, two gentlemen had been robbed in a chaise, on the Heath. And Mungo, (which is a name they call the last witness by) drove it, who was over the way. I went over to Godfrey, and he gave me a description of the men: he said, one had his hair about his ears, and the other was very much in liquor, and had had a fall from his horse: he said, they were two young men; one was mounted on a black mare, and the other on a bay gelding, which had been let blood. Upon receiving this information, I said, I had seen two such men on the Heath between five and six o'clock, and could tell them from a thousand.

I asked the landlady, if such men were there, describing them, she said, yes, they had supped, and were just going to bed. I desired to see them; we went up stairs, I laid hold on Gregory, and found this pistol, (producing it) in his pocket: just after I had found it, he said, d - n my blood, I ought to have another. Just as he was speaking this, the hostler brought in another, which he had dropped at the stable door, which exactly matched that I had taken from him. I then searched his pockets, and found a guinea and half in gold, fourteen shillings and sixpence in silver, a bad sixpence, eight pennyworth of halfpence, and two farthings. Mr. Othen took this pair of pistols out of Barrett's pocket, (producing them.)</p>

            . I am servant to Lord Berkley at Hounslow. When the information was given of the robbery, I went with the last witness to Longford.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you present when the post-boy gave the description of the men?</p>
               <p>Othen. When we came to Hounslow, we stopped at the Sun. Mr. Holmes, who keeps the Sun, informed us, there had been a robbery committed, and said, he would fetch the post boy: he did, and the post boy said, the chaise was robbed by two little men; that was all I heard him say about it. I did hear him say something about his hair. I went with Bryant to Longford: I enquired at the King's Head, at Longford, if they had seen two such men as I described; they said, there were two such young men in the house. Bryant went into the room first, I followed him, he laid hold of Gregory, and took a pistol out of his pocket: I laid hold of Barrett, and I took a pistol out of each of his pockets; these are the pistols, ( which are produced.</p>
               <p>Gregory's Defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barrett asked me to go down with him to Alysbury; he said, he was engaged with a company of comedians. I agreed to go with him; his horse was taken lame, that we could not proceed any further than Longford that night: just as we were going to bed there, these people came, and said, there had been a robbery committed on the road, and they believed we were the people, and accordingly they took us to Bow Street.</p>
               <p>Barrett's Defence.</p>
               <p>On the Sunday, before I was taken, I had engaged in a party with a company of comedians, I met with Gregory, and asked him to accompany me. We dined at Kew Bridge, and stayed till four in the evening: accordingly we set forward; my horse became lame, I had him bled at Hounslow, for which I paid sixpence. By the time the horse was bled it was quite dusk; accordingly, I said, to Gregory, we must keep up a sharp pace, or else we shall be very late before we come to any place: we rode on, it was quite dark before we got two miles over the Heath. I said, then we would put up at the first house we come at. It had been a very rainy day, I began to repent of my undertaking, because it was such a rainy day. We were riding fastish, I was intimidated; he said, you have got pistols, you can defend yourself. I said, I was not used to be out of an evening, I was not found of it; I would therefore put up at the first house we came to. Accordingly we put up at the King's Head at Longford; we asked if they had any thing for supper; we went first, and saw the horses safe in the stable, and desired them to be taken care of: the lame one, the ostler said, he was very lame, but believed, he would be able to proceed on the journey in the morning: we desired to be called early. After we had been in the house about an hour, two men came in, one, a man of Sir

            's, the other a servant of Lord Berkley's. I thought they might be people come to the house as we were; one of them came up to me, and said, young man, I must search you, and collared me, and he pulled a pistol out of my pocket. I then asked his reason for searching me, he said, there had been a robbery committed on Hounslow Heath, and he imagined we were the perpetrators of it. I well knowing my innocence, readily consented to let him search me; I knew he must execute his duty, and therefore, I consented to it immediately. I did not know I should be tried to-day, my witnesses are to come out of the country.</p>

On the 22d of this month, (last Saturday) about five in the afternoon the prisoner came to our shop; she bought two yards and a half of white cotton, which she paid for, she then went out of the shop; Mr. Rawle desired me to go after her, as he suspected she had taken something. I followed and stopped her, when she had not got twenty yards distant from the house; I told her, I believed she had taken something out of the shop: she said, she had not; I lifted up her cloak, and took this piece of muslin from under her left arm, which I am sure, is the prosecutors property.</p>

We went to work at six, or between six and seven in the morning. I fastened the door and left all safe. When I returned at about four o'clock, I found the casement open. I saw some old ragged cloaths on the floor, that I had observed on the prisoner, the night before: there was a red string I observed in his breeches, that hung down below his frock, when he was at my house the night before. I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment; they were in the house when I went out in the morning.</p>

On the 7th of April, I went out about half after seven, in the evening; I left no one in the house; I took care to leave the house secure, I lifted up the latch of the street door to be sure I had locked it. I returned home about twelve o'clock, and found my house broke open. I went up stairs, and saw a parcel of things tied up in a bundle. The next day I saw the prisoner before the justice, but he said nothing.</p>

            . I am a lodger in the house of Mr. Brookes. On the 17th of April, I went out about six in the evening, and returned home after nine. As I came down the street, I saw a light in Mrs. Smith's room. I was very much starried, knowing there was nobody at home. I got Mr. Chapman, and two or three neighbours to go into the house. When I returned, I saw the light was removed into my room, I unlocked the street door, and three men run down stairs; they blew their candle out, but the snuff was a-light: hearing them running down stairs, I pulled the door to again, but they wrenched it out of my hand, and rushed out, one, one way, another the other way, and the prisoner ran across the street. Mr. Hudson tripped up his heels as he was running. I saw him next day, before the justice: I did not see him when he was tripped up and taken by Hudson, not to be sure to his person, I went up to my apartment; I found the door wrenched open; I left it double locked when I went out: there were a shirt unmade, an apron, and a piece of cloth dropped on the outside of my door. I went to Mrs. Smith's room, and found her drawers broke open, and a bundle of things without the door; they had made an attempt to open the lock of my bureau with a chissel, or some such tool.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Brookes. I was at my door when the last witness came home; she told me, she was sure there was some body in the house, because she saw a light, and she knew there was nobody at home: she went to get some assistance, and while she was gone, I saw the light move out of the one pair of stairs into the two pair of stairs room. She returned with Campion and some other people: she seemed slurried, and said, now they have got into my room; she opened the street door, and they were coming down stairs with as much speed as they could. I cannot say how many came out, it was so dark: I am positive the prisoner is one that came out of the house, I kept my eye upon him; I took him three or four yards from the door, I never had my eyes off him till I took him; I was close to the door: I delivered him to proper people to take care of him, and went home; I was not in the house. I went next day before the justice; there he said, there were two more besides him in the house. I am very positive he is one that came out of the house.</p>

            . On Friday, the 24th of March, between seven and eight in the evening, I walked out from my chambers in Gray's Inn, to a lodging at Kentish Town, that I had for the sake of the air: that evening, Mrs. Camplin, at whose house I lodged, and I and a young gentleman, my nephew, a studentin physic, took a walk. We set off a little after seven; and in a field, on the other side of Fig-lane, we saw before us, three men in the foot path; one of them staid behind.</p>
               <p>Q. It was duskish then, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Urquhart. Rather dark, it was pretty dark. The men were about twenty yards off, when we saw them; one of them lagged behind, and stood by the bank: there is a high bank, on each side of the foot-path; I went on and passed that man, and Mrs. Camplin and my nephew followed me; when I came within about a yard and a half of the two foremost men, both of them turned about, and one presented a pistol to my head and said stop or you are a dead man; I was a little alarmed at this; I said, what is the meaning of all this, Sir, said he, your life or your money; he had scarcely finished these words, when my nephew left me and made a blow at the pistol with a stick, that surprized me a little, as I would have given them a little money, rather than run any risk; but, however, he drove the pistol out of the man's hand, and it fell into the ditch, I think, then he beat them about the head, the other two seized me, and pulled me by the neck and arm to get me down, but my nephew knocked them about so, that two of them were under the necessity of creeping off as well as they could, the third who is the prisoner at the bar, had hold of me by the neck, he pulled me down with him; he was knocked down, he fell like a stone, by some lucky blow the young gentleman gave him; we secured him, the other two went away and we heard no more of them; when the man recovered a little from his blows, we said, he must go along with us; he said, he would, my nephew got hold of one of his arms, Mrs. Camplin the other, and we took him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260017"/> into Kentish town; we had him into the Blackhorse alehouse, and a great many people came about; my nephew and some of the people conveyed him to St. Giles's round-house; he was the next morning examined before the justice and afterwards committed; we did not find the pistol then, but I saw it plainly knocked out of his hand; we told the people at the Blackhorse, that the pistol was there; some people went with lanthorns to look for it; but I was not present at the time.</p>

I shewed them several watches; they bought one, they gave earnest for it, and left it to be repaired. After they were gone, I missed a silver case single watch, maker's name, J. Davis. On Monday, one of the men, who were with the prisoner, who bargained for the watch, came for it. I told him, when they were there, on Friday, I missed a watch; he seemed surprised, and said, the Black must have taken it. Having no suspicion of him, I let him have the watch away, he had bargained for. Two or three days after, the prisoner came into my shop, and shewed me an old watch he had, I took the watch, and then charged him with the robbery: he denied it; I sent for a constable, and he was taken to justice Welch's office. I found a watch paper in the watch I took from him; by the direction of that paper I went to Mr. Triquet, in Cranbourne Alley, and there I found my watch.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the two prisoners at the pawnbroker's, I suspected them. I made an excuse to talk to the pawnbroker; I saw the watch in his hand. I said, it is a pretty watch, and asked her whose it was. She first said, it belonged to a person in the hospital. I insisted upon seeing the owner: then she said, it belonged to the prosecutor, and took us to the house at Cow Cross.</p>

We returned at half after ten, when we found the house broke open, the lock of the door was broke, and a pannel drove out of the wainscot: there were taken away a carcass, three legs, and two necks of mutton, half a buttock of beef, and part of a neck of veal. I got a search warrant and a constable, and searched Cross's lodgings, where I found part of the neck of veal.

Finding nobody at home, I laid hold of the brass knob, and while a coach was going by, the two prisoners bounced it open with their backside; we took the meat away, and hid it, and then got a bag. I cut the carcass in half, and sold half of it for five shillings. Storer sold two of the legs of mutton, he was paid before hand for it, he took it to the people, they were not at home, so he kept them at his own house, and Dinmore came and found there and found Storer in the cock-loft. We dressed part of the veal, and ate it, and Wilmot came and found the rest of it; we ate the beef on Sunday night.</p>

At half past five o'clock in the morning of the 23d of April, (last Sunday) as I was coming down about my business, I opened the kitchen door, and saw some men, I believe three, I am not quite positive to the number; I was so extremely surprized with it, they were going out of the kitchen window, which is below stairs, into the area, they had forced the door of the kitchen into the area, I went immediately back again up stairs to alarm my fellow-servants.

Andrew asked which way they were gone, as he had lost sight of them during the time he was going down stairs: I said they were got into the garden, upon which he barefooted as he was, jumped into the garden after the men; my master's house is the last but two on the last hand side, I heard one of the persons say, but who I don't know, d - n you, blow his brains out; there were no watch at that time, it was so late they were gone off their stand. I kept my eyes upon them till I saw Andrew run after two of them across the fields, the other had made his escape another way. I looked as long as I could see them running across the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260029"/> fields, then I came down stairs in order to take this bag of plate that was left in the garden, for I saw one of them fling a bag over the area when I looked out of the window, and the first man that got over, picked up this bag, and ran away with it, and got into the garden.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Nugent, I was alarmed by my fellow-servant about half past five in the morning with a cry of thieves in the house; upon which I got up and went into her room, and saw two men in the area, one with a laced hat, and another with a bag, there was a third man that was getting over the rails. I did not stay there much longer, but ran down stairs, and just as I ran down stairs the house bell rang, which I imagine alarmed the people more than they were alarmed before, and made them hasten away as fast as they could; but by the time I had got down stairs, and had opened the bars and bolts, and opened the door, they had got quite out of sight, and had got over the garden wall, which is about thirty yards off. I asked my fellow-servant which way they were gone: she said into the garden; upon which I jumped down; one of the fellows immediately said, d - n you, blow his brains out. I am not certain which said that, there being three to one, it put me to a stand; I did not advance to them, but they were endeavouring to make their escape, and got over the rails into the fields; and Jordan, the shortest of the two prisoners, dropped the bag as he was getting over the pails, I am certain it was him; I got over after them, and pursued two of them, which were the two prisoners, and pursued them as far as the burying ground, there I met with one Parsons, who accompanied me up to the brick kilns. I was barefoot, so that when we ran upon the grass I had the soot of them, and ran faster, but when they came upon hard road I could not run so fast; by that time many people were alarmed, and Parsons went and seized Jordan in my sight; I lost sight of Jordan about two minutes while he was dodging backwards and forwards among the brick kilns, but I am sure to his person, though I had not my eyes upon him during the whole time; I saw him again afterwards, and I am very certain to his person, I went up the moment Parsons had laid hold of him, and said what a fool was you to break open a house at such a time in the morning, at this was; he said he was innocent; then I went round the kiln to look for the other, he was taken not quite in my presence, he was at some short distance. I might have seen him very plain, only the multitude of people that were between me and the prisoner were such, that I cannot exactly say that I saw him taken, neither can I swear to his person. The other had a plain hat; Jordan was much behind, and I had a better opportunity of viewing his face, and I am certain to his person.</p>

            . I heard a noise about this time, of a dash on the pavement, I locked out and saw a bag on the pavement, which I suppose made that dash falling on the pavement; I saw Jordan, to the best of my knowledge, taking it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear positively to his person?</p>
               <p>Thompson. No, not directly and positively; but it was very much like him, and I believe it was him; he had no hat on at the time he came over the rails from the area, and went into the garden. Andrew came out, and asked where they were gone, and was informed they were in the garden. I also heard somebody say, d - n him, blow his brains out. The short man, which I take to be Jordan, got over the pails into the fields, and dropped the bag, and Andrew pursued him till out of sight. I still kept at the window, while Martin went down stairs, Martin went down to the garden wall, and took the bag in which was the plate from a man, who gave it to her, I had my eye upon them all the time.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker in Hart-street, Covent-garden. I was accidentally out in the fields to take a walk at half past five last Sunday morning. I heard a cry of stop thief, and saw the two prisoners running, they were pursued by four or five, one a gentleman's servant without shoes or stockings on. At first, I thought it was only some people in play together, I took no notice of it, but seeing the gentleman's servant coming running without shoes or stockings, then I began to think it was something serious, and turned and joined in the pursuit. William, the tallest man, turned round, and said to one of the men that followed after him, You bloody thief, if you touch me I will blow your brains out. I followed Williams, who, in order to avoid me, jumped into a pond up to his middle, I caught at him but could not catch him at that time, and then he ran into a brick kiln, and dodged backwards, there I got a piece of a brick and gave him a blow on the head, which a little stunned him; he put his hand to his head, then I closed upon him. I never lost sight of him from the first, I am certain he was the man. The gentleman's servant then came up and said, What a regue or fool was you to rob a house by day-light; and the prisoner desired him not to use him ill.</p>
               <p>Aaron Leigh. I was wheeling some dung to Mr. Harding's yard, who keeps cows; near his cow house, in the fields, I heard a cry of theives, and saw Williams running with a pistol in his hands. upon which I alarmed the milk people, who were in the yard, and they all ran after him; I saw Parsons lay hold of Jordan, and they hunted Williams about for above a quarter of an hour in the brick-kiln, where they dry bricks, dodging about before they caught him. One of the men found him there, and they, to the number of twenty surrounded him; he still stood upon his defence against them all: one of the men,

(The salt-seller produced, and deposed to by Bolan, who said, he absolutely saw it the day before, that it was one of a better sort, and was frequently papered up when it was not in use, and stood in that cupboard where the rest of the plate was.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness, I heard my grandfather cry out murder, I went into his room which is opposite mine, I met a man who presented a pistol to my breast and swore If I spoke a word or made any resistance be would shoot me dead, there were two other men in the room, I had nothing on but my shirt, I went to one corner of the room; then one cried knock him down, shoot him, murder him, and one of them knocked me down, I got up again and they stood close by me, I desired to be released from that confinement then they put me to bed to my grandfather and covered me with the curtains.</p>

               <p>Q. How was the room lighted?</p>
               <p>Jackson. There were dark lanthrons, while I was on the floor they desired me to inform them where the money was, and said it should be worse for me if I did not, I told them there was some money in the drawers in that room, they opened the drawers, but found nothing then they opened a box, in which they found thirty guineas and twenty-five pound in another, they took away things to the value of one hundred and fifty pounds in the whole, we lay there till about four o'clock, I cannot swear to their persons, the street door was bolted and bared, they undid the bolts and bars and went out at the door, I apprehend they got in at the side window, which was left open, I did not observe it the night before.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Pyle, who is Mr. Jackson's father-in-law, and has part of the house. I was last up in the house the night of the burglary; I fastened the door, the sash of the side window where they got in, was down and the shutters put to; I don't know whether they were fastened. I heard my master's door break open; I jumped out of bed, and called out to know what was the matter; I had not opened the door a minute before two fellows rushed in upon me: one clapped a pistol to me, and swore he would kill me if I spoke a word, and did not immediately get into bed. One of the men held a dark lanthorn in my face; there I lay in bed till they went out of the house; one of the men staid in the room all the time, which was almost two hours, they staid in the house from two, to four. I don't know the person that staid with me, I believe he had a piece of brown paper drawn down as low as over his eyes, the other man's face was black all over, or he had a crape on: he that held the lanthorn to my face, was such a made man as Tunks; they went out about four o'clock. The man that was in my room went on the the stairs, he d - d the other men, and bid them open the door; and then they all went away. When I came down, I found the window and door open, and I found this dark lanthorn in Mr. Jackson's room, (producing it.)</p>

She gave me a good deal of ill language, and said, she would have the box. She went away, and brought the two prisoners, Tunks and Hines and another man, and said, she had brought a constable for the box. I asked, which was the constable? She said, Tunks was; I said, he was the man that brought the box; and I set my back against the closet door where it was. One of them swore d - n her bang her; I was afraid and went to go out, one of the men stopped me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260034"/> at the door and Braband put her hands over my mouth, Tunks put his hand over her's and held me till I was black in the face, then Tunks took up the box and ran away with it. I struggled and got from them to the door and cried stop thief and alarmed the neighbourhood, and he was brought back with the box; one Mrs. Williams, who lives in the house with me, took up the box and weighed it in her hand and said there was something valuable in the box, it was very heavy, Hines said, I suppose you have seen what it is, there is plate in it marked J. B. E. I went for a constable and gave charge of them to the constable, but he would not take him, still I would not let them have the box, then they went away, I sent for my husband from his work, my husband is a taylor, and told him what had happened and he went and gave information of it at Sir John Fielding's and then there came three of Sir John Fielding's men, with my husband and broke the box open in my room, and they found some plate, pistols, dark lanthron and flask; I did not know any thing of the prisoners till the woman came to take the lodging.</p>

            . I lodge in the back building in Mr. Parkinson's house; my chimney was swept the 6th of March, there were some peculiar circumstances attending the sweeping of it; this boy, the prisoner, came about two or three in the afternoon, and begged very hard for leave to sweep my chimney, in order to get the foot; he said, he had got but half a bushel of foot, and he was obliged to bring a bushel home, or else his master would beat him; he begged leave to sweep my chimney; I gave him leave; he went up once, and continued a long time, then he came down, and brought but little foot. I observed that, and said the chimney was not so foul as I thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177504260036"/> it had been. Said he, the other part of the foot is lying up in a part of the chimney, I must go up again. I refused at first to let him go up, I said that as there was a slit in the chimney I was afraid he would burst it out; he said he would go up, and up he went; I put something on the fire to prevent his burning of his feet: he staid up a great while that time; when he came down again, a pretty great quantity came, and down tumbled this candlestick, (producing it) that astonished me. I thought it an odd place to find an iron candlestick in; I knew it immediately to be my landlord Parkinson's candlestick that they burnt a candle in their chimney, for purpose of watching a sick child.

               <p>Prosecutor. This candlestick stood in our chimney ever since last Christmas, on account of a sick child we had in the room, therefore we burnt a light at night in that iron candlestick. I set it upon the hub of the chimney. It is all one stack of chimnies between mine and the back building, Simmonds lives in the two buildings joined, so that any one that goes up one chimney might easily get down the other.</p>

            . I know the prisoner, and know his wife. I was out with the deceased all the afternoon of Monday the 6th of March. I don't know the name of the street where we were, but it was near Clare Market: we returned home to Orchard Street, Westminster, about eight at night, we ate a bit of supper, and I parted with her just at ten o'clock at night, her husband was not at home then: after we came home I went out to see for him, but could not find him; when I returned, the deceased told: me, he had been at home, and was gone to Tottlefields to the Three Gardeners. At ten o'clock I left the deceased alone, she was in liquor, she had drank several glasses of brandy and gin, she was apt to he in liquor, and was very quarrelsome when she was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she use to quarrel with?</p>
               <p>Coster. Chiefly her husband, I believe any body that came in the way.</p>

               <p>Q. Was her husband apt to be in liquor?</p>
               <p>Coster. Not very often, as ever I heard; I never heard that he behaved amiss to her, I never heard that they lived unhappily: I was frequently with them.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination. she said, that she heard the prisoner say, that the deceased struck him first, and that when she was in liquor she would strike any body that affrented her: the witness said, that she has seen the deceased take up the poker, and offer to strike him; and that she was very passionate</p>

            . I keep the sign of the Wheat Sheaf, in New Tottle Street. I have known the prisoner five or six years. He came to my house on Monday the 6th of March, about six at night as near as I can recollect, he staid till near eleven, he drank some gin and water, but not a great deal. About eleven o'clock I got up to shut the windows, while I was shutting the windows, the deceased came in, and asked him to go home, and they went home together. I could see Beets had been drinking, he was what we call half and half, he was rather concerned in liquor: I cannot say how the deceased was, I did but just see her. In about the space of ten minutes the deceased returned, and asked if her husband had been at my house again. I told her he had not, and asked her, whether he had out-run her, or some such word. She said, he was gone some where or other, that he was a little in his airs. I believe the prisoner to be a very honest man; he was not a quarrelsome man; he was as quiet a man as ever I was in company with in my life; he was so far from being quarrelsome he would rather endeavour to unite people together who had any words.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she appear when she came the second time?</p>

               <p>Q. Was that when he was in the house, or out of the house?</p>
               <p>Mackey. In the house, I heard his foot come in, to the best of my knowledge. I heard Mrs. Beets in the passage say, God rot you, I will heave all that is on the table in your face. I heard her desire him to bolt the street door. He said, he would not, or did not mean that, I don't know which was the words. Then Mrs. Beets said, God rot you, if you don't shut the parlour door, I will throw all the things on the table in your face. Mr. Beets said, God d - n your drunken soul.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be quarrelling together.</p>
               <p>Mackey. I heard no more, I heard the back parlour door shut directly; about a quarter of an hour after. I heard a foot go down the kitchen stairs, I don't know whether it was a man or woman's, in about two minutes after I heard the other go down, I did not know who they were, they came up both together, I heard no words at that time: when they came up the cellar stairs, I heard one go towards the street door and the other towards the parlour door; I heard the one that went towards the parlour door go afterwards towards the street door; then I heard Mr. Beets ask Mrs. Beets to come in; she was got without the street door, and the door pulled to after her; she said, I won't, I did not hear him make any answer to that; but I heard the flap of a hand three or four times, as if upon the back of another person; I could not distinguish whether it was the husband upon the wife, of the wife upon the husband, I heard only the found; then they both came in together, I heard the found of both their feet together; they went into the parlour and shut the door, I did not hear any thing more pass between them; not one word; about a quarter of an hour afterwards, I heard a foot come out of the parlour, and go down the kitchen stairs; it did not stay long below; I cannot be sure how long I was a-bed at this time.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was an hour, or less than an hour.</p>
               <p>Mackey. It was not a quarter of an hour, I heard the person come up again and go into the parlour it staid near ten minutes, then I heard a foot go out at the street door and pull the door after them; I could not distinguish by the tread whether it was man or woman; I heard no noise, no words, nor blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have heard them if there had been any.</p>
               <p>Mackey. I don't know: I have lived two years in the house, I never heard any words between them, I have seen her in liquor sometimes, I don't know any thing of her behaviour, she used to pass and repass me, I cannot say whether she was quarrelsome at those times.</p>

I belong to Mr. Jordan, I went with him to this house on the morning the woman was found dead, I believe it was on a Tuesday morning, I do not know the day, about half after nine we heard of it at our office; when I went into the house, I saw a woman that lay dead in a gore of blood, she lay on her left side.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her right arm?</p>
               <p>Jones. I cannot positively say, her leg was drawn up, there was a great quantity of blood, she was quite stone dead, quite cold.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the blood?</p>
               <p>Jones. By her face and all round.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in any other part of the room?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, round the bed: the prisoner was not at home, there were my master and I and a concourse of people, we went into the kitchen where the soldiers ammunition was kept, and I found these things, (producing a waistcoat, a pair of breeches, two pair of stockings, one pair of shoes and a hanger in a Sheath) they are bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you draw the hanger?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, it was smeer'd and there was a spot of blood upon it, it had been wiped there has nothing at all been done to it since.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, I examined the body of the woman that was killed on the 8th of March, I found a wound on the breast more than an inch long, it penetrated between the 3d and 4th rib, through the right lobe of the lungs, into what we call the cavity of the thorax.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell how deep the wound was ending in the cavity of the thorax.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harris. I traced it, I believe, about five inches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wound appear to be made by such an instrument as that dagger.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harris. It did, I found no other marks of wounds or bruises about her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that wound sufficient to occasion her death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harris. Yes, I do.</p>

               <p>All I have to say is, she struck me first, and gave me provocation, it was the effect of passion, she opened her breast several times, and dared me to do it and pulled me off the bed.</p>

I am a serjeant in the regiment, I have known the prisoner ten years; he behaved extraordinary well, in my opinion, I was with him shooting that very afternoon: we parted about a quarter before nine.

On the 16th of March last, I signed several orders for the payment of money; five in all the course of the house, is that when any bills are due and payable in the course of the day, in the morning we make out so many draughts for the sums we expect to be called for that day, upon our bankers, payable to the persons who are to bring the bills, five sell to that day, I made out the orders upon the bankers for the payment of those sums of money, and they were all put in the usual place where we keep such orders, a drawer in the compting house; the drawer is open, the book-keeper is the person that has the special charge of it, but all the clerks know where to go and take out these orders, the two orders in particular which are stated in the indictment, were made out and signed by me, one was for two hundred and thirteen pounds, the other one hundred and fifty-six pound four shillings upon Dorrien and company, these bills produced here are the very same that I

I put the draughts in the drawer, he went out soon after, the same day he sent a letter by the penny-post, which in a manner acknowledges the fact, it acknowledges having done something wrong and promises to repay the money with interest, it appears to be put in by the post mark at about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>The letter was read in court which was as follows:</p>

               <p>"As sure as I have been guilty of such</p>

On the 16th of March; the prisoner came to my house in a chaise and four, and wanted to change horses and chaise, he said, he was going to Holland in search of a sister that had been lost. His behaviour was such, as gave me a suspicion he had robbed somebody. I did not care to stop him rashly upon my own suspicion, but let him have four horses, and consulted with somebody; they agreed it was proper he should be stopped. I went afterwards and stopped him at an Inn at in Braintree, in the road to Harwich. When we took him, after some discourse, he confessed what he had done, and gave up to me, for the use of his master, three hundred gunieas, and then thirty-four more: soon after this, Sir

               <p>"Mr. Doxey</p>
               <p>"I want an iron chest: I said, I had plenty;</p>
               <p>"he said, he had some property of his own, and</p>
               <p>"others under his care, and he desired me to let</p>
               <p>"him have a very good one." I told him the one I shew'd him was a very good one, he saw it weigh'd, he a little scrupl'd my weights, but I wish, he had been half as honest as my weights, he desired me to bring it home with a bill and receipt, and gave me this card, (producing it)</p>
               <p>"Thomas and Co. Factors, No. 5 Dowgate-hill," He told me to bring it soon or he should be gone on change, a pretty figure to go on change, when I came to the house there was a little boy, I asked for Mr. Thomas, he said he was out, there was another man, his Co.</p>
               <p>"O!" says he,</p>
               <p>"you have brought the iron chest," he got men to help to get it into the house, he said Thomas was just gone out to get a bank note changed to pay for it; I wanted a little refreshment, I told him, I would go to the Three Crowns with him to get some refreshment, he said it was a bad house and bad company * and so decoyed me to the Falcon in Thames-street, there we drank together, and as I was lame, he said he would go and see if Thomas was come home and he would return to me; I stay'd three hours, then I went to the house to enquire if Thomas was come home, he said no, I asked what was come of the chest, I saw it was not in the passage; he said it was carried up stairs, Thomas came to me the next morning and said I had not left the key nor the bill, he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a bill and said he had not change enough, and asked me to change a note of seventy pound which he said was due in three days.</p>
               <p>* The Three Crowns is in sight of the house the chest was left at, the Falcon is at the other end of the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your chest again.</p>
               <p>Doxey. I traced it for a matter of three weeks, before I got it again; I searched the house for the chest but it was too late, the chest was taken away three hours before, it was taken to White Chapel, and there God Almig hty set a curse upon the cart, and would not let it go any further it broke the cart all to pieces.</p>
