Mr. Cavendish's stables, it being very dark, Johnson and Bath came up; Bath tripped me up on the left side and Johnson on the right, and I fell on my hip; I had a piece of Russia cloth under my arm; when I recovered myself, I said, what do you want? d - n your eyes, said they, your money. That expression struck me rather in a flurry. I thought it hard to be robbed in that situation, having friends not above fifty yards from me: he held something to the right side of my head which I believe to be a pistol, but it was so dark, I could not see whether it was or no and said, they would blow my brains out: they had both hold of me, and one of them put his hand into my right-hand pocket, when he put his hand into my pocket, he shook like a man that had the palsy or an ague: he took out some shillings and some half-pence, I believe, I cannot say, and the key of my box: they then said, not a word of noise! no, said I, then they ran out of the gate-way, and crossed over to the right-hand side of Oxford Road towards Swallow-Street. As soon as I got out of the gate-way, I cried out three times,</p>
               <p>"Stop robber, on the right-hand side of the way."</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your cloth all this time?</p>
               <p>Germain. No, Gray had it; I cannot say which took it up when I was down, but Gray carried it off: they all three ran off together; Gray was behind, Path and Johnson were about six yards before him: on my making the outcry, Gray dropped the cloth by a butcher's shop, the corner of Swallow-street; I took Gray at a little distance from the cloth; the cloth was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130008"/> picked up at the time I caught Gray by the breast; Bath and Johnson made their escape.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this was a very dark night?</p>
               <p>Germain. It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen any of the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Germain. I knew Johnson by fight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the other two?</p>
               <p>Germain. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively say that Bath is the other man?</p>
               <p>Germain. To the best of my opinion he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you now take upon you to swear Bath is one of the persons?</p>
               <p>Germain. He is really one of the persons.</p>
               <p>Q. From Bath. Whether as it was a very dark night, and you was in liquor, you had sufficient light to swear to us?</p>
               <p>Germain. I was not in liquor, I had been doing business in the Adelphi for my master.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in such a state that you can undertake to swear positively that Bath was one of the persons?</p>
               <p>Germain. I do.</p>

            . I live at the Green Man and Still, in Oxford Road. At about five minutes before ten at night, on the 2d of September, as near as I can guess, I was within a yard and a half of Phenix Yard, three fellows came running out of the yard, the least of whom had a bundle under his arm. I am sure the prisoners are the men; I can swear to their persons.</p>
               <p>Q. It was very dark, was it not?</p>
               <p>Williams. Not so dark but I could distinguish their persons. I am positive to them. As they were running across the road. I stood still to look at them. I could not think why three men should come out of the yard at that time of the night; in about a minute Germain came out of the yard, hollowing,</p>
               <p>"A robbery! a</p>
               <p>"robbery! a robbery! on the right hand-side</p>
               <p>"of the way." I turned round, and pursued them. I came up with the little one, (Gray) and laid hold of him. He had not the bundle then; but he had it under his arm when he passed by me. A tall thin man made a catch at the two big ones, who were about four paces before the little one. He missed them, and they got by him. I came up to the little one, just as the prosecutor got hold of him. I know nothing of the taking of the other. I heard one of the big ones say to Gray, as they ran across the road,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, make</p>
               <p>"haste, or else they will be after us."</p>
               <p>Q. From Bath. Do you know any thing of me?</p>
               <p>Williams. Yes; I know you by your having a very sharp cocked hat on, and being the first that passed by me.</p>
               <p>Q. From Johnson. Can you swear to me?</p>
               <p>Germain. Yes, by your dress. You had such a coat on as you have now; it was a loose bodied coat. I cannot swear to the colour. I can swear positively they are the men that passed by me.</p>

            . I am a constable. When Gray was in Marybone watch-house, he informed me, that Johnson and Bath were the two persons that were concerned with him in this robbery on Saturday night; that they were all three in company together; he told me, I might find them in Dyot-street, St. Giles's. I went to Dyot-street, and there I found Johnson; He told me; his name was Johnson, otherwise Dusty. I put him in a coach, and took him to the watch-house: then I went to Duck-lane, Westminster; there I took Bath, and brought him in a coach to the watch house. Gray, when before the justice, said, he hoped to be admitted an evidence, as the other men were taken by his information. Mr. Barnfather desired me to mention it in his favour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise made to him, if he discovered the other men?</p>
               <p>Elliot. No. The justices, on the contrary, said, as he was a party concerned, they could not admit him; but desired me to mention him to your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was first taken by you, did you promise him any thing?</p>
               <p>Elliot. When he was first taken, and brought to the watch-house, he denied every thing; and on the Monday following, he denied knowing any thing of the matter, till the prosecutor came, and said, he could swear positively to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130009"/> him; then he told me, if I would go with him into a room, he would tell me all he knew of the matter; it was upon that I said I, would use my utmost endeavours to get him cleared.</p>

            . I went with Barber to the prisoner's, I found there the bag, and the other things mentioned in the indictment, in the prisoner's closet. There were about fifty pounds weight of powder, in a box, two or three pounds of salt prunella, salt petre, black lead, and ivory black. I took him to a public-house. The landlord asked, if we had searched him. I then searched his waistcoat pocket, and found a pound of gunpowder. I asked him where he got it. He would give no account of it for sometime. At last, he said, he bought it for a shilling; but he would not tell of whom.</p>

He said, he would not detain me; and, before the beer was drawn, he had a glass of peppermint. In the mean time, the prisoner and Williamson came in, and asked for a pint of beer. They pushed into the bar, and sat down. There the prosecutor took out a guinea, and some silver. He paid me for the pint of beer and glass of peppermint, and then put the money again into his pocket. This was before the robbery. I then advised him to go home, and told him, one Mrs. Becket and my maid should see him home; for, in my own mind, I did not like the looks of these two men, though I said nothing.

             towards London, at about half after nine at night, in the third field from Tottenham-Court turnpike, the prisoner came up to me and stopped me first; he struck me over the breast with a pistol, and said, your money, your money. I said to him, take your pistol away and I will give you my money: he kept the pistol at my breast; in the mean time Holmes had a scuffle with the other man, and the prisoner immediately ran away: I pursued him, and he was taken in a minute; he was not ten yards from me; it was a moon-light night.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take the other man?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing when you took him?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. He said, he wanted to ease himself; I took him to the Red Lyon, in Tottenham-Court-Road, where I knew a constable lived; I charged the constable with him, and desired him to search him; there was nothing found upon him but eight-pence; the constable found the pistol in the field the next morning; (the pistol was produced in court by Saw.)</p>
               <p>- Saw. The prisoner was brought to me about a quarter before ten o'clock at night. Mr. Lloyd, whom I knew, informed me he had been stopped by a footpad, and charged me with the prisoner; I handcuffed him, and then he said, d - n your eyes now you have done your worst, you can but tuck me up. I searched him and found eight-pence upon him; he asked me to give him a pint of beer; I did, and he drank it: I then asked Mr. Lloyd where he was stopped; he said, in the third field from the turnpike: I took two men with me at three o'clock in the morning to the third field, and there I found the pistol in a water-gutter cut for the draining of water, eighty or a hundred yards out of the foot-path, towards Primrose Hill. As I was coming out of the field, I met Mr. Lloyd and three of four more with him, coming into the field; he asked me if I was come to look for the pistol; I said, yes; he said he should know it from a thousand. I then shewed it to him, and he said, that is the pistol that was at my breast.</p>
               <p>"On his cross examination, he said, that</p>
               <p>"Holmes was attacked and robbed by another</p>

I could not think that was true; because a few weeks before he was very poor in shirts, and borrowed some money of me to redeem some he had in pawn. I took hold of the bundle, and bid him come home with me: he struggled with me; but I made him go into my office, there I made him open the bundle; the first thing I took out, was a pair of thin stockings that were made a present to me at the Isle of Jersey; I never wore them above once; they are very curious; I have been told they were worth a guinea and a half: he said they were his, and asked me if I would presume to swear to them: I looked at them, and said I would. The next thing I took out was the coat I now have upon my back; I asked him if he was going to have my coat washed too.</p>

            . On the 8th of August, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, and the accomplice, Wood; when I had taken them to the Compter, I examined them separately; they confessed that they entered the house on the 7th, and took two leaden weights and some brass, and that the prisoner and Wood went afterwards, and sold it to one Hughes, for seven-pence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use any arts to obtain the confession from them?</p>
               <p>Prosser. None at all. It was taken from an uninhabited house belonging to the merchant taylors; they confessed, that on Saturday they entered the house again, and took four other leaden weights, which were sound upon Wood.</p>

This was about twelve o'clock: as soon as he was gone, I missed a stone gold ring: the prisoner returned between four and five: I watched him then, and saw him take a gold ring and a gold shirt-buckle set with garnets: after he had done this, he was going, as he pretended, to fetch the thirty-six shilling pieces; I immediately stopped him, and then he put his hand in his waistcoat pocket and dropped the ring and shirt buckle; I saw him drop them; the other gold ring I took out of his waistcoat pocket; when he was searched he had but one shilling and six-pence and a few half-pence in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this room above stairs or below stairs?</p>
               <p>Hanna. Below stairs, After I had sat down she begged I would send out for something to drink, and she would tell me what she had to say to me: I gave her a shilling; she carried it, to the door and returned immediately with the prisoner Brown; Brown returned me the shilling  and said it was a bad one, and asked me if I had any more money; I told her, I had not any more money, as I was not willing to let her know I had any gold about me; but at the same time I put my hand upon my pocket, which I believe they observed,

             came and sat down beside me, and began to use some freedoms; she laid one hand on my back and unbuttoned part of my breeches with the other; during this time, Ives sat down close on the other side; she turned the inside of my pocket out, and took from thence a shammy pocket of an old pair of breeches that I had cut out and put my money in; there were fifty-one guineas and seven half guineas: on my discovering that my pocket was turned inside out, they immediately fled out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you said something.</p>
               <p>Hanna. I had no time to say any thing; I buttoned my breeches as soon as I could and followed them to the door; there were some people at the door; I said, I had been robbed by two women that ran out at the door; a girl came up directly, and said, I lied, that I had no money to lose; and two men came up, they d - n'd me, and said, I lied, for I had no money, and they struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this girl and these men come out of the house?</p>
               <p>Hanna. I don't know; they met me at the door, they did not belong to the house, as I saw; during the hurry, a number of people came round, and a woman came and shut the door of the house I was robbed in; I did not see her, till I saw her lock the door, I laid hold of her, and said, I had been robbed in that house, and would take care of her; I had hold of her, and wrested the key out of her hand, but was soon obliged to let her go, and was glad to get away with my life. I was then advised to inform justice Sherwood's runners of it, which I did, but I believe it was of no service, for one of them, whose name is Farrell, was the pretended husband of the prisoner Brown; they took several people but not the right: I believe they had no intention to take them. On the 7th, I was informed they had sled to the house of one Mrs. M' Carty at Deptford; I hired one of justice Sherwood's runners to go with me  Deptford after them; when we came to the house, that man did not choose to go in to take them.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they taken?</p>
               <p>Hanna. The same night by one Weston, a constable, to whom I complained, and desired him to watch an opportunity to take them; there were thirty-two guineas and a half guinea found upon Brown: I was not at the finding of it.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker, I live at Holborn Bridge. About the latter end of February, I was sent for by the prisoner to the Wheelers Arms, in Cloth-Fair. I found Little with him. I have known them both about two years. When I came there, Jordan said, he had a watch to dispose of, and asked me to look at it. He told me, it was a gold watch; but, upon examining it, I found the outer case was only metal gilt. He asked what I would give for it? At first, I said, I did not case to have any concern with it. At last, it was agreed he should have what money the gold box would fetch. After having it examined at the silver smiths, I allowed him one pound eighteen shillings for it. When I came back, I brought back the metal case, they let me keep that; they said, it would be of no use to them; then I got the metal box made for a movement, intending it for my own use, and put another name over it, by way of precaution; for I acknowledge, I suspected it was stolen. I went and offered to pledge it with Mr. Pharez. Mr. Pharez took off this false piece, and began to question me about it. I said at first, I had it from Gray. But when I was before Sir

I was met in the footpath in the field by the two prisoners at the bar. I saw they had two short bludgeons in their hands; I did not much like the looks of them. I passed them; I met them near some hay-stacks; I said something low that I wished them a good evening, or something of that sort; they said something low in reply, I cannot say what; I walked pretty fast across that field; I had a great mind to run, but was afraid; I looked behind me several times going across the field, and I saw them turn up towards the hay-stacks: I came forward and walked pretty fast across that field; just as I came out into the next field there was a gateway but no gate; I saw one of them come through a gap in the hedge; he ran across the road and ran up to me, and took hold of my collar with both hands; knowing him to be one of the persons I was a good deal afraid, thinking the other man was near; I did not see the other directly; he said,</p>
               <p>"have you</p>
               <p>"got any money in your pocket?" I rather smiled and said, what do you mean by asking whether I have any money in my pocket? then he said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your blood, I will have it</p>
               <p>"before you go any further:" I told him I had got but a little in my pocket; I took my purse out of my left-hand pocket, there was a guinea and a half guinea in it; I held it out to him, and he took it; he said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your</p>
               <p>"blood, you have got a watch:" I said, yes, I had; while these words were passing, I looked over my shoulder, and saw the other man that I had seen before come out of the same gap; he came up with his stick in his hand and directly struck me over the left leg, and said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your blood;" the other then took the watch out of my pocket: the second man kept beating me over the leg; just as the first had got my watch out of my pocket, I was turning my head round, and the other that had been beating me before, hit me a blow upon the temples that brought me to the ground. I lay a little upon the ground, my senses were gone for a considerable time; I got up; after I recovered myself I found them both standing by me; they swore I had more money in my pocket; they searched my waistcoat and breeches pockets; the fellow swore all the while, and kept beating me; after that the second man that beat me, said,</p>
               <p>"d - n your</p>
               <p>"blood, why don't you go along?" the other had hold of my collar at the same time. I said, I could not go while he held me by the collar; then he let me go, and the other said,</p>
               <p>"d - n</p>
               <p>"your blood why don't you go along," and then they went away.</p>

               <p>Hillier. I took particular notice of both their faces; I always said, I should know them, if ever I should see them again.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room did you see them at Sir

            's?</p>
               <p>Hillier. I saw one of them in a back room over at the publick house; I knew him immediately; I afterwards saw him before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was that?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Bevans. I immediately charged him in the office with being one of the men that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it?</p>
               <p>Hillier. A double case silver watch; it had my own name engraved in the inside of the case, and the date of the year 1756, it had a steel chain, a seal, and a brass key.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you going from Hampstead to London, or from London to Hampstead?</p>
               <p>Hillier. I was coming from Hampstead to London?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130031"/>Q. You say you met two men, they were going then from London to Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Hillier. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed them instantly, so could have no great view of them then?</p>
               <p>Hillier. What made me take more notice of them was, I saw they had two short bludgeons.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time of night the light was not good?</p>
               <p>Hillier. It was not day-light nor dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be half after nine o'clock?</p>
               <p>Hillier. I will not swear to a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were the hay-stacks off?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Only a small distance.</p>
               <p>Q. You walked pretty fast?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance might this gateway be from the place you first met them at?</p>
               <p>Hillier. About four hundred or perhaps five hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. The men you met were behind you then as they were going a different way.</p>
               <p>Hillier. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see any thing of them?</p>
               <p>Hillier. When I got across the field.</p>
               <p>Q. You said one came out of the gap?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which that was?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Bevan.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance of time did you see the other?</p>
               <p>Hillier. In a minute, or minute and an half after.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see where that other man came from.</p>
               <p>Hillier. As near as I could see, it was the same place; I saw Bevan's coming before Jenning's some time before he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he walking or running?</p>
               <p>Hillier. A running. I did not see him till the moment he came out of the gap of the hedge.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from that gap then?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Between twenty and thirty yards, I believe.</p>

               <p>Hillier. I had given information at the office, and had attended many times to see if I knew the persons; there was one man taken up, I acquitted him, for I knew him not to be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Bevan and Jenning's were in setters?</p>

            . There had been a robbery committed the night before Bevan and Jennings were taken; they were taken the beginning of August; a man had been taken before that, who answered the description that Mr. Hilliard had given of Jennings: when Mr. Hilliard saw him, he said he was not the man; he was therefore discharged. I was at the office after the prisoners were taken; Bevan only was put to the bar. Bevan called for Jenning's; when he came, the prosecutor said he was the other man who was concerned in the robbery, and particularly, he said he was the man who beat him.</p>

               <p>Hughes. They came in cool. The prisoner took off the horses after they came back; watering and cleaning, and every thing, takes up about three quarters of an hour.</p>

               <p>Hughes. No.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to be so certain that it was the 3d of July?</p>
               <p>Hughes. Because we book every bey that goes out; I have the book here.</p>
               <p>Q. Who books it?</p>
               <p>Hughes. My mistress books it, it is put upon the slate, I carry up the slate, and she books it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was on the slate?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I believe, two horses and a saddle horse to my Lord Pomfret.</p>
               <p>Court. (inspecting the book) Is this your mistress's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I do not know whether it is my mistress's or Mr. Brown's.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing about keeping this book yourself?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gascoin. Are you clear that it was on the 3d of July?</p>
               <p>Gascoin. I am very clear of it. My Lord Pomfret came to town on the Sunday before, which was the second.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury to Hughes. Can you write?</p>
               <p>Hughes. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why are you so particular to the 3d of July, more than any other day?</p>
               <p>Hughes. Because I set it down on the slate, and it is carried up at night, and put in the book, and rubbed out of the slate.</p>
               <p>Court. At half after four they set out.</p>
               <p>Hughes. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they are an hour and quarter going to Hounslow, that brings them there about a quarter before six. When you send to Hounslow,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130033"/> how long do you allow the boy to stay there with the horses?</p>
               <p>Hughes. An hour, or an hour and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from half after four, should you not reasonably expect this young man home before nine o'clock?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, we always allow the boys four hours and a half to go to Hounslow; that is the usual time.</p>
               <p>Counsel. They do not usually come home very fast?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the carriage back?</p>
               <p>Hughes. Ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps the boys may stay some time to get something back?</p>
               <p>Hughes. As they like.</p>

               <p>Sidebotham. Yes; he had pleaded guilty just as I came in. I am sure he is the same person; he lived with Sir Watkin two years; I both hired and discharged him. On the 4th of September, just as I had finished my dinner, I was informed there was somebody upon the hay, in the hay-barn, which is a very large place, containing fifty or sixty tons of hay, it was filled but the Saturday before; we searched the barn, and in about an hour found the prisoner concealed in the hay: this was in the parish of Rhuabon, in the county of Denbigh. He said, he landed at Liverpool, and was on his journey to his father's; that he concealed himself there till night, because he was afraid to travel by day. We had him committed; and afterwards removed him to town. He was examined at Bow-street, and there he confessed that he landed at Blackwall.</p>

I went to her sister's to enquire after her; and when I returned I missed the gown. A little girl, who lives opposite, told me, she saw her go out with her apron full of things.

The prisoner laid his left-hand upon my breast, as I was not very willing to lie still, and said, if I did not lie still, he would murder me. When they had got what I had in my pocket they let me go; I immediately got up, and a watchman and I pursued him; at the King's-road-Bar, the watchman seized the prisoner; that was not more than five or six minutes after I was robbed. I was just behind, and came up upon the watchman's seizing him. I told the watchman he was the man; they took him to the watch-house; I had never seen him before; it was a star-light night; I saw enough of him before he knocked me down to observe him; I took more notice of him than I did of the other man, because he held me down.</p>
               <p>Valentine Fitzgerald. I am a watchman. Atkinson came to me that night about half past eleven; when I was about the Wheatsheaf going my rounds; he told me he had been robbed by two or three men; I pursued them, and by the turnpike I seized the prisoner. I saw at the same time, two other men going along by Bloody Bridge, but I cannot say the prisoner was in their company. Atkinson was at this time a little behind; when I came up to him, I told him, unless he could give a good account of himself, I would carry him to the round-house. Atkinson at this time came up, and said, watchman, that is one of the men who robbed me; I asked him if he was sure of it; he said, I am certain; upon which I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. From the Jury. Did Atkinson appear to be sober?</p>

I went to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130042"/> door, and putting my hand into my pocket, I missed all my money.

The Turk's Head in Dyot-Street is a very bad house; if I had not been an officer and a neighbour, it would have been impossible to have got her out.</p>

Upon the 30th of June, about nine in the morning, I went to the Cock alehouse for a pint of beer; a person informed me, that he knew of some coiners; and if I would call upon him at two or three in the afternoon, he would shew me the house they were at work at. I went accordingly about half after two; Files and Symmonds went with me; we went to this house; the street-door was open; we went up two pair of stairs; I peeped in at a little crack under the door, and saw a soldier sitting on the bed, with a jacket on; and then with an iron crow we burst the door open. The prisoner immediately jumped out of the window, and the soldier after him. I immediately jumped out after them, on to a lead at the one pair of stairs, and from thence into the street. The prisoner ran away, but I pursued him, and called stop thief. After he had ran about a quarter of a mile, he was stopped, and brought to me. The soldier was taken in a smith's shop he had broke into through the tiles. I searched Yardley, and found in his pocket eleven good shillings (producing them); I have had them ever since; they are what they call the paterns.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner two or three years. I went with Gregory and Files, upon the 30th of June, between three and four in the afternoon, to this house. We called to them to open the door; but they refused; so we broke it open. I saw the prisoner and Taylor jump out of the window, and Gregory go after them. I staid in the room: I saw a crucible on the fire with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130043"/> some metal in it. I took it off with the tongs, and cooled it in water. I cannot say whether it was metal or drugs; but it was in a liquid state. I found some bad shillings on a table in the right-hand-side of the room; and we found a quantity of instruments and boxes in the room, (producing them). Before we broke the door open, I looked under, and saw the prisoner come from behind a rugg which hung before the fire; the prisoner was in his waistcoat, with his shirt sleeves tucked up; and Taylor was upon the bed, without his coat.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner and the evidence before Justice Sherwood, I believe the morning after they were taken. The things found in the house were produced before the justice. I think I can swear this Dutch stove and drawer were produced there. I cannot swear to the rest of the things, because I have not had them in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who produced them?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Files, Symmonds, and Gregory.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the instruments, and tell my lord and the jury for what use they are designed?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Here are what they call in the trade flasks. They fill them with sand; and whatever is meant to be cast, they make the impression of it with the patterns in the sand; and the metal is poured through the pipes at the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain how the impression is made upon the sand, and how retained?</p>
               <p>Clarke. The sand is made damp, and becomes hard, and of a solid body; then they put what they call facing over it, which is a kind of finer sand, which closes the pores of the sand, and prevents it leaving any marks upon the metal.</p>
               <p>Q. How do they make the impression of the shilling in the sand after it is faced?</p>
               <p>Clarke. They put a shilling in, and force it down; when they take it away, it leaves the impression; it is pressed down with screws; the moulds are put together, and the metal is poured in at the iron pipes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they make more than one at a time?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes; a hundred, if the moulds are big enough. This mould, if full, would make thirty-six.</p>
               <p>Q. From the prisoner. Whether these things are not fit for any founders business, or any thing of that kind?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No; they are not fit for a founder's business; they may be used to cast small gold and silver things, as buttons, stay-hooks, earrings, and such things.</p>
               <p>Q. To Symmonds. Where did you find the counterfeit shillings?</p>
               <p>Symmonds. On the table in the prisoner's room. There were two tables in the room. They were on the table on the right-hand-side.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner half a year and better; he lived in Castle-street, Whitechapel, I was apprehended on the 30th of June, I was in the prisoner's room up two pair of stairs; the prisoner took the room by the week.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the prisoner did in that room?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you do any thing on the 30th of June?</p>
               <p>Taylor. We did nothing that day; the counterfeit shillings were on the table; the prisoner cast them with these moulds.</p>

               <p>Q. What was to have been done with them next, in case you had not been interrupted?</p>
               <p>Taylor. To be brought to their colour, by putting them into a liquid, either vitriol or aqua fortis, (producing some of each) which fluxes the silver, to that the silver is forced on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what metal they are made of?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Silver and copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Will the putting them in this liquid make them white, fit to put off?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What proportion of silver and copper?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Half silver and half copper.</p>

               <p>Q. to Clarke. Have you ever seen that experiment tried?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Yes, I have tried it, by taking one of these counterfeit shillings, or any metal that is part silver, put it in the fire and make it a dark red, and then put it in aqua fortis and water it forces the silver it on the outside; one might do 500 in an hour, put a quantity on a red hot iron and when they begin to be red, put them into the vitriol and water, or aqua fortis, and in less then half a minute it has that effect. I suppose if there is an ounce of copper and but three quarters of an ounce of silver it will do it, but it will not wear so long before it becomes brassy, as when there is half and half.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with this money?</p>

Upon the 16th of July at half after ten at night, as I was going home to my lodgings, I passed by several girls, the prisoner took hold of my cloaths and insisted upon my giving her something to drink; I thought I would give her some beer; I went into a house in a street near <placeName id="t17750913-74-crimeloc339">Bishopsgate</placeName>

               <p>Maltizue. Yes, as sober as I am at present; after she had locked the door, a person came and knocked, I believe it was a woman, and I think the prisoner said, make haste, and then I saw a woman come and put her hand through the window, and take the watch; I attempted to pursue her, but the prisoner held me first, by my cloaths, and then by my legs, till she made her escape; when I had got loose, I went out of the window into the garden after her, and the prisoner threw my hat after me, I never heard of my watch again; I got an officer directly, but could not find the prisoner; the officer took her on Tuesday morning.</p>

I seized him immediately, he pulled the handkerchief out of his bosom and threw it on the ground. I held him with one hand and took the handkerchief up with the other. Watkins swore to the handkerchief before the Aldermen and was bound over to prosecute.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his Defence, but called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

Upon the 19th of July, I had been in the city, when I came to my lodgings, upon the 20th at one in the morning, I found it locked up. I had been drinking a little, but I was sober enough to know any thing that passed. I had not a mind to disturb the family, therefore I went out to look for a lodging elsewhere. I went into the Coach and horses, a public house, in Marrigold-Court. I called for a pint of beer and enquired for a lodging, I could not get one there. I am positive that at that time I had nine shillings and six-pence in my pocket. The two prisoners were then sitting in the next box to me. As I could not get a bed in that house, they said they would shew me an honest house, where I might get a bed for a shilling. I paid for my beer, and went out with them. I had not got a dozen yards in the street, before they both got hold of my arm, one on each side. Ann Green put her hand in my waistcoat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130050"/> pocket, where I had a key and nine shillings. She took out of it the key and the nine shillings. While she was so doing, and I was struggling with her, the other picked my pocket of my watch. Then they both ran away. I was afraid to call out, supposing there might be some bullys by them; therefore I went back to the house. I heard from the master of the house where I was likely to find

            . I am a patrole. Coming down the Strand, between Exeter-Change and Marygold-Court, I saw the two prisoners and Riley in the Strand. This was about one o'clock in the morning. They had him one in each arm. They passed me very peaceably and quietly, and so I took no notice of them. In five minutes he came back again, and said, he had been robbed. I saw nobody at that time in the street, except the prisoners and the prosecutor.</p>

I kept the two prisoners for some in Somerset-street, at their desire, and the request of my wife, who had known them. They were in great distress. One of them I put into work. I was about to return to my own house in Chandlers-street. I sent them to clean the lodgings, and get them ready. They went about the 20th of December. Upon the 22d, they desired to take their dinner in Chandlers-street. They took a dinner with them. They promised to be at home about four o'clock. When I came home between six and seven, I found they were not returned. This alarmed me. I enquired about it, and discovered that I had been robbed. I could not hear of them, till the 17th of July last, when Susanah Clarke surrendered herself up, and told where the other prisoner was, and where these things were to be found, in consequence of her information I did find them.</p>

            . Both the prisoners lodged together in a garret. When I went to them in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130051"/> morning, they were both in bed. They desired me to pawn this gown, and let them have one of mine out of pawn, which was cheaper. They declared it was their own gown. I pawned it for them at Careless's for nine shillings, and brought them the duplicate and the money.</p>
               <p>Susanah Devis. I missed these things just before Christmas, about three days before I saw the two prisoners; for the last time I saw these things, there was no one else in the house, but these two girls. Within these six weeks, Susanah Clarke came, and surrendered herself, begged for money, and said, she would tell me where to find all my things, and where the other prisoner was. She did discover the other prisoner, who was taken up accordingly, and these things were found. When she was taken up she behaved saucy. I have known them two or three years. I had taken them out of the Magdalen house.

I lay over the way, I went the next morning to my aunt's lodging, I saw the box burning in the garret, both the prisoners were there. I knew it to be the same box by the pieces.

They sat down by the fire and had some gin and two threepenny worths of rum and water. She was above an hour in the house. I am sure she is the same woman. I was busy at the bar, she asked me to give her change for a guinea and take the reckoning. I took the guinea and weighed it, it was a very good one, she then said, she believed she had silver enough to pay without changing. I gave her the guinea again and she put it in her mouth. As I was busy I turned my head, and then she said she should want change before she got home and desired I would give her change. She gave me a guinea, I thought it was the same and gave her change, and she went away directly; when she was gone, I thought it felt light and I weighed it and found it was a bad one. I went after her but could not find her and I never met with her till last July, then I took her up. The counterfeit weighs about twelve shillings.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>On Saturday morning the 16th, about nine o'clock the judges Gould, Ashurst, and Hotham having taken their places, the prisoner was ordered to the bar.</p>
               <p>After the court had been opened in the usual form, Mr. Davenport, as leading counsel for the prisoner, begged leave to be heard in her favour, why she ought not legally to be put on her trial, after having been admitted before the justices, king's evidence. - He spoke a considerable time, and was well attended to by the court at In taking a general view of the question however, he was requested by Mr. Bearcroft (one of the opposite counsel) to narrow his arguments, to the statement of particular facts, when he said, it would appear the prisoner had not acted conformably to her character as king's evidence, in not diselosing the whole of what she knew. Mr. Davenport adopted this scheme, and observed, she was aware this would be urged, but said in her defence, that she thought herself sufficiently justified in answering the particular questions put to her, that the prosecutors were present the whole time of her examination, who, if they were not satisfied with her answers, were at liberty to propose five the matter to her, which they did not, and that, in fact, she was treated through every stage of the business to all intents and purposes, as a king's evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cooper, on the same side, began, by observing that he would not dispute the authority of the King's Bench in refusing the prisoner at the bar to bail, yet he thought the disclosure she made before the magistrates of all questions put to her, admitted her, in full, to that protection which the law holds out to all accomplices making such a confession, that it was impossible to say what evidence she gave before the Grand Jury, who might have examined her to any particulars that they thought proper; that when admitted to bail she did not attempt to forfeit it, that she was in waiting at the trial of the Perreaus, and who could say on that trial she would have denied any part of the questions relative to the whole of such forgeries, as she knew of? He concluded therefore, that the admitting her a king's evidence in this case, was no more than a legal and liberal construction of the doctrine of approvers and, consequently it concerned the delivery and honour of the criminal courts of justice, as well from the fact as from repeated precedents, to defend her from a prosecution. In this last case, he appealed to his own feelings, in saying he did not plead alone for her sake, but for the sake of public justice.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's two informations, on oath, of the 15th and 17th of March, which she made before the justices in Bow-street, at the time of her being bailed, were then read - the first describing the manner of R. Perreau's solicitation for her signing a bond on Mr. Adair for 7500 l. - The second D. Perreau's violent threats, with a penknife held to her throat to force her to it.</p>


               <p>Mr. Bearcroft as counsel for the prosecution, then rose, and began with observing that he was not at all aware of any argument being used on the legality of the prisoner's trial; but since that ground was taken, he would speak to it; he very humanely observed, that at the same time he could wish to be thought no otherwise concerned in this business than to clear the fact, as well as he was able, in point of law; in his opinion, and he was certain he spoke correctly - that excepting the prisoner, from a trial, in consequence of the kind of evidence she gave before the Magistrates in Bow-street, was neither justified by the statutes or common law. He then slightly entered into the doctrine of approvers, as well as the statutes founded on them, which he said, did not at all describe the prisoner as entitled to their protection. To strengthen this he instanced a case which fell under his own knowledge, of an accomplice being admitted a king's evidence, yet, it appearing upon his testimony in court, that he prevaricated, he was taken into custody, ordered to be indicted, was afterwards tried, and convicted; that in the present case, the prisoner only gave evidence of one bond with an intent to defraud the Mess. Drummonds of 7500 l. whereas they meant to try her on two other bonds which she had not confessed, and which consequently deprived her of the benefit of king's evidence. He illustrated the propriety of this argument by a supposed case of two highwaymen, one of whom turned king's evidence, but afterwards committed another robbery. Surely, says he, in this instance, though<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130016"/> the first confession exculpates him from the first offence, it does not from the second. He finally observed, that the prisoner had been repeatedly asked whether she knew of any other bond, to which she answered in the negative; which evidently proved she was not in earnest in her evidence, and consequently was not entitled to the benefit of a full confession.</p>
               <p>He was followed by Mr. Lucas, who said, he would not detain the court after the matter had been so fully gone into by Mr. Bearcroft; he would only add one observation, which was, that it appeared before the King's Bench. that the affidavits of the justices expressed it was on the condition, and under the supposition of the prisoners declaring the whole truth, they admitted her to bail.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howarth on the same side observed, amongst other matters, that the prisoner's evidence on the bond of 7500 l. instead of being relied on, fully exculpated her, because under the threats of being put to death, (as was stated in her information): her signing it could be no crime. Considering her case at large, he could see no legal objection to her pleading to the indictment; as to any allusions to mercy, he could not think they were proper in that court, as the power of dispensing it were lodged elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davenport replied, by observing, that all the prisoner knew was by way of question, which she particularly answered; that the design of her turning king's evidence was already fully answered by a conviction of the parties; and though she was not brought in an evidence against them, it was not her fault - she was in earnest, and willing (though, says he, I will not say in this case desirous) of doing public justice. Has she not been at liberty to make her escape? Were not the prosecutors all present, whose business it was to fist this matter to the bottom, and do they now charge her with a single prevarication? He likewise observed, whatever stress might be laid on the other bonds, for which her prosecutors meant to try herd that they were all connected in the same business, and public justice had already been satisfied, in the conviction of the unfortunate parties:</p>
               <p>"I will not say these bonds are on the same sheet of paper, but surely they are of the same parties; and shall she, who, on the fullest examination before the magistrates was thought to be the least guilty, be now place in the greatest danger."</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice GOULD's Argument.</p>
               <p>As to what passed in the Court of King's-Bench on this subject, it bears little, if any relation to what is now properly and peculiarly under the cognizance of this court. The circumstances then attending the prisoner's confinement, were very different to what is now the subject of consideration. To the point of resting or deciding the propriety and legality of putting the prisoner on her trial, it is out of the question. The near approach of he sessions, or any other circumstance of a similar nature, might have induced that court to refuse admitting the prisoner to bail; but it is not my business to enquire into the motives for remanding her. It is enough for me to lay down the law, with all possible impartiality. and to the best of my skill.</p>
               <p>The power this court is about to exercise, is most clearly founded in discretion, and not directly authorized by any provision strictly, at least literally, legal: but that, however, does not take off from the competency of it; for it is only the justices of jail delivery that can properly have cognizance, whether this woman is, or is not, to be tried. This matter can not be taken out of this court: it is here only, therefore, that the point can be judicially determined. I must first observe, that the legislature have established a very close correspondence between the justices or magistrates, and the justices of jail delivery; and I think with exceeding good reason; for if justices of the peace were not invested with several important powers, the execution of criminal justice must soon totally fail; but white I would willingly intrust them with every power that might promise to promote the furtherance of justice, I should be sorry to indulge them with a privilege which, from the very nature of it; would be so liable to abuse, that of substituting verbal testimony, instead of written, which would most undoubtedly happen, if we permitted any notice of what had passed in Bow-street, different or contradictory to the written evidence now before the court. It is only the latter that carries about it the stamp of authority; and it is only that we are now obliged to take the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130017"/> least notice of, I shall only add, on this head, that the statutes made since the revolution, for vesting the justices with the power of promising pardon to persons convicting their accomplices, takes notice in the preamble, that the law was passed in affirmance of an usage then existing, and was meant to correct an abuse, which had gradually prevailed, that of its being in the power of one justice to admit accomplices, and at other times getting a second justice to lend his name, and sign it, though he was not present at the transaction he thus took upon him to approve of. Those statutes I have alluded to, were first enacted with a view likewise of strengthening the hands of the inferior magistracy, and arming them with powers suited and necessary to the effectual discharge of their office. The first act passed, was that of the fourth and fifth of William and Mary, relative to robbers: this enables the justices to admit accomplices, and to promise to pardon them, on the condition of convicting two. By the tenth and eleventh of William, this is extended to house-breaking and horse-stealing; and still farther extended, the fifth of Anne, to burglary, or the felonious breaking open a house in the day-time. The first of those was found deficient, as it was confined to a certain species of crimes; so was the second, as it held out no encouragement; and even the last is manifestly wanting, though it extends to persons as well in as out of prison, as it annexes a most extraordinary condition, that of convicting two or more, like the two preceding. Yet none of those acts answered the purposes they were intended to effectuate: It has been therefore, the practice of almost a century to permit justices of the peace to admit persons, guilty of capital offences, to convict their accomplices, under a promise of pardon, which has always been faithfully and punctually fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Such a discretionary power is indispensibly necessary to the true administration of criminal justice. It is analogous to the power created by the statutes, but more compleat; it is suited to the spirit and genius of our laws, and it is finally built on the ancient principles of the common law relative to approvers. The matter, I take it, is not a fit or proper subject for subtle or fine-spun arguments, and abstract deductions; but is the law of approvers has been so much the subject of enquiry, let us turn our attention a little that way. An approver could not be admitted without the consent of the court, his admission was clearly a matter of grace; but if he once convicted the person he approved, his pardon was not a matter of favour, but of right; that he must be indicted, and that he must make a full and entire confession of every thing he knew, as well relative to the indictment as every other crime of which he was guilty; yet it is laid down in Rastall's Entries, and in books of the first authority, that an approver was not obliged to give evidence of any other crime but that for which he stood indicted; nay, that if he did, the person approved was not obliged to answer; or if absent, was not liable to any of the consequences. Coke is of the same opinion; and has laid down the same doctrine more than twice or three times. The trial by battle, which made part of the law of approvers, was most absurd, where the issue of right was tried by the strength of the arm. It proceeded on the extraordinary idea, that providence always interposed and uniformly decided in favour of the person who had the most righteous cause This barbarous institution fell with the superstition which gave it birth, and the law of approvers gradually fell into disuse. It was found necessary, however, to substitute something in its place. We accordingly find, so early as the year 1660, the 12th of

             the second, that this point was beginning to be settled Lord Hale refers to a case where a man had informed against his accomplices, and was admitted under the spirit and sanction of the law of approvers (He has laid it down page 303 and 305, and observes, that Keeling, chief justice, and Wilde recorder, both well versed in the usages relative to criminal prosecutions carried on at the Old Bailey, were of the same opinion. Were it otherwise, if people were compelled to give evidence, or invited to give it, and afterwards be liable to be convicted and suffer, on the ground of their own confession, it would be terrible indeed! it would be treachery in the extreme, and worse than the suspended sword of Damocles. The person is invited, he shall do so and so, upon such and such conditions; he shall be pardoned when he does it, yet when he has done every thing he promised, or offered to do, he is forsooth told,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130018"/> that such a promise was not strictly legal, or warranted by law. Lord Hale is however of a different opinion, so is Hawkins. But what is urged to day by some of the council? we wave, say they, the criminal charge in which she was admitted, but as she did not disclose all she knew, we will put her to answer on her trial for another offence. Now how is it possible for this court to judicially take cognizance of any circumstance, which can impeach the prisoner's veracity? there lies the difficulty; because, if we admit the charge, we in fact, take the premises for granted, and forejudge the culprit, before it is possible we can judicially know any thing of her guilt. I need not repeat what is so well known. It is the practice of every day, and has been established for more than a century. It has been much insisted, that the pardon, by any construction, cannot be made to extend further than the bond tendered the Drummonds. Does this court, I repeat, know any thing of any other? If indeed she had been examined, or had said a single word; if she had prevaricated or contradicted what she had sworn before the justices, when she came to be examined on the trial of the accomplices, there might be some pretence. If a person indeed gives a false account, the case may be totally altered; but here no such charge has, or can be made. For these reasons, founded in the spirit and genius of the common law, and the prosessed intention of the statutes enacted for convicting offenders, it is plain a great latitude has been allowed, controulable only by the nature of the terms and conditions. Those should be punctually performed and strictly fulfilled on both sides. The distinction about different felonies is, in my opinion, a very false one. The idea is taken up on the act of the 4th and 5th of William and Mary; but in that of

             the encouragement is indiscriminately extended to every other species of robbery and burglary, which plainly points out that the pardon was meant to be as general as the description. This usage is founded in good policy, and experience has taught us the wisdom of it. It has been the uniform practice of a century, and I hope will continue to be so for many more.</p>
               <p>A question may arise, and the contrary idea was suggested by one of the counsel (Mr. Howarth) whether we have a right or discretionary power to discharge the prisoner, should my two learned brothers agree with me in opinion? All I can answer to this is, that her pardon must follow a refusal to put her on her trial, of course. It will be said, perhaps, that the power is but a negative one. So, I suppose, are several we exercise under the authority of an act of parliament; but that does not make them the less valid. If, for instance, an accomplice under the statute was put on his trial, I know of no plea, strictly, he could put in to stop proceedings, without having a pardon to produce. It must, in that case be the discretion of the court, as it is in the present, the latter not strictly authorising either.</p>
               <p>It has been warmly urged in argument, that supposing the prisoner to have told the truth on her examination before the justices, yet as her depositions related only to the bond for 7,500 l. she is still liable to be tried for any other offence for which she might be indicted; but I believe that principle will never be admitted as law, considering the constant notorious usage to the contrary. I perceive the gentlemen have laboured this point with all possible ingenuity; and I perceive too, they have failed to produce a single precedent in support of it. One of them (Mr. Bearcroft) has, it is true, quoted a case, but it does not reach the present; and if it did, would be the strongest arguments to prove the soundness of the doctrines insisted on by the gentlemen on the other side. I remember the case alluded to extremely well, as it was I who tried the criminal, and it was shortly this: A person who was admitted under the statute, was brought to convict his accomplices; what was the consequence? - he contradicted or reversed on the trial every syllable he had sworn when he was admitted an evidence before the magistrates. He thought as he had saved himself, he would now save his accomplices. The whole court, struck with the apparent profligacy and audacity of the fellow, cried out for justice. He was accordingly put on his trial, and convicted. Even on that occasion, however flagrant the conduct of the culprit might be, he was put to answer no offence which brought after it a more severe punishment than what he was liable to suffer on the evidence arising on his own testimony in open court; for his contradicting himself was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177509130019"/> gross perjury, for which he was liable to be indicted and transported, and the offence which was actually tried, authorized no higher punishment.</p>
               <p>The same gentleman who alluded to the above matter as a precedent in point, seemed to insist with a considerable deal of force, that supposing the magistrates to have the power contended for, by a kind of discretion supported by analogy to the legal powers created by the statutes; yet those discretionary powers should be exercised in some what a similar manner. I grant the rule to be a very just one; but I suspect he will find, that the argument will admit of a deduction, expressly contrary to that he has drawn from it. He will find, that the very powers created by the statutes are exercised in a manner very different from their strict legal import. For instance, he will find that the three statutes of William and of

             all require the conviction of two accomplices. He will find, that they are confined to certain particular species of felony. What found then would it have in a court of justice, this time of day, to tell a person, after that he had done all that was required of him,</p>
               <p>"You shall be now hanged, you have only convicted one accomplice, or you have been found guilty of stealing at night, of robbing, or of stealing in the day time, according to the circumstances of the case?" This then will bring us to the clear found principle, whether the justices have not a discretionary power to admit, not founded on the statutes but analogous to them, and that even when they do act under the form of the statutes, they do not almost always find themselves obliged to resort to that discretionary power, in order to carry the statutes themselves into effectual execution, which without this power would be little more than waste paper.</p>
               <p>On the whole then, I must repeat again, the justices of jail delivery have always found it necessary to recognize this discretion, as exercised by the magistrates. It now forms a part of the criminal justice of the nation; wisdom and experience has taught its great utility; I cannot, therefore, for my part, depart from it on the present occasion; and should my brethren agree with me in opinion, I shall consequently refuse to put the prisoner on her trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice ASHURST.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Rudd is now before this court, in order to answer to an indictment on a charge of forgery, and, in my opinion, is very properly and legally called upon to make her defence. I am very sorry to differ in opinion from my learned brother, whose learning and abilities no man esteems more; but I cannot help retaining the same sentiments I did, when I joined with the rest of my brethren in the unanimous opinion of the Court of King's Bench, that she was entitled to no benefit beyond the extent of her own discoveries. I know of no strict legal right she had at all to be admitted, much less to be admitted in a manner and on conditions unknown to the parties before whom she appeared. She, at the time of her examination, was conjured to relate all the facts that came within her knowledge. She has not done this. In my opinion, therefore, if she has failed in the conditions annexed to the implied pardon; she has of course, by that act, forfeited any claim or title to it.</p>
               <p>But supposing that the facts were otherwise, I cannot see how this discretionary power, exercised by the Justices, can be set up as a strict legal defence, nor how it can be pleaded in bar of an indictment on an offence created by an express act of parliament. On the contrary, if justice be the thing to be fought, if the laws are meant to be fairly enforced, and equitably executed, for the general benefit of the public, and the particular protection of the prisoner, I think the only best method to obtain these ends, will be to put the prisoner on her trial.</p>
               <p>She said, she knew nothing relative to any other forgery. It has since come out that she did. - If she did not, she runs no risque in being put on her trial; if she did, and concealed it, I can by no means think her intitled to the benefits she would have a right certainly to claim, on the ground of a full and fair disclosure of every thing she knew.</p>
               <p>If my other learned brother should unite in opinion with me, the trial will of course come on; but I do not mean to hurry it. It is a matter of weighty and important consideration; as such, therefore, I should gladly, for my part, have the point of law referred to the opinion of the twelve judges, and Mrs. Rudd remanded back to prison.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>However affected my feelings may be, in a situation which necessarily obliges me to determine, whether the prisoner shall, or shall not, be put on her trial for her life; or whatever impression the arguments of my learned brother, who spoke first, and to whose opinion I am willing to pay all possible deference, might have made on me, I am perfectly satisfied in conscience, that Mrs. Rudd ought to be put on her trial. The point, of law, in my opinion, neither rests on the law of approvers, nor on the statutes. And farther, I cannot conceive, that an examination before the justices is a full and perfect admission; on the contrary, as it is entirely on the consideration of a full and fair disclosure, which is only to be gathered at the trial of the accomplices, I shall ever think that it is in the power of this court ultimately to refuse, if in the mean time any discovery should be made, in proof, that the discoverer against his or her accomplices had not made a fair disclosure of all they knew. They are bound in honour on both sides, or on neither: the engagement, whether discretionary or by statute, is reciprocal. I am therefore clearly of opinion, that the prisoner cannot, with justice, be now tried on the first indictment; but I have no conception, that a prisoner going before a justice of the peace to discover his accomplices, and sinking one material fact, does not thereby preclude himself from all benefit or favour he might be otherwise entitled to. On the whole, however, for the same reason assigned by my learned brother who spoke last, I join in opinion, that the prisoner be remanded in order that the rest of the judges may be consulted.</p>
