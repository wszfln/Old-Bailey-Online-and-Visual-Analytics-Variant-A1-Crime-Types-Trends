            . Last Thursday night, I received a guinea wages of Mrs. Dabbs, my mistress, I had changed the guinea at the Rose, in Rose-court; and put 20 s. into my handkerchief, going by Bishop's-gate church I met the prisoner; I ask'd her if she could tell me of a lodging; she said she could not just then, but if I would go and give her a dram, she would consider and tell me; I went and gave her a dram; I don't know the house, it was betwixt nine and ten o'clock at night. After that she asked me to go with her to Pump Court in Gravel-lane, where she lodged, so I went with her; when we came into the court she asked for another dram, and I told her I had rather give her a shilling to buy a breakfast in the morning; she had a desire for a dram, so I went with her to the Ship in Gravel-lane, and gave her one there. Before I went in I had my money in my pocket in a handkerchief and my hand in my pocket also; going to put my hand into my pocket in the house, she said, you have halfpence in the other pocket; she saw me change sixpence for a dram; then I paid for it, and we went into <placeName id="t17530221-6-crimeloc27">Pump Court</placeName>

As we stood talking together I thought something pulled my pocket, but did not apprehend she was picking my pocket. When she did not come according to her promise, I put my hand into my pocket, and the handkerchief, with the money in it, was gone. I went to look about to see where I must go, as she had given me the slip; she was got into a passage about two yards from me in the court; she told me she was going up two pair of stairs; I went to the sign of the Ship and asked the landlady whether she knew the woman that was drinking with me, then her husband and brother came in, who said they would go and see for her; they went, and returned again in about half an hour, and told me they had found her. I went along with them, and told them that was the very woman, but she had changed her dress.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a dress had she when she pick'd your pocket?</p>
               <p>E. Hunter. She had a sort of a jacket, a black hat, and a blue cloak. When she was taken she had on a blue flowered gown and a camblet one upon that. This was a little above half an hour after I had lost my money. She was taken to the watch-house. Before she was taken from the alehouse the landlady of the Ship came and said she could swear that was the woman that I treated with a dram at the bar at her house. I was ordered to strip her at the watch-house, so I took her pocket off and there were 13 s. 6 d. in it. I was in nobody's company but her's till I found the money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go with a woman you never saw before to a lodging?</p>
               <p>E. Hunter. Because I had no acquaintance at that end of the town.</p>

             came to our house last Thursday night, and had each of them a dram. I had never seen E. Hunter before, it was a little after nine. E. Hunter went to seel in her right hand pocket. and the other said, you have money in the other pocket; then she took the halfpence and laid them down, I took a penny of it, and the prisoner returned a halfpenny to E. Hunter. About a quarter of an hour after that E. Hunter came again, and asked me if I knew the person that had a dram there with her; I said I did by sight, and that I had seen her before; then she told me she had robbed her of 20 s. tied up in a handkerchief, and that it was all she had; then I desired my servant to go out and see if he could find her; he returned and said he could not find her; then my husband and my brother came in, and they went with E. Hunter to see the place where she had left her, they found her at the Angel, at the bottom of Deoonshire steps by the square; then my husband sent for me, so I went, and knew the woman to be the same that was at my house with E. Hunter. Then the watch was charged with her. When she was at my house she had an old blue cloak on, and when she was at the alehouse she had a linnen bed gown on under that she has on now.</p>

I was at the White Hind alehouse in Bishopsgate-street last Monday morning was a month, there were the prisoner and two others, who had a sack with this funnel in it. I wanted to see what was in the sack. As they were swearing and making a dispute, saying, they would go and sell the funnel, I asked him what he had in the sack; he said nothing but bread and cheese. I saw the prisoner take it out and hide it under the bench; I took it up and secured him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175302210006"/> He first said he would give it me if I would let him go; then he went with me and shewed me the prosecutor's house, and said he took it from thence. I never saw the prisoner before as I remember.</p>

I gave him the same answer again, and said, as sure as I had it under my arm I'd carry it home to my father; then he came to the Haycock in Devils-lane, and said it was money he wanted and money he must have; I answered the same as before; then he pulled his razor out of his pocket, and put the handle of it to the back part of my neck, then he put the back part of it to the back part of my neck; I thought he had cut me; so I put my hand to feel; then he took me by the chin, and drew the edge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175302210007"/> of the razor along my throat, and said, we cut them so at our house when we shave them; then I ran to the gate just by the Haycock (I bled much) and he ran after me; I went to hollow out to a man or woman which I saw, I know not which, in a field where were two horses, but nobody came to me; then he put his thumb on one side my mouth and finger on the other, to prevent my calling out; then he laid me on the back of the haycock, and pulled hay out of the haycock, and covered me over and bid me lie there till he came back from Holloway, and he'd go and borrow me a crown or six shillings, and bid me say it was somebody else; I told him I would for fear he should do any thing else to me; then he went away. A little while after I heard some drovers coming along; so I got up and told them; then they went after the prisoner and took him. I was not along with them; I was sent to the hospital with my wound.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they took him?</p>
               <p>Dennis. Because when Dr. Coleman was going to sew my wound up he shewed a large scar on his throat; the people came and said he was taken. I carried my money home, which was 7 s. 8 d. farthing.</p>

               <p>Thomas Lake. I keep an optical shop in Leaden-hall-street. I was in the shop, and heard the cry stop thief! between 5 and 6 o'clock on the 14th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175302210008"/> of Jan. and saw the prisoner run by my shop door from a gentleman that was without a hat; I said to the gentleman, what, have you been robbed of? he said, a hat. I pursued the prisoner and took him in Fenchurch Buildings, another witness then followed me, and we found this hat under the prisoner's coat ; (produced in court); we brought the prisoner to the gentleman without his hat; he desired me to give him the hat, saying, it was his hat, which I did. This was Mr. Fanandus ; there came another Jew behind him, and they whispered together; then the gentleman gave the prisoner the hat again, and said it was none of his hat, but still he kept pulling it at several times to take it out of my hand; I charged the constable with the prisoner; then the person that should have been the prosecutor laid hold on the prisoner, and would not let me have him away; then the prisoner said he was going to carry the hat to be cleaned, and that it was his brother's hat.</p>

From thence we went into Field-lane, to Mrs. Ridge, and she bought the other two pair for three shillings; we asked her half a crown a pair; I never knew her before, she trades in women's cloaths. Then we went to Mrs. Pearce who lives two or three doors from the other, and asked her if she would buy any silk stockings, and she desired to see them, so we went to our room and fetched 4 pair, which she bought of us at 2 s. a pair; we asked her three; as we went out of her shop Mrs. Ridge called us to her, and asked us if we had any more stockings to sell, and said if we would bring them she would buy them; so we went with some, and she was to give us a shilling a pair; then we went and fetched more; we carried at the last time 14 pair; in the whole we carried 40 pair; she paid us 6 s. and was to give us 32 or 13 s. more.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175302210009"/> She bid us come o n the next Sunday, so we did and she said us 3 s. then she bid us come the next Sunday, we went, and she, paid us 5 s. we bought two handkerchiefs of her, which in the whole came to 7 s. 6 d. we went to Mrs. Pearce's the same day that we carried the 40 pair to the other; we wanted to know if she would buy any more, and she said we might bring them down that she might look at them, so we carried 20 pair, and she said she did not know what to do with them. We desired her to lend us 20 s. upon them, which she did, and desired we'd fetch them away as soon as we could; we told her we would as soon as we found any body that would give us more.

             . On the first of this month there came a parcel up by the Towcester waggon, which unloads every Thursday morning about four or five o'clock in Newgate-Market; the bag was in the bill of lading, and the bag was missing after it was unloaded, it was directed to Mr. John Hookham in liread street . After I had an answer to a letter that I sent into the country about it, I advertised it 3 guineas reward twice, and at another time 10. The first information I had was from one Mr. Price, who had stopped one pair of them. The boy was taken up, and I was present when he owned that he took this bag of stockings from under the waggon, and he said there was a bag of halfpence which he could not carry, or he had taken them (there was a bag at that time with 3 l. 10 s. in halfpence in it) he said he carried it to the house of Moor, and opened them, and burned two pocket books that he took out of the parcel, and had an apron made of the cloth they were in. I saw that.</p>

Catharine Taylor brought two pair of silk stockings to me to pawn on the 12th of this instant; I asked her how she came by them ; she said she bought them for her husband's and her own use in Chick Lane last summer, and that she gave 16 s. a pair for them ; I asked her where she lived; she said in Field Lane, and kept a cloaths shop ; I told her there had been some stockings advertised, and it was not improbable but these might be part of them, but I would look into the advertisement and send for the persons, and if they were not part of them, then she should have them safe again; she seemed to be in a great hurry to be gone, and said she had left her shop alone, so she went away and came no more. Then I advertised them (the stockings produced in court) I found she lived where she said, and I directed the prosecutor to her.</p>

(He names them all over.) They were all in the room when I went out that morning. Upon missing the things I called my landlord up, who saw the box was broke open. I never saw the prisoner afterwards, till I saw him in New Prison taken up on another account . I shewed him the paper whereon I had set down the things I lost; he then owned to me and my landlord, he took every thing mentioned, except the watch, and said he was a dying man (meaning for his other offence) and I might do as I pleased, and if I'd come another day he'd let us know where the things were; we went three or four times, but he put me off from time to time, and would not tell me where they were.</p>

            . On the 17th day of September the prisoner came to my house and asked me if he could have a lodging, and said he was going to work for a jeweller in Turnstile ; I told him he might lodge with a man in my house ( meaning the prosecutor) but I would enquire after his character; this being on the Sunday night I let him be there that night, intending on the morrow to go and enquire after his character where he had directed me. John Cooper went out in the morning to work as usual. I thought the prisoner lay a long time, so I went up stairs about nine o'clock and found he was gone.

Then I and another young man went into the country as far as Gravesend; I staid there about five nights and lodged at the Angel; then we came to town, and when I came to my mother's I was told Mr. Wilkerson had been there, and said I had robbed a man of his cloaths.</p>

The prisoner came to take a lodging of me the 31st of July last, and we agreed; he said he was a lawyer's clerk; he sat down in the room where I was at work above stairs next room to that he had taken, and fell to writing immediately . There was a crimson waistcoat laced with silver, he took it up with his hand and said it was a flashy waistcoat, who does it be long to? then he said to me, I suppose you think we write very strangely, but we write that which people can't understand that they should not know what we are doing; he sealed it up in another sheet of paper, and said, can you recommend me to an honest person that can carry this to No. 5 in Gray's Inn, and he'd give them a shilling; he had told me his father's name was Morris, a goldsmith, at the corner of Salisbury Court ; I thought I might as well earn that shilling myself, then I could call on his father to enquire of his character as I went to No. 5. The gentleman unclosed the letter, and said, what rogue has sent this to me? said I, he tells me he is your clerk; said he, he is a rogue, let him be what he will, I ran home again as fast as I could, having been absent about a quarter of an hour. When I came home I went up stairs, and out of a chest missed my waistcoat made of silk and cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chest locked before?</p>
               <p>Hustenson. No, it was not; I there found an old hat and mine gone ; then I looked about and missed the said waistcoat before mentioned and a pair of nankeen breeches; the worsted waistcoat trimm'd with silver belonged to Mr. Hardwick. They were all in the room when I went out with the letter, but have never seen them since. I heard he was taken up about a month after and was in Clerkenwell prison, so I went there to see him, and he acknowledged he had taken them and delivered the goods to a woman to pawn, and said, if I'd be easy and make no disturbance he'd help me to them again, but I never could get him to help me to them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Dawson, I was sent with the prisoner, by my master, to carry these knives and forks; the prisoner said suppose his master should be at dinner . I shall want to have them left for half an hour or three quarters, my master said he had no objection to that, but bid me not deliver the bill with the receipt till the money was paid; going along, the prisoner asked me how long the gentleman, that kept the shop before, had been dead, I told him I did not know; he said his master had been a good customer to him, and if he had known he had been dead he should not have come so far for the knives, for here are several hard-ware shops nearer; coming to go into St. James's-Park, he bid me to put the knives under my coat that I might not be stopped by the centinels, but he said some of them knew he liv'd in the Park, I could not hide them all conveniently, so I gave him two dozen to put under his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the dozens did you deliver to him?</p>
               <p>Hichcock. They were done up in papers, I can't say which they were, he had me down to a chapel, when he came to the gate, he pretended to be much in a fright, because it was his master's dinner time, that he should stay so long, and said to himself, how came I to be such a fool to stay so long, and said you may go, and call in about three quarters of an hour's time, which I refused to do, then he said he'd go and try the other door; then we wen into Duke street, and came up to a door, he dit not push, but look'd in at a window, and caused the porter for not being in the way, and said ad could not get in; then we went round to the Pare again, and staid there a little time, there came man in a livery, and gave a push at the gate, tea try if it was locked ; then the prisoner said to him, we are both locked out; upon that the man went away directly, after a little time, he proposed to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175302210015"/> into an she could just by to drink a pint of beer, to which I consented, it was near to Story's-Gate coffee-house, we went into a parlour, there was a soldier and another man, he said, here are people about business; they answered our business will soon be done, he called for a pint of beer; he laid down the two dozen of knives upon the table, upon which he told me I might as well lay mine down, which I did; he was very impatient for the pint of beer, and call'd out again to the landlord for it, when it came, I believe we drank each of us twice, I proposed going just out at the gate, to see whether the gate belonging to the house, was open, I did, and upon my return, the prisoner, and knives and forks were gone.</p>

I keep a cutler's shop, the prisoner brought the two dozen of ivory and China handles to me, I live in St. James's-Market; he wanted to know if I would buy them, this was on the 20th of January, about a quarter before seven o'clock, he brought three dozen, I bought two dozen of them, the other he did not open, he said they were for some body else.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>On the 29th of January I accidentally met a person named Edward's, whom I knew in North-Wales, he told me he was glad to see me, and that he had an order from a gentleman, to buy 3 dozen of genteel knives, and that he did not understand them; he was to receive some money in town and was disappointed, and wanted me to lend him money to pay for them, till he got into the country; then he'd return it me from Westchester, I told him I had none, then he asked me if I was acquai nted with any cutler, that I could have credit for him a little time, I told him I did know one, that I had dealt with eight or ten years; but I had not seen him for two years, but I would go the next day and try, I went, and when I came to the shop, I saw Mr. Dawson, he asked me what I wanted, I told him to look at some knives and forks, for a person that wanted some, I asked him where the master of the shop was, he said he had been dead some time, but he remember'd my using the shop, when I found the person was dead, I did not say any thing to him about giving me credit for them; he shew'd me two dozen which I was very willing to take, but the china handles I refused three times over, he perswaded me to take them, at last I said he might put them up if he pleased, we agreed for price, and he parcelled them up, and asked me who he was to make the bill to; but first of all, I should have mentioned I asked this Edwards, who these knives were for; he said one Williams, and mentioned some place where he liv'd near Harding, but I can't remember the name of the gentleman's seat, I bid the prosecutor set every thing down in the bill by itself, he said must they be cast up in three places, I said no, only the sum cast up; said he, shall I write a receipt? I said no, you had better not write a receipt? may be the money may not be paid upon the delivery of the goods, if you do, write it at some distance, that it may be torn off without blemishing the bill, so he wrote the receipt two inches below the other; coming out of the shop, I said, in case the money is not paid directly, may your servant leave them with me, till another time? he said yes, provided the receipt be torn off the bill; when we came to Spring-Gardens, the servant gave me two of the dozens and he never had them after, or came near them, when we had waited at the gate, we went into a publick-house, I sat just within the door, he went and sat at the further end of the room, when we had sat a little while, I said, give me the other dozen, that I may put them with these that I have, which he did, and he went back again, and never touch'd them, we said the space of twenty minutes, then he proposed to go out, and as I thought I had bought the knives and forks, I thought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175302210016"/> matter was not material whether I waited his coming back or not; so I took them up and went to Smithfield, to the inn where this Edwards said he put up his horse, there the people said they knew no such person, then I thought I had certainly mistaken the sign, I inquired at several other inn, but could not find him out, then I thought there could be no harm as I had bought the knives and forks, in my disposing of them as I thought proper, and all that I had to do was to wait a little out of Mr. Dawson's sight till I could raise the money to pay him.</p>

               <p>William Stickney. On Sunday the 14th of January, about seven o'clock at night, I felt a hand at my pocket, I turned about, there were two young men very near me, they told me they thought the prisoner had been picking my pocket, I saw him throw the handkerchief out of his hand, into the kennel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in his hand?</p>
               <p>Stickney . I did, and saw it fall, one of the young men took it up. ( Produced in court and deposed to.)</p>

             . Rose Manning lodges at a lodging-house, and sells fish, oranges, and apples, and is about 20 years of age; we had half a pint of rum; then we went from the Golden Boot, where we had been drinking, to her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for your eating and drinking ?</p>
               <p>Bass . I called for all, and paid for all. Rose Manning was so fuddled that the waiter of the publick house was forced to lead her home, and help her up stairs; we had but about 50 yards to walk .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk without help?</p>
               <p>Bass. I did, and insisted upon having a full pot of beer brought, fearing we should be dry in the night, which was brought up by the prisoner Summers . Rose Manning took it of her at the door, then locked the door, and put the key in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Bass . I am, my lord, instead of both going into bed we were so much in liquor that we were neither of us able to get into bed, so we lay on the bed with our cloaths on. I awaked in the morning some considerable time before day-light, and awaked her and said we must be very much in liquor to lie in this manner with our cloaths on; I went to undress myself, and missed my silver buckles out of my shoes, then I put my hand to my pockets, and missed my watch and money, which was two thirty-six shilling pieces, three guineas in gold, and four shillings in silver, I undressed myself, and went into bed, and told Rose I had lost my watch, buckles, and money; but said I, we will hope for the better, perhaps Mrs. Scot has taken care of them, seeing me in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you so drunk, that you did not recollect whether you had all these things at the time you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Bass. To be sure, I can't recollect that I had them at that time, I awaked in the morning when it was broad day light, about nine o'clock, I was reaching for the pot of beer, and discovered a large hole in the wall; (the door was then locked and the key in Rose's pocket,) I said, I am afraid, there goes my watch, buckles, and money, through that hole, Mr. Scot's maid came for the empty pot, I called, and bid her ask her Mistress, whether she had got these things I had missed ; she went and brought word her mistress knew nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not that hole have been there over night, and you not observe it?</p>
               <p>Bass. The waistcoat and shift was pushed quite into the middle of the room, and lay on the floor, I could not go, without going over it, had it been so over night, I am certain I must have known it, besides I was in that room the day before, it was not so then, I got up and went to the Golden-Boot again, there was the prisoner Summers and

On the 12th of this she goods mentioned in the indictment were taken out of my house from a one pair of stairs room, I had seen them the day before in the room; my street door always stands open, there being a barber's shop. About a quarter of an hour after I missed them, the prisoner (Stafford) was stopped in my passage . She told me she wanted a person to fetch some coals, so I let her go. After this I had some suspicion of her; she was taken up, and her mother came and made a great noise, saying, her's was an honest child; the girl cried, and said her mother knew nothing of the things, but

             . I live facing the prosecutrix's, and hearing she had been robbed, I went over to her house, and there found the prisoner ( Stafford ). She at first denied it, but at last owned she had taken them away, and that they were at Prosser's house, and that if I would go with her and not let a mob follow her she'd go and fetch them again; so I went with her to Prosser's room, and there was Thomas Prosser her husband. The girl wanted to have the bed let down, which was, and she took out some of the things mentioned; then she looked about the room and under the man's hod (he is a bricklayer-labourer) there lay the rest. Then we brought them to the prosecutrix's house.</p>

On the 10th of this month the two prisoners and I agreed to go and steal some ropes to make money ; we were all waterman, so took a boat and went up into Lambeth Reach and cut away the best part of a cable on board a balast barge; then we went on board another balast barge and cut part of that cable away, we brought away one winch-line, that is what they turn to get the balast up, and several pieces of rope lying about the barge, which we carried to Mr. Blake on the Saturday, and sold them all for 6 s. 6 d. we went on sunday and shared the money and spent it; then we went to work to carry people by water at by-stairs . A fisherman's man came to us and shewed the two prisoners where to get Mr. Steager's ropes, so we went between one and two in the morning and broke down a board and took out the 600 lb. weight, then put it in the boat, and brought it to Mr. Blake's to sell, who stopped us on suspicion of stealing it ; then we were carried to a justice of peace and committed, and I was admitted an evidence.</p>

               <p>Hankin. I believe they might be worth 3 l. I spoke to my wife about it, she said she knew nothing of it, I always carried the key in my pocket, the reason that I charged the prisoner was, I have witness that saw her at my buroe, I took her before a justice of peace, she would not own any thing. There were nothing found upon her, I had never a lodger at my house when my things were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this buroe stand?</p>
               <p>Hankin. In a back parlour. I went to her in New-Prison, and asked her how she could serve me so to ruin me thus; the answer was, I can't bear to hear you talk of ruin, if you will have patience till my father comes up, all shall be made up; she told me she had a cozen on the other side of the water, if I'd go and fetch him, she would down of her knees to me, and say something that shall give you both satisfaction.</p>

             . I drink at the prosecutor's house often, on the 15th of January, at half an hour after ten in the morning, I was at breakfast in the opposite house to his back parlour, I saw the prisoner in the back parlour, and presently I saw her at his buroe with the front of it down, the back parlour is behind the bar: there is a long room between the front room where people drink, and the back parlour. I saw her pull out of the buroe, one or two of the drawers, where I was I could see every corner of the room she was in, there is no blinds to the windows, I did not acquaint any body with this, till I heard Mr. Hankin was robbed; she went out that day and back again in about an hour, and after that out and in again, all after this affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you saw her at the buroe, on the ground floor or up one pair of stairs ?</p>
               <p>Lanch . I was on the ground floor.</p>

             . I live in the house the last witness mentioned ; on the 15th of January, about half an hour after 10 in the morning, this young man was at breakfast ; he said there is the drummer's wife in the parlour, at Hankin's buroe: I looked, and saw her with one hand upon the drawer, and a drawer about half way out . I saw her take nothing out; but the flap was down: she was searched in mr. Hankin's parlour by her own desire, on the 16th in the evening; she and I had some talk together, I said, I'll shew you the posture you stood in. I went to the buroe and stood so; on which she owned she had been there, putting up a piece of pig: she acknowledged before the justice, upon my repeating the same she did stand so, but took nothing out of the buroe.</p>

This was on the Thursday, and on the Friday following, about seven in the morning, the chamber-keeper's servant at the guard-room came and told me I had been robbed, and there was a soldier came to acquaint me with it, which was Armstrong, a soldier, who gave me two silver table-spoons, a tobacco-box, and a pocket-book, and asked me if they were mine; I told him they were; then he said I had been robbed the last night, and if I made haste he supposed he'd help me to part of the things and the thief, so I immediately took my pistols which lay on the table, put them in my bosom, and went with him to Long-Acre; he said the thief was in a house in Drury-Lane, and it was not proper for me to go in there, but he'd bring him to me. We went in at the Vine; he went for the man; in the mean time I got a constable, and in a short space of time he came in with the prisoner, and one

            , who is here to give evidence; the servant of the house told me they were gone backwards, so I went into the room, and put a pistol to the prisoner's head, and said, he was a dead man if he resisted; the constable took hold of Conner, and the soldier of the prisoner, we took a parcel that then lay on the table before the prisoner, two linnen shirts, one blue-grey surtout coat, and one hat, all my property, and were in my room when I went to mount guard, (produced in court); we took them before justice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175302210025"/> Fielding; some time before he was ready to examine them, Armstrong said to me, feel in his pocket for a ing, saying, he saw him have one. I took out this ring (produced in court and deposed to) from the fob of his breeches (it had a chrystal and two diamond sparks) then the other witness (Conner) took me aside, and bid me feel for some stockings, and in the lining of his coat we found a pair of silk stockings, my property; then Mr. Fielding was ready. I told him the things which we there produced were my property . Mr. Fielding asked him what he had to say for himself; he said a woman robbed me and gave them to him to sell, but, upon being asked what woman, he gave no answer; then he said to me, captain, as you have most of your things again, what signifies sending me to goal? let me go home; he also said, captain, I wish you'd shoot me through the head, it would give me ease (or words to that effect.) He was put into a coach to go to goal. I lent the constable my pair of pistols to guard him, and desired he would take care of him. Then I went with Armstrong to the house of one Reason at the saleshop near St. Giles's; the soldier had before given me the key of a large box which was there, I took the key and unlocked it, and found several things in it my property. As soon as I saw the things were mine, I locked it again. Before I examined the whole, we put the box and another parcel into a coach, which Mrs. Reason delivered to me, and then went to my lodgings; when I came there I took out one black velvet coat, one brocaded waistcoat, one pair of velvet breeches, one cloth coat with gold lace, one cloth coat with metal buttons double gilt and engraved, one scarlet coat with black trimming, another with blue trimming, a coat and waistcoat made of Wilton stuff lined with brown holland, two red cloth frocks, one stuff frock, one blue silk waistcoat, one black cloth waistcoat . one worsted waistcoat, two pair of silk breeches, and other goods, as mentioned in the indictment. I got all my woollen goods again; then I asked the soldier if he knew of any more, there being some cotton and some thread stockings, and some shirts missing, which I have not got again; he gave me an account of some shirts of which he'll tell the court. Then I examined my buroe, which I found was broke open, the chamber door of the same, and the brass box was gone that received the bolt of the lock.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Showery. I had; he was put into the house few days before this robbery was committed, by Mr. Harris, to take care of the goods for him . He had taken the house, but was not as then come into the house. The prisoner had the key of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the lock of your door appear when you observed it ?</p>
               <p>Showery. It appeared as it did when double locked; the bolt was shot out.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar goes by the name of Farrol, and on the 8th of this month, between the hours of seven and eight, he came to me at York-Buildings to the Fox, in Villers-street ; he said he wanted to speak with me, so I got up and went with him to the door, and he told me he had got a parcel of cloths to dispose of, and if I would sell them, or recommend him to any body that would buy them of him, he'd handsomely reward me; I told him I knew a woman that dealt in all manner of cloaths, whose name was Reason, and if he'd go there may be she might buy them; then he saw Conner in the same house, who was drinking in another company, he said he wanted to speak with him, so he went in and brought him out, and told him he had got some cloths ready for him to carry, and then was the time for him to go, saying, he'd not detain him. Then we all three went together.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Armstrong. It was then near eight at night; we went to Spring Gardens; the prisoner took a key out of his pocket and opened a door, but I did not know whose house it was, though I have been in it since, it is the house the prosecutor lives in. We all three went into the house, and he desired us to stay a moment and he'd bring a light, which he did; then he locked the street door, and in the passage was a large bundle tied up either in a table-cloth or a sheet, in a little room where he said he lay; by the passage there was a long bag full of other cloaths; he said to Conner, do you take that in the passage and I this, which they did; then he unlocked the door, so we went out, and he locked the door after him and put the key in his pocket. We went up by the king's Muse by Long-Acre, and so to Reason's house ; he would have had me take the bundle he carried, when we were about half way, but I would not; I told Mrs. Reason we had got a parcel of cloaths to sell, so he threw them down on the floor and said to her, don't be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175302210026"/> in fear, madam, for what is here are all none, and wanted to sell them all to her. As soon as they were opened, and she saw the regimentals and rich cloathing, she said her husband was not at home, and she would have nothing to say to them, and looked a little affrighted. I took her aside and whispered to her, and said, I thought they must be some officer's cloaths that he had robbed, and desired she would be so good as to lend me a box or chest to lock them up till next morning, and I would see if I could find the officer who had been robbed, and I would see that she should be rewarded for so doing. At first she did not chuse it, but at last she emptied a box full of her own cloaths and lent me the box, and desired I would do as I pleased; so I put in as many as it would hold and locked it, and put the key in my pocket. The rest we left in the long bag, and tied the bag up in the sheet or table cloth; then the prisoner gave me two large silver spoons and a large silver tobacco-box to see if she would buy them, but she would not, so I kept them. We went away, and the prisoner insisted upon having something to make money that night, so he took four shirts away with him, two of which he gave Conner to pawn. I told him I thought I could bring a person in the morning that would buy them all; the prisoner desired I would bring him as soon in the morning as I could to the Plough in Drury-Lane, and so we parted. Then I went to the place where we had the goods from, and enquired of a man near there if he knew any body belonging to the horse-guards near that place; he told me there was one captain Showery that mounted guard such a day at such a place, and that he lived over the way, so I went home to my quarters, and in the morning early enquired of a Sentinel at Buckingham-Gate for captain Showery, who said he was in bed; I desired he would go immediately and tell him he was robbed; he called to a woman, and she went and acquainted the captain, and presently I was admitted into his apartment, I gave him the pocket-book, tobacco-box, and two silver spoons ; he said they were his ; I told him if he would go with me speedily I would endeavour to help him to his cloaths, and the man that took them; so he went with me to Long-Acre . The rest as the captain had before deposed.</p>

            . The prisoner came to call me and the last witness at the Fox in Viller's-Street, near Hungerford-Market, on the 18th of this month between seven and eight in the evening; he told me he had a parcel of cloaths to dispose of, and if I would carry them he'd pay me generously for my trouble; he said they were at a house in Spring-Gardens, so we both went with him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever in the house before ?</p>
               <p>Conner. I had, and lay with the prisoner about six nights in that house; I knew there was a lodger above, but did not know whether it was a man or a woman. The prisoner opened the door with a key, then shut the door and went for a light; then he came and locked the door, he shewed me a bundle for me to carry, which lay in the passage, and he was to carry another . We took them and went to the house of Reason. (He had told me they belonged to a woman who was in the verge of the court, and he was to sell them for her.) The prisoner offered to sell them to Mrs. Reason, but she would have nothing to say to them upon seeing the regimentals, and appeared to be much affrighted; he said she need not be afraid, for they were all his own; by the persuasion of Armstrong she lent him a box to lock them up in till the morning, he locked them up and offered her the key, but she would not have any thing to do with it; then he put it into his pocket. The prisoner brought two pair of silk stockings and four shirts, and said he wanted some money that night. As we were coming down Bridge-street by a pawnbroker's, he desired me to take two of the shirts and pawn them; I asked him what name I should carry them in, and he said, in the name of Johnson; I went and pawned them for half a guinea; then the prisoner appointed to meet me at the Plough in Drury-Lane, in the morning before eight. He and I came, and after him came Armstrong; the prisoner was angry with him for staying so long; Armstrong desired us both to go with him to another house in Long-Acre, saying, he had got a man that would buy the things. The prisoner had this bundle with him that was first produced. When we were got to the house and sat down, the captain and constable came and seized the prisoner and me, and carried us before the justice, where the prisoner was searched, and a ring was found in his right fob, and a pair of silk stockings in the lining of his coat.</p>

He told me he'd fetch them the next day, and bring the gentleman that had been robbed, which he did, and the gentleman took them away, and sent me the box again.</p>

             . I was employ'd to clean the house of Mr. Harris, I remember the prisoner being there yesterday was fortnight, the day I came to the house; he came there about eleven o'clock. I had orders he should get a woman to help me clean the house; he brought one to me on the Thursday; but the woman went away and he was on and off. He said it was not worth my while to begin then, he'd help me the next day. We dined together, after which I went and worked at cleaning, till I could see no longer, and then I went to my lodging; he was there, I said to him, go and shut up the windows; he was drying his stockings, and said, it is not for want of stockings that I am drying these, for I can put on fix pair: he took the key and went, and just as the watchman was calling the hour twelve, he came with the key to me, and laid it down on the dresser: I said to him, don't you lie in the house: he said he had a letter from his master, and he was going to Hyde-Park-Corner, to take care of the horses, and he knew where to lie.</p>

I am a constable of St. Martin's in the Field's, on the 9th of this month, captain Showrey came before nine in the morning, I went with him to the Vine in Long-Acre, the captain gave me one of his pistols, in about ten minutes, we heard they were come in, we went into the room where they were, and took him and Conner, The rest as the captain and Armstrong had before deposed with this addition; that the prisoner said Armstrong and Conner were the persons that broke open the door and eserutore, corner cupboard, and a tea chest belonging to the captain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Armstrong what he did with the gold-lace he took off of the captain's hat, and the knot he took off of the sword.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. I never saw a hat with a lace, I saw three plain ones, the prisoner gave me the knot of lace which he took off the sword with-inside the tobacco-box, and said it would make it weight the better, and I returned it to the captain.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When I married that man's sister he got my wife to execute a wrong judgement, by antidating it, against me, and he was put into my house, so he kept me out. The case was tried before my lord chief justice Lee . This is all Spight.</p>
               <p>Hall. The woman never confessed a judgment to me; she found soon that he had a wife and five children living at the time he married her, which was on the Saturday, and on the Monday following he put a bond and judgment into the house. The things were appraised and sold; I bought them of 'Squire Buckley .</p>

            . I have known the prisoner 12 years, he once was a tenant of mine. I remember about four or five years ago, I believe it was, I saw him come down from Newgate linked with a chain, amongst other transports, to Black Friers Stairs; I went on purpose to see him; I said to him, Mr. Jettea, I am sorry to see you transported; then he went to shake hands with me, but I said, not so familiar as that, I think it is ten thousand pities you was not hanged; then he threw a bottle of girl at me with violence, and swore, if I came near him, he'd stick me. I saw him put into the close lighter, and saw him go down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the court at his trial?</p>
               <p>Boulton. I was not, but I knew he was tried and convicted for robbing a person of a guinea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man, after I had given in a receipt to buy some houses, arrested me, and put me into goal, and so got my houses from me, and broke into my house.</p>
               <p>Boulton. I never owed him any discourse in my life; he would neither pay me my rent, nor go out of my house.</p>

On the 13th of this month I came to town early in the morning; my servant came to me and told me my two leaden statues, Mercury and Fame, (which had stood in my garden, and they were taken down) were taken away. After that I had a second message came, that the men who took them were in custody at the Red Lion, in Kingsland Road, so I went there and saw the two prisoners and some lead cut to pieces, which were statues by the two heads of them. I believe them to be mine. There was Wingrove, the evidence ; they all three confessed, before we went to the justice's, they had been in my garden that night, and took the statues away, and that lead was part of them, and that they had cut them to pieces. Wingrove also informed me that he had been there the Friday before to survey the place to see what they could take away this was about two in the afternoon. After this they confessed the same before justice Fielding.</p>

             . I robbed with the two prisoners some time; I live near Whitechapel-Church; we all three went into Mr. Albarey's garden about a fortnight ago, and took the two images through the summer-house window, and carried them out into a field, and Watling sawed them to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. In what position did you find them in the garden?</p>
               <p>Wingrove. They were lying down against a green house, one was a male, and the other a female. I believe they might weigh about 300 lb. weight or upwards. When we had cut them to pieces, we put some into a sack, a pair of wallets, and a basket, and carried them away, except some of the heads and arms, which we hid in a gravel-pit in a field. We were taken up directly in the man's cellar who used to buy all the things of us.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you all enter the garden?</p>
               <p>Wingrove. We were in it about 11 o'clock; when we had done sawing it might be about three, and we got to Robertson's, by Whitechapel church, about five.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brogden. I am clerk to justice Fielding (he produces the two written confessions signed by the two prisoners). I saw them both sign them, they were done at their own desire, freely and voluntarily. I also saw the justice sign each of them. They were read in court. The contents was that of stealing the lead, mentioned in all the indictments specified below, with this fact, which only was read .</p>

               <p>Elizabeth Canning. I had been to Salt-Petre Bank to see an uncle and aunt, his name is

            , I set out from home about 11 in the forenoon, and staid there till about nine at night on the first of January; then my uncle and aunt came with me as far as Aldgate, where we parted; I was then alone, so came down Hounsditch and over Moorfields by Bedlam wall, there two lusty men, both in great coats, laid hold of me, one on each side, they said nothing to me at first, but took half a guinea in a little box out of my pocket, and three shillings that were loose .</p>
               <p>Q. Which man took that?</p>
               <p>E. Canning . The man on my right hand. They took my gown, apron, and hat, and solded them up and put them into a great coat pocket. I screamed out, then the man that took my gown put a handkerchief, or some such thing, to my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any persons walking near you at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I saw nobody. They then tied my hands behind me; after which one of them gave me a blow on the temple, and said, d - n you, you b - h, we'll do for you by and by. I having been subject to convulsion-sits these four years, this blow stunned me, and threw me directly into a sit.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these sits attended with a struggling?</p>
               <p>E. Canning . I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened afterwards?</p>
               <p>E. Canning . The first thing that I remember after this was, I found myself by a large road, where was water, with the two men that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any discourse with them?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I had none; they took me to the prisoner Wells's house .</p>
               <p>Q. About what time do you think it might be?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. As near as I can think it was about four o'clock in the morning, I had recovered from my sit about half an hour before I came to the house. They lugged me along, and said, you b - h, why don't you walk faster? one had hold on my right arm, and the other on the last, and so pulled me along.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment in what manner you was conveyed to the place before you recovered of your sit?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I think they dragged me along by my petticoats, they being so dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to Wells's house, was it day-light?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. No, it was not; I think it was day-light in about three hours, or better, after I was there, which is the reason I believe I was carried in about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was carried in, what did you see there?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I saw the gypsey woman Squires, who was sitting in a chair, and two young women in the same room; Virtue Hall (the evidence) was one; they were standing against a dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner (Wells) there?</p>
               <p>E. Canning . No, I did not. As soon as I was brought in

             took me by the hand, and asked me if I chose to go their way, saying, if I did, I should have fine cloaths; I said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she explain to you what she meant by going their way?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. No, sir. Then she went and took a knife out of a dresser drawer, and cut the lace off my stays, and took them from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, at that time, any apprehensions of danger?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I thought she was going to cut my throat, when I saw her take the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner (Wells) at that time?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175302210031"/>E. Canning . No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else taken from you?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. There was not then, but Squires looked at my petticoat and said, here, you b - h, you may keep that, or I'll give you that, it is not worth much, and gave me a slap on the face.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the petticoat in her hand?</p>
               <p>E. Canning . No, it was on me. After that, she pushed me up stairs from out of the kitchen, where we were.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the kitchen.</p>
               <p>E. Canning. The kitchen was at the right hand going in at the door, and the stairs are near the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. How many steps to them?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. There are four or five of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they call the name of the place where they put you in?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. They call it the hay-lost. The room door was shut as soon as I was put up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it fastened?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I don't know that, it was at the bottom of the stairs in the kitchen. After she shut the door she said, if ever she heard me stir or move, or any such thing, she'd cut my throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing brought up to eat or drink?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I saw nothing brought up. When day-light appeared I could see about the room, there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor bedstead, nothing but hay to lie upon, there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about 24 pieces of bread, (a pitcher produced in court) this is the pitcher, which was full to near the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. How much in quantity do you think these 24 pieces of bread might be?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I believe about a quartern loaf.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you nothing else to subsist on?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I had in my pocket a penny mince-pye, which I bought that day to carry home to my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue in that room?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. A month by the weeks, all but a few hours.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a month by the weeks?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I mean a four-weeks month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come to you in the room during that time?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. No, sir, nobody at all. On the Wednesday before I came away I saw somebody look through the crack of the door, but don't know who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, during the time you was in this confinement, make any attempts to come down stairs, or make your escape?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. No, sir, I did not till the time I got out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any thing to subsist on during the time besides the pieces of bread, penny pye, and pitcher of water?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you get out?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I got out about four o'clock in the afternoon on a Monday, after I had been confined there four weeks, all but a few hours.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get out?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I broke down a board that was nailed up at the inside of a window, and got out there.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was the window from the ground?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. (She described it by the height of a place in the Sessions-House, which was about eight or ten feet high.) First I got my head out, and kept fast hold by the wall and got my body out; after that I turned myself round and jumped into a little narrow place by a lane with a field behind it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the jump hurt you?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. No, it was soft clay ground .</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light then?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do for cloathing?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I took an old sort of a bed gown and a handkerchief that were in this hay-lost and lay in a grate in the chimney. (Produced in court. ) I made my ear bleed at getting out; the handkerchief I tied over my head instead of a cap, it was very bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body when you jumped out at the window?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. No, nobody at all; then I went on the backside the house up a lane, and crossed a little brook and over two fields, as I think, but I did not take notice how many fields, the path-way brought me by the road side. Then I went by the road strait to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the way?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call at any house?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175302210032"/>E. Canning . No, I did not. It struck ten as I came over Moorfields . I got about a quarter after to my mother's house Aldermanbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you acquaint any body with your misfortune coming along?</p>
               <p>E. Canning . No, I did not .</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you meet with first?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give an account to any body how you had been treated?</p>
               <p>E. Canning . Yes, I did to Mrs. Woodward, was came to see me, that I had lived on bread and water . She was so affrighted she could not ask me many questions then; then Mr. Wintlebury came in, with whom I lived servant before I went to live with Mr. Lion; he took me by my hand and asked me where I had been; I said, sir, in Hertfordshire road ; he said, Bet, how do you know that? I said, because I saw my Mistress's coachman go by, which she used to go into the country into Hertfordshire, that was Mrs. Wintlebury; I knew the coach because I used to carry things to it, and fetch them back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you asked any questions about the room or jugg that night, and what you had to subsist on?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. Yes, there were many people came in, and I told them I had a jugg which was not quite full of water; they asked me how much, and I said I believed better than a gallon of it ; they asked me also how I got out, and I said I broke out of the window, and had torn my ear in getting out, which bled all the way coming home.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did you observe in this hay-lost?</p>
               <p>E. Canning. There were a barrel, a saddle, a bason, and a tobacco mould.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a tobacco mould?</p>

             that has given her evidence is my daughter, after she was missing from new-year's day, I advertized her three times, she came back on the day before King Charles's Martyrdom, about quarter after ten o'clock at night, she had nothing but this ragged bed gown and a cap; I fell into a fit directly; my daughter is subject to fits, there was a garret ceiling fell in upon her head, which first occasioned them; and at times when any body speaks hastily to her, or at any surprize, she is very liable to fall in one, she has sometimes continued in one seven or eight hours, sometimes three or four, she is not sensible during the time she is in one, no more than a new born babe; when I came to myself my daughter was talking to Mrs. Woodward and Mr. Wintlebury; they asked her where she had been, she said on the Hertfordshire road, which she knew by seeing a coach going by; she gave the same account she has here. When she came into her warm bed, she was very sick, and had no free passage through her for stool or urine, till she was supply'd with glysters, for seven days after she came home, but what was forc'd by half a cup full at a time .</p>

               <p>Sutherton Bakler. I am an apothecary, I saw E. Canning, the day after she came home, on the 30th of January about noon, she was extreamely low and weak; I could scarcely here her speak, her voice was so low, and her pulse scarcely to be felt with cold sweats; she told me she had no passage during the whole time of her confinement, she was then in such a condition she had a glister administered the same day, she had many glisters given her, which after some time relieved her .</p>
               <p>Q. Whether a person that is extreamely costive cannot subsist longer without food, or with less food, than a person that is not so ?</p>
               <p>Bakler. I cannot answer to that . Each of the persons that said they went down to take the prisoners were asked where they went to, and answered to Endfield-wash, the house of the prisoner Walls .</p>

Coming along Popham-lane there were some people raking up dung. I drank at the second alehouse in Basingstoke on the Thursday in the new-year week. On the Friday I lay at Bagshot-Heath, at a little tiney house on the heath. On the Saturday I lay at Old Brentford at Mr. Edwards's, who sells greens and small beer. I could have told this before, but one pulled me and another pulled me, and would not let me speak. I lay at Mrs. Edwards's, on the Sunday and Monday; and on the Tuesday, or Wednesday after, I came from thence to Mrs. Wells's house.</p>

I don't remember I heard a word from either of them; I called out, watch, and murder! two watchmen came, and I told them the affair; then I met Roe and laid hold on her, and charged the watchmen with her; we took her to the Roundhouse, where I told the watchmen the other woman had a particular cast with her eye, and I should know her in the morning. Roe said, I don't believe but it is Grace; then the woman of the Roundhouse told me, if I would give her maid two-pence she should go for the key, so she went and brought the pocket and the key. (Produced in court and deposed to.) She lived near the place where they robbed me, and was taken up. I am positive to the two prisoners.
