I am the wife of Joseph Ball, a labourer, and live at No. 10, Ratcliff-Street, Gulston-street; the prisoner, M'Bane, lodged in the same house over head, and Glenning was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards. On the 28th of April I went out, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, leaving my husband at home—about twelve o'clock he brought me the key of the door—I went home between four and five, found the door open, and missed the articles stated, the candlestick from the mantel-shelf, and the other things from a box under the bed—these now produced are them—M'Bane's brother brought me the candlestick next day—the house is let out in lodgings—we have two rooms—the landlord does not live in the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gun-street, Spitalfields, and am a furrier; the prisoner was my apprentice. On the 28th of April I went with him to New<lb/>gate-street—we were returning between five and six o'clock in the evening—he was walking by my side in South-place, Finsbury, and somebody called out, "You are losing your furs"—I observed a bit of a squirrel fur flounce coming out of the prisoner's trowsers, at the bottom—I asked how he came by it—he said he did not know—I gave him in charge—I had not been above three quarters of an hour from home—when I returned I found I had but forty-three flounces instead of forty-four, which were safe shortly before I left home with the prisoner.</p>

I went to his lodging, he said he had no money, and would give me his watch till the morning; he put the watch down my bosom; I stopped with him some time; I put the watch on the table again, and came out I saw the policeman, and told him what had occurred; he said, "You are a fool not to have the watch;" I said, "You don't mean that, do you?" he said, "Yes, go and get it, and I will see it is all right." I went back and got the watch, thinking it might be gone, and I should be accused of stealing it.</p>

               <p>twenty-five minutes past seven o'clock in the morning—I have never seen the letter since—it is the practice in the office for the letter-carriers to pay their charges to the receiver-general three times a week—they pay the amount of two days' letters—one carrier takes it from what is called the division, and hands it to the receiver-general's clerk—there are fifteen divisions—there are seventeen carriers in the prisoner's division—when their pay papers are made up, each paper is delivered separately to the receiver-general's clerk, with the money in it—Hipp is collector of charges to the prisoner's division—on the morning after this, after Hipp had collected the payments from the different carriers, he brought them to me, about seven o'clock in the morning of the 19th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-inspector of letter-carriers. On the 18th of April I saw Mr. Playle inclose a sovereign in a letter, about a quarter past seven o'clock in the morning, directed to "Mr. Midlam, bread and biscuit baker, No. 6, Dorset-place, London"—a sovereign was fastened into it by a piece of card—I had marked the sovereign, and saw Mr. Playle mark it—I noticed that it was the reign of Victoria, 1843—that produced is it—Mr. Playle sealed the letter—I shortly after saw it in Mr. Playle's hands—it had then received two post-office stamps—Rice was called up, and directed to put it among the Dorset-place division, with Davis's letters—about a quarter past eight o'clock that morning I saw the letter again on the prisoner's seat, having passed through the first sorting, and put up in one of the divisions of letters, as is the custom, to be delivered in different streets—the letters are first sorted by a sub-sorter into divisions, and afterwards into walks—they are then brought out into another office, and placed on the seats of the respective letter-carriers who have to deliver them—they are brought out in a tray, and placed on the carriers' seats—they then arrange them for delivery—I saw this letter after it had been arranged for delivery—that it done by the carrier.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How could you tell it was after it was arranged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are first placed flat on the desk, but afterwards placed upon two shelves, and stand upon one end—this being a larger letter than common, and of a peculiar yellow tint, and what is rather unusual, two stamps, that satisfied me it was the same letter—I saw the two stamps and the colour of the paper—it was rather a large letter, but I think not to large as to project so much as it did—I did not see the prisoner leave the office that morning—I saw him with his hat on, and he came into the private office where I was, preparing to go out—I think it was a little after eight—I was present next morning when Hipp brought the charges into what we call the inquiry room—Mr. Playle was there—we both began to open the different charges—Mr. Playle opened Davis's, when it came to its turn, and put it on one side, without speaking, for me to look; at, which I did.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you know it was Davis's charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew that afterwards—here is the paper with Davis's name at the bottom of the amount, in his handwriting—there was six sovereigns and one shilling in it, and among them was the sovereign which he bad marked—the prisoner was called in that morning, and placed in charge of Tyrrell, the officer—he remained in his custody an hour or two before he was examined by Mr. Peacock.</p>

               <p>in that way after giving another man into custody—I was concerned with Mr. Playle in'getting up that plan—I noticed the date of the sovereign at Mr. Playle's suggestion—anybody into whose hands this paper came, might open it and change the money—there is no seal—it has the pri<lb/>soner's signature to it, showing that for two days his letters came to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. all but 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I made a dent on the sovereign with a brad-awl, on the shield side, between the stems of the wreath—Hipp has been seven or eight years, I think, in the Post-office—his situation is the same kind as the prisoner's—I saw Mr. Playle put the wax on the letter in the superintending president's room, and saw him leave with it—I saw the letter afterwards—I do not know whether I had it in my hand, but am pretty certain I handed it over to Rice, but do not exactly recollect—the prisoner's is the fifteenth division—I do not know how many letter-carriers there are in it—there are a great many—if a letter is given to a carrier, whose division it does not belong to, he would not be fined if he does not carry it out, that I am aware of—the carriers' seats are divided by a partition—each man has a seat to himself—I did not put the letter on the prisoner's seat, nor see it put on—on the division of his seat that I saw this letter, there were about twenty—they varied in size—Mr. Playle selected the paper for the letter, and directed it, by Mr. Kelly's direction—I saw Mr. Playle mark the sovereign at the end of the curl of the Queen's hair—it was an indentation of the same brad-awl—I was not acquainted with Midlam—I have since found there is a person of that name—the prisoner's ordinary weekly payment was about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On the evening of the 12th of April, about half-past nine o'clock, I left home—I saw my mother lock the door—the house was all shut up—the shutters were fastened—I am sure it was past nine o'clock—the Dock<lb/>bell rang at nine, which was half an hour before—I went on an errand, and was coming back—I saw a light in the first floor window—that room has got no shutters—I went back for my father and mother—when I came home I saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the room—I did not know her—I said, "I have caught you"—I saw a bundle tied up in a handkerchief on a chair, which she was standing by the side of—the policeman came—I observed the staple of the street-door lying on the floor, by the door-post—this is it—there is a back yard door—I am sure that was shut when I left home—I did not notice it when I came home—it had only got a latch to it—I do not know whether there was any possibility of getting in at the back—it is a low wall—there is a public-house at the back of it—it appeared the staple had been forced off.</p>

In Sept. last I had occasion to go to the house of the prisoner's mother, who lives at Truro—I searched her house, and found in the kitchen a box, which is here—the prisoner was not there when I went—I knew he had been there the day be<lb/>fore, and was living there—I searched that box, and found in it five dupli<lb/>cates in a tortoiseshell card-case—one of them refers to a cloak, pawned at Cording's—the others do not refer to this matter—I have been searching for the prisoner since that, and found him at last in the island of Jersey—I ap<lb/>prehended him there, the Thursday before last Easter—I told him what I took him for—he made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-meter, and live in White Horse-lane, Stepney. On the 11th of April I went into the Black Lion, Mile-end-road, about half-past ten o'clock—I was not exactly sober—there were several quarrels in the room—I said nothing to the prisoner, but I saw he had been very ill-used-he took up the poker, and struck me by accident instead of somebody else on the top of my head—it was only a very flight wound—I received no in-convenience from it—it did not bleed mucfi—I am satisfied he never intended to do me any harm—I told the Magistrate so, and wanted him to discharge him—he had been struck by other people, and was defending himself when he took up the poker—he had no malice towards me, for I never saw him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Ebenezer-place, in the parish of St Ann, Limehouse—it is my dwelling-house. On the 15th of April, about eight o'clock in the morning, the two prisoners came into the shop—Thompson asked for a pair of trowser-straps—I tried on one, which did not suit—I tried on two or three others, and cut them to fit him—Dixon was near the door, and Thompson came right into the shop, and put his foot up on a ladder, keeping himself between me and the door, to conceal Dixon and the doorway from me—while I was trying the straps, Dixon had a cloak over his arm, which he seemed to move from one arm to the other—I know that more from the rustling noise and the shadow, I did not see him, but I noticed that he took the cloak, and, as I thought, was putting it on—I lost sight of him, and saw by the shadow that he went out of the door—in a few minutes he returned—I very soon then fitted Thompson with straps, and</p>

               <p>they walked out, Dixon rather before Thompson, but he loitered a little till Thompson went out to him, which was not half a minute, and they walked away arm in arm—the moment they left the door I noticed the empty shelf, where the waistcoat-pieces had been, and the noise Dixon made I am cer<lb/>tain was his moving them—all the articles named in the indictment were on one shelf—I had seen them safe, and handled them seven or eight minutes before they came in—nobody had been into the shop between my seeing them safe and the prisoners coming in, either from the street or from my house—none of the property has been found—I directed my apprentice to follow them instantly—I followed them myself, and overtook them—I said I had lost a lot of waistcoating, and asked if they had seen any thing of them—they said, "O dear, no"—I threw open Dixon's cloak instinctively, and he took it off, but I did not find them—they were worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On the 21st of April I was at Mr. Teasey's public-house, at St. Margaret's, Westminster—the prisoner came up to me, and asked me to give her some beer—I said I had no money—a young woman gave her a pot—she drank some of it, and threw the rest over me, and before I could recover myself, she hit me on the head with the pot—my head bled very much—I was quite sober—she was a little in liquor—the wound is well now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Palmer, and live in Albemarle-street, Clerkenwell. Mr. William Palmer has a dwelling-house at No. 29 1/2, Great Sutton-street, in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell. On the 13th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was in Sutton-street, and saw the prisoner Draper between the two parlour windows of Mr. Palmer's house—one of the windows was open, and when I got up to the window, I saw Phillips in the parlour, with the clock in his hand—I asked what he did there, and shut the window down—I then knocked at the door of the house, and called out, "Police"—I then saw Phillips getting out of the window—he ran down the street, and at the same time I saw Draper</p>

               <p>nearly at the bottom of the street, running—I did not see him commence run<lb/>ning—I had walked past him to get to the door—it was the first window that was open, and which I shut down—I followed Phillips, crying, "Stop thief," till he was stopped by a policeman—I lost sight of him for about half a minute, in turning the corner of Sutton-street into St. John-street—I fol<lb/>lowed him round the corner, and saw him running about fifty yards from me—he ran about 500 yards after getting round the corner—I am certain he is the man I saw get out of the window—I had a full view of his face at the time he was in the parlour, and of his back when he was running—he put the clock on the side-board again, he did not bring it out with him—as we were bringing Phillips back to the prosecutor's house, another constable brought Draper towards us, and he went back along with Phillips—I firmly believe he is the same man I had seen between the windows, by his dress and ap<lb/>pearance—I speak to him from his face and dress both</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Barnet Slowman, landlord of the house, No. 91, Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square—Elizabeth Bosfield occupies the first floor of the house. On the evening of the 19th of April, about half-past seven o'clock, I answered a knock at the door, and found the pri<lb/>soner there—he asked for Miss Bosfield—I asked him to stand in the hall while I went up stairs to her, but he followed me up stairs to the room door—I went into the bed-room to Miss Bosfield, and fetched out a candlestick—I went through the drawing-room into the bed-room—I lighted the candle, put it on the table, and showed the prisoner into the room—Miss Bosfield's watch and appendages were in the room between the two candlesticks, and the watch-case underneath them—I then went in to Miss Bosfield, and before I could return out of the bed-room I heard him running down stairs—I ran down as quick as I could—he slammed the door after him—I could not overtake him—I never saw him afterwards till the 22nd of April, when he was at the police-court.</p>

On the 1st of April, I was at the afternoon service at St. Paul's Cathedral, in one of the stalls on the north side—the clergyman officiating was nearly opposite to me, and a little lower on the south side—he was on a line with other persons, rather elevated, but lower than me—I was in one of the stalls—it was Mr. Haden—at the prayer for the Queen, I observed a person nearly opposite to me, and about two yards from the officiating clergy<lb/>man, appeared to stand while the majority of the congregation were kneeling—he appeared to me to have a book under a bag or handkerchief, or some<lb/>thing of a red colour—I thought he was about to follow the clergyman in his duty—the red bag was before him—his face was to the east—I was on his left hand, as the last gentleman in the jury box is—the congregation were with their faces as mine is, towards your lordship, consequently the congre<lb/>tion behind and before could not see him, but I could see him, being on his left hand—the clergyman was on his right-hand—the light comes from the east window—I saw him, as I thought about to open his book, but instead of the book the light fell on the barrel of the pistol—I immediately rose up and screamed out "Seize him," or something, "he has a pistol"—I alarmed the congregation, and saw him at the same time turn the pistol round—I distinctly saw the brass from the light falling on it—I left my seat, calling out during the whole time, came along the stalls towards the body of the church, and came down the steps—while I was on the steps the pistol was elevated by him, and I saw the sparks from the pan—I cannot distinctly say whether it was pointed at any one in particular then, as I had altered my position—my eye was directed more to the pistol than to the direction of it—I went a few days afterwards into the same stall, and Mr. Haden was also performing duty in the same situation, and I was surprised to find that from the situation I was in, and the situation Mr. Haden was in, that if the pistol was turned at all it must be turned in the direction of that clergyman—after I had called out for some moments, the congre-</p>

               <p>gation were alarmed—the pistol was seized by one person close to him, and he was seized by another person—I think the pistol was knocked down—I saw the sparks when the pistol was elevated, and before the pistol was seized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BRYARLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say it was impossible the pistol could be directed otherwise than at the clergyman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not said so—I did not afterwards measure the spot from where the prisoner stood to where Mr. Haden stood, but feel satisfied it was not three yards cer<lb/>tainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether anybody struck the prisoner's arm before the pistol went off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was some struggling—the impression on my mind is that the sparks were distinctly discharged from the pistol before the prisoner was touched—though I had left my seat, I think I could see the whole that was going on—I kept my eye distinctly on the pistol, and on his hand—he sunk his hand, certainly, after raising it—he raised the pistol, and discharged it—whether he discharged it at any person I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that in the interval nothing was done between his holding the pistol in the direction you suppose, his presenting it, and it going off—were you so placed as to tell the pistol could not have been raised, taken down, and after<lb/>wards go off in the scuffle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, certainly not—it did not go off in the scuffle—the pistol was not seized, nor was he seized till the sparks had been emitted from the hammer—he was very sullen afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have measured to see where Mr. Haden was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I measured the distance I was at from the prisoner before I removed—I was about twenty feet from him, nearly in a straight line.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BRYARLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in a state of great agitation, or ia a condi<lb/>tion to notice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not so agitated but I intended to seize the man, had I been near him—of course I was very much alarmed at such an extra<lb/>ordinary circumstance, believing the man to be about to enter into the de<lb/>votions of the service, and then to have a murderous attempt, I of course was alarmed—I should be sorry to say I was not agitated.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the muzzle of the pistol appear to be pointed so as to reach the clergyman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was most certainly elevated, and not elevated to strike any one level with the prisoner, but if discharged, the ball or contents must go above the heads of the congregation on the floor, but what the pre<lb/>cise direction the muzzle of the pistol was I cannot say—when he discharged it I was further from him—when I saw the sparks—I was then more behind him, and in a lower situation—I had descended a step or two, and got into the body of the church—I think I was on the last step.</p>

I was in St. Paul's cathedral when this hap<lb/>pened—I was on the left hand side of the prisoner, on the north side, sitting close to him—he was on a seat on a level with the floor—about the middle of the prayer for the Queen, I heard somebody scream out, "He has a pistol"—I turned round and saw the prisoner standing up and aiming a pistol at the gentleman who was reading—I heard the snap of the pistol, and saw two or three sparks from the flint—two or three persons ran and seized him—I was next to him, on the other side of the clergyman—the clergyman was one seat higher than the floor—before I heard the snap of the pistol, a per<lb/>son behind tried to knock, the prisoner's arm down with an umbrella, and an<lb/>other seized his arm, but let go—the umbrella struck him on the arm he was holding the pistol with—the blow had no effect on his arm—he still con<lb/>tinued</p>

I was at St. Paul's cathedral on this afternoon, in the choir, standing under the organ—after the anthem, during the prayer for the Queen, I saw the prisoner in the act of presenting a pistol at the gentleman who was reading the prayer—I immediately rushed forward, and laid hold of him—I kept hold of him—he said, "You need not hold me so tight, for I am not going to run away"—I was, I should suppose, about four or five yards from him before I moved—I was leaning against one of the pillars under the portico of the organ—some one had succeeded in knocking the pistol out of his hand when I got up, and before I got hold of him—I should say the pistol was pointed in a parallel line with the gentleman who was reading the prayers—whether it was intended for that gentleman I cannot take on myself to say—I did not hear any snap, or see any sparks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a verger of St. Paul's cathedral. I was there on the 1st of April, sitting under the Bishop of Llandaff, the dean of the church—the Rev. John Clarke Haden was officiating—I saw no part of the transaction till the bustle of securing the prisoner—I examined the pistol which he had—it was presented to me by the persons who took it from the prisoner, I understood—the lock was open—I should imagine it had been struck by the hammer—the hammer was down—there did not appear to have been any powder in the pan—the lock was in the state it is now—there did not appear to have been any powder in the pan—I examined the barrel—I found the end of the muzzle stopped up with a piece of paper twisted up very tight—when I took it out there were five or six shots, No. 4, or about that size, and the smallest quantity of powder imaginable, and no wadding be<lb/>tween the powder and shot—if the paper had not been put into the end of the muzzle, the least movement of the pistol would have made the shot drop out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the City police.

"To E. R. Sintzenich, Esq., 41, Moscow-road, Bayswater, April 1, 1843. Dear Brother,—I wish to inform you of the situation I am in; I took it into my head this afternoon to have a pop at the clergyman in St. Paul's, and am now in a police-station in an alley that leads out of Fleet-street. I don't care much about it, as I did no harm; but be so good as not to tell papa and mamma yet, as it will put them out. My examination comes on on Monday at twelve o'clock, as I hear. I want you to come to see me, and no one else till I see you; but it did exasperate me above a bit when I heard the fellow calling the usurper, Queen, when I have lately discovered that James Stuart is the right sovereign. Give my love to all, and tell them not to be uneasy about me. Inquire for me at the police-station, Fleet-street."</p>

               <p>shot could not have reached the clergyman—the quantity of powder shown to me would decidedly not have removed the shot that distance—I have no doubt of it—I went to the prisoner's house next morning—I applied to exa<lb/>mine his books and papers, and was permitted to do so without any trouble whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By whom were you shown this small quantity of pow<lb/>der? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was handed by some of the authorities in the cathedral to the officer who had the prisoner in custody—he had it in a small bit of paper when it was shown to me—I did not see it taken out of the pistol—it was about ten minutes after the prisoner was taken that it was shown to me—I cannot say how many hands it had passed through—it was not Mr. Lingard that showed it to me—it is not unusual for the flint of a pistol or gun to strike sparks without igniting the powder, if it is in the pan—if a pan is pro<lb/>perly charged with powder to go off, you will generally see some little soil on the hammer, and there was none whatever on the part of the hammer that presses on the pan—had it been primed as pistols usually are, it would have left a little foulness—the portion of charcoal in the powder would have caused that—I think a pistol having powder in the pan, and powder dropping out without being ignited, would probably leave a mark; it is usual; I am speak<lb/>ing generally of what I should conceive would be the case.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BRYARLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not almost invariably the case, when powder is put into the pan, that some will remain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The generality of powder used, the common kind, from the greater portion of charcoal being mixed with it, would decidedly leave a portion to cause a soil, so as to be shown when rubbed, and the powder shown to me appeared to be a very inferior large grain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If priming was put in the pan of a pistol, and fell out without igniting, could you then detect whether there had been powder or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I conceive that would depend on the quantity of powder put in the pan—the smaller the quantity the less chance would there be of its leaving any sign.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>seemed in violent agitation—at last I heard the words, "The pistol" pro<lb/>nounced—I immediately turned my eye under where I was sitting, and there saw the prisoner, at the very instant my eye caught him, throw his right arm round, as if endeavouring to extricate it from the grasp of somebody behind, I saw a pistol in his hand—it was then extended to about an angle of forty-five degrees, towards that part of the choir in which the communion-table is placed—there were two gentlemen sitting on the seat immediately behind him, and when the pistol came in contact almost with their heads, they seemed to shrink back, almost involuntarily—the gentleman who gave the alarm immediately cried out, "Seize the pistol!" when one of them darted his arm forward with the utmost rapidity, and grasped the barrel of the pistol—a very short struggle took place, in which the pistol was snapped, as if the man's hand was on the trigger, and the act of drawing it out of his hand had caused it to go off—I observed something white protruding from the mouth of the pistol—the man was then seized and taken away—immediately after the service I went into the vestry, where he was secured—the policeman gave me the pistol, and I drew a dirty white paper from the muzzle—there were two inches of it protruding from the muzzle—I found some paper at the bottom of the pistol, besides what was in the muzzle—it was in the barrel—it was crum<lb/>pled paper—Mr. Lingard extracted it with a piece of wire—I took the paper, and spread it open on the vestry table, and should think twenty or thirty grains of powder dropped from the paper—it was apparently inclosed in the paper with the shot, which had dropped out when I spread it on the table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you of opinion, supposing the paper to have been set fire to, that it would have projected the shot, that it would have gone off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I am accustomed to fire-arms, and in my opinion it could not have ex<lb/>ploded—it did not appear to me to have been primed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you find any powder in the pan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None—I as<lb/>sume it was not primed, from the quantity of sparks emitted—if it had been primed it would have exploded, probably from the sparks—they appeared sparks from the flint and steel—I observed then it was a flint and steel pistol—I saw the charge drawn by Mr. Lingard—I do not know how for down the barrel it was—I was sounding it myself with the wire before he drew it—it was down quite at the breech of the pistol—it is my firm belief the powder and shot were inclosed in the paper—I cannot distinctly say whether they dropped from the paper, or followed it when it was drawn out, but am perfctly clear the grains of powder were inclosed in the paper, for I brushed them off from it on opening it—I do not think they adhered to the outside of the paper—after the paper was drawn, Mr. Lingard put the wire down the barrel again, stirred it about, and on rapping the muzzle on the table, a small quantity of powder came out, with a great quantity of rust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the next thing to the touch-hole was powder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may be so—there certainly was a few grains of powder at the bottom of the pistol, mixed with rust—I was immediately over the spot where the occurrence took place—I was next to Mr. Haden—the prisoner was between me and the person who seized the pistol—his face was towards me—the person who seized the pistol was behind the prisoner—the pistol has a very large touch-hole, and if it had been loaded with powder, a great quantity of the charge must have come into the pan—if the trigger had been pulled without igniting, it is very pro<lb/>bable a great quantity of the charge might have been lost.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I wish to say, on account of the last gentleman's evidence, that the pistol was directed towards the communion table—I think it right I should state the impression I had on my mind when I saw the sparks from the pistol—I was either on the steps, or in the body of the church, and</p>

               <p>from that situation, whether the pistol was directed to the clergyman, or more towards the communion-table, as the gentleman has said, I cannot say; but it appeared, from the situation I was in, it was directed more towards the com-munion-table than towards the clergyman; but I think that appearance arose from my altered situation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the police. By desire of Mr. Powrie, I was concealed with him in a room over the back parlour, above the shop, where we had command of his shop about a quarter or twenty minutes after eleven o'clock, on the night of the 26th of April—the prisoner had been pointed out to me—about a quarter after four, I heard the lock go leading from the bake-house to the shop—I heard the turning of a key in the lock—I saw the prisoner go into the shop with a pot with a candle stuck into it—I saw him turn round into the parlour under where I was—I lost sight of him for about seven minutes—I then saw him come into the shop and try the desk, which was placed against the window—he could not open that—he then opened a drawer, and took some biscuits from it, put some into his pocket, and commenced eating them—I went round to the side door to secure him—I was without my boots—I took him into custody in the shop—I told him I belonged to the police, that he had been suspected of robbing his master some time, and must consider himself in my custody—he commenced break<lb/>ing the biscuits and putting them into his mouth—he said he would be d----d if he would be accused—I took him into custody—I found the shop-door open, and received a pair of pincers from Mr. Powrie—I examined the door, and saw this end of the key projected about one-eigth of an inch through the lock, so that it might be turned, and by the constant application of something the key was worn away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver and stationer, and carry on busi<lb/>ness at No. 115, Fleet-street. On Wednesday, the 8th of February, Smith made a communication to me as to somebody calling—next day the prisoner called—he did not say who or what he was—he asked me if I could execute a document exactly like this—this is the paper he produced—(<hi rend="italic">marked</hi> "A")—I told him I could—he asked how much it would be, I said I thought about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that waa for the engraving, including 1,000 impressions—he said he thought that was a great deal of money—I said there was a water-mark in it, which was not in my department, that I should have to get it done, and I did not exactly know what they might charge for it—(there is a water-mark in the centre)—I think I then told him if he would leave it till, the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184305080058"/>
               <p>next day I would tell him exactly what I could do it for—he agreed to that, and left the shop, leaving the paper with me—after he was gone I examined the paper more minutely—I observed in the centre of it the initials "C. P." with the words "credito publico," and that was also in another part of the paper, like a water-mark, round the stamp—in consequence of discovering those words, I consulted Mr. Withers, a friend of mine, who is a cashier in the London and Westminster Bank—in consequence of what passed I went that same afternoon to St. Mary Axe, and saw Mr. Vanzalla, the Consul-General of Portugal—Mr. Vanzalla told me something, and gave me some instructions—next day the prisoner came again—I told him I had looked at it, and there was not so much work as I had thought, and I could do them, the first thousand for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a thousand afterwards, as he said he should want a great quantity—he said that was nearer the price—before he came that day I had seen Mr. Bush, of the firm of Bush and Mullins, solicitors for the prosecution—the prisoner took the paper away with him, and said I should see him in a day or two perhaps—in all my subsequent interviews with the prisoner I acted under the advice of Mr. Bush—I knew what I was about—I saw the prisoner again on Monday, the 13th of February—he brought the same paper marked "A"—he said that I should execute the order, and to let him have them as soon as possible, 1,000 first, but it was not to be stinted to that—I said it was usual for strangers to leave their address or a deposit—I think he said, "Quite right"—he gave no address, but he put a half-sovereign down on the counter, and said, "Will that do?"—I said, "Yes"—he then left—in consequence of the paper not being in my line I went to Mr. Saunders, a well-known paper-manufacturer, on the next day, the 11th—I left the paper marked "A" with Mr. Saunders, pointing out the water-mark—I saw the prisoner two or three times after that, up to the 25th of February, when he called—he merely came to inquire if the paper was ready—I told him I had got the paper in hand—on the 25th I had some paper from Mr. Saunders—I showed the prisoner one of those pieces of paper with the water-mark—I have not got the one that I showed him, but I have a similar piece, from the same mould—it is marked "B."—there are the figures "1000" in a circular wreath—he objected to the way in which the leaves were done—he compared it with the original—he pointed out to me what alteration it required—I said I thought it might be done—he shortly left, promising to call again—he called again on Monday, the 27th of Feb.—I had been engaged on the plate during that time—I showed him the plate which I bad been at work on—this is the plate—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it was not quite finished—I told the prisoner so—I had not taken any proof from it at that time—I think the pri<lb/>soner complained about my being so long about it, but he did not complain about the plate—I promised to let him have a proof on the following day—he came again on the Wednesday—I then showed him a proof similar to one which I produce, marked "C"—that was the state of the plate on that day—on seeing that, he pointed out some alterations which he wished to be made in the engraving of the plate—he called on several occasions, and watched the progress of the plate, and the alterations I was making—he pointed out what he found fault with in the proofs that I produced to him—he was present on several occasions when I altered the plate itself—he stood over me while I did it—I recollect his doing so on the 29th of March—the alterations I then made are marked here on this proof, in pencil—he pen<lb/>cilled them, and I took my graver and altered the plate whilst he stood by—I think the alterations he then required was the white part of the "C" to be thinner—it is in the flourish over the "C"—that is what I call part of the</p>

               <p>"C"—it is not united with; the "C"—it is the "C'upon which the word "credito" is—the flourish comes over the "P," and then touches the "C"—there is another mark at the bottom of the "C," which be also pencillef—the "P" and "C" are both altered—the mark at the bottom of the "C" was to make it thinner, not to show so much white—he stood over me whilst I made those alterations with my gravet—on Saturday, the 18th of March, he called and asked for a proof—he said be wished to send it off by the post that even<lb/>ing—I gave him one, and he took it away with him—he said he wished to go to Paris, and that I was putting him to a deal of expense by stopping in Lon<lb/>don—on the 25th of March he came again, and had two more proofs—I think he said he was going to send them by the post—on that day there was some alteration made on this piece of paper, marked "F," by his direction—I do not know whether he was present on that day when I made this alteration—I made the alteration he requested—on the 28th he called again—I showed him a proof—I produce one marked "G"—he marked certain alter<lb/>ations on that, to be done by me—he then said that would do—I think those alterations were made whilst he staid—those on the 28th I know were—he called on Wednesday morning, the 29th, and suggested alterations, which I have named—I was then at work on the proofs, and showed them to him—he waited while I was doing them, and saw them after the alterations were made—he then said that would do—he said he should want 2000 on the fol<lb/>lowing Saturday, and more next week—he came on Saturday, the 1st of April, and wished four early in the morning—I gave him four—they were quite perfect engravings from the plate, and the dies, water-mark, and all—I told him I was sorry I could not let him have the 2000, and said I most let him have as many as I could by five that afternoon—he said he would call at three to see how I was getting on—he called afterwards, and took 1000 with him on that day—he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account on that occasion—I proceeded to make out a receipt, and asked him what name I was to draw it in—he said, "Mello"—he was looking over the desk, and seeing me write it, told me how to spell it—he said, "M-e-1-l-o"—this is the receipt—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he left me about four—that was the last time 1 saw him before he was in custody before the Justice—he spoke in English on all these occasions—on one occasion he left with me this paper, marked "D"—it is part of a bill—the original paper, marked "A," had been lying about the work-board—I wanted a more perfect specimen to work from, and he left me this to enable me to copy the stamp the better—Smith produced to me the paper marked "E"—I have three dies here—one is the die of the "1000," the water-mark in the middle of the paper—one has got "C. P.," with a little border round it, and the other has "C. P," raised lip with "Credito publico," that was for the striking up—they work together.</p>

I do not know what you are going to do with them when you get them"—my engraving is done at the back part of the shop, quite away from the front shop—persons at the counter would not see what was going on in the back room, where I was engraving—when I made the alterations in his presence, I was at a bench that I work at, at the very end of the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the solicitors for the prosecution. Three let<lb/>ters were produced to me by Forrester, of which this is one—I produced them before the Lord Mayor on the prisoner's examination, and in his presence, about a fortnight or three weeks before he was finally committed, and nearly a fortnight after he was taken—they were sealed—in the presence and hearing of the prisoner and his solicitor, I applied to the Lord Mayor to open them, as a Magistrate—the prisoner and his solicitor objected to their being opened, as I understood from their conduct—I applied to the Lord Mayor to open them, and objections were made on the part of the prisoner, principally, I should say, by his solicitor, who is here—his Lordship refused to open them—I then stated I should apply to the Secretary of State in the proper manner, which I did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Consul-general in England to the Portuguese Government—my counting-house is at No. 15, St. Mary Axe. I am acquainted with the mode of drawing Portuguese Government bills—they are drawn upon a Financial agency in this country, by the Minister of Finance—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one of the impressions</hi>)—this is the form in which a bill is drawn by the Portuguese Government upon the Financial agency in this country—(<hi rend="italic">looking at paper "A"</hi>)—this is a genuine Portuguese Government bill on the Financial agency here—it is an original bill, already paid—they are partly engraved and partly written—this bill is drawn by the present Minister of Finance at Portugal, whose name is Do Tojal—I have seen his handwriting very often—I did not see him write this—I believe it to be his, or it would not have been paid—I should say he is a person who has authority from the government to draw bills—the engraved part of this bill marked "A," is like the other, which I have in my hand, marked "J. B."—I should suppose "A" to be a genuine bill—it is not filled up—this, marked "J. B.," is a copy of it, as far as the engraving goes—it appears to be an imitation—it is like it in the water-mark, stamp, and the letters "P. C."—the words, "Credito Publico," in those letters, means "public credit"—that is the form in which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184305080062"/>
               <p>Government bills are generally drawn—I know the form in which private bills are drawn in Portugal—private individuals have their own forms, which they have stamped at the board of public credit, exactly as they are stamped at the Excise-office here, that is when they take their own paper—the bills 80 drawn have not the "P. C," "Credito Publico," engraved upon them—I have never seen it on them—the paper which private individuals take to be stamped has the water-mark—I do not know that it is a water-mark, it has the stamp, the sum of money, 1000 reals, or 500 reals—I do not know whether it is done by water-mark or a stamp, but they have the impression of the value of the bill, if it is a 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bill or a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill, or something of that sort—the "1000" in the corner means 1000 reals—that is a mark of the government—private bills have that mark, and also the stamp in the middle, the "1000," or whatever it may be, with a wreath round it—that is the value of the stamp—this is a private bill—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—this has "2000" stamped in the middle, and also at the side—that means 2000 reals—1000 reals is fifty-four pence by the present exchange—the form of a public and of a private bill is different, because a private bill has not the printed "C.P." at the top, with "Credito Publico" round it, and I believe in the stamp also it has not "Credito Publico"—I have generally seen bills like that—I have in my hand one of the blank forms, and a genuine bill filled up in writ<lb/>ing—if the blank form was filled up in writing like the genuine bill, I should take it to be a government bill—I do not myself know the distinction be<lb/>tween the one and the other—I saw Mr. Reynolds the first day or the day after he saw the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you gave authority for all that Mr. Reynolds did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I put him in communication with Mr. Bush—I was informed that Mr. Reynolds had been applied to to do something, and I told Mr. Bush to do what he thought proper with reference to it—I have been consul-general since 1830, I think—I was 'in Portugal about two years ago—I was born there—I should take the paper on which this blank form is engraved to be Government paper, because it is very equal to the original bill—the difference between this paper, and the paper of a private merchant is the "C. P." and "Credito Publico"—the introduction of those words is a criterion by which I form my judgment that this is a good paper, and none other—Government have drawn upon other paper, upon unstamped paper—private individuals draw upon paper of this kind, with "Credito Publico" on it—they buy bills from persons employed by Government, just like you buy in England of persons appointed to sell stamps—if the Portuguese Govern<lb/>ment had to draw on the Finance Agency here, they would draw on such a bill as this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose that stamp to be in the hands of a private individual, could he not draw upon it a perfectly innocent bill, as between merchant and mer<lb/>chant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is always done—if a fraud was contemplated on the Govern<lb/>ment, by the filling up, it would be perfectly easy to insert in that portion of it the address of the Commissioner of Finance—the address to the Com<lb/>missioner would be writtee—it is a blank bill—this blank form is used both for the Government and for private individuals—it may be used either as a Government bill or a private bill—I cannot say whether the "Credito Publico" denotes that the tax for the stamp has been paid—if a person goes to a shop and buys this, of course be pays for the stamp—it is the form of the Portuguese stamps, bills and stamps—the Board of Public Credit issue these exactly like the Stamp Office issue theirs, part in blank—the stamp "Credito Publico," shows that the amount mentioned in the water-mark has been paid for the stamp—that is all it denotes—the plate from which the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184305080063"/>
               <p>2000 private bill was taken, was engraved by order of the firm whose name appears on it—there is nothing to prevent the engraving of that portion of the stamp which I find on this bill, by any private merchant, who after paying the stamp on it, uses it as a private bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the stamp affixed after the bill is printed, or is it affixed before, and issued with a blank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the blank form goes to the Board of Public Credit, or Stamp Office, and there it is stamped—they do not stamp the "P. C." and "Credito Publico"—they stamp this in the middle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the letters "P. C," and "Credito Publico" are not stamped by that board? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, in one way—in the same way as the other, but not the printed, not the engraved "P. C."—the "P. C." and "Credito Publico," in the raised part is put on by the Board of Public Credit—the "P. C." and "Credito Publico," which are printed at the top, is not put on in private bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Not where the party has a private plate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nor any private bills—I have not seen otherwise—I have had a great many bills drawn upon me, and I have never seen that in any—I believe if you look at that private bill, you will not find "Credito Publico" in the round part, you will only find "C. P."—that is supposed to be the stamp put on the bills that they sell.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A party preparing for drawing bills, would not put on this stamp himself, he would have it stamped by the Portuguese Government? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly like that—he would have a blank form, and have it stamped by the Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is it that the Portuguese Government, when a private bill is carried to them to be stamped, put on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You will see in that pri<lb/>vate bill what they put—they put this round mark with "C. P." in the middle—the 1000 reals in the water mark, or whatever the amount is, means the amount of the stamp—what they put on does not contain the words "Credito Publico" at all—I do not think they ever put the stamp with "Credito Publico" on a private bill—I think not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

P.," and "Credito Publico" in the water-mark, and "C.

Lacy and Reynolds, gum makers, in Great St. Helen's, from all of whom I can have a character—I took you into my house when you were so destitute that you had not a meal's victuals, and gave you shelter; and when I left I recommended you to Mr. Cox—there was an Arnott stove in the shop I let to Cox—I never said that I had bought it on the cross—I remember two men coming in one evening with a quantity of cigars to sell—I do not know how they obtained those cigars—I knew them to be dealers in cigars; and from the price I paid, they could have come by them honestly—they had them in a paper parcel, not in their hats—I recollect a person who called himself a minister being there one evening, when a sailor lost his tobacco-pouch, and you and your friend Williams knew more about it than any one else—I did not stand before a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man and an<lb/>other man with a paper in my hand, to hide them from the minister while they took the tobacco-pouch out of the sailor's pocket—it is all false.</p>

About four o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing of the 3rd of May, I met the prisoners in Rose-lane, Spitalfields—Fuller was drunk, and Riley was leading him—I went up to them in George-yard, and asked Riley if he knew Fuller—he said he did, he was his brother—he was then lying on the ground—I saw this stiletto projecting out of Fuller's trowsers—I told Riley I should take Fuller to the station, for being drunk—he said I should not—I then went to remove the instrument from his pocket, and found there a pearl knife, tobacco-box, silver tooth-pick, a silver scissors-sheath, one coral ear-ring, a pearl stiletto, thirty-nine farthings, and nine half-pence—I told another constable to secure Riley, which he did—I found in his pocket a brass candlestick, a pair of boots, one in each pocket, a shawl in his breast, and a ladies' cloak between his shirt, waistcoat, and trowsers—I took them both to the station—I found in Riley's hat, 3lbs. weight of tobacco—he had a bottle under his arm, which I believe contained rum—I proceeded to the place where he gave his address, Blue Anchor-yard, Rosemary-lane, I made inquiry and found the side-door of the George the Fourth, Rosemary-lane, was found open about four o'clock in the morning—that is about half a mile from where I found the prisoners—I found the landlord standing inside—he accompanied me to the station, and identified the property I found on both prisoners—Riley said the boots were his own, the cloak was his wife's, and the tobacco his brother's, meaning Fuller, who he said was a tobacconist and cigar manufacturer—the prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel.</p>

On Monday evening, the 20th of March, I went to a beer-shop in Newman-passage, and saw Mortlock—I heard him ask somebody if there was a person of the name of Walker, who let out trucks—a person who stood by the side of me said, "Mrs. Walker you are wanted"—I turned round, and said, "What do you want?"—Mortlock said he wanted the hire of a truck—I told him my name was Walker, and asked what sort of a truck he wanted—he said, "Merely a small one"—I told him to go with me to where my trucks stood, in Rathbone-place—he went with me—I put my hand on a little green truck, and said, "Will this do!"-he said, "I think that will do"—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said, to carry a light bed—I asked where he was going to take it—he said, "To Mr. Line, No. 7, Rathbone-place"—nothing was said about what he was to give for it—there is a regular price, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour—he took it away with him—I never saw it again till the 18th of April, when it was at the station—I should not sell it for less than 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is my husband's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live in Bowling-street, Clerkenwell. I have known Williams five or six years—about the 14th or 15th of March he hired part of a cellar of me, in Twister's-alley, Bunhill-row—on the morning of the 21st of March I found a track in my yard, with two oil-jars alongside of it—I went up to breakfast, and about nine o'clock Williams came to me to take the truck and jars to the cellar—he told me he had brought the truck there—my wife told me something, and I saw him take it away—oil-jars are heavy things, and require a truck—I said it was a nice, handy, light truck, just such a one as I was in want of in my business—he said he be-lieved it was for sale—I asked to whom it belonged, and how much was wanted for it—he said it belonged to a party who had helped him down with the oil-jars—I asked what the party wanted for it—he said, "About 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "I shall see the party in Bunhill-row, to whom it belongs"—he asked me to accompany him, and also a man named Cox, to drag the track, which was in pieces at that time—we put it together, and went to Bunhill-row—he there pointed out a man, who I believe to be Mortlock, as the man who owned the truck—he went and spoke to him on the other side of the way, then came back to me, and Mortlock told me the truck was for sale—I asked him how much he wanted for it—he said, 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put the truck and jars into Wil-</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Her Majesty's Customs, and have been so six years next August—I am stationed in the port of London. On Tuesday evening, the 9th of May, about nine o'clock, I was in company with Davy and Allen, two other officers, at the top of Swan-lane, and observed the prisoner John Hackett coming in the direction of Fresh-wharf, towards Swan-lane—he turned round, looked in the direction in which I was, and started off immediately, down Swan-lane, running as hard as he possibly could—I followed, accompanied by my brother officers, from the top of Swan-lane to the bottom, fifty or a hundred yards—I raised a cry, and he was stopped by two policemen—I came up almost immediately—as he was run<lb/>ning he was unbuttoning his clothes, as I imagined—when I got hold of him I found his trowsers all down—I caught hold of him, put my arms round his loins—he began immediately to lay out with his hands as hard as he could at me, right and left—while struggling, he took the bottles out of his trow<lb/>sers, and threw one of them violently down on the ground—one was removed out of his trowsers—they were large glass bottles—the contents were emptied on the ground—I immediately stooped down, got a handful into my hand, tasted it, and found it was French brandy—there was a crowd assembled—the two policemen, and Allen, and Davy, were there—they proposed to take him to the station in the neighbourhood—we had gone scarcely a yard, when I received two or three violent blows on the right side of my head, which knocked my hat off—they were not given me by John Hackett—I had hold of him—he had struck me several times on the ribs and chest, from the effect of which I am labouring now—he said he would do for me if he was to be</p>

               <p>taken by us—he was so violent, I tried to handcuff him—I could not succeed—he got my finger into his mouth—the blow on the head was from a person I did not see—it made me stagger and reel about for a minute or so, before I could recover myself to turn round and see who struck me—it caused me to let go of John Hackett—the others took hold of him—in a few seconds after I recovered, I saw George Hackett at my back, in the policeman's hands—he was also taken to the station—as we were going, John was handcuffed, with his left hand to George's right hand—he made several attempts at blows at me in the coach, but was prevented by Allen—he said he would knock my b----brains out, making use of a very desperate expression, saying he should not always be in prison, and when he got out he should know where to meet us, and he would see my b----brains when he came out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 171, Oxford-street, and am a jeweller. On the 13th of March a woman came to my shop about six o'clock in the even<lb/>ing—I cannot positively say whether it was the prisoner or not—I believe now it was her—she wished to look at some gold watches, and pointed out one in the window—after some time she said she was commissioned by a young lady, who had lost hers, to purchase one—after some time she selected one at 12 guineas—she soon after selected a chain at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she ultimately</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184305080080"/>
               <p>had six tea-spoons and a key—the total amount was 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—previously to her looking at the spoons she said she wanted some other articles, provided I could give her change for a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I said I had no doubt I could do so, and then she selected the other articles—she produced this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I had not the change at home, and endeavoured to get it, but could not—I returned and told her it was past banking-hours, but if she had no objection I could give her a cheque for the balance—she hesitated a little, but at last agreed to take it, and I wrote a cheque on the Union bank, Argyle-place, Regent-street, for the balance, 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when she produced the note I asked her name and address, which she gave me, and I wrote it on the note, "Mrs. Price, 36, Stafford-place, Pimlico"—just previous to her leaving the shop she said, "You need not doubt respecting the note, (or something to that effect,) I took it of Mr. Wyatt, No. 360, Oxford-street," which I wrote on the note—she then left with the goods and my cheque—she was in my shop, as near at I can judge, half an hour—to the best of my recollection she had either a cloak or a shawl on—she had a white bonnet on—I have no doubt of that, and a black veil—I scarcely observed her face at all—she had spectacles on, and a boa round her neck, as far as I can recollect—I think it was a brown sable one—I did not particularly notice her person—she was sitting behind the counter in the corner—she appeared to me to be rather stout, but I could only see the upper part of her person—I directed one of my apprentices to follow her.</p>

               <p>from my master, I got my hat from the parlour, and followed her—when I got to the shop-door, I saw her ten or a dosen yards off—I am sure it was the same woman—I did not particularly notice her dress—I believe she had a dark shawl on—she had a white straw bonnet on—I do not know what it was trimmed with, but I think black, and a black veil—she had spectacles, and she appeared to me rather stout—I followed her to No. 10, Nassau-street, Middlesex-hospital—I did not lose sight of her only for a moment or two, while she turned the corners; but when I turned, I saw her, and I did not see any other woman like her—I am certain the woman who was in my mas<lb/>ter's shop went into No. 10, Nassau-street—I waited about for three quarters of an hour, but she did not come out that I saw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live with Mr. Polfer, in Old Gravel-lane. On the afternoon of the 12th of April, about four o'clock, I fell in with Moore, in a grog-shop—she took me to her house—as we went up stairs, I took my purse out and counted my money—she could see me—I had seven sovereigns in my purse—I did not give her any thing—I had nothing to do with her—I went to bed, and went to sleep—when I awoke, my money was gone—my purse was in my trowsers when I went to bed—I was not sober when I went to bed—I was when I awoke—I laid awake, and when Moore came in I accused her of robbing me—she said she had not, and went down on her knees—I went out with her about ten o'clock at night, and saw M'Carthy as I was going out—he asked where I was going—I said to give her in charge—he said I should not—I said I would give both in charge; with that he struck me above the brow, and on the side of the nose, and in my eye—he got down between my legs, and tried to throw me over—Moore got away.</p>

Thomas Witcher. I let the room at No. 3, Middleton-buildings, to the prisoner—it was in his occupation.</p>

I am the wife of Isaac Cockley—we live ia White<lb/>cross-street, St. Luke's—the prisoner came to lodge with us in September last, and subsequently worked for me in my house—she was in the habit of making a bed for my apprentice—I missed a blanket from that bed—I asked her about it, she said she had had an accident, and let it fall in some water, and had taken it up stairs to dry—I consulted my husband, and we sent for a sergeant of police—we searched her apartment—the blanket was not found, but I saw a purse found and a printed book, which was the property of my daughter, Isabella Louisa Cockley, and a brooch and a pair of scissors, which are mine—I cannot tell when I missed the brooch, but it was soon after the prisoner was in attendance on me—I made inquiry of her about it several times—she said she did not know anything about it, that she had seen it on the writing-desk, but had not removed it.</p>

I am the wife of George Lowe—we keep a clothes-shop in Union-street, Lisson-grove—on the 22nd of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, the putty was cut away from a square in the window—it was broken before—we heard the crack, and the glass was poshed in, but nothing was taken away—it was put back again; and the next day, at a quarter before four o'clock, I caught the prisoner with his arm in at the same place in the window—he took out these two pairs of shoes, and put them in his other hand—he put his arm in again to take more, but I collared him—he dropped these shoes on the area—he said he hoped I should forgive him—these are my husband's shoes.</p>

I met the prisoner about a quarter past ten o'clock at night, on the 22nd of April, in Abbiey-fields, coming from the direction of Kilburn, with a fustian frock coat in her apron—I asked how she came by it—she said it was her father's, who worked on the railway—I asked if he was going home without a coat—she said, "No, when I brought his dinner down to-day, I brought him his great coat, and I am going to take this one home"—about twelve that night I heard there was a coat lost, and I looked after the prisoner; but I did not meet with her till the Thursday after, when I found her in Salisbury-street, Portman-market—I said, "I want you about the coat I stopped you with on Saturday night"—she said, "Yes, I told you a fine tale, but I did not think you would let me go"—in going to the station, she said, "You will not find the coat; there is another in that; it is not pawned, but sold."</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Long-acre—Wood was my errand-boy—I have been losing screws and buckles for about a year—we could not tell who took them—they went day after day in small quantities—these papers that inclose the buckles now produced have all got my private mark on them—I spoke to Wood on the 27th of April, and accused him of taking them—I said if he did not bring them back I should proceed against him—he made no remark, and I left him—he afterwards communicated with my warehouseman—I went with a policeman to Abbott's house—I saw Abbott, and asked him if he had any buckles of a particular kind, he said, "Yes," and showed me some—I said, "These are not the sort I want, I want some smaller"—he said, "I have not got any, I sold them"—he said he bought them of a boy—I said, "How could you think of buying these buckles of a boy, and giving so small a sum as 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for three dozen and a half," (which he said he did,) "when they are worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen?"—he said the boy was a plater, or his father was—I then looked round, and saw these other things, which are also mine—I said, "These are mine"—he said he had them of a boy who he knew very well—we brought them away, and the policeman took Abbott to the station—these things are all mine, and most of them have my private mark on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. From information I received I apprehended the prisoner on the 31st of March, as he was going into his own lodging at No. 19, Garden-row, St. George's-road, or London-road—I told him what I took him for, and said anything that he said might be used either for or against him—he asked what I wanted him for—I said, "For those notes that you changed on Monday"—I think he said he could explain that, or something of that kind—I said if he did not give a satisfactory ac<lb/>count who he took them of, I must take him into custody—he said he took them of a person named Feeling, a steward or mate of one of the Irish steam<lb/>ers for some stout, and he afterwards said he changed one at Mr. Vaughan's, in the Strand, and deducted 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for some stout he sold to Feeling, and after that he changed the other note at the request of Feeling, at Seeley and Deane's—I asked who Feeling was, and whether he had known him before—he said he had dealt with him before for small quantities of stout—that he had had a dozen or two at a time, but Feeling came on Friday and had a dozen of stout—that he came again on Saturday, and said, "What will you put me in twenty dozen for?" and he ordered twenty-four gross, or twelve gross—I asked where they were—he said at his stores, or warehouse, in Cushion-court—I asked how long he had been there—he said he had left Swallow-street on Monday, and his place of busines was Cushion-court—he said the stout was packed on Saturday by Jones, his cellar-man, and that Feeling came on Monday morning, between eight and nine, and fetched the stout away in his van and truck—he did not know where Feeling lived—I have been since then to Cushion-court—I did not find his name there—there are some cellars there—the first is in a Cushion-court, out of Broad-street, and then there is another Cushion-court, which is a narrow passage—there was a hamper and a few bottles, and the name of Painter on one door—I found some duplicates in the room the prisoner occupied—his wife gave them to me in his presence—he admitted they were his—some of these articles were pawned upwards of twelve months since—one is for three books pawned on the 7th of Jan., for two guineas—one for a book on the 20th of Feb., for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and on the 6th of Feb., an umbrella for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chaser, and live in Clerkenwell-close. On Tuesday, the 18th of April, I was at a tavern at Greenwich, at the fair time—about half-past ten o'clock in the evening I was passing the bar, to leave the tavern, and saw the prisoner—he said nothing, but came close to my person, and took a union pin out of my scarf—the space before the bar was very crowded, but I can speak positively to the prisoner—I had never seen him before—he passed it to another person—I seized the man he passed it to, collared him, and got him down into a corner of the room—I was immediately set upon by six, eight, or ten persons, and was dreadfully treated—I was not able to attend to my business for some days—the man whom I took hold of got away—I bled very much at the time—I got some hot water—it was perhaps half an hour before I could leave the house—I then left, and in going up High-street, Greenwich, I saw the prisoner—I attempted to seize him, and in passing between two oyster-stalls, or something, I was pushed back by a party, and he made his escape—I afterwards got into a fly, and went into the Elephant and Castle—I felt fatigued, and went into the Alfred's Head, near there, and saw the prisoner there—that must have been past one o'clock in the morning—I pointed him out to the police, and he was taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went to No. 4, Bedford-terrace, to sweep the kitchen chimneys. The stove was loose, and behind it I found this pot, which is burnt at the bottom, a coffee-pot, and a lot of old saucepan lids. I put them on one side; and as I was putting the soot into the sack, this other pot fell off the shovel; the servant picked it up, and put it into my sack. I did not see them till the soot was sifted, after I got home. I showed them to my master, who told me to take them home; but my mistress told me not to do so, but to leave them there, or throw them away. I left them in the top room. I left my master about six weeks ago, and set up for myself, and have got a few of his customers from him, and this is his spite. He knew the pots were in the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">White's Defence.</hi> I met the two females on the other side of London-bridge; they asked me to give them something to drink; I said yes, if they came to the house I would. We went and had three or four pots of beer together; they asked me to give them a breakfast, which I did, at eight o'clock. I then said, "I must go to my work." I had got a little way along Southwark-bridge-road, and saw them coming after me. I afterwards looked behind, and saw them with the policemen I met two strange men in the street; this was not one.</p>

James Hough is the clergyman who married them—the clerk is since dead—I did not know Talley before her marriage, and did not know her name, or whether she was single or a widow—she was described as a widow, and was asked in church by the name of Harriet Talley—I recollect that—the registers are usually kept in an iron chest in the vestry; but the clerk being very ill in bed, and not able to get up, and the clergyman being from home, they might be sent for to his house.</p>

               <p>"Mr. Taylor, Waterford Arms, Peckham: Ist April. Dear Ann and George,—I hope you will forgive me for all my past folly, and do the best you can with me with regard to bury me. I have a long time thought of this unhappy death. I see there is nothing but trouble for me, and happi<lb/>ness for others. Your unworthy sister—<hi rend="smallCaps">REBECCA RUMBALL</hi>."</p>
               <p>"Stamford-hill. Dear mother and sisters,—I own I am very much in<lb/>debted to you. I have brought on you an expense which is growing heavy on you. You were kind enough to say you would take him home; I have been thinking there will be much jealousy in your doing so, so I think of ending our lives in the canal, which I hope if George will not see us when alive, he will see us when dead, and hope you will bury us both together, me and my darling boy. I hope you and all my friends will pardon my sins. I am praying, and trying to seek repose in the bosom of God, which I have in vain sought for on earth; my own folly has brought me to this unhappy death. I hope you will think no more of me, but pray that my sins may be forgiven me, and that we may meet again in the next world. I hope you will forgive me. I hope you will all live happy together, my dear sister, you and George. Your dutiful daughter—<hi rend="smallCaps">REBECCA RUMBALL</hi>."</p>

In Jan., 1842, I took the prisoner into our service in consequence of an advertisement, and fully approving of him, I raised his wages to 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week—he boarded and lodged in the house exactly as one of my family—on Sunday evening, the 20th of Nov., he was taken ill, and on the Monday morning he was not able to get up—about a fortnight before that, or between a fortnight and three weeks, I had put into his hands a French gold hunting-watch to have the upper case raised, that the works might be free of the glass—the cases should have been taken off the works—when I gave it to him, I said, "I have determined on having the case raised so that it may free the glass, I have determined not to go to further expense," and I think I said, "It shall go to Fielder, in St. John-street-road," but whether I did or not, he knew that, because he was the only person I employed for that purpose—he was to have sent it by a lad I keep for that purpose, and I should have expected it would have been ready in two or three days, for the boy to have called again for it—it was not necessary that the works should have gone with the case—the prisoner knew that, decidedly—he was taken ill on the 20th of Nov., and a day or two af<lb/>terwards I missed the movement of this watch—he was then very ill—I said nothing to him about it—he resumed his work on the 3rd of Jan., and on the following evening I brought him the whole of his work, which I had taken away from his work-board in the shop—I said to him, "Where is the French gold hunting watch, it is high time that was completed, and fit for stock?"—he said, "Bless me, sir, has not that French gold hunting-watch come home yet? why I sent it pretty nigh a month before I was taken ill; John took it"—I said, "Where to?"—he said, "To Jackson's"—I said, "Who is Jack<lb/>son, is he a respectable man?"—he said, "O yes, a perfectly respectable man; the watch is safe enough"—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said, "At the back of Clerkenwell prison"—I said, "Well, but how is it I don't see the movement of the watch amongst this work which I have delivered to you; there was no occasion for the movement to be away?"—he said, "That is with it"—I said, "For what purpose is the movement with; the case?"—he said, "O, sir, the movement was foul of the dome, it would not close"—I said, "Well, I shall send John after it in the morning"—it was then about six in the evening—he slept in the house that night, and the next morning he got up to assist the lad in opening the shop—I was uneasy, and got up as soon as he did—I was down in the shop some time, and then I went to break<lb/>fast, expecting him to follow me, but he did not come—I found he was gone, and never returned—he had never assigned any reason to me for going, but he seemed to be better that morning—I took some pains to find Mr. Jackson, and inquired at the back of Clerkenwell prison—I found the prisoner on the evening of the 12th of Jan., at No. 4, Victoria-place, Kent-road—after some other conversation, I said, "Now, where is the French gold hunting-watch?"—after some hesitation, he said, "At Mr. Carter's"—I said, "Where</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184305080203"/>
               <p>does he live?"—he said, "In President-street"—I gave him in charge—on the following evening I went to Mr. Carter's, I there found the gold hunting-watch—Mr. Carter also produced to me this pencil memorandum, which is the handwriting of the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"New cover and dome—Deane and Co., 169, Borough"—the dome is the inner case which coven the move<lb/>ment, and the cover is this outer case which I had given instructions to have raised—the effect of putting a new cover and a new dome on this watch, would be that I should not know the watch myself—it would take away the maker's name and the number, and destroy the identity of the watch alto<lb/>gether—I had never given him the slightest authority for any such alteration—it was altogether unnecessary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the P division. In consequence of information, on Sunday, the 30th of April, I apprehended Herne at the corner of James-street—on Tuesday, the 2nd of May, I went to No. 54, James-street, with Kendall—I had heard Rowland lived there-he was not at home—I had some conversation with his wife—he afterwards came in—I told him I had come to his house to make some inquiries relative to some property that had been left at his house by Herne the policeman-I read the list of them from this paper—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"One brown Petershars great coat, one brown cloak, one copper tea-kettle, one brass candlestick, a black velvet waistcoat, a copper scale, with dial, one side of pork, and three pairs of shoes"—he said, "These things were never brought here"—his wife was present, so as to hear that—I said, "You had better be on your guard, your wife has already admitted that the things were brought here"—she said, "You had better tell the truth"—he then said, "On the morning of the 13th of April, between two and three o'clock, I was in the road, near Mr. Myatt's garden, when Herne and Smith came up to me; Herne gave me a side of pork and half a ham, which I carried home; shortly after, while I was lacing my boots, Herne came in with the other things"—Kendall asked him how he was positive as to the day—he said because it was the day before Good Friday, market morning, and that was the reason he was out so early.</p>
