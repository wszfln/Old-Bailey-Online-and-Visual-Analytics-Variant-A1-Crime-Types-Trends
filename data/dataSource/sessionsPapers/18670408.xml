               <p>about twenty minutes past seven, I was in Kensington, and saw the two prisoners with Shirley in a cart—they were all sitting on a seat—there was hardly room on the seat for them to sit—Sheen was driving—they were within about 150 or 200 yards of Kensington Palace Gardens—I proceeded along Kensington Palace Gardens a few minutes after, about a quarter to eight, and outside the gateway of 15A I found the cart standing—Sheen was in it—he looked at me very hard, and turned the horse across the road—I said to him, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "Why?"—I said, "We are police officers (I was not in uniform); I saw you not long since with two other men I know in this cart"—(I am read<lb/>ing from a paper that I wrote at the time, or soon after—next day, when I gave my first evidence—I generally make a memorandum in a case like this)—I did not mention the names of the two others—he said, "You make a mistake, sir"—I said, "No; who are you waiting for here?"—he said, "If you want to know I will tell you; I am waiting for my master, Mr. Green"—I said, "Who is Mr. Green?"—he said, "a butterman near Ebury Bridge, Pimlico"—I sent a young man who was with me to inquire at the different houses, and from what he told me I told Sheen I did not believe him, and should take him to the station—he said, "I can prove I am a respectable man, and live in Lupus Street, Pimlico; I am a stranger in the butter trade business; this horse and cart belongs to my brother-in-law; we have just left a lot of poultry down the road"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "I shan't give you no further satisfaction"—I directed Webb to get up into the cart and keep observation, and I walked by the side of the wheel—I went to 15<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, Palace Gardens—after remaining outside the house about forty minutes an alarm was given, and from what the servant told me I examined the premises—I found that an entry had been made by a person climbing up the portico and getting in at the first floor front window, which I found open, and the catch forced back—there were marks on the window-frame, the woodwork—I found the places in the room broken open—I saw marks of an instrument upon them all—some had been broken open and some had been attempted—the things were strewn over the bed and about the room—on Thursday, 7th February, about noon, I went to No. 1, Plough Court, Fetter Lane, Holborn, and found the prisoner Dundas at breakfast, in the front parlour—I said, "George, I want you for being concerned with Sheen and Harry Shirley in breaking into a house in Kensington Palace Gardens; I saw you and the other two in a horse and cart"—he made no answer for some time—after a time he said, "Who are you?"—I said, "My name is Cole, of the C Division; you know me very well"—I then gave him into the custody of Webb, who was with me—I asked him if that was his room where he was—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he had any other room—he said, "No"—I then searched the room, and in a drawer close to where he was I found the instruments I have produced—after conveying him to the station I went to Mr. Carthew's, and in his presence and Webb's I com<lb/>pared this knife with the marks on the window, and they exactly corre<lb/>sponded—it is a very fine instrument, it goes between the sashes and opens the catch, and exactly fits the mark—this jemmy also exactly corresponded with the marks on the drawers that were broken open and attempted.</p>

               <p>or next day, after I give my evidence—this is not the first time by a great many that I have done so—you have objected to it before, years back when I have given it in evidence that way—I wrote it down that I might make no mistake—I think I shall continue to do so—it was about twenty minutes past seven that I first saw the cart; I always carry a watch, I looked at it, I had to see a gentlemen at a quarter-past seven by order of the commissioner, and that was my reason for knowing the time, it was dark—it was just by Young Street that I saw the cart first, on the opposite side of the way to Palace Gardens—there were then three men in the cart; they drove past me, and I lost sight of them for some time; the next time I saw it there was only one man in it—I know that was Sheen—I did not see either of the other two then; I saw no more of them that night—I did not see Dundas again till I apprehended him, I was looking for him—there was another man in the room with him—I don't know whether it was a lodging-house—he said it was his mother-in-law's—he did not say the things did not belong to him—none of the missing property has been found—it was nearly a month after the robbery that I took Dundas—Sheen was in custody all that time.</p>

               <p>marked, put into an envelope, and fastened it with a piece of gum, and I addressed it, "Mr. Bishop, till called for, General Post Office, St. Martin's le Grande"—at five o'clock the same day I handed it to Bingham, the officer, to post immediately—after that I called the attention of Mr. Forbes and Ennis to it—next morning, about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner in my private room—I said to him, "A money letter, addressed to Mr. J. Bishop, General Post Office, till called for, is missing; do you know anything about it?"—he replied, "I do not"—I said, "It was seen in your hands this morning"—he said, "Yes"—Crocker the constable was present, and he produced a sovereign and a penny, which he said he had found on the prisoner—I did not see him searched—I said to the prisoner, "Where did you get this money from?"—he said, "The sovereign I received from Mr. Robinson for my wages last Saturday"—this was Tuesday—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the one I enclosed in the letter to Mr. Bishop—I showed it to the prisoner, and said, "This sovereign was enclosed in the letter addressed to Mr. Bishop, General Post Office; in fact, in the letter that I have been asking you about; it was in the letter this morning"—he replied, "I cannot tell you any more than I have told you."</p>

I know you have done so until very recently"—he said, "Yes; anything you find there I shall hold myself responsible for"—Elliott had found some keys in the prisoner's trousers pocket, and said, "Are these the keys?"—the prisoner said, "Yes"—we went to the stable, one of the officers unlocked the padlock with one of the keys, Humphreys and Fife entered, and after searching a little time Fife produced three bad florins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner said, "Oh! then somebody else must have put them there that owed me a spite"—he was taken to the station—the bedroom opens from the sitting-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private gentleman, and live at Church Street, Islington—on the morning of 5th March, a little after one a.m., I was near the Angel, Islington—I saw a cab, a cabman, and three other men, of whom Foulger was one—I asked for a light; they gave me one, and I said, "If you are going my way I should be very glad to get into the cab and take my share of the expense"—they agreed, and I got in—we went to Packington Street, where I got out and offered to pay the cabman a shilling—they said, "Do not do that; get in again and come and smoke a pipe with us"—I got in again, and was driven down to Whitmore Street, Hoxton, where we all got out, and they told me I should have to pay the whole expense—while I was speaking to the cabman, one of them put his hand into my jacket pocket—I saw there was something wrong, so I paid the cabman and immediately ran off—two of them followed me, I believe Foulger was not one of those—they threw me down, snatched my watch, and ran off—I saw nothing more of them that night, but gave information to a policeman whom I saw on the canal bridge—after going home I went to the police-station and saw the three pri<lb/>soners there and my watch.</p>

I am married, and resided at 7, Emily Place, in the same house as the prisoners and their deceased child—I occupied the front parlour—the prisoners had the room over it—I was not in the habit of visiting the child—I only saw it twice—I saw he family on the night of the child's death, but I knew nothing of them—I saw the prisoners in pass<lb/>ing through—the last week in December, I think it was, the deceased child came into my room about half-past six in the morning—I heard a peculiar rustling noise and lighted a candle, and underneath the bed in the centre of the room the child was crouching—it looked very thin and emaciated—it was in its night-gown—he spoke to me.

I live at 72, Villiers Street, Bromley—I did live at No. 10 while the prisoners lived at No. 11 opposite—what first drew my attention to the house was one of the windows either having boards or shutters up—those boards were removed when Mrs. Conde was out, and I saw a child, looking more like a ghost than a child, with his head bound up with a piece of white rag—he looked very frightened and seemed quite wild—I saw him standing day after day, with no food what<lb/>ever given to him—I have seen Mrs. Conde fetch a pint of beer daily, and bread and cheese, and give it to her own two children, and she would keep them at the window; they were never allowed to move and play with the other child—they were kept separate—I used frequently to call over to her and tell her to give the child food, but she would never see me or take any notice—I am very deaf—if she had made me any answer I could not have heard her, but my daughter could; she was always at the window with me—the child was standing with his hands behind him and his back against the wall from morning till it was dark at night; I could see him from my window—he stood right facing the window, not in the corner, but behind where the door opened—I saw him once go round to where his mother was standing, and she struck him a heavy blow in the face, which nearly knocked him down—his father was at home, but did not interfere or take the least notice, and he had to go back to his standing-place—this was in the evening in the summer, when the father had come back to his tea; it was upwards of five years ago—I have not seen the child since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered licentiate of the Apo<lb/>thecaries' Company—I was called to the deceased child on Saturday, 16th February, about half-past eleven in the morning—I found him almost wasted to a skeleton; he was alive, but rigid and cold, his mouth and eyes wide open, tongue and throat parched and dry, and pulse weak; he was in bed—I ordered stimulants occasionally and other restoratives, but the child was past recovery and died in a few hours—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination by order of the Coroner—the body was dreadfully emaciated; it weighed 201b. 12oz., and measured seventeen inches round the chest, fourteen inches round the abdomen, six inches round the thigh, and was forty-one inches long—he was about twelve years of age—there were no external marks of violence, except bruises on the arms and hands, as if it had been beaten—they were superficial—there were not more than three or four, and very trifling—I should say they were about a week old—a fall might have caused them, they were on the left hand and arm; there were none on the right—there was no fat between the skin and muscles, and no fat in the body—the cause of death was starvation—there was a total disappearance of the <hi rend="italic">omentum;</hi> the stomach was empty, con<lb/>taining only about half an ounce of dirty creamy fluid—there was no food in the stomach, the intestines were healthy—I know the disease called atrophy—I do not think the appearances might be attributable to that; all the internal organs were perfectly healthy, the intestines were healthy—the lower intestines contained hardened foeces—the liver was healthy and the heart, but pale; there was no fat—the brain and its membranes were healthy—there was no mesenteric disease—if the child was being starved and had not sufficient nourishment, frequent beating would tend to accele<lb/>rate its death, the body being weakened by insufficient food.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cigar manufacturer, of 18, Douglas Road—on the evening of 22nd March I was in Houndsditch at the corner of a court—my coat was unbuttoned, and the prisoner made a snatch at my watch and chain—he did not get the watch, as it was attached by a steel ring, which broke, and the watch slipped back—he ran up the court; I pursued him through several courts into the arms of a detective—I am positive he is the person—when I was crying "Stop thief!" a man said, "What is the matter?" and got in my way—the prisoner passed very close to him.</p>

               <p>only paid me one week's rent, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but at the end of the year they made out a bill of what they owed me for rent, at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week from 1st August, and it amounted to 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Emily has told me that she used to go to the Lord Chancellor's Chambers at Hounslow—they all three left my house on 8th October, 1866—before they left they asked me to lend them some more money, but I told them I had not got any—in December I went to the Chancery Record Office and searched the public books with the clerk—we went as far back as five years, but could not find any entry about Lord or Lady de Fisca, nor anything like Hasted—I also went to the Bank of England and searched in the Will and Probate Department, but could not find anything about a deed in my favour—at various times Emily has asked me to write letters to Lord Wigan, and she promised to allow me so much per cent.—I wrote several letters, and addressed them to Lord Wigan, and she said she was going to take them to him—I think sometimes I was to have as much as 20 per cent., and sometimes less—at last I said it was absurd writing so many letters, but she said there was so much money in the Bank at Paris and it must be disposed of, and I must write them, and I did write them—I know Mrs. Anu Lifford—her husband is an upholsterer—on 7th January she went with me to Newland Street, Kensington—we found Mrs. Hasted and her daughter lodging there—I asked Mrs. Hasted if they had heard anything from the Lord Chancellor—she said, no, and I must wait until they had letters from the Lord Chancellor—I asked Emily why she did not stir them up—she said she could not do that, and that I must wait—I asked her once to go with me to see them—she said, no, she could not go, as they might be offended—I said, "Why should they be offended? if they are Lords, people have a right to go and inquire after their rights"—she said I was to go to the Court of Common Pleas, in Chancery Lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in Messrs. Copestake's employ—I and Mr. Leech have charge of the premises at night—from sixteen to twenty people sleep on the establishment—I was with Mr. Leech and Hancock on the night of 19th and 20th, when the dripping was weighed—there were 561b. and 251b. respectively—I saw it away the following morning, and it appeared to be in the same state as when we had weighed it—I was present when Hills was given in custody on the Saturday—Mr. Leech told him that he was charged with stealing the dripping, and Hancock said, "I have had information that you have been receiving 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for conniving at this"—Hills said, "No, I have not, Sir; I have received 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week," and there was something said about <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> receiving 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week each for skimming the fat from the receptacle—I was present at the station-house when Hills and Skeats</p>

                  </hi>. In September last I was an able seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Raby Castle</hi>—I shipped at Penang—I knew the deceased man Marchien the time I was shipmate with him, that was all—I knew the prisoner two or three days before he came in the ship, at Penang—we were all on good terms together—there was no quarrelling on board, only a bit of a word now and then, but never any quarrelling among us—the prisoner would never take his meals with us—when we were in warm weather the cargo we had in the vessel steamed very much in the fore<lb/>castle, and we went on deck to take our meals, but the prisoner would stop below, and when we got to Cape Legullas it was getting rather colder and we went below, and then the prisoner remained on deck, and the ship was throwing water on board at the time—I heard the prisoner say during the voyage that there was a Russian Fin on board that he did not like, or the like of that—he did not say he would do anything to him to my know<lb/>ledge, not before me—we used to hear him laughing and saying many a thing, but we never used to take any notice—one day it was blowing pretty strong, and he did not go to the wheel that day—he said that the Russian took his wheel that day—that was three or four days before the 24th of November, to the best of my knowledge, but I cannot say exactly—it was his next wheel, and a man named Robert Westhoff took his wheel, not the deceased; we left Westhoff at the Cape of Good Hope—on Saturday, the 24th of November, I turned in about half-past one in the day; the prisoner was then on the fore hatch, putting some fancy work on a man's chest, carving his chest with a chisel—when I turned into my bunk the deceased was tattooing Peter McGrath—I did not see any tools near the prisoner at that time; I know he had tools on board; he had an axe—he kept it in his tool-chest, I think; he had two</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186704080067"/>
               <p>chests—he kept the tool-chest on the starboard side of the port forecastle—I had seen the axe about two or three days before the 24th of Norember—I never saw it after—it was searched for on the 24th—I slept on the port side of the forecastle, and the deceased slept in the bunk above me—I was awoke by a noise above my head; I was almost asleep—I did not know what it was, and I gave a sort of a <hi rend="italic">slew</hi> over—I felt something come dropping on my face; I gave another <hi rend="italic">slew</hi> over again—I felt it come run<lb/>ning on my face then, and I put my hand on my face, and when I took my hand from my face my hand was all blood—the noise I heard was some<lb/>thing like a knocking just above my head—I thought it was too heavy for a man to be moving—I was lying right in my bunk on my right side, with my face towards the ship's side—the blood came down through the bunk boards from above into my bunk; the boards are about an inch apart—when I felt the blood on my face I jumped out of the bunk, looked in the bunk above me, and saw the deceased Marehien laying there with his head almost parted from his shoulders—as I gave a slew over to jump outcome somebody jumped from alongside the bunk towards the forecastle hatchway to go up on the top-gallant forecastle—I could not say who he was—directly after that I called McGrath—the deceased groaned two or three times—I put my hand on his shoulder—there were several cuts on his neck—I put my ear to his chest, and said, "James, James, what is the matter with you?"—he said, "Oh! oh!—that was all he said—I saw traces of blood alongside the bunk—there were drops of blood on my chest and between that and the scuttle—I did not trace them any further—I did not go upon deck then; I paid more attention to the deceased—Westhoff came out of his bunk and asked what was the matter, and he said to the pri<lb/>soner, "Oh I Charley, Charley, you have done it now!"—the prisoner was then on the top-gallant forecastle, and Westhoff was at the foot of the ladder on the forecastle at the time—I cannot say whether the prisoner made any reply, I was in the forecastle, paying more attention to the man in his bunk, I had no clothes on—the prisoner afterwards came down into the forecastle with the captain and Westhoff, and Westhoff asked him where his tomahawk was—he said it was in his chest—they went and looked in his chest, and could not find it there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say that the prisoner did not eat with you and the crew? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I spoke to him about it—he never said to me that he would cut off one of our heads—I believe he said it to some on board the ship—I heard him threaten many times—he never said he would cut off anybody's head exactly, but I heard him say several times that there was a Russian Fin on board—I was examined at the Cape—what I said was taken down in writing—I heard him threaten many a time what he was going to do, but he never exactly said that he would cut off one of our heads that I know of; he said there was somebody in the ship that he was going to do harm to, and he used to call him a Russian Fin and swear at him—he said two or three times that he would cut off somebody's head, that there was a Russian Fin in the ship—he did not say whose head he would cut off—I cannot rightly say whether he was foolish and weak or not when he was at sea, but when he was ashore he was right—he and I used to go and take a bit of a walk at night, and I did not think that the man was anything that way; he might be, I don't know, I cannot say for that; that was at Penang—I did not think he was any way foolish when he was ashore with me—when he was on board we used to paw a joke that he was <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> and the like of that.</p>

Charley you have done it now; where is your hatchet?"—I could see the prisoner's hands, they had blood on them—I believe I spoke to him, but I do not know what I said.</p>

               <p>seven in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner and his wife in the Goat public-house, 41, Verulam Street—that is not very far from where they lived—the prisoner was very tipsy—his wife was sitting on a seat when I went in, with her eyes closed, very queer—I spoke to her, she returned no answer, but shook her head, and soon afterwards fell down between the bar and a vat which stands in front of the bar—I picked her up—her hus<lb/>band assisted me with her across the road to their own house, 12 or 13, Verulam Street; it is opposite the Goat—I placed her on the second step of the stairs from the bottom of the flight which leads up to the first floor, the second step from the passage—her head was then leaning towards the wainscoat—I left her in her husband's hands, and did not see her afterwards—she never spoke a word to me as she went along, nor to her husband—she said, "Harry, come home," meaning her husband—that was before she fell—it was said in a very faint voice.</p>

I am the son of Harriet Hawkins—I was locked in the kitchen on this day—I heard somebody call Mrs. Hawkins, and they called again, "Is Mrs. Hawkins in?"—I said, "No"—I then looked about and found a key, opened the door, went out, looked up, and Mrs. Snelling slipped—Mr. Snelling whs on the top of the stairs with her—she slipped down the stairs—he was the only person there—he was looking at her as she slipped, and I went up, and she fell backwards down to the bottom—when I first saw her she was sitting like this, with one hand like this, and the other like this, on the first stair—there are only nine stairs, and she fell down to the bottom stairs, down to the stones, which are at the bottom—after she had fallen, her legs were in the back kitchen and her head in the front, in the middle like—I could not say what caused her to fall—I went up and she fell—she was not going up stairs when I first saw her, she wanted to come down—when she fell I went up and told Mr. Snelling—he did not come down—he said, "I thought she went up stairs," and then he came down and caught her by the shoulders, and knocked her head on the stones three or four times—I saw him do that—that was after she had fallen—he was ant helping her up—she did not say anything, she only went like this (<hi rend="italic">making a snoring noise</hi>)—after he had knocked her head he said, "Let the b—die"—it was after he got tip stairs he said that.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Francis Hawkins, of 13, Verulam Street—the prisoner has lived on our second floor since 2nd September—he is a painter—on the night in question at ten minutes to seven I returned home from my husband's stables—my little boy spoke to me, and I found Mrs. Snelling lying at the bottom of the stairs—the kitchen is underground—the stairs are old wood, and there are square stones at the bottom—she was insensible, but breathed—I lifted her up and found that I was covered with blood—there was a quantity of blood at the bottom of the stairs and on her head—I sent next door for Mrs. Wallace, and after that the prisoner came down—that was the first time I saw him—I told him she was dying, and I thought we had better have a cab and send her to the hospital—he swore he would not let her go to the hospital—he said he would have her in his own room, and would not have a doctor—I afterwards saw the deceased in her own room; but before that, when the prisoner came down to the kitchen, and I lifted her up, I said, "Mr. Snelling, she will never walk any more;" he then violently gave her a kick, I could not say where; but I understand it was in the stomach—her feet were under her, bent, her head was down, and Mrs. Wallace and I had hold of each arm—I was side-face to the prisoner when he kicked her—I thought she was dying before he gave her the kick—I said that she would never walk again—I sent for two doctors, and then went into her room and saw her on the bed—she lived about an hour from the time that he gave her the kick.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 38, John Street, Bedford Row—on 2nd March I was sent for to the prisoner's wife—I found her lying on the bed quite dead—I examined the back of her head externally; there was an irregular contused wound about an inch and a half long, which had been bleeding—it was at the back of the head, on the right side—on the follow<lb/>ing Monday I opened the head—Sunday had intervened—I found a frac<lb/>ture of the bones at the base of the skull, not corresponding with the wound outside, but lower down—the wound was above the fracture—there could not be a blow at the part which was fractured—I believe the cause of death wae fracture of the base of the skull, causing an effusion of blood on the brain—a fall from a staircase on the stones at the bottom, or on the edge of the stairs, would be likely to produce what I saw—there were contusions on each side of the forehead, and on the nose—that had nothing to do with the cause of death—supposing she had fallen down and received that frac<lb/>ture of the skull, I think a person taking her by the shoulders and knock<lb/>ing her on the hard stones would accelerate her death.</p>

On 22nd February I was on duty in Upper Eccleston Street, and at a little after two o'clock I was near the window of Mr. Glynn's house, which is next door to the Marquis of Down<lb/>shire's house, in Belgrave Square—the two gardens are divided by a wall—I saw the prisoner jump over the wall of Mr. Glynn's house into the street—he went off, and I caught him, without losing sight of him, fifty or sixty yards from where he jumped over—I asked him what he had done over the wall—he said, "What! me?"—I said, "Yes, you"—he said, "I was not</p>

I am a widow, and live at Montpellier Yale, Blackheath—I know the prisoner—I saw him on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, the 11th, 12th, and 13th February—on the Tuesday Miss Reppington came up into my apartments, and said to the prisoner, "Mr. Ralph, I was very sorry I could not cash that bill for you, but we do not keep as much cash in the house"—he said, "It is not of the slightest consequence, Miss Reppington; I can cash it in the morning as I go to town at the bank"—I am sure that was on Tuesday, the 12th—I did not see the bill—I took these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from under my daughter's head in bed on Sunday morning last, read them, and, finding what they were, I took them to the detective—I do not know the prisoner's writing.</p>

I heard a noise outside, took up the pistol, and went out at the back door, when I was stopped by some men, who said I was a thief. I told them it was an untruth, and offered them to search me; they did so; some one threw stones at me, and hit one man on the back of the head. I then returned with them to my grandfather's house, and saw the servant and others. One of the officers asked the servant if I was the man, and she said she did not know."</p>
