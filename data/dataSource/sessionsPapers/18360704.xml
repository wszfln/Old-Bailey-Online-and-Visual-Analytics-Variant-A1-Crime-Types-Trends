                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On the 14th of June I was at the Cross Keys public-house in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, with my wife—we were drinking there—the prisoner was there—I was in another part of the room—I had had a quarrel with the prisoner on Easter Tuesday last, about his wife abusing my sister—on Tuesday, the 14th of June, I went into the tap-room, and had been there about twenty minutes when the prisoner got up and began in his usual way, and challenged me to fight him—asked me would I fight him, and he was saying he did not care and—about any man in the house—he did not strike me—he stripped to fight—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Mike</hi>, you owe me an old grudge, ever since Easter Tuesday"—I said I would fight him in fair play, in the middle of the tap-room—the publican of the house heard the noise, came down, and, knowing what sort of a man he was, he put him out of the house—he did not put me out—I did not see the prisoner come in again—no blows had been struck by him or me before he went—I said there about half an hour, and my wife and I then went home together—this was between twelve and one o'clock—I had to go about two minutes' walk to my home—I live in Hobbs'-court, Castle-street—when I got up to the end of the narrow part of the court I saw one of the prisoner's legs—he was standing at a corner, at the end of the narrow part of the court—he was concealed—it is a dark court, and has no lamp in it—I know it was the prisoner—I knew him perfectly well, because he had been a neighbour, and his brother-in-law lived next door to me—the prisoner lives in Castle-street—the place I saw him in was not in his way home—the court is no thoroughfare—he was behind a wooden partition, which divides the yard from the court where I live—when I first saw his leg I had just time to look at him, and he had a weapon in his hand, holding it with his two hands—it seemed much like the weapon the officer has in his custody—I had only time to see him with the blow—I was struck on the left side of my head—I became insensible, and can not remember any thing that happened afterwards.</p>

On the 25th of June, the two prisoners came into the shop, and one asked for a cravat like the one round his neck—I told him I had not any like it—one said to the other "Let us go; we will call again on Monday"—I said it would be of no use, as we did not keep the article—a gentleman then came in, and took one by the shoulder, and said, "You rogue, you have been thieving"—he said he had not—these handkerchiefs were then on the floor, and the place in the window where they had been was vacant—these are the handkerchiefs—King was the one nearest to them—they had not asked about these hand<lb/>kerchiefs.</p>

I am certain—I went to Mr. Wheeler about eight o'clock, and he came to the house, No.30, about ten o'clock; but I did not see him go in—I was looking out, about ten o'clock, and saw the prisoner run from No.30 and get on to No. 31, and jump across a court, to No. 32—he was in my sight all the time—when he came to 34, I called to him, as he was directly facing me—I saw him pursued—he got down a trap-door and walked out at the front door of a house—when I saw him at five o'clock he was about thirty yards from me—I could distinctly see him.</p>

Mellish has lived in my service for the last twenty months as carter—on Sunday, the 26th of June, I left my premises in care of Charles Lane, at eleven o'clock in the morning—he is about sixteen years old—the counting-house desks were locked at that time, and I had the keys with me—I returned about a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, and found Lane there and two policemen—I went into the count<lb/>ing-house and found both my deskes broken open, and missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—all the articles were safe in the counting-house when I left in the morning, except the flute and snuff-box which were in the parlour adjoining—I lost 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in copper off the parlour-shelf—there were twelve pence, I am certain, and the rest in half<lb/>pence.</p>

On the 26th of June, about past five o'clock in the morning, I was going from Whitechapel, down Petticoat-lane, towards home, and met the prisoner with another girl—they both asked me if I would treat them, two or three times—I said I had no objection if there was a house open—they took me down George-yard, but the house was not open—I sat down on the bench, and one of them sat in my lap in the open yard, and the prisoner sat on the left-hand of me and put her hand into my pocked—I said if she did not take her hand out of my pocket I would knock her down—I wanted to get up, but could scarcely get away—at last the girl got off my lap and they both ran away—I felt in my pocket and my money was gone—I caught hold of them both, the other one tore her shawl and got from me—I called "Police"—the policeman came up and the prisoner threw 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of her hand—the prisoner is the one whose hand was in my pocket—I found the money safe after she took her hand out—but she put her hand in again directly after and took it—I felt her hand in my pocket—I lost between 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Henry Locock, of Myddleton-square. Mr. Brown was our chimney-sweeper—on the 10th of June, I saw the prisoner in the kitchen—they had then finished sweeping the chimney as far as they could—they said they were too large to get up—they wanted to no away and get a little boy, but we missed a purse, and some money, which had been in the dresser-drawer, in the kitchen?—I had seen it secure the even<lb/>ing before—it was then clean, and no one been in the house but me and the servants—we had been absent from the kitchen, and when we returned the purse was gone—the prisoners then wanted to go away—they went into the hall to go—I said, I was sure they had robbed me of the money—I locked the door, and sent the housemaid up to tell my master—I stood in the hall—Thomas then went down and said he would go and sweep the soot up—he was down for some time—I saw the purse after it was found—they said, they came from Mr. Brown—this is my purse.</p>

At a quarter-past five o'clock the prisoners came to the area gate, and rang the bell—they walked down into the front kitchen—I went into the back kitchen and left them thee—I went into the kitchen again, and came out again, and then Sarah Nicholls told me to go and look for the, money—it was not there, nor the purse—I said they must have got the money—they denied know<lb/>ing any thing about it—I asked if they came from Mr. Brown—they said, yes they did—they said, they were too big, they would go and fetch a little boy—I said they should not go—I went and told my master—he came down soon after—the purse was at last found by the nurse under the plate<lb/>basket, under the dresser, all over soot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a willow-cutter. I was at the public-house with the prosecutor—the prisoner was there in company with Rachael Adams—I had kept company with her before that and I had fallen out with her about a week—I did not strike her that night—I said I would strike her when I got down—but I do not think the prisoner heard that, because he was looking another way—about a quarter before eleven o'clock, the landlord desired the company to go, because one of then began to sing—the prisoner went down first and I followed—he was in the passage when I got down—I saw him put his hand into his pocket and pull out his knife—he came out into the passage and stood with his back against the window of the tobacconist's, and said he would stab the first man that came near him—I was standing close against him, and went and tried to lay hold of his hand, to get the knife away from him—he then said he would stab the first man that came near him—Monksfell came and laid hold of his collar and said, "You shan't stab my cousin"—the prisoner had not done any thing to him to provoke him at all—he said no<lb/>thing in particular to him—he had the knife in his hand, and Monksfell went to get it from him—he laid hold of his collar, not roughly—they both stood still when he caught hold of his collar—he then said, "I will stab you if you don't get away from me"—then Monksfell said, "Is there any law for a knife?"the prisoner made answer "No," and immediately made a stab with the knife, but the first stab did not go in any where—he made a job—I should think it would have gone at his head if it had touched him, but it did not—Monksfell them struck the prisoner directly—he had hold of his collar at the time—the prisoner then struck at his head twice, and then, as Monksfell was reeling away, he caught him by the side of the ribs with the knife—Monksfell called me, and said he was stab<lb/>bed, and I took him to the doctor's—the prisoner backed himself into the tobacconist's and he had the knife in his hand then—I went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Upper Ebury-street, Pimlico, and am a publican.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When will you undertake to state that you saw that green silk on this roller? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the beginning of April—this writting on the roller is a private mark of mine—it means 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I made it when the silk came into our possession—I do not know how many people sell silk at our shop—there are two generally, except they are engaged. and then other persons serve—there are about twenty shopmen there altogether—when silks are sold the blocks are put under the counter—they are some—times given away to persons who buy silks, but not very often—I have been with Mr. Evans about nine months—when the prisoner began to come to the shop she came every day or every other day—she always bought and paid for things—I told the magistrate that she came at times when we were not engaged, and I generally served her—she might have come thirty or forty times there before she was taken—I generally served her—I serve any one who comes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been in any difficulty about this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There certainly was a statement made by the prisoner to Mr. Evans about this—I was not charged before the magistrate with having participated in this offence, but Mr. Evans informed me of it on the day the prisoner was taken, which was on a Wednesday, about a month ago—I do not know where she was taken—I was not present—during the nine months I was serving Mr. Evans, I had missed some of his goods, and I told him of it—I said nothing about losing any goods with respect to the prisoner—I had no reason to suspect her—I never knew her to buy more than two yards of silk at a time—I never saw her buy this—the roller, silk and all, were missed altogether sometime in the beginning of May, or the latter end of April—she might come eight or nine times to the shop after it was missed, before she was taken—none of the other shopmen who sell silk are here—I never sus<lb/>pected the prisoner—she was first suspected about two months ago, or rather more—she came two or three times after that—nothing was said to her about it—she was watched her the last time she came—nothing was taken then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that a person could take silk on such on such a roller as this without your seeing her at times when you were not engaged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do—she wore a clock, but she must have got the silk off the counter</p>

               <p>first—there are persons on both sides in the shop—she generally came early in the morning—there would perhaps he more men then than custom<lb/>ers, but there might not be more behind the counter—some of the men are window dressing at that time, and some decorating the shop—I do not see that at that time it would be more likely we should detect a thief than in the middle of the day, when the shop was full of customers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman on board The Albion, which laid on the 2nd of July abreast of Woolwich Dock-yard, on the south side of the river. I went on shore to a public-house, and was passing through the church-yard, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—Mills came up to me, and knocked my hat over my eyes, and struck me three or four different times—I had seen him before, but he was no acquaintance of mine—he</p>

               <p>knocked me down—I got up again, and was not fairly on my legs before the prisoner Heas knocked me down again—I never saw him before—he struck me with his fist—they ran round the church, and I ran round the other way—I sent a fellow servant for assistance, and he brought Stevenson, the watchman—I took him to a public-house, and pointed the prisoners out there—I had watched them go in there—I did not feel any thing taken when I was knocked down, but when I got up the second time, I missed my silver watch, and money out of my trowsers pocket—I did not mention it to the prisoners—I had between 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the best of my knowledge—I know at twenty minutes after eight o'clock, I had both watch and money—I paid for a pint of half-and-half when I came out of the public-house, and had my money safe then—I took my watch out at twenty or twenty-five minutes after eight o'clock, just after I can out of the public-house—I am sure it was safe in my pocket when I came out of the public-house—there were two seals and a key to it, and a piece of black ribbon with three knots in it—I saw the constables find it in the churchyard, and knew it again.</p>

I apprehended Mills at his won lodging, in Chesnut-row, Woolwich, on Sunday morning, about half-past six o'clock, the day after the robbery—I told him I took him for assaulting and robbing Kingston of his watch in Woolwich churchyard—he said that circumstance had been mentioned the previous day, on board a ship—I asked him why he ran away from the watchman, when he said he was not guilty—he said he did not like to be taken to the station-house for such a circumstance, as that was—saying at the same time, that it was only a lark—I searched his lodging, but found nothing—I took Heas at a lodging-house about ten o'clock the same evening—he asked what for—I told him it was for robbing Kingston—he hesitated, and then said he was not near him by two yards—I searched him, and found a portion of biscuit, and part of a balled, which the prosecutor identified.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fisherman, and live at Wandsworth, in Surrey. On the 1st of July, at night, I had my boat moored against the white Horse at Wandsworth, by the water-side—I had three barkets and a great quanitity of flounders—they were alive in the well of the boot when I left them—I thought they would fetch next morning I was called up, and found some barbel and nearly all the flounders gone—they were worth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

On the 2nd of July, at about quarter past three o'clock in the morning, I was in my barge, and saw the three prisoners alongside Peters's boat, taking the fish out of it—the boat was afloat at anchor, at wands<lb/>worth—Honeyman held the boat's stern—Watts was taking the fish out, and Barker was keeping the boat steady with a scull—I saw Watts take flounders out and put them into the boat, and I saw Honeyman jobbing them down at the bottom of the boat, to kill them—I saw him put some barbel into a light-coloured handkerchief—I asked if they were not ashamed of themselves, for hurting a poor man—they made no answer, but one said to the other, "Pull away"—I afterwards saw the fish at the station-house—they were bruised.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you notice whether any part of the house had been burned by the fire, whether it had caught fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the entrance of the shop from the street, where the bags hung, was completely burnt—it was a wall, but a quantity of paper bags hung on the wall—the counter and shop shelves were fired—they were black and had been burnt—half of the front part of the counter was consumed—the door leading into the shop was nearly burnt through—I had looked at the safety of the house that Saturday night—I have gas laid on—the prisoner turned it off that night—I was present, and before I left the shop, I took the glass off the pillar and put the candle to it, to see if it was all safe—there was no fire in the house that night.</p>

Perhaps, or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—when I renewed my policy for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will not swear positively that my stock and utensils amounted for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will swear it amounted to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should consider it worth not less than 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the day I renewed my insurance—I cannot take</p>

               <p>on myself to say it was worth more—I have been in the habit of insuring for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for five or six years—I always considered my furniture as included in the amount—(<hi rend="italic">handing in a policy dated</hi> 1829.)—I gave instruc<lb/>tions verbally to one of the clerks for what I insured—I certainly under<lb/>stood my furniture was insured as well as my stock in trade and stensils—I should not insure my stock and utensils alone for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I swear I intended to include the furniture—I cannot swear that the clerk asked me how much my furniture was estimated at—he might have done it, but I cannot call to mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now we have sent for him. On your oath, did you intimate at any time, to any clerk in the officer, that you intended to insure your furniture as well as stock in trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should consider myself very neglectful if I did not—I cannot recollect whether I did do so or not—I have two or three policies at home—I have read them—the word furniture was mentioned in one of them—I think it was in the first—I do not find the word furniture in this policy, but I was struck at the time with the omission of it—I cannot tell the name of the clerk to whom I gave instructions for the new policy—I think I should know him if I saw him—I was not aware of the omission in the new policy till after the fire—I paid the premium on this policy regularly every year—I never noticed till after the fire that furniture was omitted—I received it and put it away—I altered my policy in 1831 I think, and increased the amount for the house in Lambeth<lb/>walk—I have not the policy here, but I think, to the the of my recollect<lb/>tion, I insured for about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot call to mind what difference there was between 1830 and 1831—I cannot positively say there was any difference—it is very likely I might have changed it in 1831—I cannot exactly tell unless I had the policy here—it must have been at the time I let my other shop, and brought my furniture from there—I should think that it must be in 1831 that I increased my police to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will swear I did not do it before 1830—I fix on 1831, because that was about the time I let a shop at Walworth, and then I did increase it—whenever the time was that I disposed of the shop at Walworth I increased it—to the best of my recollection it must be about five or six years ago—(<hi rend="italic">the policy produced being read, was dated December, 1829, for stock is trade, and utensils</hi>, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">without naming furniture</hi>)—I was surprised at the furniture not being included—I should think I must be a fool if I thought utensils meant furniture—I have no note from the Inusrance office—I gave the clerk instructions, which he wrote down in his book—I will not say that I did give him instructions to write the word furniture, because I considered, as I said before, that my furniture was included in the whole sum—I was not struck with the omission of the word furniture before I went to the Insurance-office—I did not go back to the clerk to tell him I meant to include the furniture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said you must be a fool to suppose utensils meant furniture, and yet you gave instructions for the insurance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the same amount as I had formerly insured, as I considered the furniture was included.</p>

               <p>sure of that—the seemed time had escaped my memory—the first is many years ago—I think the last was five of six years ago—I think I can give you the year, as I have here some of my acceptances—I brought them here in case a question should be put to me—I did not consider the policies would be wanted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then how came you to think the acceptances would be wanted. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought the question might be put to me—I did not think the amount insured would be asked.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now tell us the date of your last composition with your creditors. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About August, 1831—I think I paid 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—it must have been before my last composition that I increased my insurance—it was before August that I compounded—here is a bill, dated 24th of August, 1831, at eighteen months—it was drawn after I compounded—it is for the amount of the composition—I cannot call to mind the amount of my debts at the time of the composition—I believe they were between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not taken the trouble to look back—I will swear I paid as much as 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I forget how long the first composition was before the last—the first was an assignment, it was all assigned over—I was told it realized 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—but I can only go by report—when I was called on the night of the fire, I came down and looked into the shop—I went into the garden—I can go into the garden without going through the shop—the prisoner had lived in my house about nineteen months—there is a passage through which you go into the garden—I was not hurt or singed by the fire—the prisoner knew of that passage—I saw surprised at his going out where he did—he might have gone out at the yard door—he ran along the parapet I understand—he ran considerable personal risk by going that way—he was advised not to go out that way by his mistress—she did not know whether the other way was safe or unsafe—he might have got out on the leads of the front room.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. All you said was, "With a dreadful oath he said I was his prisoner." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Then I omitted it—he said I was his prisoner for setting my house on fire.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see the man after he took you into custody, without his coat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the first time I saw him was the leads—I did not see him afterwards with his coat on to my knowledge—I will not swear I did not—I saw him in the garden—I cannot recollect whether he had a coat on then—he might have had a coat on when he followed me into the garden, but I really cannot recollect—I did not see a truncheon in his hand—he might have had one, but I never saw it—he had no coat on on the leads—I asked him why he wanted to take me, and he said he was a police-officer—I will not swear whether he had a police-coat on in the garden or not—I think he had his hat on on the leads, but I am not sure whether he had or not—when he told me I saw his prisoner for setting my house on fire, I told him I had not set my house on fire—there were people on the leads—I do not know whether Mr. Lewis heard me make that answer—he was on the leads—I cannot tell how long after the fire was discovered it was put out—when I returned for the mustard poultice the flames appeared extinguished—it could not have been above a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes between my escape and return to the house for the poultice—and when I went through the shop the fire appeared extinguished—the prisoner aroused me and my wife—I went through the shop, when Mr. Lewis came to inform me what the report was—I cannot say whether it was out then—there was water being thrown on—I saw a good deal of smoke—I cannot say whether I saw any blaze—I might, and forget it—the prisoner's 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is in the hands of Field, the Inspector.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you during the last year had stook, utensile, and furniture to the value of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I should say they would not amount to that—it would full short of that about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—with the furniture I was not over-insured above 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had insured for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. since 1820—I have never made any claim during that time for loss by fire—on the Thursday prior to the fire I had paid Mr. Travers, a wholesale grocer 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the week before 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—that parcel came the day previously—these was not any left in arrear—that cleared the account of all that was due—I paid Shuttleworth, the wholesale tea-dealers, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and several other trifling things—I did not keep a banker's account—mine in a small trade—I did not latterly keep a servant.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's house and examined the gas-pipes—I found they had been turned off—I cannot form any judgment where the fire begun—of course it began in the shop—the fire was in to of three past—the door on going in appeared charred—the door was against a lath and plaster wall—that door was charred nearly through—it appeared to me, that two, if not three distinct parts had been on fire at the time.</p>

I was present at the prisoner's examination, and heard him make a statement before the magistrate—I heard it afterwards read over to him, and saw him sign his name, and the Magistrate signed his—this is what they signed, (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "The prisoner on his examination says, about four or five weeks since, when there was a fire in the walk, Mr. Crooks told me that he should not mind setting his own house on fire, as he was insured, and all that he should look after would he his cash-box and his books, and he should leave every thing else to the firemen; and since then, when the fire happened in the kitchen, I was alarmed, as they said it was through my carelessness, and I went on Saturday afternoon and told Mr. Jones what my master had said to me four or five weeks ago—on Saturday night when I went to bed I left Mr. Crooks in the shop getting a rush-light, and I never heard him come up afterwards—the pestle I left on the sugar scaffold—it was there when I went to bed—about three o'clock I was awoke by the ringing of the bell—I put on my trowsers and stockings and went down to my master's room—the door was open, and a rush-light burning in the room—my mistress and master got up directly, my mistress went up-stairs and awoke the children—on the same Saturday morning, my master said to me on looking up to the ceiling, "The ceiling is very black, but it will be blacker yet, and then I'll have it whitewashed Taken before me, this 30th of June, 1836.

Weston's Bank, and received the money—I was then going back to the Magpie and Stump. and the prisoner called to me in the Poultry, as I was running up—I offered him the money in the street, but he would not accept of it—he said, "Wait a <hi rend="italic">bil</hi>"—we went round the back of the Poultry, and into a small public-house—I there gave him the money, and he gave me a pint of beer—he drank out of it—he then came out in the street, and gave me a shilling—he told me to go to the Elephant and Castle, and wait till he came—I went, a waited till half-past six o'clock in the evening, and he never came—it was between twelve and one o'clock when I left him—I never saw him again till he was taken into custody at Northampton, about a month ago—I then found him in a shop, in Abingdon-street—Mr. Kelly took me there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher. Between twelve and one o'clock at night, on the 24th of June, I was going home—I stopped at the corner of a street—the prisoner came up to me, put her hand into my pocket, and took out my bag and key—I am sure she is the person.</p>
