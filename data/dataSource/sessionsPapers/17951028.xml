             with the sack on his back; it was not a whole sack of flour, there was about a bushel in the sack, worth about fourteen shillings; I see him bring it out on the 15th of September, about one o'clock in the morning; he brought it out of my bakehouse; I caught him with it in Bridewell walk; I see him bring it up the steps out of the bakehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you let him go before you took him? - No further than I could cotch him; and when I laid hold of him he dropped the sack off his back.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from your door when he dropped it off his back? - It might be about fifty yards; that was the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him when you laid hold of him? - Yes, I called him a bad fellow, and told him I thought he would not have done the like; not only that, but I told him I thought it was not the first time; the answer that he made was, he hoped that I would let him go; and begged that, I would. I called out which I for a considerable time before the watchman came up; the patrol came up first, and I gave him in charge of the patrol; and afterwards the watchman came up, and I lifted the flour on the watchman's back, and he carried it to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has kept the flour ever since? - I have in the sack. The sack belongs to the miller; but I have the papers when the flour was delivered in to me from the factor. I had two parcels, and I know the sack was delivered into my bakehouse in one of the parcels, by the papers, but I cannot say in which load. The sack is here, and the flour is in the sack.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen the sack in your bakehouse - I see it that day before I went out. It has the same mark as on the paper, T. S.</p>
               <p>Q. Now all this, I understand, to have been proved against one of the prisoners, Skowin; what have you to say against the other,

            , that was not signed at the time, nor is it signed now? - No, I was to sign it, or get it signed, and he gave me a list of the shops that had been done; fearful I should go to those shops; I returned, and told him I could not do it, but I would get a friend to do it; he asked me who it was? I said it was a friend that meant to send them to Wales, and there they would be far distant from the town; that was my own idea to him, that he should not be urgent for the money immediately. The second note I had was in about two days after.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that note for? - It was for five guineas; I cannot say particularly that I should know the note again, because there was no mark, and there was so many of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note. (A note shewn him) - I am pretty positive, I would not swear, but I am pretty sure it is. This is a note on Messrs. Hankeys for five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Which ever was the note, did you give the same note to Mr. Whittard and Mr. Winbolt? - I gave them first to Mr. Ellison, Mr. Ellison viewing the stamp to be forged, sent me to Mr. Escourt and Whittard, solicitors for the Stamp office, and clerk in the Stamp office. When he gave me the second note, he told me that as soon as he could raise fifty pounds, he would have a plate to work the Bank of England. I took this second one likewise to Mr. Ellison, Mr. Ellison viewed that likewise; but mentioning the Bank of England, I thought it my duty to go to Mr. Winter, the solicitor for the Bank, I went to him to shew him this second note, the five guinea note, as soon as I shewed it to Mr. Winter I took it to Mr. Escourt and Whittard, and there Mr. Ellison met me; then Mr. Whittard gave me some money; I then went to the prison, and I gave Mr. Catipodi some money.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280006"/>Q. How much did he give you? - He gave me four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you came to Mr. Catipodi? - I took him some money and provisions.</p>

               <p>Q. How much money did you give him? - I cannot absolutely say the sum. When this was over, which was the conclusion of the week, he came up to Bow-street, and was dismissed; I took the two notes from Mr. Whittard to Mr. Winbolt.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the same that you delivered to Mr. Winbolt afterwards, the same as you describe to have given Mr. Whittard before? - Yes, the very same; then a very few days elapsed before he was discharged, he was discharged the 20th of July; then there were various appointments between Mr. Catipodi and me till the 8th of August; there were people who were negociating these bills, and we sometimes met them in St. James's Park, sometimes in one place and sometimes in another. But however on the 5th of August he gave me the bill in question, which is the subject of the present indictment, he gave it me in the avenue, or lane, leading from his garden door in Frog-lane, or Frogmore-lane, I slington; he then gave me the bill signed,

            Sanders, and he made an observation that he wished the ink had been different, he said it was not so well as if the two inks had been different, the writing of the entering clerk and the signature of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what you was to do with this note? - To negociate it, and to make all the haste possible to do it. Previous to this we agreed to go to Southampton, and all the coasts about, as soon as we could raise as much money as we could travel genteelly down; I offered to go with him as an attendant, but there were two or three to go with him as occomplices; this was in the afternoon, between four and five o'clock. I could not see Mr. Ellison at his office that evening, immediately I waited on him at his house in Sloan-place, Chelsea; he likewise viewed this not to be quite perfect; I went to Mr. Whittard, and Mr. Whittard took a good impression of the stamp, and compared them, and said this is not a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Meaning not a forged stamp? - Yes. Immediately I went to Mr. Winbolt, the solicitor for the Bank of England. I am sure this is the note, I marked.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you gave this note to Mr. Winbolt? - I did, I told Mr. Winbolt that he was very urgent for money, and I must take him something, and Mr. Winbolt gave me a guinea; it was then towards the evening, and the next day, as Mr. Catipodi met his accomplices down at the parade at St James's, the Horse Guards, at eleven o'clock, which was the usual hour of exercising, there I met Catipodi as usual, then I gave him four shillings out of the guinea; he had some other people whom he expected money of, he did expect money of three different people I believe; he complained very much that the people who had his bills did not come forward as they ought to do with the money for the bills that he gave them, and he threatened to impeach some of them.(The bill read by the clerk of the court.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. I take it for granted that as you are on your oath, what you have told to day is true? - Every word is true.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that you were employed by Mr. Winbolt, on your oath were you? - I have been so far employed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280007"/>by Mr. Winbolt, that I have done Mr. Winbolt and his client service, and Mr. Winbolt paid me for it; Mr. Ellison recommended me to Mr. Winbolt; I was employed by both so far.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I suppose if Mr. Winbolt should swear that he did not employ you, he is guilty of perjury; do you mean to swear on your oath that you was employed by him? - I will not say that Mr. Winbolt ever sent for me, I cannot say that I was employed under Mr. Winbolt by any means.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me ask you what you meant by being employed in the service of the public, and that that was the way you got your livelihood? - No, far from it; I have told you the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this public service? - It is a public service that I must not mention.</p>
               <p>Q. In plain English are you not acting as a common informer? - No, never was in that kind of way in my life.</p>
               <p>Court. He is not bound to answer that question.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that you gave two blank notes to Mr. Winbolt, when was it you gave him them? - The first was I believe in July, about the 19th.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since this note in question was given Mr. Winbolt? - On the 5th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Winbolt had the intervening time from the 19th of July to the 5th of August, to enquire into these notes? - He did not think any thing at all of these notes; M. Winbolt knew his practices for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you represent it to Mr. Winbolt as a bank note? - I thought it was my duty, I had no occasion of making any representation of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you first enquire of Mr. Ellison whether the stamp was a good one or a bad one? - I did not enquire any thing at all of Mr. Ellison, but whether it was a forged note or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who desired you to do that? - Mr. Whittard and Mr. Escourt.</p>
               <p>Q. On that occasion did Mr. Winbolt know of your having been at the Stamp office? - I told him when I gave him the note that I had been, and the stamp was not forged; Mr. Winbolt looked at it, and I said I must take Mr. Catipodi some money, and he gave me a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mr.

            , how much money did you receive of Mr. Whittard? - Mr. Whittard gave me four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you get these four guineas as a reward to encourage you to go forward? - Upon my word it was not; part I gave to Catipodi and part I kept.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you give him? - I cannot tell, as I am on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. But you shall tell. Did you give the half? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the fourth? - Upon my word I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him a guinea? - It may be more or it may be less.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him as much as five shillings? - Yes, a vast deal; or three times five.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Mr. Winbolt gave you a guinea on this last note, what did Mr. Winbolt say to you? - Mr. Winbolt seemed in a hurry, and there was no conversation at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the note in Mr. Winbolt's hands before he gave you the guinea? - It was not five minutes, because he was in a hurry, going out.</p>
               <p>Q. You represented to Mr. Winbolt what you wanted the money for? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in London? - Above sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you continued in London during that time? - Yes, except such time as I was clerk to Sir Paul - , down at Boxley Abbey.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you were at Dublin? I believe you are an Irishman? - About nineteen years.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280008"/>Q. Do you mean to swear that you have never been in Dublin these nineteen years? - I will swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body shall say that you was concerned in the robbery on the lottery wheel there, then they will swear that that is false? - Indeed they will.</p>
               <p>Q. In this town have you ever employed yourself as giving bail for several persons, and receiving money for so doing?</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot answer such questions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Have you ever given bail for the prisoner and his son? - I did, about three years ago.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley submitted to the court, that in this case, the evidence went no further than having this forged note in his possession, but not of his forging or uttering, with an intent to defraud.</p>
               <p>Court. That is the question which the jury have to decide; if a man merely forges a note, and takes no steps on that note; there is no evidence of his intention to defraud, but if he takes any steps on that note; then there is evidence to go to a jury, for to decide whether he meant to defraud or no.</p>

            ; my lord must permit me to observe to the gentlemen of the jury, that it is the testimony of a man that has been well known to be guilty of every species of perjury and fraud; and it is not justice that has impelled him to this prosecution; no, his corrupt heart is destitute of every honest sentiment, and he is induced to this prosecution by hopes of a reward, which he is promised if he can prevail on you to pronounce me guilty; under these hopes he comes into this honourable court, and endeavours by falshood to mislead your judgment, and under the mask of justice he endeavours to rob me of my existence. Painful as my situation is, I feel a singular satisfaction that I am tried in this tribunal, and under your lordship's direction I leave my cause; I have no witnesses, I thought Blake's character was sufficiently notorious to be known by some of the jury, or some of the gentlemen in this court.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you up or in bed? - Up. I got up very early in the morning to do my business, and while I was up the button came off my small clothes, so I went up stairs and changed them, and took them down stairs to the servant maid to put a button on them; and I called her before she put the button on, and she left them by the fire screen while she came up to me. I don't know that of my own knowledge.</p>

How soon was it afterwards that you missed your notes? - About a couple of hours, the same morning; I put the breeches on, and went to feel for the notes, and found the fob sewed up, by sewing the button on, and I cut it open, and found the notes gone. I have a very good opinion of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never knew any thing of them. I was only taking down a pair of shoes from the shelf to clean, for Mr. Fox's son, which he asked me for, and I took the breeches in my hand, and I said, master Tom, I will ask your dadda for these breeches, he will hardly wear them again, they are all broke at the knee; and somebody called for a pint of beer, and I went down to draw it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When had you last seen your notes? - I put them in my pocket the night before, and found them in my pocket when I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other paper in your breeches? - None. I have enquired into his character, and I find he has a very excellent one.</p>

               <p>Q. These articles in the indictment, were they missed at one time, or at different times? - I never missed them at all, except the spoons; when I missed the spoons I charged her with it, and gave her in charge with the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she when you found them on her? - She was in the kitchen, dressing some victuals for dinner; the officer, Lawrence, searched her in my presence, and I see the spoons drop from her; Lawrence took them into his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. When you missed the spoons did you send for Lawrence? - I went to my Lord Mayor, and he ordered Lawrence to come with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else that you missed? - Not then; but there was a bag with a matter of a hundred pawnbrokers duplicates, found on her, but only eighty concerned me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been in your service? - About eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any character with her? - Yes, a written character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her on that character? - Yes, but I have known her these twenty years, she was a mantua maker formerly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not pledge the things, but with an intent to take them out again, and part of the things are my own.</p>
               <p>Court to Lawrence. You went by desire of the Lord Mayor, to the house of Mr. Brathwaite? - Yes, I went with Mr. Brathwaite.</p>
               <p>Q. You was ordered to search her, I suppose? - Yes, and I did, I took these two silver tea spoons out of her pocket, and a single duplicate, which was hardly dry, a duplicate of a coat of Mr. Brathwaite's; while I was searching her she shoved about very much, and she dropped this bag of duplicates on my right to it, there is about a hundred of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept those duplicates ever since, and the two spoons? - Yes; as soon as I found these duplicates she confessed that they were all her master's property, or a great part of them, and that she meant to take them out of pawn, and begged his pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you recommended her to do so? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her it would be better for her to do it? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you traced any of the property? - Yes, the pawnbrokers are here, their duplicates answer to theft.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the time that the officer came to me, I was taking up my dinner; he has got two little boxes of mine, and my silver thimble, and at the same time he did not find the tickets in my pocket, he shook them out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Lawrence. Those things were left at Mr. Brathwaite's, being of no consequence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He did not find any thing on me but the two tea spoons.</p>

On the 20th of October, going through the warehouses, at the request of the elders, to intercept any felony of the kind; I discovered several bags of sugar cut open and plundered of a considerable quantity, accordingly I acquainted the elders of it, they desired me to watch, accordingly I did, on a pile of sugars, and I see the prisoner at the bar come to a bag, No. 848, and took the sugar out which I have in my possession; I then see him take it out of a bag, and put it into a handkerchief, he was then coming out of that warehouse, and going into another, and I followed him and caught him by the collar, and said, you have been thieving of sugar; I struggled with him for a minute, however I held him too fast, and he said if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280021"/>would let him go he would give me any thing, I told him then as I had been employed on that business, if he had been my father I would not let him go; I kept fast hold of him, and took him to the counting house.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was in the counting house? - A Mr. Vaughan, an elder there; when I took him to the counting house I sent for a revenue officer to come and search him, but before the officer came to search the prisoner, he took the property out of his pocket, and he gave it into my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at the time that he gave it you? - He said it was the first time he was ever guilty of the like, and he did not know what the devil possessed him. He was then taken by the constable to the counter, and before the Lord Mayor. This is the same sugar that he gave me, tied up in his own handkerchief, inside of the paper; I cannot tell the value of the property, there has not been any sold under sixpence or eight pence a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the quantity that is there? - One pound and fifteen ounces, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present before my Lord Mayor, and he was committed? - I was; he pleaded when he was before the Lord Mayor, that he had got the gripes, and that he took it to sweeten a little beer with.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the examination taken in writing? - Yes, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You told this man when he asked you to let him go, that if he was your father you would not; you wanted to get a guinea? - I cannot say as to that, I believe the honourable East India company would reward every man according to their merits, I can say that this is the sixth man that I have taken, and been the cause of taking, and I have had but one guinea yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual to give a guinea for every man that is apprehended? - At times it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it understood so amongst you? - I don't know, it is not understood so by me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have had a sale of the East India company? - I think it was about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that this sugar was not sold? - I will, nor never a bit of sugar in that cellar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Whether there had been a sale there or not, are you sure that you see the prisoner at the bar take it out of the bag? - I am; and after it was lodged in the hands of the constable, I had the curiosity to weigh that bag, and it weighed eight pounds deficient of the landing weight.</p>

               <p>I am deputy elder of the warehouse; it is my duty to see that every man is at his station, and to take account of goods to prevent as much as possible any embezzlement; going round a corner I found a deal of plunder out of a bag, 848; I immediately went up to the counting house and mentioned it, it was there that we agreed to place a trusty person to watch, and Rickman was the person pitched upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the sugar? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it weigh? - One pound fifteen ownccs; it was weighed at a grocer's near the warehouse. I compared it with the bag 848, and it appeared to be the same quality, and there was eight pounds efficient in that bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Is it usual for these men to be searched when they are coming out? - They are. But this man was taken between three and four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this man say that he had picked up this property in this place? - I never heard it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The sugar laid all abroad, and I picked the sugar up to carry it to the counting house, and going through the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280022"/>warehouse the man stopped me, because the bag lay in such a state; the bag lay tore all to pieces almost.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses who gave him very good character.</p>

On Sunday evening, about half past five o'clock, I put them three pots the corner of Chancery-lane, while I went into a house, a patten shop, close by, and I went up two pair of stairs; whilst I was up, I heard the pots rattle, and when I came down I enquired for the pots; I was looking about for them, and a tall man came up, and I asked him if he knew any thing of them, and he said he saw a woman with them; says he, follow me; and I went with him up Bell-yard and across Clement's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see her? - In Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop her? - Yes, and she had the pots under her apron; she laid the pots down and begged I would let her go; I told her I would not, I would take her to my master, and he might do as he liked; and as I came by Chancery lane she pointed to the place where she took them from. The pots have been locked up ever since.(Produced and deposed to.)</p>

             took a bag of sugar, the bag was in an empty cask, he put the bag of sugar underneath his frock; after that he altered it, not finding it right, clapping it down not to make it so very large; the one then said to the other, we had better break a lump of sugar that lays in the tub, because they could not carry it without being detected.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the two prisoners? - Two porters.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you heard all this? - I was laid on a shelf in the lump room; they did not see me. As soon as they had done it, they came under the shelf where I was laid, and I came down and took hold of them both. This is the sugar; I see them take it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the only ground for its being your master's? - It is so.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of sugar do you call it? - About one pounds of lump sugar, and three pounds of bastard sugar or ground sugar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I take it for granted the sugar is not in the same state as it was then? - The lump sugar is, but not the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my lord that you was on the shelf, where was this shelf? - Over the door, about two yards and a half from the ground or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. They could not see you? - I believe they did not see me.</p>
               <p>Q. There was not much light in the warehouse? - There was a candle about ten yards from where I was; that was the only candle in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you wish the jury to understand that you were almost three yards from the ground, and they did not see you, and you was able to see what past, and there was no candle within ten yards distance? - Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear to the sugar? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. The lump sugar has been put in paper by you since? - It has.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no sleeping partner in this house, is there? - No. It was Stevenson, Hewson, and Fenn, but Hewson is dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that there may be no other partner though he may not appear in the firm? - No, I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a servant before this man left your service? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go down into your cellar the week before, when the prisoner came into your service? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this green cloth you bought it and paid for it? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a practice that we should expect you are in the habit of, of course.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 22d of september you apprehended the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I did, in Petticoat-lane, Whitechapel, the right hand side, at No. 134; Thomas Burrows, he keeps a shop where people sell old bottles; on the prisoner I found eighteen bottles of wine.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you at the time that you took him? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You are going to tell us something that the prisoner said. You are an officer? - No, I am not; I was an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him before he said any thing to you? - Did not you tell him it would be better for him to confess and tell the truth? - Nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him that you should certainly take him up, unless he told you the truth? - No, nothing like that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Now go on with your story. - When I took him at the door I asked him what he had got there? I see him with something that I suspected was not right by his knocking there; the bundle was set down on the ground, and he was looking up at the window, and I said, now, what have you got here, John? I called him by the name of John. Says he, I have got some bottles of wine, and I did not come honestly by them; says I, you must go along with me to the office. In the course of a quarter of a mile, going along, he begged of me to let him go; I told him I should not. It was between five and six in the morning. (When I see him first I see him at Aldgate, before he came to Petticoat-lane.) I took him to a public<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280025"/>house near the office, and he begged I would let him go, and he offered me money; I told him I would not. Then he begged me to let him go to his master; I told him I had no objection going to his master; I asked him where he lived? he said, he lived in Broad-street; I said, it is a very round about way to come from Board-street where I see you; and then he said, his master was a hop merchant, of the name of Railton, and lived in the Borough, and said, that his master was a hasty man, and he had known servants steal spoons and other things, and he had no doubt but he would look over it. I went with the prisoner to Mr. Railton's house, and Mr. Railton was not at home, and I left word for Mr. Railton to be at the office at twelve o'clock; and I spoke to Mr. Railton before he came into the office, and told him the door the prisoner knocked at, and whether he thought it proper to have a search warrant to search the house, for a man was passing by at the time that I stopped the man, and said, that he see some man at the door the morning before.</p>
               <p>Q. What past at the office? Were you by at the examination? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I was wrong in stating you to be an officer of the police. How long before this had you been one? - About a week before.</p>
               <p>Q. What office did you belong to? - Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be dismissed from the office? - I was not dismissed; I dismissed myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been an officer? - Two years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was not dismissed for any ground of complaint that was alledged against you? - If this is a fair question I will resolve you. There might be grounds of complaint. I dismissed myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to dismiss yourself? - Taking half a guinea of a black man going on board a ship.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever get your dismission from the office? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to the office afterwards? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What for? - For business; to apprehend such men as this at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Any little snug informations in which you go snacks? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You happened to know that man before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he know that you belonged to the police office? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not he know that you was an officer? Or what do you call yourself? - No. A thief-taker you may call me.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you that he had some bottles of wine, and had not come honestly by them. Did not you tell him that if he gave up the receiver there should be an and of it? - I did not, nor a word about the receiver. I asked him what house it was he went to? he said it was a countryman of his, but what his name was he did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. He said that he lived at Mr. Railton's, hop merchant, over the bridge? - Yes, he did; but before that he said he lived in Broad-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Railton was his master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he told you where his master lived? - Yes, he did.</p>

            , taken before him, September 22, 1795. Who faith, I have lived with Mr. Railton about a week, in the capacity of a footman; I have known Mr. Burrow about twelve months; I see him about a week ago; he knew I was a gentleman's servant, he said, if I could get any thing he would purchase it; he mentioned candles, &amp;c. On Friday or Saturday morning last, I carried him about a dozen bottles of white and red wine; which he agreed to give me a shilling a bottle for; I took the wine out of my master, Mr. Railton's cellar, at his house in the Borough. It was about half after six in the morning when I took the wine to Burrow; he said, is this all you have brought? I told him, yes; he said, then I will pay you when you bring some more. He said, as you live in a gentleman's house, you may get me a few candles. I took some out of my master's house; he agreed to give sixpence a pound for them; he told me to get more red wine than white, that he could sell it better. The night before last I carried him about a dozen of red and white wine, which I took from my master's cellar; he said, I shall not stand to pay you now, I will pay you when you come again. This morning I was going again to his house, with eighteen bottles that I took out of my master's cellar; I was stopped by the officer in Aldgate, who spoke to me; he passed me, and I went on; he came up to me again as I was at Burrow's door, and took me into custody. Burrow told me when I came to knock at the door, I had no occasion to call. I took the linen cloths out of my master's pantry to keep the bottles from breaking, also the the green cloth; but I meant to take them back again; I never took any thing else. I did not see any marks on the corks or bottles.</p>
               <p>Taken and signed, September 22, 1799."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Thompson. Taplin had brought this man to the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore all this passed after the conversation between him and Taplin? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar seem agitated when he made this confession? - Yes, he appeared agitated the whole time.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That afternoon that I went to the office, I told him that he must have a pick lock to open the cellar door; he told me that he had not, that he had taken the bricks out by the cellar and got in there, which I found to be the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that a sufficient quantity had been removed so as to admit a person? - So the officer said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This breach in the wall you had not observed before that time? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. This was at the magistrate's that he told you this? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was after the conversation that had passed between Taplin and him? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether he seemed alarmed and agitated? - Very much so. He cried and said, it was Burrow, the receiver that brought him to that. I can swear to the cloth myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The officer told me that if I spoke the truth and nothing but the truth, I should not be hurt.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his former master to his character.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you knew what was going on? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? -Between eight and nine o'clock at night; it was moon light, new Michaelmas night. With that they left me, and took two horses away, and left one, and I rode towards home.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did they go? - They seemed to stand still.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean riding towards London? - Towards London; they stood still at the time, but I see them mount one of my horses, and ride after me, after I had got some distance from them, but I rode away, and see nothing further of them, but came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a saddle or bridle to them? - I had two new halters to the horse I had lost; I bought them at Uxbridge fair, and had them booked there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you well mounted? - Very well mounted, but seeing four of them I rode away from them, and made the best of my way home.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this take up? - About five minutes, or not so much, I cannot pretend to say to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of them before? - I see all four as I came out of the town, but had no suspicion of them being thieves when I passed the Fountain, I see nothing of them again till they jumped out of the path and stopped me; I had seen them in the town all day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they armed? - One had a pistol, and the others appeared to me to have sticks. I cannot be positive whether it was sticks or pistols, but one I am positive had a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they taken up? - Three days after the robbery, I went down to Uxbridge to enquire whether any body had seen any thing of my horses, thinking they would have dropped them on the road, and I had them cried at Uxbridge; I found one of my horses turned into the field loose, at Uxbridge, the publican of the Fountain went with me and shewed it me, which I gave him five shillings for, what I had cried I would give; this was on Tuesday; on the Monday following I was going to Hounslow fair, going through Brentford I saw two of them, Clarke and Hill, and one of them was riding my horse, going to sell it, and the other was on their own, or somebody else; with that they bearing of me coming, they gallopped away as fast as they could, and they found that I close pursued them, and they rode by the side of a blacksmith's shop, and there they got off the horse; when I came up I asks them who owns this horse, I catched hold of the horse,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280028"/>Clarke says, I don't own it, this owns it; and Hill rather faltered in his speech, and turning pale, said, I own it; he was dismounted then; I then said it was my horse, and he was the man that robbed me of it; so with that he cried, and wished not to go before the justice, I said I would insist on his going before a justice, and I would not have my horse without going before a justice; then they pulled out some gold.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you stop Clarke, or might he have got away? - I would not let them go; there were some other people came up; they were both stopped, and went before a justice, and committed for that night to the watch house; the next day I was ordered to come up to Brentford again, and I went, and this other man, Hamnell, came to speak in behalf of Clarke and Hill, to give them a character.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the first time you had seen him since the robbery? - Yes. Then he was committed with the other; there were two more come to give them a character, which I think I knew one of them, but I could not positively swear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What is your name? -John Bengoe.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been Bengoe? - Ever since I was born.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not been Benjoe sometimes? - No, Bengoe.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the first time you have ever been in a court of justice? - I cannot say that, I was once in a court of justice before; this is the first time I ever apprehended a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you in a court of justice before? - At Kingston; I dare say you know, Mr. Shepherd.</p>
               <p>Q. I have not the honour of being Mr. Shepherd; what did they say you had been guilty of there; what was you tried for there? - On suspicion of my house being on fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you indicted by the name of Bengoe then? - Yes, by the name of Bengoe.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived at Battersea before that? - I was born there, I live there now.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't live in the neighbourhood of Uxbridge? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about two hundred yards from Uxbridge town, and a very light night? - It was about two hundred yards from the Fountain, between that house and the half way house.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not go back to Uxbridge? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There were plenty of people in Uxbridge for you to have made the alarm to? - I could not go by them four.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a very good horse? - I was very well mounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any alarm? - I did, at the next town, at Hillingdon; I could get nobody that had courage to go with me, I did not raise the town, I see nobody but the waiter and two hostlers.</p>
               <p>Q. You told them you had been robbed? - I did, the men knew me, they did not think proper to go, because there had been so many robberies that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps having been before a court of justice before, it may have occured to you that there is such a thing as a reward? - But I have been offered double the money by their party.</p>
               <p>Q. But don't you know there is a reward? - There is by all account.</p>
               <p>Q. How much reward is there on each of these mens lives? - I cannot say, I never paid any attention to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you never hear what was the reward for convicting a highway man? - There is a reward, but I don't know what.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear what the reward was? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't tell me of your knowledge, on your oath don't you know that there is a reward of forty pounds on conviction of each of these men? - Not to my know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280029"/>ledge, on my oath I do not, I never heard that till justice Bond told me yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Bond, or somebody tell you yesterday what was the reward for the conviction of a highwayman? -He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know there is an hundred and twenty pounds on the conviction of these men? - I do not, nor ever heard it, not before you tell me now.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear yesterday? - justice Bond told the constables that they had no business with it at all, nor need they go down to Hick's Hall, because they were not at the taking of the men, and if there was any reward I deserved it.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that if these men are convicted, they are liable to be hanged on your evidence? - Yes, and I think they thoroughly deserve it. At first I was not bound over it was thought that some other gentleman would prosecute, and the gentleman did not come forward, and justice Bond sent over to me, to come to be bound over to prosecute.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe she was very ill, in sits? - Yes, she was, and that made me very careful of her, it was as much as two of us could hold her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not stop her? - I did not; I was coming down the court at the time.</p>
               <p>Boswell. It is my ribbon, there is my mark on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You cannot say that that ribbon had not been sold out of the shop? - It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Court. Who sells in your shop besides yourself? - I have a brother that serves, but there was no possibility of bringing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. To Harriot -. That was not the ribbon you sold the woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - Yes</p>

               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing of the man that he said so? - Yes, he was there, he helped to unpack some of the wine, I told my partner that I could swear there were twenty six when we left home, he said there were but twenty four then, and I said, perhaps the horse has swallowed some of them; I went up immediately and searched the bag that was under the axletree of the cart, and found a bottle of Lisbon sealed there, with my master's seal; I went immediately to the basket out of which the horses fed, and I found there a bottle of Lisbon wine, sealed with my master's seal, and my fellow servant took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else attend this cart besides the carman, except you and your fellow servant? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. You say you found two bottles near this cart, you did not ascertain what they were, you did not draw their corks? - I did not, but they were sealed with my master's seal "Wigzell, Lisbon."</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever the two bottles were, you put them all with the rest in the cellar? - My fellow servant took them, I did not.</p>

               <p>I was in the cellar when Mr. Wigzell's man unpacked the wine, and he set twenty-four on the shelf, and I said, there ought to be twenty-six, and he said, very likely the other two were in the pickle, under the rail, and it was examined, and they were not, and he told his fellow servant, and he went up and brought them down; I have kept them separate ever since, one of them, and one Mr. Wigzell has had ever since Friday. They were all set on a shelf in the wine cellar, and these two were set at the other end, not among the others.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do you mean to say that he did not put the two bottles with all the rest of the cargoe? - Close by them, but not to mix them so but they might be taken from the rest; he could not put it with the parcel of the others, because I had filled the shelf up with other wine.(The wine produced.)</p>

               <p>Q. It was dark then? - It was; apparently the moon was young. Then he drew the cart up, and before Jessop took his horse out of his cart, Jessop and another went into the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same person as he called to him? - I cannot tell. They staid in five or six minutes, thereabouts, and Jessop came out and stood in the middle, of the way, as if looking out, and somebody past by the stable; then I came down and communicated what I had heard to Mr. James, and then we pursued and went round to meet them.</p>
               <p>Q. You returned again before you met them? - Yes.</p>

            , my master's son. Then Mr. James and I went up into the lost; we had been there about three quarters of an hour, or something less, and a man came along; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280034"/>not perfectly see who it was that passed along; then I discovered Benwell go and look behind some hogshead opposite the lost where we stood; the hogsheads were in bye way.</p>
               <p>Q. Near the stable? - Yes; and then he went opposite the stable left door, and said, now! he was saying that seemingly to Jessop in the last; and Jessop said, are you ready? then Benwell said, down with it. Accordingly Jessop lowered the hay down to Benwell by his hands, to ease it on his back. The lost is some where about ten or eleven seet high; it was seemingly two trusses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Benwell take it? - Yes; and Mr. James, I and Thomas Weatherhead pursued him; Mr. James went on first and took him; when I came up he had hold of him, and I took the hay from Benwell by the desire of Mr. James; I deposited it under lock and key, and put a seal on, in a house belonging to Mr. Weatherhead. Benwell went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was he apprehended? - Saturday, the next morning. We let him go, because he gave us a reason; he said our carman had borrowed the hay of him, and that was to return it.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the night was this that the hay was lowered down? - About a quarter to eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your master had borrowed any hay? - Not to my knowledge. I got a warrant that night and took Jessop up that night, and Benwell the next morning, and they were taken before a justice and committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate. Where abouts is this lost situated with respect to the house, over the warehouse? - No, nearly opposite.</p>
               <p>Q. When this transaction was going forward, what distance might you be from the lost? - About sixteen or twenty yards. It lay aslant.</p>
               <p>Q. The premises both belong to the prosecutor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened a few days ago. You could see the person of the prisoner? - Yes, perfectly well; there was a lamp a little way from the stable door, and Jessop had a light in the lost; they were between us and the light.</p>
               <p>Q. That light was in a lanthorn, I presume, was it not? - They had a light in the lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not been watching for that purpose, should you have been able to have discovered alone that this was the prisoner at the bar that you see there? - Yes, perfectly well; I should have known him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any other of the prosecutor's servants access to this hay lost but the prisoner at the bar? - There was nobody had any business there but himself.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose they could get in occasionally? - If they did, they must get in from inside of the premises, because it is all surrounded with buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you see both the prisoners at the time that the hay was taken away? - Yes, as plain as I see you.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be before you came up with the parties in this transaction that passed at the hay lost? - Somewhere about sixty or a hundred yards. When I came up, as far as I heard, Benwell asked Mr. James if he thought he was coming to steal his hay? and told him that he had got that hay in return for some that he had lent the carman.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Jessop been in the service of Mr. James and the other gentlemen? - I think about eight or nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other person concerned in business with him? - Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You knew these persons before? - Yes.</p>

            , the prisoner at the bar. I collared him, and he let down the hay; he had got the hay on his shoulder; I said, what I have got you at last; he seemed confused, and he said, I only came for two trusses of hay which your man owed me; I told him it was a very odd time of night to come for it; he said, very impudently, he had a right to come for his own when he liked; I asked him if he did not know the way to the counting house? he said, he knew nothing about the counting house. Jeremiah Keys came up, and I gave him the hay; I went into the house to see if Mr. Weatherhead was come home, to see what I was to do in the business; he was not at home.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that hay the same as you see him lift out of the lost? - Yes, it was. I went up to justice Staples and took out a warrant, and took Jessop up that night; I met him in a street in Old Gravel-lane, coming out of a public house. Previous to that, when I came back again, I went to the stable where Jessop was; he came out, and said, O, it is all right, it is two trusses of hay which I borrowed when Mr. Crowder's people were here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of hay being borrowed? - No. On the contrary I told him never to borrow any thing without coming to the counting house to propose it. The next day the officer apprehended Benwell that I gave the warrant to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate. You speak of this man coming slily down the lane. What do you mean by that? - A man's coming down in a skulking manner, more like a thief then an honest man, in a fly manner altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he walk fast? - Sly, in a creeping manner.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that he spoke in a low voice; don't you think the tone of voice was sufficient to be heard? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed this person and collared him. Don't you think if a person was to follow you, and collar you, would it not alarm you a little? - I don't think it would alarm me.</p>
               <p>Q. I am rather inclined to think it would. However he told you that it was hay that he had borrowed? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you pressed the business he seemed angry? - He did not seem to be the best pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. When you see Jessop in the stable, or hay lost, or cooperage, or somewhere, it is not material where, he told you the same story, and that he had repaid the man again? - He did so.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose at this time both the occupations of this Jessop and the other prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280036"/> was ended? - Jessop had got to clean his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no partner but Mr. Weatherhead? - Nobody else.</p>
               <p>Jury. Will you take on yourself to say, that your lost was so well furnished with hay as to have no occasion to borrow any about this time? - I suppose there was then about ten or twelve trusses in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you wanted any hay for any time previous to this? - I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have bought that hay? - The 2d or 3d of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there before this any occasion for borrowing any hay? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate. Did either of the prisoners state to you as to the time of the loan of the hay? - William Jessop told me that he had lent it about five weeks ago the last Thursday, and he said it was a time that a particular friend was at our house; and that was on the 5th of October, and on the 2d or 3d we had the load of hay in by our books.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jessop. Six weeks ago last Sunday morning I borrowed two trusses of clover hay of this man, and last Friday night this man came for it, and I paid him. I have witnesses that I borrowed it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see or feel it go? - Yes; I did not see the watch in her hand, I felt it go; she calls out, open the door! open the door! and there was another by the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the other? - I cannot tell, it was a very dark place, and I laid hold of her, and I said, where is my watch? and she said, what ails the man? come down stairs; and then I went down stairs, and I walked from that door to another, and I stopped by this door, and by and by I see four women coming arm and arm, and the prisoner Roberts was one of the four, and I laid hold of her, and put her in the watch-house.

               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again? - Yes; Coombes has it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it in his hands? - The 19th, the Monday as they were tried.</p>

               <p>Q. Cole was not one of the girls that you see in the house? - No, but she was one of the four that was with the other girl when I took her.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in liquor. Had you ever seen Roberts before? - I have seen her many times; I never spoke to her before; but I go a jobbing in that street very often, for my master, and I live close by. I am certain she took the watch from me.</p>

The house is full of girls, and they have got a great antipathy against me, and I don't know what for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cole. I never see the young man till he came up on Sunday morning, and said, that was the room where he was robbed; and when he came in he said, that was not the room; and he went into the back room, and found nothing, and he said, that he was very confident that this was the girl that took the watch.</p>

On the 28th of September the prisoner came into my house, I don't know what day of the week, about eight at night, and asked for a pint and penny worth of beer; I was then in my bar, I called the maid to draw the pint and penny worth of beer, which she did, and put it into a quart pot; I see her deliver it into her hand; my maid asked her where she was going with that pot? she said, to No. 2, next door. The maid suspecting her, she watched her home; I see her follow her out of doors, but I did not know then that she meant to watch her home; I remained without doing any thing further, till between nine and ten o'clock, when my pots were very short, having had about ten pounds worth stolen in about a fortnight; when I sent my 
maid after the pot; she denied to the maid that she had 
any pot, and I went to the woman myself.</p>


               <p>Q. How long was this after the maid followed her out of doors? - About three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner's room? - In the back garret, No. 7, Stacy-street, the same street. I asked her for my pot; and she said, she had no pot, neither did she know any thing of me nor of my house. While I was speaking to the woman, a woman, whose name was Edwards, came up stairs, and said, Mr. Nurse, here is your pot, thrown out of window. It was picked up by one Mrs. Cadwell, in the adjoining yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this conversation pass? - On the stair case, close to her garret door. I then charged the watch with her immediately. The metal was then hot when it was brought up to me. I went to the watch-house with her. I cannot swear to the metal, only my pot was never forth coming. I returned from the watch-house with the watchman, and desired them to go with me to her garret; the woman of the house went up in the garret with me; Mr. Edwards, who keeps the house, told me that that was the garret that woman lived in.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was in her presence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in this garret? - The frying-pan in which from its appearance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280039"/> the metal was melted in, some of the metal is now in the pan; I took the pan and carried it to the watch-house where I left it, and it remained till Saturday in the hands of the constable, who took charge of her, when he brought it to me and delivered it up, as he said there no occasion for his attendance. I have brought it here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same pan that was returned? - That is the very pan.(The pan and metal produced.)</p>

               <p>Q. What did you give her the beer in? - A quart pot. I watched to see whether she went to No. 9, and she went to No. 7; I watched her up one pair of stairs myself.</p>
               <p>Q. She took away the pot with her? - Yes; she had not drank the liquor. About three quarters of an hour after I went and asked her for the pot; and she said she had never a one; she was not in her own room then, she was in the next woman's room; I told her I must have it and I should not leave the house till I had it. I immediately went to my master, and my master came up to her; I went and fetched my master, and my master and me went up together; my master insisted on having the pot found, and this woman brought the metal up, and my master charged the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any metal? - Yes. There was some metal found in a pail of water; that was after the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some conversation in the passage about some; did you hear that conversation? - Yes; Mrs. Edwards came up and said, Mr. Nurle, here is your pot, thrown out of window just now. She brought up the piece of pewter.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Q. How is the coffee kept? - In casks and bags. They are generally open after they are tared. I was on the stairs. I see the prisoner take the coffee out of the cask, it was this small bag, and put it into his breeches. On doing this he went down stairs. I immediately followed him, and told Chamerson, the excise officer, if he offered to go out to stop him. I went up and told my master, and he called him to him, and master told Chamerson to touch him, and he said, he had got a little coffee in his breaches; he pulled it out himself, and delivered it to Mr. Chamerson.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was there? - Two pounds and a quarter, Mr. Chamerson weighed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any such small bags as these in the warehouses in which coffee are kept? - There are not.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of coffee was it? - Raw coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be of the same kind as the coffee in the warehouse? - The very same kind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Moore. Did you see him put the coffee into the bag? - No, I did not, because the casks was not above half full. I see him take the bag out of the cask.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a warehouseman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray has there not been some little kind of dispute between the custom house men and the warehouse men? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not so unreasonable as to complain that you would not move the casks? Was there any complaint to your matter that it was your business to move the casks out of the way, and you did not move them? - I do not remember there was any such complaint.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the allowance of beer taken away in consequence of their complaint? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was stopped? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this man's employment in the warehouse? - A coffee tarer, employed by the customs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the custom of office to search every man before be went out? - Yes, but in the part where he had concealed it, he might not have been searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they not been, in consequence of several depredations, more in their search? - They certainly have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280042"/>Q. Was he certain of being searched before he left work? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this such a quantity that you think be could escape being found out? - Yes, because I observed when he went down stairs there did not appear any alteration.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes. He was employed as a <rs id="t17951028-26-deflabel149" type="occupation">cooper</rs>

               <p>Q. Was there any coffee deposited in that part of the warehouse? - A great deal of raw coffee.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether any body was at work with him? - Another man. let him out of the warehouse. We are obliged to lock them in.</p>
               <p>Q. It is the course of business. - It is. I searched them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you search first? - His fellow workman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on him? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards you searched the prisoner? - Yes. I found this coffee on his hair, under his hat. A pound and three quarters. We generally just touch the hat. I see the coffee trickle down; I did not take his hat off; he took the hat off, and threw it down on the floor, which had been just swept that morning; I told him that I thought he had no idea of taking the coffee; he said he had only a little for his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the coffee? - About one shilling and nine pence, or two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that coffee of the same kind as was lodged in the same room as he was in? - I believe it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There is great quantity of raw coffee in these warehouse? - Yes. They were all in casks, but some was loose on the floor at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280043"/>Q. You never see the prisoner searched him at going out? - I see him in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not search him till his time of going out? - No</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether he took it from the floor or casks you don't know at all? - I do not. There was a great deal of raw coffee on the floor, that the had left, as much as would fill a couple of hogsheads.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a cooper? - He had cooper's tools with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have never heard of such a thing as perquisites of the little tare that might drop from the casks? - There were no perquisites of coffee; they have beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never know persons that had coffee, and considered it as perquisites; have you never heard that before? - I don't know that I have. I cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. You produce this coffee; it has been in your custody ever since; never been out of your custody since you took it from him? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not taken to be weighed by any body? - The custom-house officer took it from me to weigh it. I cannot swear to the coffee.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This coffee is necessarily thrown on the ground to be dried and tared? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. The coffee on the floor is not waste coffee? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that coffee that you found on the man clean raw coffee? - It is good coffee.</p>
               <p>- RAPER sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you are a person in the employment of the customs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in these warehouse of Mr. Masheter on the 30th of September? - Yes. We have two floors in the warehouse with coffee in; one a higher than the other. I was in the lower story. I went up on Mr. Willbore's calling to me. When I went up I see some coffee on the floor, which Mr. Willbore told me that he had detected the prisoner with in his hat, and he had thrown it on the floor. I took it up and weighed it, and returned it to Mr. Willbore.</p>
               <p>Q. That was raw coffee of the same kind as in that warehouse? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a publican. On October the 9th, in the evening, between the hours of seven and eight, a man came into my house, in Coppice Row, and said, Ellis, I believe there is a man knocking up forae pewter in such a house in Coppice Row; it is a shell of a house, the corner of Bowling Grden Lane, Coppice Row. I went to the window of the same house, and when I came there, the man made his escape out of the door; I pursued him, and took him in Baker's Row. The prisoner,

               <p>Q. How far from the place did you take him? - About a hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him? - No. From that I collared him, and brought him to my house, and set him down in the bar. He had pots in his apron, and he had something in his packets, which I did not take from him. I gave charge of him to a couple of patroles, who took him down to St. James's watch-house, Clerkenwell. I have got the pots here, two quarts and a pint; he had battered them with a brickbat the same way as they are now.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my pots. I can almost swear that they were scoured the same day as he took them. There is my name on them all.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ellis sent for me to take the man into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at the White Hart, Battle Bridge. I know the house perfectly well; if I am not mistaken, one Mr. Hamilton keeps it. I went there at one o'clock; I had a sheep's heart drest for dinner, and it being a rainy afternoon I stopped there till half past six o'clock that evening that these three pots were found on me. I believe I can prove I was there at half past six, and coming from the White Hart home to Mr. where I lodge, I found these pots and the bundle I am like wise charged with, altogether. It was in a place where there was a pump, and a little house there. I found the pots; I did not endeavour to nine them; I brought them in my apron along the road; I might have come many different ways not to have come through the town; and in the house that was opposite Mr. Ellis's I went to ease myself, and my foot slipped, and the pots made a noise, and that was what they heard. Whether they was bruised so in the fall, I must leave your Lordship to judge. However, that gentleman comes out to me when I got out again into the road, and said, what have got there? says I, I have got some pots, and he said, whose are they? I said, I did not know, and if they had watched me out, they might have found out whether I was the thief, and most likely the people that were the receiver of these things. I did not make any obstruction to being taken; I went very quickly into the house; he asked me if I would drink some gin? I was then intimidated, not so much for any thing, as for fear of going to prison to be ironed; a circumstance I never experienced before. However, I was taken by two watchmen; I did not appear that they gave any charge against me; I was then put backwards, it was three hours before I was searched; I then had time to ruminate, and consider of the unhappy circumstance. I knew there was a great deal of guilt Implied in having stolen goods in my possession. I had a bundle with me, and there was a hole in the wall, where I might have made away with the bundle, but I did not, but however, after that I was searched; I was taken to the magistrate's, at Hatton Garden, I believe, but before we went into court, they proposed to me to enter on board some of his majesty's ships, or to go for a soldier, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280045"/>I absolutely must confess, that I was willing; they told me there was no fear if I was agreeable to do that; I told them it was not for fear of guilt, but for fear of being in a prison. I told them I was willing to go, and in any corps that they might think proper, but when I came to have the examination I was denied that.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I lost the feathers almost out of two beds entirely, one in each garret. One is quite gone, and the feathers are almost gone out of the other.

I have seen them, and am clear they are mine.</p>

               <p>Q. You are the wife of the prosecutor? - Yes. On the seventh day of May, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to ask me how I did. She had been a lodger with me about twelve months back. I asked her to stop, and take a bit of breakfast along with me, and after I had my breakfast, I asked her if she would stop in my place while I went to fetch a shovel that a neighbour had borrowed. When I came back she was there, and staid for about ten minutes, and then she went, and as soon as I opened my box, I missed a gown and shift.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was your box kept? - In the same room she was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it the last time before it was stole? - The Monday before.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did she take it? - Wednesday. The Monday following I found them at the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your house broke open at any time? - Yes, between the hours of one and five on the 22d. I was the last person up.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your windows and doors secured on the 22d? - Yes, I went to bed about half after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the first person up in the morning? - No, the servant was up before me, and came and alarmed me a little after six.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day light at the time the alarm was given? - Yes. I found the cellar door open, the lock wrenched.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that within side of the house? - Inside of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at all perceive how they had had got into the house? - They had taken an iron bar out of the cellar window which opens into the stable yard, and by opening the cellar door which opens into a passage, which has the whole range of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find that cellar door? - I found it wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of your own knowledge whether that cellar door had been fastened the over night? - I am confident of it, I double locked it myself. The lock of the door was not put back, it had been wrenched by forcing the staple; I also found the door open that want into the stable yard, there they had a proper conveyance for taking away the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you fastened that door that goes into the stable yard at night? - It was fall then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you examined your premises did you find any thing missing? - Yes, I lost a cag of gin, also a cag of compounds called oxmore.</p>
               <p>Q. About how many gallons did they comain? - I cannot positively say; there was about three gallons lest of the oxmore.</p>
               <p>Q. And how many gallons of gin? - Nine gallons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing besides? - Yes, a great quantity of red wine in bottles, I cannot exactly say how much. I rather suspected one Clarke and got a search warrant to search his house in the afternoon of the 23d.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your property at Clarke's? - Yes, a dozen of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that Clarke said, did you afterwards see the prisoner? - Yes. In consequence of what Clarke said they went to the prisoner's house, the King's Head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with them? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner? - He keeps a small public house at Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from your house - A quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a house where they sell wine? - I don't know really, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at any time with the prisoner at the bar, when he said any thing? - Yes, after the prisoner was confined by the constable, at the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. At his own public house or another? - At another. The constable sent for me after they had taken him, to see if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280055"/>could find any of my property; nothing was found in the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you afterwards went where they had the prisoner in confinement? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or any body in your hearing make him any promise, or threaten him, to induce him to say any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then tell us what he said. - He said, if we would loose him and not keep him in confinement, he would pay me for my loss; afterwards he said that he had seven or eight bottles of my wine in his possession, which he would surrender up, and that he had sent a person for them to take them to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all you know about this man? - The same day, but before I fetched the search warrant, I called at his house and had part of a pot of beer with him; after he was taken into confinement he said he was sorry that he had not told me more of the case, at the time I was drinking the beer with him, that he might be admitted a King's evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. What time of the day was this? - In the evening, after his confinement.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get the search warrant? - On the afternoon of the 23d.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lives in the house with you? - My wife's father.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name? - Spring.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the house your's? - I went it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you alone answerable for the rent? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. It was day light when you got up, therefore you cannot say at what time they broke the house open? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go with any search warrant in consequence of any information that Mr. Lawrence's house had been broks open? Had you the prisoner at the bar in your custody? - Yes; I went to the house, and his wife denied him.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time did you apprehend him? - Between eight and nine, the evening of the 23d. I took him to the Blue Anchor public house, and he declared to me that he would pay all the expences, that he would pay the landlord for the wine and liquor that was lost, and he would pay the constable and every one for their trouble; he would pay all expences, rather than be taken to gaol to be made an oration of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else at any time? - He mentioned it several times to me. After his commitment to Shepperton, I asked him to give up the liquor, as the landlord was as young beginner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Be so good to tell us what past before he made this confession; perhaps you made some oration to him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you did not tell him that he had got into a bad scrape, and had better do something to get out of it? - I had sufficient trouble to secure him.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you had sufficient trouble to get this confession? - No, quite the reverse.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you did not tell him? it would be better for him? - I am certain I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you told him it was but a flea bite, that he might confess every thing? - My answer to him was, that he had better hold his tongue, and say nothing, for Clarke had turned evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now tell us what you said to him and he to you about this wine? - After he came out from the bench and was committed, I said, Nott, you had better give up this wine to the landlord, for he was a young beginner, and could not well bear the loss; and his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280056"/>wife told it was not in the place where he put it.</p>

             window; Wingrove broke it, and we got into the cellar where his liquor was; they put me in, and Wingrove and Notts they stood outside, at the window, while I opened the door to let them In.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after you got in? - I asked the liquor and took some away.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take away? - A cask of gin, and a cask of cordial, some red port, and I believe there was some white.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the port in? - In bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. About what hour was it you broke in? - Between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the house? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the liquor and wine after you had got it? - Carried it down to Notts's house. We shared the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the liquor? - We carried it over into the Heath, opposite the house, and buried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it been found since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who got the liquor afterwards? - The landlord, Thomas Lawrence; I told him where to find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many bottles of wine you had apiece? - We shared it at Notts's house; I had twelve, the rest had eight apiece. I was taken up the same day, Friday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover this matter then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To save yourself, I suppose? - I did not think much about saving myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullon. You are positive that Notts was with you when you broke open the house? - No, we went and called him up after.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Wingrove broke the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were was Notts? - At home.</p>
               <p>Q. Then afterwards you went and called up Notts? - Yes. It was agreed upon the over night.</p>
               <p>Q. If ever you did say that Notts was with you when you broke open the house, it was not true? - I never did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you did not say so before the justice? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then perhaps, if the justice has taken it down so, he took it down false? - I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never said Notts broke the bar with you, but that you and Wingrove broke the bar together, and then you wentand called up Notts. You desire to be believed by the truth of what you have now sworn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to tell my friend just now that Notts and Wingrove put you into the cellar? - So they did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave information of the prisoner at the bar having been concerned in this, you did not know that it would do you any good? - No, I did not know any thing about it; all the gentlemen round persuaded me to tell. I did not know any thing about saving myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that you had been guilty of burglary? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know that you deserved to be hanged for that? - I did not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps then as you did not know that you deserved to be hanged for breaking open a house, you did not know that there was a reward? - No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280057"/>Q. Pray what is your business, Mr. Clarke? - A day labouring man.</p>

               <p>Q. How many nights before in that week? - None.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a day labourer? - Ever since I was bred up, and turned out to service twelve or fourteen years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what do you mean by a day labourer? - I work for my bread.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you before? - Lived in service.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Betster? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I see him after he was taken up; he was in my custody a time.</p>
               <p>Q. While he was in your custody did he say any thing? - He offered to give up eight bottles of wine, rather than have any more piece of work about it, or words to that purpose. I likewise had the two casks that are here, at the bench of justices they told me to give the landlord the liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Who put them into your custody? - The headborough, I believe; and I put a dark lanthorn into my pocket, which I was told belonged to John Nott.</p>

               <p>Q. Was every part of this house and warehouse windows and doors fastened, before you went out? - Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not aware that any part was left open? - I am not. The next morning, between seven and eight, I found my warehouse open; I observed a great part of my property moved from their respective places; I observed like wife two large bags completely filled with my property, laying near the warehouse door, filled with threads and tapes, sewing thread and sewing cotton. The next thing that I observed was my desk broke open; I examined it and found my watch was gone; it was a gold repeating watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose a cornelian seal with it, a steel watch chain, a gold watch key, and a gold bed hook? - Yes; I have recovered the seals, and bed hook, and bed key.</p>
               <p>Q. The other property, I understand, was not removed out of your house? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure from the observation that you made, that the property that you see in the morning, was removed in the course of the night? - I am perfectly sure of it. The bags were not my property; I never see them before.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever left this house without any body in the house? - I had, but not for five or six nights previous to this robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Since the time that you left your house empty, had you seen all the things that you have described to be found in bags? - I have not a doubt but I have; but I cannot speak particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. The very night this business was done, you went out and left North in the house? - I did not; I went to his house and delivered him the key, in St. Ann's-lane, near Maiden-lane, Wood-street.</p>
               <p>Q. We know that St. Ann's lane, and Queen street, Cheapside, are at a considerable distance? - Some distance.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you return to the house with North? - I did not.</p>

               <p>I am a hair dresser; I slept in this house the night it was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought you the key? - Mr. Dinsdall, about twenty minutes before eight.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go to the house? - About ten minutes before ten. In putting the key into the door I discovered the door to be on the single lock; it rather startled me, as every evening before I found it double locked; immediately the key was in I opened it and sees a glimmering light in the passage, and I says to another young man that went with me to sleep there, there are thieves in the house; his name is

            ; he immediately says, pull to the door. We endeavoured to pull to the door and double lock it, to keep them in, but they over powered us, and opened the door and rushed out. I don't know how many were in the house; I see two men come out; I know one to be the man, for I caught hold of him as he came out; I cannot speak to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in the house at the time? - None but the light of the dark lanthorn, in the hands of a person, when we opened the door. As he came out of the house I caught hold of the man at the bar, and with the force of his coming out, he sent me to the ground; I had hold of his coat at the same time, but I was obliged to leave go his coat; in the mean time he got the other side of the way; I fell to the ground on my side, by his rushing out; I was obliged to loose my hold to recover myself, by that time he gained the other side of the way, and I caught him by the flap of his coat again before he got to the pavement, and there I held him, till. I gave him in charge to the constable; he ran some little distance. There was not a foul about, that it was impossible for me to be mistaken in the man that I laid hold of. The other young man pursued the other, and I kept this in my eye. When the constable took charge of him, he took him into a public house and searched him; he had nothing about him; but while I had hold of him, he rummaged his pockets for something, and he slipped his hand between his thighs and dropped something, which founded to me like keys, and there were some pick lock keys brought to us in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it he dropped something? - In Queen-street, the corner of Watling-street; I see his hand, but I did not see what he had got in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were the pick lock keys brought in after? - About two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the person here that brought them in? - I don't think he is; he was a person that came up promiscuously, and I don't think we have seen him since. I see him to the counter; we went back immediately to the house, after I had been to the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other prisoner? - He got out of the other young man's hands; he was not taken. The other young man got back before me; when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280060"/>got back, there was a bag with a number of goods packed in it in the passage, and another bag in the warehouse on the floor, about three parts full. I went to the little compting house, and there I perceived the strews had been wrenched out of the halps of the little desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any violence done to the door of the house? - Nothing at all. They must have got in by pick lock keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark when you got there? - It was a dark night; we could see by the light of the lamps ten or twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. We understand from the prosecutor that he left the house between seven and eight, and you were there about ten, so that there were two hours elapsed between the time that the prosecutor left you the key and the time you went there? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. You pursued the prisoner at the bar? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Chamberlain's attention was not directed to the prisoner, it was after another man? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the keys that were found were found after the prisoner was in custody? - After I had got him. I could not perceive what it was dropt, but I heard the rattle of something like keys, and I see him rummage his pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the sixth of October, and about ten at night, dark of course? -Dark, so as you might see by the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. The night was dark without the lamps? - It was. It was a wet night, but free from rain at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my lord just now that there was no other light but the light of the dark lanthorn? - Not in the house. As I opened the door there was no other light that I could see but the dark lanthorn, and that was in the man's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You endeavoured to pull to the door? - I did. My partners had hold of the nob of the door, and I had hold of the key, but that was not so strong a purchase as they might have on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. But however, notwithstanding that, they rushed out, and you was down in a moment? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the lanthorn? - It was found in the house afterwards. There is a lamp directly opposite.</p>

               <p>Q. Queen-street is a wide street you know? - Just room for two carts to pass. I could evidently see any person that was coming up or down the street for ten or twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that at the distance of ten or twenty yards that you could discern a man so as to know him? - I don't say so, but he was not two yards from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner at the bar before in your life? - Never, but it was all momentary, and he was in custody momentary.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that the life of the man at the bar is at stake in this prosecution? - No, I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I tell you that his life is at stake; on your oath do you mean to swear to this man under these circumstances? - I do, I can do it, I have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard there is a reward in the case of conviction, where a house is broke open? - Yes, I have heard such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a reward, how much is it? - According to the circumstances. I have heard there is a reward of forty pounds if the man is to be hanged.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, sir, what may you be? - I am a hair-dresser, and keep a house in St. Ann's-lane, and the man that I lived with I lived with till I was in business for myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go with North to the prosecutor's house? - I did. As soon as North came to the door, we were alarm<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280061"/>ed by a glimmer of light, and North and I attempted to pull the door to, but we were overcome by somebody inside, and they with force rushed out upon us. The first man that came out was the man I struck at, that made his escape. I pursued him across the road, and he presented something to me which I thought to be a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man, do you know? - I know not, only that North had hold of him. I see him lay hold of a man that came out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that North laid hold of was taken to a public house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you lost your man did you return to Dinsdall, or go to the public house? - I returned to Dinsdall, and from there I went to the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open when you returned? - It was. I did not enter it before I went to the public house, and got a light in a lanthorn, the Three Cranes, in Queen-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the public house? - Yes, I see North have hold of him at the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else, were there any keys produced? - Not while I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back to Mr. Dinsdall's? - I did, with the light. I found a large pack of goods in the passage, tied up, and another pack in the warehouse, three parts full, and found the desk in the counting house broke open, and a few halfpence scattered about it, with a locket; there was a variety of goods lay scattered about the warehouse, and a dark lanthorn between the warehouse door and the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in the dark lanthorn, or had it been put out? - Put out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the candle appear as if it had been lately burning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When we searched the house we heard there were three men, but we could find no other.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing disturbed in the upper part of the house? - Nothing in the world.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Were you present when the prisoner was searched? - No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. There was a considerable brush out of the house? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you thrown down? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't undertake to swear to the man that North took? - I do not. I see him take hold of a man, but who that man was I cannot say.</p>

On the 6th of October, Tuesday evening, it may be some little before ten o'clock in the evening, I had just done supper, I thought I heard rather more noise than usual. I opened my door, and found a man of the name of North had a man in possession by the collar, and I was given to understand that he had made his escape out of the next house to mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - That is the man. We went into the public house which is next door, and there he was searched by one Wright, a watchman; I went with him to the counter. I see the keys and a dark lanthorn; the keys were brought into the public house, one part picked up in Queen-street, and the other part in Watling-street. They were brought into the Three Cranes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has kept the keys ever since? - I believe Wright, the constable.</p>

I see the man on the sixth of this month at the Fleece, in Well-court, in company with another man, about a quarter after nine at night, or near ten, he called for six penny's worth of gin and water; he sat down for about five minutes, and another man came and pushed the door open, and then the other two immediately went out, after having a glass of gin at the bar altogether. They went out together. About half an hour after that I was sitting at the Fleece door, and I heard a noise in Queen-street, and I immediately went out and see the prisoner now at the bar in the hands of North.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you? - A carpenter. On Thursday morning, the 15th of this month. I went down to the house that the prisoner lodged at; I went and asked whether the prisoner Alice, lodged there? he said he did, and was sorry for it; I asked what it was for? he said he was a very bad man, and there was a person there that told me that he brought a sack of hair there the last night. I went down and see the sack of hair there.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose house was this? - No. 9, Blandford-mews, the person's name is Hale that keeps the house, the back of East-street, Manchester-square. I went up to Mr. Thomas's and asked them if they had lost any hair? they said they had; Mr. Thomas was not at home. I went and got a warrant for the prisoner; in the mean time I went for the warrant, the prisoner went away; but I met him on Thursday, the 15th, the bottom of Oxford-road, took him and called for a coach, and took him to the Apollo, at Paddington-street. When we got into the coach, he said to me, Mr. Dixon,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280069"/>what must I do in this mess I said, the only thing that you can do is to acknowledge where the hair is gone. He sent his wife for the hair the same day, and I took the hair from off her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know from the prisoner whether they were his lodgings or not? - I did. I conveyed the hair to the justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peate. You met the prisoner in Oxford-road, you say; that is not far from where he works? - A great way.</p>
               <p>Q. In the day time, walking about in public? - I believe he wished to be hid, he tried to get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass between you and him besides what you have told his lordship? - He told me that he took it out of Mr. Thomas's house where he saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that he was directed by his master to take it out? - No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Grub. I know nothing about his taking the box; he used to come there and ill use me; have formerly lived with him, and I left my husband; I told him that I would not live with him any longer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cann. This young man sent for me out of the public house, and de<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280073"/>sired me to go of an errand for him to pawn two spoons, which I did, and he asked me for the key of the door; I gave it him accordingly, and he went up stairs and left a bundle of things, and I did not know any thing of it, till the officer came and searched my room.</p>
               <p>Court to Haynes. The publican's daughter has told us about a box that was taken from the house, was that so? - Yes, it was empty, and it has never been out of my custody since.</p>

On the twenty fourth of September I had some carpenters employed; one of the carpenters looking for a wedge at the top of the horse stall, found a parcel of soap laying there; there was no sugar there; that was on Thursday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was there? - To the amount of about three pounds nearly. He made my brother and apprentice acquainted with it that night. On the morning following I was told of it; the apprentice went over to the stable, and he brought the soap into the shop to let me see it. I desired him to replace the soap, to see whether there would be any more taken to it to the same place; it was yellow soap, and on Saturday morning there was some white mottled soap with it. I had occasion to go out of town on Sunday morning, and desired the prisoner to have the horse ready at eight o'clock; and I had some suspicion that he would take away the soap on Sunday morning, and desired my brother and the apprentice to watch that he did not take it away from the time of his getting up to the time that I went out of town. Before I went out, I went over to the stable, and charged him with having things belonging to me secreted in the stable. I said to him, you have some things secretly concealed belonging to me. I did not know of any sugar. I told him I would have a constable, and take him before a magistrate, if he did not tell me what he had concealed there.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell what he said after that threat. - He want down on his knees among the litter, and brought some sugar out, about a pound and a half or two pounds. I told him he had some other articles there as well, and he denied that, but he brought the soap, about two pounds; he had the ginger concealed in his pocket, about two or three ounces, which he threw out as he was coming down the yard. I cannot swear to any part of the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any part? - I could not out of the quantity that we have.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Pringle. I went over to the stable on the twenty-fourth of September, towards the evening, and found only one piece of soap in the stable, and I went over on Friday morning, and I found four pieces. I then informed Mr. Pringle of it, and he went over with me, and between the times that I came and told Mr. Pringle, the prisoner had been over to the stable with the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner use to go to the stable? - Yes, three times a day constantly to feed the horse; he had taken two pieces away by the time that Mr. Pringle went over. I went over again on Saturday morning, and there were brought two pieces there of a different kind of soap, white soap.</p>
               <p>Q. Other people might go to this stable besides the prisoner? - The stable was locked; there was nobody had any business there besides our own family.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You and the prisoner had words frequently together? - No.</p>

I see him deliver the soap out, and it was delivered into my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Was it such soap as you told? - Yes, it was. He was a man that I had unlimited confidence in, and if any man had told me of it the night before, I should not have believed him; he was a man that served me, to all appearance, very faithfully, and very industrious.</p>

I see the prisoner in a watchman's coat, he had no lanthorn, he had a large stick. I asked him where the gunsmith's shop was, he made me no answer, but took me by the collar, held up his stick, and said, where is your money? where I say a word, and I will knock you down. I had the advantage of taking the stick in both my hands, which I did, and pushed him against the wall, being in so public a street, I thought I should get assistance, which I did, several people came, and took, him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be sober at the time? - Not knowing the man, I cannot say; he made use of a very queer expression afterwards, he said, insult me? would you insult the Prince of Wales? That was some considerable time after he was taken. At the time he first attacked me, there was not a single soul in the street, he had his watchman's great coat on, and some people said, let us examine, and see if he was a watchman or no; on examining further, we found that he was a watchman, but it was not his hour of being out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he go with you as an assistant? - He went with us as an assistant.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the warrants that you had prepared? - We had the warrants which we had prepared the evening before. We went first of all to the house of Mr. Benett, which Mr. Pinsent pointed out as a person of that description; we searched his house, and at the back part of his house there was a five gallon tub found, we seized it. That was in the yard, the back part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all you found there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had seized this, what did you next do? - We went to the house of one Horton? another person that we had a warrant against in the same town, and there we found nothing; from thence we went down the street, to the house of one

               <p>Q. What next did you do? - I repeatedly knocked at the door for admittance, but I discovered a key inside, and the door appeared to be locked. While I was knocking at the door, somebody called to me, that

             was coming.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that from the street or in the house? - From the street. He came up to the stairs, to the top of the stairs of the dwelling house door; as they told me he was Rewitt, I did not know the man. I asked him if he was master of the house, he said he was, I then told him I had a warrant to search his house, and read the warrant to him; on this he went to the door, and attempted to open it, I told him that I believed the door was locked; then he called, open the door, there was no answer made, and went off; and seemed very much distressed and cried.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you did after you got in? - There was a cellar under the dwelling house, and in that cellar I could perceive there was some liquor; about the middle of the stairs there was a little window that opened into the cellar, which was made fast in the middle, with a kind of shutter over it; I stood on the stairs, and pushed open the shutter with my foot, it gave way, on which I see a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280077"/>quantity of tubs slung with cords in the usual way. I requested a soldier to go in, a soldier went in, through the window, and opened the door, which was locked I believe. We then went in, and took one of the casks, and bored it with a gimbler, and tasted the liquor, and to the best of my recollection, it was brandy. We made the seizure, and I asked the Custom-house officer if he would give me leave to deposit the goods in his house, he readily said that we should put it in his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you enabled to see what was the quantity in this house which was the object of your seizure? - There was a very large quantity, to the amount, very probably, of two hundred casks, to the best that we could determine.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Pinsent being a resident there, you thought it a proper place to lodge it at his house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me of what part you made a seizure, and where it was conveyed to? -We seized all that was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of it removed from Rewit's house to the house of Pinsent? -We removed sixteen tubs to the house of Pinsent, containing sixty-five gallons of brandy. and fifteen of geneva.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened from without that alarmed you? - We were alarmed by the firing of several guns or swivels. There was a report of several guns towards the key, out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to describe to my lord and gentlemen the situation of Port Parrow, as it bears relation to a key there? - It is a little fishing cove, and there is a key there.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a small pier there? - There is a small pier.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Rewitt's house from this pier? - A very little trifle, about two hundred yards. If you go round to go immediately to the water, it is a very trifling distance. I was apprehensive that the mob was assembling, and going to rescue the goods. I was insulted by several of the inhabitants. A man came up to me and cursed me, and called me all that was not good. That was not the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. However, you met with insult? - Yes, saying they should soon be prepared, that I should not remove my bones from thence, and it was the last time I should come there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there in fact any assembly of people that came to annoy you? - There was a large number that came at last armed with guns and clubs, large sticks, and the prisoner at the bar had a bayonet, when I first see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Speak to the number, how many might come towards you? - I dare say there were upwards of a hundred people in the street, but how many armed I cannot pretend to say, but a great many of them were armed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they come up towards you, and done any thing, when you had an opportunity of seizing the prisoner, Long mead? - The soldiers were in the act of removing the goods, and the mob came upon them, and said, they should not carry them from thence; one of them went to the cellar door, and shut the door, who it was I don't know, and said, he would be d-ned if we should move any of those goods from there, that we should be murdered if we attempted to do it. The soldiers were drawn up. Mr. Pinsent requested me for God's sake not to let the soldiers fire, for, says he, if you do, we shall be all murdered. I told them that I did not come to molest them myself, and requested that they would let me take the goods out of town; they said, they would be d-d if they would, that they would sooner lose their lives than their property, and if we did not go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280078"/>about our business, that they would murder as, or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation were the tubs in when you got into the house of Rewitt's? - They laid in the cellar in rows, all slung in cords. With that mob I see the prisoner at the bar, he had a bayonet in one hand, with a suzee in the other, and he came up pretty close to me, and said, he would be d-d if he would not run me through. I believe him to be the same person. I never see him before that time, nor have I seen him after, till I took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him now, do you believe him to be the person? - To the best of my recollection; he had a bayonet in one hand, and a suzee in the other, and swore he would run me through if I did not desist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on and continue? - I asked them at length, if they would let us take the goods out of the town? they said, they would be d-d if we should. On this I quitted the place, I thought my life was in danger.</p>
               <p>Q. Now be so good as to describe the guns that you mentioned, how they were placed? - There was a gun in the street, it was a swivel, it was elevated and pointed towards us, it laid between the house were the goods were, and Mr. Pinsent's. I see powder on the touch of it, and an officer of mine told me, that there were three guns behind, that I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. So far as you observed yourself, did you see any other piece of ordnance of any kind? - No, only that one.</p>
               <p>Q. How many guns might there be in the hands of the people, that were come up in this croud to you? - Really I cannot tell you upon my word. There might be four or five, or more, I cannot presume to say, but I can speak safely to that number, positively there were four or five. We returned then on this, and went to the public house, and called for some refreshment, and went home.</p>

               <p>Q. You gave up the seizure? - We abandoned it. After we had got to the public house, I requested Mr. Pinsent to go down to see whether they were more cool, and inclined to give up the goods; that was about half an hour after. Whether he went or not, I cannot say, but he returned back, and said, it was of no use, they were not disposed to give up the seizure.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that cellar of Rewitt's in your district? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You have been some time an officer of excise? - I have been twenty years or more in the employ.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been long stationed at Cornwall? - Ten years at Bodmin.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into Mr. Rewitt's cellar, and see these things, did you bring the casks out? - Sixteen only were taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. What has become of these sixteen? - They have been condemned by the Exchequer, and sold. They were secured in Pincent's house.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a question that my learned friend put to you, that you did not give any answer to. How long after this was it that you first see the man that you suppose to be the prisoner Longmend? - I cannot tell the exact time. I did not see him on the first beginning of the mob, it was near the conclusion of the business.</p>
               <p>Q. So I understand, but I want to know how long it was after the mob had assembled before you see him? - It was almost over, the mob had assembled for about half an hour, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently at this time you must be very much alarmed? - I was certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen him before nor since till he was taken up. Now how many months might elapse between the time that this affray happened and the time that he was taken up? - It is a long time; from March, 1794, till within a month ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280079"/>Q. That is, I believe, a year and a half? - Yes, so it is.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had never seen the man before nor since till that time, nor did you see him on that day till the latter end of the business, and after you were very much agitated? - I see him in the street afterwards walking, while we were in the public house refreshing ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you say then when my friend asked you the question, that you had never seen him before the time that the affray happened, nor after, until the time that he was taken up? - Not that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point out any other man of the mob? - A man that I had known before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point out any other man in the mob whom you had not known before, and whom you had not seen for a considerable number of months after? - There is a man that I think I should know if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. The next time that you see this man was after he was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you had never seen him from that day till after he was taken up, and pointed out to you as one of the men. Then the first time that you recognized him as one of the men was after he was pointed out to you as one of the persons that had been in the mob? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long will you venture to say you see him in the mob? - Not a long time, but he was more particular in having a bayonet.</p>
               <p>Q. More than half a minute? - Five or six minutes at least.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to swear that? - I do. I dare say I see him for four or five minutes in the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say that he had in his hands? - He had a gun and a bayonet.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he had a piece of fire arms in his hands? - Yes, I do, positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray are you the gentleman that was a witness in the Court of King's Bench two or three years ago? - I have been a witness in several causes.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you? - I am a native of South Wales.</p>
               <p>Q. Then probably you are the same man that was very near being committed for perjury in the Court of King's Bench, and gave as a reason for what you said, that you did not understand English? - No, I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were never resrobated by a Judge in the Court of King's Bench for the evidence that you had given, and gave as a reason for what you said, that you did not understand English? - I do not recollect the circumstance, nor nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps I may have mistaken the Court, was it in the Court of Exchequer? - It was not, never such a thing ever happened in any Court Whatever, positively, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you an officer of the excise? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have been threatened to be dismissed? - I have been threatened by the smugglers, but by nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you had a representation that you were likely to be dismissed from the office? - There have been impeachments by smugglers, but they could not make good the impeachments.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you had not a caution given you by your employers? - I have been cautioned once or twice by my superiors.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been told, that if you did not conduct yourself very different, you would be dismissed from the service? - I have not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280080"/>Q. What do you call, a caution? - A miss of the pen, or irregularity of duty.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you swore to this man was it you were cautioned? - I cannot pretend to say, I don't recollect, fourteen or fifteen years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. And never since? - I don't know that I have any business to answer these questions, if the commissioners ask me these questions I will answer them.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you under any censure at present? - Not in the past.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Then for the space of eighteen months you had never seen this man? - I see him that day afterwards, I told you so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Where did you take him up? - At Port Parrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any foundation for the suposition that you have been reprobated in any court of justice for evidence that ever you gave? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been an officer of excise? - I have been one twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so goods as to explain what you mean by a caution? - For mere irregularity in our duties, making a change in a figure, or any thing of that sort.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you are an officer of excise, at Bodmin, in Cornwall? - I was at the time that this took place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany Mr. Llewyn and the soldiers, and the party that went to Port Parrow? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got there tell us what passed? - We searched two houses, in the first we found five gallons of spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any search warrant with you? - Mr. Llewyn had with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was that? - They were just at the back door, thrown out as I came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that five gallons contained in? - In what they call tubs in that country.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that tub fastened? - There were small cords about it, what we call slung.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way in which the smugglers usually carry their brandies and liquors? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had found this cask where did you go then? - We searched another house, and found nothing in that; we then went to

            's house; Mr. Llewvn went to the front door of the house, and demanded entrance, we found the door ladened, it was locked, Mr. Pinsent, the custom house officer, said, that Rewitt was coming up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he afterwards appear? - He did; Llewyn shewed him the warrant, he demanded entrance, he desired them to open the door; there was no person spoke on the inside; Mr. Llewyn then came down all the way of the steps, and there was a window to the cellar which gave way, and he saw tubs in the cellar; he ordered a soldier into the cellar, and he unbolted the cellar door.</p>
               <p>Q. How many tubs were there? - A great quantity, between two and three hundred, all slung, that I see at least.</p>
               <p>Q. In the usual way that smugglers carry them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What then? - We went about removing of these tubs to the custom house officer's house, Mr. Pinsent's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by we? - Mr. Llewyn, and part of the soldiers that were with us. There was a person just as we began, came up to the cellar and said, if we did not withdraw -</p>
               <p>Q. That was not the prisoner? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mob assembled at that time? - There was not. We went about removing the goods, and as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280081"/>I returned from Mr. Pinsent's house, one soldier said there were three swivels brought up, I looked and see three swivels, they were pointed towards the cellar door, where the tubs were deposited; I ordered four or five soldiers to six their bayonets, and walk with me to the swivels; I then returned to the cellar door, and found the street was full of men.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation were those men? - There were several of them armed with guns and susees.</p>

               <p>Q. How many do you think were armed with guns? - I believe I see myself just there, eight or ten or a dozen, I cannot say, but I think so; the street was very narrow, and they came up very close to us.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides that were there any others armed in any other way? - Yes, I observed several with large sticks in their hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do when they came up close to you? - They threatened that if we did not leave the goods, and take ourselves off, that they would murder us; one of them catched the banger that I had in my hand, and threatened to run me through with it; I told him that he would be called to an account for his conduct, and desired him to give it up to me again, which he did. Mr. Llewyn told them he would not wish to have any blood spilt, that he would withdraw, he found that they were more in number a great many than we were. Then we withdrew to the public house.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you had withdrawn to the public house, had you seen how Llewyn was treated? - Yes; there was a person with a susee and bayonet fixed on it, first, and afterwards I see him with the susee and bayonet not fixed, the susee in one hand, and the bayonet in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that person do? - I see him afterwards with the bayonet in his hand, pointing the bayonet at Mr. Llewyn, and he swore he would run him through.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the susee, I don't know indeed; I recollect seeing the bayonet pointed at Mr. Llewyn.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you recollect the person again if you was to see him? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round about the court? - I believe that to be the man, but I cannot positively swear to it, I never see him before nor since.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of these tubs that you had seen? - We lodged them in the custom house officer's house; the mob obliged a soldier, and I believe one of the officers, to lay down four in the street, which I took up and carried them back to the cellar. When they came up and insisted on having the cellar door shut, we shut the cellar door, and withdrew to the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any attempt has been made to take any people concerned in this business since? - O, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this matter happened was there any attempt to take any body? - Upon my word I cannot justly say the time.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean to a day; how long think you? one month or six months? - It may be four, five, or six months after this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you here when the bill was found by the grand jury? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there an attempt to take them after the bill was found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that time? - It might be a month or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the attempt was made? - We had soldiers, a hundred and three private soldiers from Maker camp.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to take any body? - No, they had made their escape, they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you go to take? - We went to take the persons that were indicted, their names were Liddy, and Perry, and Longmead.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280082"/>Q. Were you at last able to carry off any of these spirits that you had seized? - No, we left it at the custom house officer's house, on account of the mob being so powerful that we could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the warrant for searching Rewntes house? - Mr. Llewyn.(Llewyn produces it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. The tubs that were actually removed, were taken before this riot commenced? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After the riot commenced, and got at the length that you have described, nothing was taken? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore what these tubs contained that were left behind, you cannot say? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of a man, not the prisoner, that took your cutlass, the disposition of that man however was such, that on your demanding your cutlass he gave it back to you? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw a man with a susee and bayonet fixed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards saw that man in a threatening posture to Mr. Llewyn, with the bayonet in his hand; can you say whether he had a musket in his hand at that time? - I cannot say, I do not recollect seeing it at the time; I did not take particular notice, I cannot say whether he had or had not.</p>
               <p>Q. I observed you was desired to find out this man; you have been in courts of justice before? - Yes; I have never been here before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you look at the bar for the person that you want to find out.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him since that day, before you see him now? - I see him since, but whether it was the day we were there, or the day we brought the goods from there, two or three days after, I cannot be positive, but I took particular notice of him, that I might recollect him.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, whether the person whom you recognized there, or four days after the obstruction was over, whether you see him amongst the mob when the obstruction happened? - I see him among the mob. I see him with the susee in his hand, and he had a bayonet on the susee, pointed at Mr. Llewyn.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say at the time he was doing this? - I cannot say any particular expression that he made use of, but he made some threatening words, what he would do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the time in the act of seizing these things? - We had the goods in our possession at the time that I see him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the behaviour of the mob at the time that you see him with this susee? - I heard a man say to Mr. Llewyn, d-n thy eyes, Llewyn, I will have thy blood before thou goest out of the place; and he bent his piece at the same time at Mr. Llewyn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see how many men might have arms at that time? - I can answer that; I see five or six with arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the swivels? - I see a small cannon or swivel, I see the priming of it at the top.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Did you see these casks that were taken from the soldiers? - I see two casks that were dropped in the street, I don't know who took them, they were brought back to the cellar by some person.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280083"/>Q. To Rewitt's cellar, where they were left? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I think you say that these that had been secured in Mr. Pinsent's cellar were secured before the mob came? - Just at the time that the mob were coming on, I believe there were some few casks that were taken to Mr. Pinsent's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did you see in what situation the casks were? - They were slung.</p>

We then secured them of course, and took them away. We have got all the things away.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time, and where, that you see the other prisoner? - I did not see him till he was brought into the front room, in the custody of the other officers; he was naked also.</p>
               <p>Q. I would only ask you whether the cellar stairs, on which you met, or found the prisoner Bartlett, led to any other place? - Close to the cellar stairs there was a pair of stairs that went up stairs, but the prisoners on being asked did not deny that they came out of the cellar, they said, don't use us ill, and we will be civil, which they certainly did behave very civil, and very proper. Here is every thing here, a vast quantity of halfpence finished, a great quantity indeed. They were cutting that day, not finishing.</p>

               <p>In consequence of an information we went to this Dean's-court, in St. Martin's Le Grand; on entering the court I see a window a little open, I went to the window and flung it up, and jumped in, and went to the head of the stair case, where I heard the voice of some men, saying, we are here! we are coming!</p>
               <p>Q. Where did that voice come from? - From below apparently, from towards the cellar, to the best of my hearing. Immediately Bartlett comes up, first, without his shirt; after him (I am not positive whether the other man followed or the woman) the other man came up without his shirt likewise, and a woman apparently in the same way; the woman was without a cloak or bonnet. I immediately got a candle and went down stairs into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the light in the cellar when you got down? - Yes; two or three, or more candles burning on each side of the press.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - I believe it was after twelve o'clock, to the best of my recollection. I then see a vast quantity of copper round the press; I put my fingers into the cups, supposing them to be dies, and they were very hot; I then came up stairs, and was informed by one of my brother officers that they had found a die with a stamp; the prisoners were secured in the parlour, and I told the prisoners it would save us a deal of trouble if they would tell where they were, for we should not leave the house till we found the dies; they asked to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280085"/>unhandcuffed, which they were, and went down into the cellar and discovered where the dies were, and helped us take up the press, and behaved very civil indeed; round the press I found a few halfpence that were struck, these are two, (produces them) these are the sort they were at work at (produces a blank) and a vast quantity more.</p>

I was informed by my shopman, that he had missed a piece of print, and had made diligent search for it, and could not find it. I applied to the police office in Worship street, offering a reward of five guineas if they should meet with the print in their walks. I applied to Harper, Monday, October the twelfth, I believe about the middle of the day. I heard nothing from them respecting the prints, but on Wednesday, the fourteenth, a gentleman came to my house, and in consequence of information, I went to the public office, in Goodman's-fields, on the fourteenth, and I see the very print there that I had lost. I think it was in the afternoon, in Little Ailiff-street, Goodman's fields; the officers has kept it. The prosecutor's husband has applied to me since, and offered.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. Gibson. The prisoner is the person that was in the shop on Friday, the second of this month, between six and seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your master? - A linen-draper.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when she was in the shop, was any body else in the shop? -Only the young men that serve in the shop, no customers.</p>

               <p>Q. How many shopmen had you in the shop? - Three other persons in the shop besides myself. When she came in, she desired me to shew her some prints for a servant's gown. I shewed her several,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280089"/> she begged me to shew her some my lock stripes, which I did, and after I had shewn her a great quantity, she refused having them, said they would not wash, and were not sit for a servant. I then were going to turn over the prints to shew her some that were among the laylock stripes, and she said, no, I will not have it, reach me that off the hinder shelf, then she desired me to cut her six yards of it, after that she opened a pocket book, and took out a pattern, and asked me if we had any thing to match that? we had nothing like to the pattern, but I shewed her one which she approved of better than her pattern, which was a remnant of eight yards. She then looked over two or three others, which she hung down the sides, to see which would look best, She had a little child with her, which was very troublesome, and she made a sad shuffling about the shop. She threw her down some halfpence, and she was for ten minutes picking up these. After I had served her, she begged of me to do up the things in two parcels, for one she durst not carry home, because she said Mr. Smith would not approve of it; I asked her whether I should send the parcel home? she said no, she said she lived in Prince's-street, Spital-fields; I opened the door, and wished her a good evening. She bought a gown for her servant, a remnant of eight yards of print, and a petticoat, and some other things. I believe she paid two pounds four shillings and five pence. I believe that was the sum. On the tenth we missed a piece of chintz print, which I perfectly remember shewing this person; that was on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the thing that you complain of being stolen? - Yes, and the laylock stripe.</p>

               <p>Q. How much does the two pieces contain? - I believe about fifty yards. This piece I remember shewing it to the prisoner at the bar, and she refused taking it, and I remember folding it up, and laying it on her side, and I never see it afterwards till I see it at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. You have described two pieces in the indictment, and you tell us that you only missed one? - No, we did not miss the other. I see them both at Ailiff street office. I cannot recollect the day of the month. I see it laying on the bar before the justice of the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This happened on the second of October? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep four persons besides yourself? - There are four persons besides Mr. Gibson.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your master any partner? - No, he has not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you served this woman? - Yes. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you took away and put up the goods that you had taken out of their places, that lay on the counter? - Those goods that I had been shewing to her I took out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put them in their places again? - Yes, I did, after she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you missed nothing? - No, I did not, I shewed her such a great quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till eight days after, namely, the tenth, that these pieces were at all perceived to be missing? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. There might be some hundreds of customers between the second and the tenth? - There might.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say, she laid out two pounds four shillings with you? - I cannot be not positive. It was thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not call that a bad customer that lays two pounds four shillings with you? - We call it a middling one, neither a bad customer nor a good one.</p>

I don't know whether we had when she came in. She came in, and asked to look at some printed cottons. Our young man shewed her a great many. She laid out about two pounds four and five pence in different articles. She might be in the shop about an hour, or not quite so much. She went out after she had paid for what she had had. On the tenth, I missed a piece of goods, we searched all over the shop, and could not find it. I missed a piece of chintz printed callico. It had my mark on it, I know the pattern very well. The Friday following I told Mr. Gibson. I never found it no more. I see it the Wednesday or Thursday in the officer's custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. We understand there are two persons more employed in the shop besides you and the last witness? - Yes, there are.</p>

               <p>Q. It is of course impossible for you to know what your fellow servants may fell when you are out of the way? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of your own knowledge it is impossible for you to know that this piece was not sold by any of your fellow servants that are not here? - I know I never sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till eight days after this woman was in your shop that you thought you lost this piece? - No, I did not miss it before.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to the police, Whitechapel. I produce these two pieces of print.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they printed callico? - I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards do they contain? - I cannot justly say the yards. On Wednesday, the fourteenth, we went to Mr. Clarke's house, looking over the prints, we brought these away, which, before the magistrate, Mr. Gibson proved to be his.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Clarke? - The husband of Mrs. Clarke.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do they live? - In the New Road. It appeared to me to be a linen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280091"/>draper's shop. Mr. Gibson applied to me the night-before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went to the house of these people? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get these things? -From the shop. Hanson brought them out of the shop, they were exposed for sale I believe. I brought them away, and have had them in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Gibson deposes to the prints by their pattern, and the marks being his shopman's hand writing, and he had never sold them.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Mr. Gibson. You are a married man? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife assist you in the shop? - No, she does not. She has the misfortune to be hard of hearing, and very unfit to be in a shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The mark is as visible and plain on it now as it was on the second of October? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no attempt to take it out? - There is not.</p>
               <p>Q. If this person took it, she had it eight days, and therefore had time to remove all evidence, yet the shop mark is as evident now as it was when you lost it.</p>
               <p>(Turner likewise deposes to the goods, and Eddy.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Eddy. The marks are just at the end of the pieces? - They are.</p>
               <p>Q. These marks might be cut off without any injury to the piece itself? - Most undoubtedly they might.</p>

               <p>Q. This was eight or ten days before they were found? - Eight days.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Gibson. What value do you put on these pieces? - Three pounds; two pounds on one, and one pound on the other. I would give more a good deal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called thirteen witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>On Friday, the ninth of this month, I was in Houndsditch. Between eight and nine in the evening, there was an hackney coach, and the prisoner at the bar in the coach, with another man; the other man told the coachman to drive on a little further; I followed it, and the coach stopped, and the coachman got off his box, and opened the coach door, the other man got out, and asked the coachman what his fare was, and he paid him, the prisoner did not get out. The coachman held the door, and observed, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280092"/>the prisoner did not seem to know what to do. The coachman stood for about two minutes, and then he asked him what he was to do? he bid him shut the door, he shut to the door; it was by a chandler's shop, and I went and put my hand over the hatch and got the candle, and went to the coach, and as I went and opened the coach door the prisoner attempted to get out; I put the candle away, and jumped into the coach, and we had a bit of a struggle, however, I secured him, and put my hand to the hind part, and took out a trunk; the prisoner said it was not his property. I took him the next morning before the Lord Mayor, and the property was advertised. I have got a part of the property here. It was by the approbation of the Lord Mayor that the gentleman should have the best part of the property, because the children had no things to put on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What time of night was this? - Between eight and nine I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. There was another man in the coach with the prisoner, why did you not apprehend that other man? - Because I was not thoroughly convinced that things were not right.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in the city of London where this property was found? - It is.</p>

A man called out, coach! and told me to the Butcher Row, nearest London Bridge, he got on the box with me. There were two men standing there, when we came there, with a trunk. That is one of them, the prisoner at the bar. I got down and let them in, the two men got inside, the prisoner at the bar got inside with one other man, the man that was on the box went behind the coach. They told me to go, but to no particular place. When I was on the bridge I asked where I was to go, they told I was to go up Fenchurch-street, but when I came within ten yards of Fenchurch-street, one man put his head out of window, the man that is missing, and then bid me go to Houndsditch. When I came to Houndsditch, the man that was behind the coach got down. I followed him up till we came to a court, when I came there, he got off from behind, and went away then, I went and got down from my box, and opened the door, and the other man got out of the coach, and paid me; the door remained open, and I asked the man inside whether I should shut the door? - He said yes, and I got some hay, and began to feed my horses, and the constable he then got a light, and secured the prisoner, That is the person that the constable secured.</p>

               <p>I and my daughter met Dr. Grieve just ascending Shuter's Hill.

I am a stay maker by profession, I carried the trunk for him to Butcher Row, he then told me to set it down, says he, we will have a coach, and after some little trifle of time, a man came down in a dark coloured coat, and he opened the coach door, and then we went in with the trunk, then the coach drove to Houndsditch, and he got out of the coach at Houndsditch, paid the coachman eighteen pence, and left me inside of the coach, and told me he should return immediately, then Mr. Tipper came and asked me, what I had got in the coach, I told him that I had something there, says he, I insist on taking charge of you, and he took charge of me in the coach, at least ways at the door of the coach, and he laid hold of me, and went into the coach immediately, and he pulled out this trunk, and he asked me whether this trunk belonged to me? I told him no, it belonged to the gentleman that was gone, and he took me to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come in? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see her while she was in the shop? - Yes, I did. On Friday, the ninth of this month, I was called down stairs, the prisoner at the bar was in my shop, when I came behind the counter, I recognized her features. I had seen her about three years and a half before in my shop; I had very great reason to suspect that she was a thief, as such, when she was gone, as there had been plenty of opportunity for her to take goods out of any shop, I looked particularly among them, and I missed two pieces of printed callico.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these the last time before it was missing? - That I cannot positively say, one of my young men can. I had seen them in the course of two or three days, they had not been in my shop above a week. In the evening of that night I and my young man,

            , made particular enquiry in the neighbourhood of Swan-street, where the prisoner had said that she resided, as I understand. I could hear nothing of her that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear of her? - On Tuesday following. This was on the ninth that she was at my shop, on Friday. On Tuesday I went down to her house, and I looked into the window of her shop, she keeps a linen-draper's shop. I see her shewing these prints that I had missed to a customer. I came up for assistance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280094"/>to the police office, and they went down with me in about an hour's time; we went there together, we searched the house for about an hour, without finding any thing that we were in search of, except the sag end of one of the pieces which was torn off. I have got it in my pocket; there is no mark on it, but it joins exactly where it was torn from. In the course of this hour we looked down the necessary twice, and there was nothing there, but I not being satisfied before I went, wished to have the place searched again; we went the third time, at least one of the officers did, and there lay these two pieces of print that I had missed, with that sag end cut off; the officer, after he had found them there, gave information to his partner, and I went immediately to the place, and see them there, and helped them to take them out. When I came into the shop again, the prisoner particularly solicited me not to proceed any further, offering me money, which I refused, telling her, that I did no more then what I thought was my duty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your's is a shop of a good deal of business, you keep a good many shopmen perhaps? - I keep two.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your wife serve in the shop? - She does not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the ninth that you saw her at your house, and the thirteenth, four days after that, you see her at her house? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about this offer of money before the magistrate? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know why you omitted to tell that circumstance before the magistrate? - I did not think of it.</p>
               <p>Q. It is now above a fortnight since, and at this time it occurs to your recollection? - It does.</p>

               <p>You are shopman to the prosecutor? - Yes. On the ninth of October the prisoner came in and asked to look at some different printed callicoes, I shewed her a variety of different patterns. In about two minutes after she came in, she told me her name was Mrs. Smith, a neighbour, likewise she had a sister, an opposite neighbour to us. She was in the shop about twenty-five minutes, as near as I can recollect, and purchased of me two gowns to the amount of three pounds nearly; she offered me a ten pounds Bank note, which I had not cash enough to give change. I rang the bell for Mr. Gillson, he came down stairs, and called me on one side, he gave me reason to suspect her; I came forward, and gave her the change, she immediately went out of the shop, the next instant I looked over the prints that I had been shewing her, I missed two patterns, two quantities, I know them, they have my own marks on them. I then immediately went and asked this person who she said was her sister, if she had any sister in town; she told me she had not. I went that same evening to Swan-street, where she said she lived, near Mr. Gillson's, we could find no person there of that name; on Saturday we enquired in the trade of our neighbours, likewise the same on Monday. On Tuesday we had information of a person answering that description and the name, with that Mr. Gillson told me he would go down to the police office.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with your master to the place? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Your master keeps two journeymen, was the other journeyman in the shop at this time? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. She bought goods to the amount of three pounds, you don't call that a bad customer that lays out two or three pounds with you? - Not a very bad one,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280095"/>if we had never better, it would be very bad.</p>

Then after that, this here man that is at the bar now took the young woman from me, and took her out of the path; then one of them put his hand down by the side of him and drew out a case knife,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280098"/>a black handled case knife, immediately he made a job at me, as he had got hold of the collar of my coat with his back hand, and I put up my hand, and stopped him, and I said, I will be d-ed if I do deliver either, and then he jobbed the knife at me, and I gave him a blow and knocked him down immediately; and then the other man came up and gave me a blow, immediately after I had knocked the other down; he did not knock me down; I recovered immediately, and then afterwards I gave him one and knocked him down, and then they both got up and ran back immediately, and said to this Sylvester Hill, let the young woman go; she tried to run away, and screeched two or three times, and then he gave her a blow and knocked her down; it was the prisoner that knocked her down; they all three ran away immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. YOu did not part with your money at all? - No, nor my watch; I had a watch in my pocket; I would not let them have either.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This was a case knife? - Yes, it was, I am sure it was; it was a black handled case knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this? - Between Newington Green and Kingsland, not in the high road, just in a path across a field; it was very moon light, and I thought it was safe enough to go that way.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been always certain? -As to the person of the prisoner I am certain it is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not point out somebody else to the magistrate? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing about his face? - Yes, he had something about his chin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a round hat? - A flapped bat, and an handkerchief up here, not quite so high as his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had never seen the prisoner before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not under four degree of terror and fright? - I was in her at first.</p>
               <p>Q. What you bold? - Yes, I was, after heat them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then never having seen this man, and seeing him for so short a space of time, and being alarmed and having the handkerchief up and the slap hat, do you mean to swear to him? - I do; I have an undoubted right to do so, because I am certain he is the man and no other.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand you it was moon light? - It was moon light as day, a finer evening there could not be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you know whether there is any reward attending this conviction? - I don't know, I never enquired.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear there was a reward for conviction of a highwayman? - Yes, I have heard that.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think is the reward? - I don't know; I never did convict one, nor I do not wish to convict him, unless he is deserving it; but I think this man is thoroughly deserving it; if he is convicted it is no more than what is right.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the second indictment you have preferred against him? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you are sure he is the man? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you would say so if it was till to-morrow? - Yes; if it was till next week, or seven years, or twenty years, I would say the same.</p>

Then I went to run away, and he ran and overtook me, and caught me, and I went to screech a second time, and he stopped my mouth again, and then the other two said, let her go again; and I fetched a very violent screech; and the instant I fetched the screech, he knocked me down, and then, when I was on the ground, he left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what was done to William Spice? - I observed that one of them had the knife in his hand; I observed that they were tusling with him, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as to the prisoner, can you speak to certainly as to him? - Yes; not the least doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are the prosecutor's wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been married to him? - A month the 1st of next month.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not married to him when I see you at Bow street? - I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. You say when they demanded the money of the prosecutor, the prisoner was engaged with you? - No, I did not say so. They were altogether when the demand was made of money.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he laid hold of you two or three times, and you could not fetch a screech at first? Now where did you fetch a screech? How long was the prisoner engaged with you? - Ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you edeavoured to resist being much frightened? - My resistance! What is a woman against a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to make any resistance at all? - I endeavoured to screech if I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently I take it for granted that you was more occupied about your own safety than the person of the prisoner? - I see him among forty people and fixed on him immediately, before I came to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or no you was not more occupied about reicuing yourself than observing the man's person? - I am confident it is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man dressed? - In a blue coat and striped waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a handkerchief over his face? - No, only came up over his chin.</p>
               <p>Q. And a round hat on? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you venture to swear to him? - Yes, and I would again.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard any thing about a reward for apprehending a highwayman? - No, I don't know that I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your husband never told you? nothing about it? - No, he has not.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he keep a secret so strict as that? - I don't know what you mean about reward; I have heard of such things, but I had not the least idea of any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not your husband told you? - I have heard such things from him and others.</p>

When I went in I see my back door open, and I immediately went up to the place where I had laid a parcel of money to pay my rent and taxes, it was six guineas and a half tied up in an old shawl, and I missed it all, and I had a brother come out of the country, who boarded with me, he left a box with me; and all the clothes were pulled out of his box, and his money was all taken away.

               <p>Q. Have you ever recovered any of this money? - No, not a single farthing of it. When I came home my surprise was so great at losing every penny we had, I made a great alarm in the neighbourhood, and the young man that lived up in the two pair of stairs next door knew two more that had been in the house, and that prisoner was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see them there yourself? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. There was nothing taken but your money? - Only that old shawl and an old stocking.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280103"/>Q. Are there any partnership servants sleep there? - There are. On Friday the 2d of October, in consequence of some particular application for some muslin from a neighbour, I desired one of our servants to bring down a piece of a particular mark; he went to look for the particular piece and could not find it; we made a very particular search, and could not find it; we concluded taking our stock, apprehensive that this piece might not be gone alone, I went and looked over the wrappers, to see if any other piece might be gone, in looking them over I found that another piece was gone out of the very same lot; who had taken them at that time we could not tell, but from some particular circumstances our suspicion fell on the prisoner at the bar; he had left our service that very morning, the 2d of October; we then took some pains to find out where he was; we found out that he was at a very reputable house in Bond-street, I called there, but did not find him at home; after that one of the partners in the house called on me, in consequence of that I went after him on Tuesday to Bond-street, with an intention of charging the prisoner with the fact; I went there, and he was then at dinner in the house, I called him out, at least desired a servant to do it; when he came to the door, I told him that having missed several articles, our suspicions fell on him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When you told him this did not you tell him it would be better for him to tell the truth of the business? -At that time I said nothing at all about it. I did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Then nothing that he has said after this can be evidence with regard to the discovery he made? - I went up stairs with the prisoner to the place where the boxes were, and there I found two pieces of Irish linen laying in a corner of the room, in a hat box. They are in the indictment. We had afterwards the box opened, in that box we found a great quantity of muslins, huckaback, and Irish linens, and cambricks. After that, Taylor, from Bow-street, was called up, who examined his pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you by at the time? - I was. In his pockets he found twenty guineas, and among his papers taken out of his pocket was found a catalogue, together with an account annexed to that catalogue. It was a catalogue of goods to be sold at Fellows and Myers's, Aldersgate street. We went to Bow-street, and got a summons from Mr. Bond to Mr. Fellows and Myers's, in order to come and produce the goods the next morning. I went with the summons in my pocket to Messrs Fellows and Myers, but previous to the delivery of the summons, I went into the warehouse to inspect the goods that were marked in the catalogue as delivered to them by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Fellows and Myers? -Brokers and auctioners, in Aldersgate-street. I have the catalogue here now, marked in his own hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What are these goods in the catalogue? - Four dozen of napkins, four eight-quarters of diaper cloths, nine diaper table-cloths, eighty our linen napkins, five table cloths to match these napkins, two pieces of muslin, also one of which pieces of muslin was the very one that I originally missed, which led to the discovery. I afterwards went to his taylor's, benjamin Caddington, in Brewer-street. The taylor shewed me some callicoes, which he had bought of the prisoner; this was I think a day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all this pass on the second? - No. it was on the sixth that I went to Bond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to the taylor's? - That was on the eight I believe, where I found some callicoes. I opened on of the pieces out, and I mentioned before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280104"/>hand to the taylor some defects that were in it. The property is all in court now. All the property that was taken from his room was delivered up to me at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept it ever since? - I have. The rest of the property is in the hand of the auctioner, and the callico is in the possession of the taylor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Your name is Christopher Crook? - It is.</p>

               <p>Q. Nobody has any interest in the trade? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. These things must be taken at different times? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. The particular day in which any of them were taken you don't know? - Except, I am pretty confident that the two pieces of muslin were taken away on the first of October. I see it myself on the thirtieth of September, the day before. The muslin cost us six pounds ten shillings. I will swear that I believe it went on that day. but I cannot swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. These pieces of muslin you see at Fellows and Myers's that was in consequence of a catalogue to be sold there? - Yes. and also an amount of it in the prisoner's own writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Fellows and Myers are brokers and auctioneers, of course they sell every thing that they do sell openly? - They do.</p>
               <p>Q. So public and open that it was expressed in the catalogue when it was to be sold? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore all the world might have known as well as you what it was to be sold? - Yes, they might.</p>
               <p>Q. Now these two pieces of muslin, how long might you have had them in your shop before? - Perhaps a couple of months.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of muslin is it? - Plain India muslin, marked in my own hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say there was some Irish linen found in a box up stairs, in Bond-street, I believe the prisoner at the bar did not go up stairs with you? - Yes, he did, he shewed us the boxes, and denied there was any thing in them.</p>
               <p>Q. But he shewed you the boxes? -He did.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he was the very means of detecting himself.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you? - A broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - In Aldersgate-street. On the first of October the prisoner came to our house, I was at home, he enquired when we should have a sale of linen goods, that he had been in trade in the country, he had kept a shop, that he had left off business with an intent to go to America, he had brought the stock in trade to town, or a part, I am not sure which, and it was at Mr. Dudding and Richardson's, in Oxford-street, at whose house he resided till the ship should fail; he then said he had been recommended by his friends to sell part of his stock in trade, and he was recommended to our house to dispose of it; he had brought two pieces of muslin with him, and he would send the remainder in the evening, or in the following morning, and he said he should have occasion for some money, and asked me if I would let him have ten guineas, five I gave him that evening, and five on the following day; he sent the remainder of the goods that evening, and called the next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280105"/>day about noon, he enquired whether it would be best to sell them privately or publicly, I told him, that from the nature of the goods, they would go to more advantage in a public sale; he agreed that it should be so, the only objection he had to it, he was fearful the ship would fail before the goods would be sold, and he should not have time to receive the balance, I told him, that I did not think it would make any odds, as he had friends in town, we would pay the balance to them; we put them in a public sale, and had the catalogue printed. He told us he should be every day on the change to see the captain to know when the ship would fail, and that if we wanted him we might see him at the New York coffee-house, or at No. 24, Bond-street. On Tuesday after, we sent him a catalogue at the New York coffee-house, marked in the margin against such lots as were his property. He called on that day at our counting house, and asked me whether I thought the goods were likely to sell well, I told him there was no doubt of it, as there had been catalogues distributed all over the town, the goods had been advertised, and many had been to view them. He then asked me if I would let him have twenty pounds, as a further advance, he said he had occasion to buy some necessaries for his voyage.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you advance him more? - Nineteen guineas. When he wrote the receipt, he went away, and I see no more of him till he was in custody at Bow-street. The following morning, Wednesday, Mr. Crook came to my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say that this man consented, since it was more to his advantage that these things should be sold by public sale? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in a very extensive way I believe? - We do a deal of business.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you his fair directions either at Bond-street, or at the New York coffee-house? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding these catalogues and advertisements, which go to this man's master among the rest, he came to you afterwards? - Yes, he did. When he signed the receipt, he did not sign it in the name of Stevenson, but in the name of

               <p>Q. Did he ever bring any thing to you? - Yes, in the months of August and September, several pieces of callico at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces might he bring you in all, did he bring you five? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy it of him? - Yes. I gave him a fair price, I gave him altogether six or seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whereabouts you gave him for each piece? - About four or five and twenty shillings, and some two and twenty shillings and a guinea, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept the callico ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I take it for granted he brought them at separate times? - He did.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Produce the property taken at his lodgings? - Eighteen pieces of muslin, worth sixty pounds, in some my marks are totally cut off, and he has put another mark on them, but I can trace my hand writing on some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What would you give for the lowest piece of muslin there? - About five and forty shillings. Twenty-eight muslin handkerchiefs, with my own marks on it, my own hand writing on it, though he has endeavoured to erase it; three pieces of cambrick, I would give ten pounds for them; I would give four pounds a piece for the Irish linen; and here is some huckaback besides, I believe them all to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Myers. Have you got all the things described in this paper? - Yes, I have, two pieces of muslin.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is the very piece I originally missed, with my own land writing on it, they are worth more than ten pounds together.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the other things at Mr. Myers's? - I have, I am perfectly convinced they are all mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the callico produced by the taylor? - It was a lot that was damaged, and they are marked half a yard over, it is the custom of our house to mark them so, I don't know that it is the custom of other houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that such property was missing from your house? - No, I could not, we have such a quantity of callico; I believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor, at the time that he took me, told me that he would not prosecutor me if I would confess.</p>
               <p>Court. Every part of this case is a case of facts, I have stopped every word of confession.</p>

               <p>Q. You have known Abrahams some time? - I have for these three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. He did business for the India company? - He did find men for the commanders and owners of the ships.</p>
               <p>Q. You had therefore an opportunity of transacting business before him? - Yes, because he signs before me, whenever he is bound for a person.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not this man always had the character of an honest man? - Quite so, as much as I know of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write often? -O yes, a vast number of times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen Hounsley write? - Yes, three times, that I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Hounsley came with Abrahams to you, before he went abroad, for the purpose of executing some bond? - He did; this is the bond.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you look at the signature of that will, Samuel Hounsley? - I firmly believe it is one and the same hand writing, but I will not positively swear to it, because I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Except that you did not actually see it executed, have you any doubt that it is his hand writing? - It corresponds exactly with the hand writing that I see him write.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the prosecutors so themselves? - I told Mr. Fletcher so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body so on the part of the prosecution? - No one applied to me. I firmly believe it is Hounsley's hand writing.</p>
               <p>(The absent bond shewn him.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you witness the execution of that? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. The other signatures in your book you see Hounsley sign? - I did. I have got the contract they are obliged to sign before they go to sea, it is in the hand writing of Hounsley.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that another document from whence you form your judgment? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have got three signatures in the book, those articles and that power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. When a man applies to these men, such as Abrahams, to sit them out, they sit them out with slops? - They do.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. At this very instant Mr. Abrahams was bound for Hounsley? - He was; here is his bond for a hundred pounds for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Except this man had some estates in the skies, ten pounds and odd would have been the whole that he could have received? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe all the documents, the power of attorney, the absent bond, and whatever was to entitle any one person to receive money, were all directed to Abrahams? - They were.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar had been your clerk for some time? - Yes, for three or four years. The bill came by post; I opened the letter myself, on the 14th of September; I have the bill.(The bill and letter produced.) I opened it and gave it to one of the clerks; it is due the 17th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive the money for that bill? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner? -He absconded with the bill and other property, on the 16th.</p>


               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Tell us what situation Chipchase was with you? - Was he clerk with you? - He was. He used to receive money and bills, and once or twice a week I used to settle the balance with him.</p>
               <p>Q. So that if, for instance, he might receive money on Monday or Tuesday, on Wednesday you could receive the balance and settle with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was, in fact, cashier? - He was employed to receive money and make payments for freight, and such things.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this bill came to his possession in the regular course of his business?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179510280109"/>- I believe the bill was given to the other clerk, John Forthergill, to carry for acceptance.</p>
               <p>Q. But whenever it came into his possession it came in that character, in which he served you? - Yes, just so.</p>


               <p>Q. Of course, if this had not happened that bill would have been carried to account in his accounts? - This bill was never entered in the accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. I put this question to you; had he not, in the course of his employment, authority from you to receive money and to charge himself with money? - He had not, before they became due.</p>
               <p>Q. For instance, that very bill in your hand, if he had not gone away with it, he would have received the money, and if he had wanted any particular sum to disburse, he would have paid it away, and have carried that also into the account? - He may sometimes; but the usual course is for to send it to the bankers, and they are to receive it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your usual course was to send it to the bankers for them to receive it? - Yes, it is.</p>

               <p>Q. Has it been since paid? - Yes, paid on the 17th.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came to you what did he say? - He put the bills into my hand as usual, on the 16th, I asked him what was to be done with the bills, they were not indorsed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual that the parties who send the bills to your house should endorse them? - Always when they are discounted. I asked him whether they should be entered in Mr. Burkitt's account as short bills, or what was to be done with them? He said, he wanted small notes and money for them. I hesitated a little, because it was the custom of every person to indorse every bill they sent in; I offered to give him some light money, which laid on our hands, in order to be changed whenever they chose; he objected to the offer of the light money, and said, it must be good money, it was for Mr. Burkitt's particular use.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Messrs. Fothergill any considerable balance in your hands? - Yes, I believe a very considerable one, they always have. I gave him the money, a hundred pounds in small notes, and the rest in cash.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have received the money on that note for Messrs. Le Febure and Co. as their due? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I observe you state that when he put the bills into your hands, he did it as usual, by which I should suppose that he was in the constant habit of doing. this? - He used to come three or four times a week paying money, and sometimes taking it out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Has he been in the habit of discounting bills? - He has come to the house and left bills.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not he tell you that he wished to come back, in order to do justice, but that the American sailors had offered to rescue him if he had chose? - I dare say there were near three hundred seamen about; I believe he spoke to them when he came out; he spoke to the Captain, and I know the Captain whispered to him three or four times before I brought him away, I am sure it would have been impossible for me to have brought him away if he had said half a word; the Captain and the landlord of the house were so much against me, that I thought myself in great danger.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in consequence of his good conduct that the rescue was prevented? - Certainly.</p>
