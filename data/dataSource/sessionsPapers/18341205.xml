                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Raley. We live at No. 40, Pleasant-place, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth—we rent the house, and live in it by ourselves—the prisoner lived in the same row—about ten o'clock on the morning of Sunday, the 7th of December, we left our house—I went out first—my husband followed about a quarter of an hour after—we went to Hammersmith to bury a child—we returned together about iten o'clock in the evening—my husband unlocked the street door—there it a front and a back door—he unlocked the front door, which opens into the shop—it was dark—my husband went round the counter to cut a can<lb/>dle, and kicked against the shop-till on the floor—that was just after he entered the shop—I had seen the till in the morning in its place—it slides under the counter—I had seen it shortly before I went out in the morning—I do not know how much there was in it—my husband gave me a candle—I went next door but one and got a light, and went from the shop into the kitchen, which is if behind the shop—my husband asked me for the light—he went to the door, and we found the top bolt of the back door of the kitchen, which opens into a small yard, had been forced—there is a bolt at the top and bottom, but only the top bolt had been fastened—I had fas<lb/>tened the top bolt myself just before I went out—I did not bolt the bottom one—I found the iron staple, which the bolt goes into, had the top screw forced out—it hung on the bottom screw—I went into a neighbour's, and he came in—as I came in at the door again, a policeman stood at the door, and he came in—there is a tree at the bottom of our yard—one of the branches was broken from that tree—it is close against the wall which separates our yard from Elliott's-row, which Pleasant-place communicates with—it ap<lb/>peared as if a person had stepped on the branch in getting over the wall, and broken it—it is a little yard—I went up stairs afterwards with a light with the policeman—the bed in the first floor room appeared as if it had been turned oyer—I had not left it in that condition—there was no bedding</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of Mary Raley. I left my house on the Sunday morning, soon after ten o'clock—I had not opened the back door after my wife went out—I locked the front door when I left—it goes on a spring—I turned it with the key, and took the key with me—the shop windows were fast—my kitchen window does not open—when I re<lb/>turned at night I found the front door as I had left it—I went into the shop and kicked against the till on the floor—I looked to see what was on the floor—there was nothing else on the floor—the till was empty—there was no money in it—there were a few farthings in it when I had last seen it—I cannot say exactly how many—I took the halfpence out of it before I left—I opened the till after my wife was gone, and left nothing in it, but the farthings—I went into the garden on Monday, and observed one branch of the tree split down from the trunk, as if a person's foot had been put on it in getting over the wall—I missed a telescope on the Monday evening when I returned home—that was the first time I missed it—I had not seen it for some weeks before—Sunday fortnight was the last time I noticed it—it was then on the first floor mantel-piece, in the bed-room—a child had died in that room, and we had not slept there for a week—I had not slept there for a fortnight—I have not seen the farthings or teles<lb/>cope since.</p>

Last Sunday week I left the house at twenty minutes after four o'clock in the afternoon—I was the last person that left it—I went out alone—I fastened the door, which has a drop-latch to it, which we had put on because we thought the lock was unsafe—I pulled the door to, tried it after me, and found it was fastened—I fastened the back door and every window in the house—my brother had gone out at one o'clock, and the apprentice went out before him.</p>

About half-past three o'clock in the afternoon on the 28th of November, I was at the corner of Gray's-inn-lane, looking at a picture shop—I felt something at my pocket—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my handkerchief—I have since seen it in the hands of policeman E 104—when I turned round, I saw the prisoner near me—he was close to me by my side, when I felt something at my pocket—when I looked round, he walked away—I followed, and kept close be<lb/>hind him—I saw a policeman, and on his coming up, the prisoner ran off—I told him to stop the prisoner—he pursued him, and I saw him in cus<lb/>tody in Southampton-buildings in about two minutes—the policeman produced the handkerchief.</p>

On the 3rd of December I had some goods to take to va<lb/>rious customers in a waggon—I had two boxes, containing thirty glass bottles, and some oil and paint, directed to Mr. Hitchcock, Taunton—this is the box—I was in Fore-street between five and six o'clock, and left my waggon for about five minutes, at the outside—I returned and saw this box in the middle of Fore-street—I had left it sale in the waggon—I saw the prisoner in custody immediately afterwards.</p>

On the night of the 4th of December I was in a room overlooking the factory of Mr. Plummer, in Golden-lane, at twenty minutes before nine o'clock—I observed a bag of cotton wool drop from the premises—the prisoner Leonard picked it up and put it on Baumer's back—it was dropped from about twelve or fourteen feet high into a court which leads into Golden-lane—after Leonard placed it on Baumer's back, I saw Jordan drop from the gates—I came down stairs to the door, and saw Jordan pass by me as close as eighteen inches—the other prisoners came by, and they joined company—I went out at my front door, down Brackley-street, and met Baumer with the bag—I gave him in charge of the watchman, and at that moment I saw Jordan standing opposite, in Golden-lane—I went to Mr. Plummer's directly.</p>

The back of my premises looks on the back of the prosecutor's warehouse—they are about eighteen or twenty feet from it, across the way, not more—it is a little to the left, not directly opposite—I suppose it is from nine to twelve feet to the left—I got the watchman to take Baumer—I saw Jordan standing on the opposite side at the time, but I could not take him, as I had the bag to carry—the watchman could not take the boy and carry the bag—there were people passing—I did not require their assistance—I knew Jordan so well, I knew I could take him at any time, if I wanted him—I did not say before the justice, that I knew Leonard because he wore a blue coat—I said he bad a blue coat with gilt buttons—I knew his person, but I did not know his name—I have nothing to get by this—I have no object but the mere purpose of justice—a sovereign was given to me before the magistrate by Mr. Plummer—there was no one in my company when I saw all this—the boy went down Ball-alley, into Golden-lane, and I went down Bridgewater-gardens—I lost sight of them three or four minutes—there were two gas-lights at the end of the court—it was a very clear night, not foggy at all—it was not what I call a foggy night—it was not so clear as it is sometimes—it was neither foggy nor clear—it was not a bright night—I could distinguish clearly what I have sworn to—I have had nothing more than a sovereign, nor do I expect any more—I know nothing of Baumer—I have seen Leonard before—I saw his face that night, I swear, and Jordan's face also—I know them by their faces and dresses—I told the magistrate I knew Leonard, by the blue coat which he wore.</p>

On the 28th of November, I was on duty in Edward-street, Kingsland-road, near an empty building—I heard a noise inside—I listened, and heard some one was there—I went to Kingsland-road, and fetched my brother officer—I left him there—I went and got the key of the house from the shopman—I brought Smith with me—I attempted to put the key into the lock, but I could not—I found there was something inside which prevented me—I then <hi rend="italic">planted</hi> Smith at the back, while I got over the wall and attempted to force my way in, but I could not—I heard some persons run towards the front, and I called to my brother officer, who was in front, to look out—I got over the wall again, and I just saw the prisoner rise from the ground—I followed him till he fell down in a garden—I then took him—I got a ladder and a light, went into the house, and found this skeleton key in the lock—two sashes had been removed from the front parlour, and one from the back parlour—these are the sashes.</p>

                  </hi>. This house belongs to my employers, Edward Chuck &amp; Co.—I have the care of it. I went and found three sashes had been removed—I had not been there for some weeks—it was then occu<lb/>pied—I had passed the house afterwards, but the shutters were closed—the glass had evidently been taken out of the sashes very lately, and the cords recently cut.</p>
               <p>

               <p>you cannot tell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the putty was not hard—they had been glazed several months, perhaps six months—putty hardens in that time—I had been in the country, and had not been to the house for three weeks—Mr. Chuck has two partners—they are lead and glass merchants—I know the house was their property—I have received the rents for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Begg. The prisoner lodged in the same house with me—she left on the 23d of September—while she was there, I had some lace, which I put, with some other things, into my box—on the 28th of September, I missed it—I went to Worship-street, and they sent an officer, who went to where I lodged, but the prisoner was gone—I afterwards went to where the prisoner lodged—I saw her box open, and this lace was found in it—it is mine—it is exactly eleven weeks ago since I missed it, on a Sabbath morning.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This poor woman has sur<lb/>rendered this morning, has she not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she attended three or four times before the magistrate—I lodged on the first floor, and she on the second—I was not receiving much money at that time, but I had a good many things in my boxes—I changed lodgings with the prisoner—I have two children—I never was without food for them, but the prisoner has often given them bread and butter—I had no furniture but my boxes and bedstead—the prisoner lived with her husband, and they were com<lb/>paratively well off—the lace was found in her box—I cannot say that I remember that box being packed up, when she removed—I did not assist in packing her box—my hands were never in her box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it through Mrs. Burroughs that you were induced to take this woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She told me what she had lost—I heard that the prisoner had a quarrel with her in consequence of her calling her a thief—I did not assist in packing the prisoner's box—I saw her packing a box, but I can<lb/>not say whether it was the box my lace was found in—I was not present when her boxes were packed—I know a girl named Ann Clark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you again, (Clark is here,) did you not actually assist in pack<lb/>ing this very box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: the prisoner went to live at Mrs. Burrough's, in Paul-square—I called, and saw her there, on the Monday after I dis<lb/>covered my loss—I had lost a great many things—my husband and another person were with me—I mentioned this lace to the prisoner—I called it "My cap borders!"—the prisoner did not, on that occasion, offer to have her box searched.</p>

               <p>search her box, but you refused? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; but she did not know it, be<lb/>cause I did not then suspect her—Mrs. Burroughs sent a policeman into the prisoner's room, to search her boxes, but that was six weeks after I lost my things—the box in which this was found, was not locked—I do not re<lb/>member the prisoner recommending me to go to Worship-street—perhaps she did—I do not know when the policeman broke into her room—he handed her over to another officer—I do not know when I heard about the quarrel between her and Mrs. Burroughs—the prisoner said she would tell her husband that the lodger kissed her—I received a letter, written by Elizabeth Nicholls—I did not know from Mrs. Burroughs that she desired Nicholls to write—but it was in consequence of what Burroughs said, that the letter was written—Mrs. Burroughs said she had been robbed—Mrs. Nicholls knew I had been robbed, and she sent me word—Nicholls was not intimate with me—I knew her, but had not seen her for weeks before—I do not know that Burroughs knew Nicholls.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know Nicholls? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till I saw her at the office—I did not know that she wrote any letter—I lost some things—I did not hear of the letter till the prisoner was in custody—my husband works at Mr. Springfield's—he is not a regular porter—I do not know what wages he has—he allows me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I let the house, and do needle-work, and earn 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the name of the lodger that the prisoner threatened to tell your husband had kissed you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sir, it was false—his name is Reuben; but it was false—he is a foreigner—the policeman did not break the pri<lb/>soner's door—he put his staff to it, and it flew open—he never forced it at all; but she would say any thing—I wonder she did not say something worse.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. On the 4th of December I was going down Mile-end-road, between one and two o'clock in the day—I saw Purkis take some hay out of his master's cart on his shoulder, and throw it down against the Coach and Horses public-house, close by the cellar window—when I had passed about twenty yards, I turned and saw a person in a smock frock, about the size of Rysley, put the hay down in the cellar—I gave information to Mr. Menzies.</p>

The prisoner was six or seven months in my employ, making women's shoes—on Saturday evening, the 29th of November, he brought home four pairs—I examined his work, and saw one particular pair among them which I doubted whether he had made—I said I never saw a pair in my life so much like Wallis's make—he said they had been on the last the whole week—I paid him part of his money, not having suffi<lb/>cient silver, and he went away—he came again about nine o'clock the same evening—he had half-a-crown in his hand, and said he had brought me a customer—I looked round, but could see no one—he then said Mrs. Stephen wished to purchase this pair of shoes, and she had already tried them—I refused to sell them, and told him I considered he was a guilty man—some customers then came in, I attended to them—I said to the boy, "Put those shoes aside"—the prisoner then went through the shop, saying she had better come herself—when the prisoner was gone, the shoes were missing—they had been where the customers could not reach them without being observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean by saying he was a guilty man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he must have taken these shoes from the shop, and brought them in again—my charge relates to both the first and second taking.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you demand payment of the prisoner for the shoes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I refused to sell them to him—he said Mrs. Septhen wished to pur<lb/>chase them, and I would not sell them—he lived in lodgings—I used to give him work, and he made it and brought it home—he did journey-work—he has no stated wages.</p>

On the 25th of March last we took the prisoner as servant out of Bethnal-green workhouse; and on the 27th, she was set to clean the door and the passage—I saw her there about nine o'clock that morning—she seemed in a confused state, and my little girl was with her—she was hired as a weekly servant, and slept in the house—she went away that day without notice, and I did not see her again till about a fortnight ago—when she was gone, I missed a silver watch and stand, a pelisse, a shawl, and a pair of half-boots, which had been all safe that morning in the front parlour—I am sure the prisoner is the person—I saw her again when she was in cus<lb/>tody—she denied having been my servant, or knowing any thing about me, or having been in the workhouse—here is an apron and shawl which she left at my house.</p>

I was on duty on that Sa<lb/>turday night, and heard the cry of "Police," in Princes-street, Soho—I went up—the prosecutor gave the prisoner into my custody, charging him with robbing him of two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—the prisoner denied it—I took him to the station-house—when we got to the door, I let him in before me—I saw him raise his hand towards his mouth; when I went inside I looked him hard in the face, and saw him move his jaw, and try to swallow something—I seized him, and with the assistance of two men, we wrenched open his mouth with the door-key, and found this £20 and this £10 note in his mouth—these nine sovereigns and a half I found in his pocket.</p>

On the 23rd of November, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the shop and ordered 1lb. of the best salt butter to be sent to Mr. Watkins, 22, Wellington-street, St. Luke's, and change for a five-shilling-piece—in about five minutes he returned, and, with an earnestness of manner, asked if I had sent the butter and change as directed—I then weighed the butter, and called my boy, George Webb, and gave him four shillings, which I particularly remarked—three were of the reign of George III., and one of George IV., with a lion on it—the boy came back with an officer, who had the prisoner in charge—he asked me if I knew the prisoner—I said yes; he is the person who ordered a pound of butter—he said, with affected surprise, "I order a pound of butter!"—I said most assuredly he did.</p>

On the 23rd of November I received directions from him to take a pound of butter and change for a five-shilling-piece to Mr. Watkins—I had four shillings change—as I was going, I met the prisoner in Wellington-street, St. Luke's—I had not seen him in the shop—he said, "Are you going to Mr. Watkins's?"—I said, "Yes"—he then took the butter and the change, and gave me the five-shilling-piece—I thought it was right, as he gave me the five-shill<lb/>ing-piece—he told me to go back and fetch half a pound of cheese—I did not go back, but I showed the five-shilling-piece to a person on the other<lb/>side, who told me it was a bad one—I then pursued the prisoner—he ran away across King-square, and as he turned a corner, I lost sight of him—I then saw an officer, and told him what had happened—he took me to the Champion public-house, where we saw the prisoner—I told him he gave me a bad five-shilling-piece, and he said, no, he did not—the officer then searched him, and took him to my master—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person who gave me the five-shilling-pieces, and took the butter and four shillings.</p>

On the 5th of December I was at the end of High-street, near Oxford-street—I had a parcel on my shoulder—Strong called to me, and I missed my hand<lb/>kerchief out of my pocket—I turned and followed him to Lawrence-street—I saw Labern about twenty yards down that street—he had another lad With him, who I believe was King—I went up and asked how they could be guilty of such an action—they said they were not guilty, and one of them threw open his jacket for me to search—we then left them to follow another person—I afterwards took Labern to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Bow-street patrol, and have been so almost three years. I was at Harrow-on-the-Hill, on the 13th of December, about a quarter past eleven o'clock at night—I received information that there was some mutton hanging in a tree near the Black Horse, about a mile and a quarter from Harrow, and about a mile from the prosecutor's—I went to the tree and watched by the side of a ditch—the tree was in a field some distance from the village—I concealed myself having ascertained that the mutton was there, concealed in an oak tree—there were two legs and a shoulder, and liver—I concealed myself, to watch—Watson was in another place, and in about two minutes, I saw the three prisoners come out of the Black Horse public-house, and walk down to the sign-post, in the road—they stood near the post and conversed a short time, and then came on, down opposite to the tree where the mutton hung—I could see very plainly into the tree—I was on my horse about ten or twelve yards off—a gentleman passed on horseback—one of the men, I think it was Shackell, said to him, "Good night"—as soon at he was gone, Shackell said, "All's right"—the two others jumped over the</p>

He had some sheep at pasture in a field about a mile and a quarter from where the mut<lb/>ton was found—I counted my sheep on Saturday morning—I had fifty ewes and a ram—I missed one ewe on Sunday morning—I searched about, and found in a ditch part of a sheep, all but the two legs, shoulder, and pluck—the hind quarters were very much chopped about—I found the skin in the same field—it had master's mark on it which I had put on myself, "J. C."—I fitted the shoulder into the skin; it tallied exactly—Shackell is a hay-binder.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Russel's-court, St. Giles-in-the-Fields: it is also called Salutation-court. On Friday last I left my house about half-past six o'clock—it consists of one room—I left nobody in it—I tied the door twice with a piece of string—I tied the staple and hasp together, and made it as secure as I could with string—I had been out shortly before, and when I came back I saw the prisoner listening at my door—I asked him who he wanted—he made no answer—I asked him again, and took particular notice of him, as he did not answer—it was just dusk when I went out at half-past six o'clock—I do not call it very dark then—there are gas-lights there—it would be quite dark without the lamps—I was not out above ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at most—when I came back I found the door wide open, and the things laid on the table—the sheet and blanket were gone—I saw them again next morning, at Queen-square.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Lord Nelson, in East-street, Trafalgar-road, Greenwich. The prisoner was my servant for about four months—I had suspicion, and on the 3rd of December I marked fourteen half-crowns and one crown-piece—I put them into a bag with some other silver in a cup<lb/>board, which I locked, and put the key in my pocket—I went to the cup<lb/>board again the next evening—I missed nine of the marked half-crowns and four shillings—the shillings were not marked, but I knew how much there was—this was after eleven o'clock—the prisoner was gone up to bed—I went up and met her at her bed-room door—I said I had come on an unpleasant business, I wanted to see the contents of her portmanteau—she hesitated—but I said, "You had better do it, for if you do not, I will send for an officer"—she then turned out the contents of her box, and put her hand into her pocket, and gave me these nine marked half-crowns—she said they were mine, and the money in her portmanteau also—it all amounted to about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Pensherst, Kent, and am servant to Ann Pott. On the 26th of November, I saw the two ewes and two lambs at the station-house, Union-hall—they were the property of Mrs. Pott—I was her servant at the time—I had seen them on her premises, to the best of my knowledge, on Thursday morning, the 20th of November, at Pens<lb/>herst, which is thirty-two miles from town—one ewe had a mark—it was sheared about three parts along the back and down the side—it was shorn the first time about the middle of May, but the fly had taken it, and I sheared it three parts along the back and down the side, in consequence of that—there was no particular mark on the other three—I am certain they belong to Mrs. Pott—I did not miss them till I heard they were stopped in or near London—I heard that on the Monday, the day before—I know the prisoner very well—he lived near Pensherst, and belongs to Chilting<lb/>ton, which is the adjoining parish.</p>

On Friday, the 21st of November, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in the London-road, St. George the Martyr, Southwark, and saw the prisoner with a horse and cart, and four sheep in it—he was leading the horse along the road, as it seemed very tired—I asked him where he was going with the sheep—he said to Smithfield—I asked who lie was going to take them to there—he said, "Mr. Smith, a salesman"—I assisted Collier in taking him into custody—I searched him at the station-house, and found two turnpike tickets in his pocket, one of Kennington gate, and one of Godstone, Surrey—he said he had come through those gates that morning—I have the tickets here—I observed his horse's feet—I think it had one shoe off—it appeared very tired indeed—he said he could hardly get it on, and that it was quite knocked up, coming so far.</p>

Weller" on the face of it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a note</hi>) this is the note—I took down the three figures that were on it, 30, 10, and 34—it was not an indorsement, but written on the face of it—William Lockhart, my waiter, took it back into the tap-room, and immediately after Morris, the prosecutor, came to the bar, and asked me to change the same £20 note—I refused, and then he produced a £5 note, and asked for change for that—I did not have that in my hand—I told him to put it into his pocket, and refused to change it—I asked him into the bar—he came in, and folded the notes up in his pocket-book, and tied it with a string—he went into the tap-room again, and in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes came to the bar, and said he had lost his pocket-book and notes—he went away—the prisoner had left the house previous to that—he had been sitting the nearest person to the prosecutor—he went, away before the prosecutor complained of his loss—he remained to eat the sausages, and had a glass of grog, and a cigar or something with the prosecutor—I did not know but they were all friends together.</p>
