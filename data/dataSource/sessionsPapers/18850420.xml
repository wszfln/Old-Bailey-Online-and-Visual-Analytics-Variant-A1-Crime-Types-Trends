I am a licensed victualler, and keep the Oakley Arms, Goswell Road, St. Luke's—on the morning of 25 th March I closed my house, and about 4 o'clock I was aroused by the police, came downstairs, and found the bar in great disorder, and the police in the house—I examined the house, and found the hasp of the tap-room window, which had been fastened the previous night, was unfastened—it could be pushed back from the outside by a knife, and entrance obtained through the window—from the bar I missed four boxes of cigars, five or six ounces of tobacco, a bottle of whisky, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in bronze, and other pro<lb/>perty worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I know the prisoners by sight—I had seen Webb in my house when I closed it the night before—I believe Leonard was there that night, but I did not see him—all my spirit taps were turned on and running; I lost all the spirits out of them—on the bar of the counter, when I went down I found two plates with human excrement in them—I have seen the property found at Webb's; it was stolen from my house on this night.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 24, Denbigh Terrace, Notting Hill—on 3rd April I was walking down Ledbury Road about 11.30 p.m. when I met the two prisoners—Jacobs asked me if I had seen Blanche—I said no, I did not know a person of the name, neither did I know the prisoner—Jacobs next gave me a blow on the side of my head and knocked me down—I got up, and then the other prisoner came up and knocked me down again and tore off this cape from my shoulders and ran away, its value is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not know the prisoners before—I called out and saw a policeman who took up my case—he went after them and took them into custody—I next saw my cape at Hammersmith Police-court—the prisoners were apprehended about 20 or 30 yards from where the assault occurred.</p>

               <p>Street, Islington—about 4 o'clock on the evening of 1st April the prisoner came and asked for a <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">Echo,</hi> which I had not got, and he then asked for the <hi rend="italic">Islington Gazette,</hi> price one halfpenny, and put down a shilling—I asked him if he had got anything smaller—he said "No, that is the only money I have"—I tried the coin in the tester and found it was bad; it bent easily—I told him it was bad, and said, "Have you a better one?"—he said "No"—I told him to take it where he got it from, and he left, leaving the paper behind—I went to the door and spoke to a constable—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not the coin that was tendered to me and which I gave back to the prisoner; I bent that in two—it was a black-looking one, and this is a new one.</p>

Mrs. Dimsdale spoke to me on 1st April, and described a man—I saw the prisoner on my beat alone, and he was afterwards joined by two other men about 20 yards from Mrs. Dimsdale's shop—I went round another street, and met them in the main road—the prisoner then left the two, and went into Mrs. Poole's shop in Essex Road—this was about 20 minutes after I had seen Mrs. Dimsdale—I passed by the shop and saw the prisoner inside with a paper in his hand—I then went to the corner of the street to look for the two other men, but they were out of sight—I went back and saw the prisoner come out of Mrs. Poole's shop—I went in and spoke to her, and then saw the prisoner join the two men again about 800 or 900 yards off—he left them again—I followed him, and finding he did not go into any other shop I stopped him, and said, "Where is the coin you have been trying to pass?"—he said he hadn't any—I said, "You must not tell me that; where is the coin you have got in that pocket?"—he pulled out a handful of coppers from his trousers pocket, among which was a sixpence—I asked him for what he had got in his ticket-pocket, and after some time he pulled out this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said he had earned it that day, and that he knew where he got it from—I took him back to Mrs. Poole's, and she identified him—I searched him at the station, and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze and sixpence in silver good money.</p>

I am a plain-clothes constable—from information I received I watched the prisoner and another man who was afterwards found in a house in Vine Yard, a turning leading from Com<lb/>mercial Street, close by the police-station, at the back of the Cambridge Music Hall—about 7 p.m. on 4th April I went with Sergeant Counter to this house—the front door was open—we broke the ground-floor door open—it was fastened by a catch inside—as I went in I saw the prisoner and the other man with their faces towards the fire—the prisoner turned round—I saw something in his left hand, and said to him "Give it here"—he threw it behind him by the side of the bed—I told Jonas Mozan, who had followed us in, to pick it up, and he picked up this mould (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in two parts, which contained a shilling—it was warm—the prisoner said "Let me put my coat on"—when we went in the other man was standing with a spoon in his hand, pouring something into this mould—I said to them "You will be charged with the manufacture of counterfeit coin"—I took the prisoner out of the house, and Sergeant Counter took the other man—we left Jonas Mozan in charge of the room—when we got outside the house the prisoner called out "Rouse," which is slang for "rescue," and immediately turned round and kicked me on my legs—a struggle ensued—about 300 roughs assembled and took the prisoner from me—I followed him through several streets, and caught him in a house in Grey Eagle Street—I brought him out of there—he became very violent again; I threw him to the ground; I was kicked about the body and legs—I detained him there till I got the assistance of another constable, and then took him to the station—I then went back, searched the room, and found a box containing a spoon for melting metal, with a piece of metal in it called a <hi rend="italic">get,</hi> two packets of acid, a metal spoon, a file with some lead on it, and four other iron spoons, some dry and wet sand, and some plaster-of-Paris—down a crack in the floor I found 13 counterfeit coins, and one on the mantelpiece and one in the mould—this is a shilling mould—there was a large bright fire in the grate when I first went in, and when I returned, in 25 minutes, it was still burning—no money was found on the prisoner—he made no answer to the charge—I had been watching these two men about a month; I had seen them together numbers of times.</p>

                  </hi>. I first made the acquaintance of the prisoner in 1874—in August of that year he spoke to my little brothers on the sands at Margate as they were going to school—I was not there at the time, but I saw him next day on the Parade, and he spoke to me on several occasions after that while I was at Margate—I was then 15 years old—we returned to London to 4, Holland Villas Road—I then went to school at Holland College—the prisoner spoke to me on several occasions on my way from church and to school, saying it was his way to</p>

               <p>business—my parents had come home from Margate with us, and had then gone to Scotland—when they returned I spoke to them about the prisoner, and after that I told him we knew nothing about him, and did not desire his acquaintance—it was some few months after that that I received the first letter—I can't say the date when it arrived—I received all the letters, and then gave them to my mother—I did not reply to any of them—in 1876 I wrote a letter to the prisoner at the request of his mother—in August, 1877, we were at Llandudno in Wales—my mother was not there in that year—several of my aunts were there—I was with the maids and nurses—I saw the prisoner there several times, and he spoke in a very violent manner, and afterwards sent a telegram apologising for his conduct—I don't remember the words he used, but I remember saying once that I did not want to have anything to do with him, and he knew it—he sent me letters by hand several times, unsealed—after my return from Llandudno I saw the prisoner again; he was always about, in front of the house at all times of the day, and followed us whenever we went anywhere—during the year 1878 I saw him frequently in town, nearly every day—in August, 1879, I was at Folkestone—the prisoner was there about a fortnight—he attempted to speak to me on different occasions, and was very violent in his manner—but I was always accompanied by some one—in the early part of 1880 my father took me to school near Paris—on 27th June the prisoner followed us to the English church there—I pointed him out to my governess, and we left the church before the end of the service, fearing there might be a disturbance—the prisoner followed us and asked our address, and spoke in such a violent manner that I was obliged to give him in charge to a gendarme—in March, 1881, we were at Torquay—we took a house there, standing in its own grounds—the prisoner followed us there—he accosted me there several times, and I was obliged to stay in the house two or three days to get out of his way—he used to come straight up to the drawing-room window, walking up the drive, and come and whistle under the windows late at night, and call out words which frightened the children and servants very much—I recollect, on one occasion, being in the dining-room with my mother, the prisoner passed in front of the window, and called out several things that I can't recollect, but finished by saying, "I will cripple your father, I will ruin the lives of the sons and daughters, even though I have to swing for it"—on one occasion, while I was out for a drive with my mother, the prisoner followed in a Hansom cab for a distance of seven miles, calling out all the way—in the autum of 1881 I was at Dinard, Brittany—in October, 1881, I was in town—the prisoner followed me and my French governess one day, and we were obliged to take a cab to avoid him—he ran and took hold of the sash of the window, and hung on to it so that the window could not be put up, and called out twice "I will do for you"—we were glad to get away from him—I gave evidence at Hammersmith Police-court about this, and he was bound over to keep the peace for six months and find two sureties of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and in default of finding that he was sent to prison for that length of time—he came out of prison in the spring of 1882, and on the very afternoon that he was let out he came walking up and down in front of the house the same as before—in August 1882, I went from Southampton to Dinard with my mother and a lady friend—the prisoner went on the same steamer with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188504200028"/>
               <p>us to St. Malo—he sat beside us everywhere we sat, and at meal times in front of us, and he was so annoying that we had to go into the ladies' cabin and remain there—the rest of the family had gone before, with the ex<lb/>ception of my father—he followed us up to the house, and took rooms at at an hotel close by, and was always walking up in front of the house, and followed us wherever we went, whether for walks or drives—an ap<lb/>plication was made by my mother to the police about it—on 14th August, while I was walking with my brother down towards the sands, my brother said the prisoner was coming behind, and I put up my parasol to screen myself; he ran after us, and said to me, "Alice, I will have your answer, 'Yes' or 'No'"—I said, "You know very well 'No'"—he then knocked up my parasol and put the muzzle of a pistol in my face—my brother knocked down the pistol, and the prisoner then dropped behind for a few paces; we walked on, and then met my eldest brother walking toward us, the prisoner ran up and said "I shan't stand it any longer"—my eldest brother held him while I and my younger brother returned to the house—at the time he presented the pistol he said "Then this shall play its little game"—the pistol was exactly like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this letter and parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I did not open, I did not see them till afterwards—my father had not arrived at the time the pistol was presented at me, he didn't arrive till the following day; my mother then told him what had occurred—we went from Dinard then to Normandy, and when we returned to town we saw as much of the prisoner as before—I have received several hundreds of letters from him, but have not answered one—this letter of 23rd July, 1884, was handed to me by mother, opened—the envelope is addressed "Miss Grierson;" I read it—this piece of newspaper extract was pinned to the letter as it is now—I don't remember having seen this letter of 16th Feb. 1885, until I saw it at the police-court. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHARLES SHELLY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was here called and proved this letter to be in the handwriting of the prisoner, which was read as follows:</hi> "Darling Wife,—If you attempt to marry any one, or it you are seen with any one, you know what to expect. I love you and will marry you when you write to me; in the meantime watch intently my movements, which will continue as long as I have life. You will find your brothers and sisters will eventually curse your father. You know that every word you uttered in Court was false. You need not have the slightest fear of my marrying, I don't play with God or any one else. Your mother will no doubt remember what I said to her at St. Dinard, but now the other sex are added. A woman should not give a man encouragement and then inform her friends that she does not care two pins for him. I am afraid your religion is a mere show. I am yours till death. I shall not write again till I have one from you.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We lived at the same address as now when I was about nine years old—I did not know that the prisoner lived at 1, Addison Gardens South—I never saw him till I saw him at Margate, but I knew it after that—their house is about 20 houses from ours—I am the eldest of the family—the prisoner first spoke to my little brothers on their way to school, he had a little brother who went to the same school—we were at Margate about six weeks—the prisoner sent me a lot of presents, which were either burnt or done away with—we knew nothing about the prisoner's family until the police told my father about them—I did not know that his father was a coal merchant in a large way of business—I saw the prisoner in possession of my photograph which had</p>

               <p>been taken away from an invalid gentleman; I told him to return it, and he did so—the first large present which came from the prisoner was a bird-cage and a canary—we thought it had come from a Mr. Leech, who had a great many of these birds, as there were no indications otherwise, and we hung it up in the nursery; but upon finding out it came from the prisoner we sent it back to him immediately—I was still going to school when I returned from Margate, and the prisoner walked to school with me on many occasions, saying it was his way to business—I never spoke to the prisoner about being displeased at a request that the letters should not be shown to my mother, I showed all the letters to my mother—I never spoke to him after the first letter was sent—in the early part of this matter, before he was bound over, he had not complained that my family were preventing his being my lover and after-husband—on every possible occasion I showed him that I did not wish his acquaint<lb/>ance in any way—when before Mr. Paget, the Magistrate, on the occa<lb/>sion of his being bound over, the prisoner denied emphatically using any words of threat—I had been made a ward in Chancery about a year then—from time to time proceedings were taken with my knowledge in Chancery before the Master of the Rolls, Sir George Jessel, to get the prisoner committed to prison again, twice I think, but he never'was sent to prison by Sir George Jessel—I believe in 1881 an application was made to one of the Judges to reduce the amount of recognisances that Mr. Paget had made, and the Judge would not interfere, and the prisoner was kept in prison for the six months—I never saw the prisoner's letters to me after he came out of prison; I supposed by his manner he wanted to make me his wife, he always professed the greatest possible regard for me in words—no legal proceedings were taken against him with regard to the incident at Dinard, we went to the British Consul—I did not see the letter of 19th February, 1885, before it was produced at the police-court by Mr. Grain, my mother never bothered me with the letters more than was necessary—I saw the letter of July 23rd, 1884, my mother showed it me at the time it was received.</p>

It enclosed a cutting from a newspaper giving an account of a girl murdered by her lover, who then had committed suicide.</hi>) When I was at Dinard in 1882 the prisoner came up and asked if he might speak to me, and would I introduce him to my daughter—he then said I had encouraged him to go there; that I had always given him the greatest encouragement, and that it was very wrong to treat him as we were doing; that we had ruined him and his family, and he would have his revenge, he didn't mind if he got 14 years or he swung for it, and he said that my daughter Alice should not have any one else; he would do for her first—my husband had not arrived then—he said he knew he was coming, and he would cripple him, or do for him.</p>

I beg to report that at 4 a.m. Lewis Parks, Levy's Lodging-house, Camberwell came to Tottenham Court Road station, and made the following statement:—About Boxing Day, four years ago, I was in the employ of Mr. J. Powlesland, 121—✗2, Tottenham Court Road, as porter. At 10 a.m. I lit the gas in the base<lb/>ment, and instead of extinguishing the paper I lit the gas with, I wil<lb/>fully threw it over the door into the adjoining room, where there was a quantity of waste paper, which became ignited, and caused this room and contents, consisting of waste paper and empty packing boxes, to be burned out. On the room becoming ignited I went and told Emma Jardine, the cook, that the place was on fire. I then went to the Fire Brigade box in Tottenham Court Road and gave an alarm. I did this because Mr. Powlesland refused to give me a Christmas box. Mr. Powlesland said that if I had set the place on fire, which appeared very much like it, it would always be a torment to me, or something to that effect. I now give myself up because I can get nothing to do.—Lewis Parks."</p>

               <p>its clothes, because she said she was going to take it to a party, and would bring it back on the Tuesday following—she took it away and brought it back on the Tuesday morning—while the child was away I wrote to her at her mother's and told her to keep the child and not bring it back—when she brought it on the Tuesday I said "Why! have you not had my letter?"—she said "No"—I said "I wrote to you on Sunday night, it was posted on Sunday night, and you ought to have had it on Monday morning"—I told her my health was bad and I could not be troubled with baby, and on account of what I had seen, and did not like, she had better take her away—I had some family articles, and I told her she could not have them till she paid me what she owed—she asked me the way to Stoke Newington, as she was going to a situation there—she left the child and said she would come back; she came back the same evening, but did not take the child away—on Monday, March 2nd, I received this letter from her—it is in her writing: "Dear Aunt, Just a line to say will you get Cis's things ready in a parcel for me on Monday afternoon, and bring it, as I shall not have much time, I want to go home, and my umbrella please. MISS Salmons." The part torn off was blank—on Thursday in the same week I received this letter by post, it is in the prisoner's writing: "Dear Aunt,—Will you be as kind enough to bring Cis down to the station, as I shall not have much time, if you are not able to come perhaps Uncle will not mind to bring her. I would come myself only I have not time, and our people are going away. I want to go home, and I have to be back by seven, and I will pay you up in a fortnight's time, without fail, and will come. Please tell me what I owe you, and you shall have it. I shall start from London at 4, and get to Stratford about 4.30. Do bring her, please be as kind. Yours, E. Salmons."—On the following Sunday, March 8th, the prisoner came to my house, about 5 p.m., and I said "I suppose you have come for Cissy"—I at once got the child's clothes on; she wore a Mother Hubbard satin bonnet, a black diagonal dolman jacket, woollen, a blue diagonal jacket trimmed with black braid, a woollen black and magenta plaid frock, a violet under-frock, a white knitted petticoat, and a white flannel petticoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are the clothes—that was the last time I dressed the baby—I also packed a quantity of other clothes belonging to her in a thin old shawl of mine, and handed the bundle and the child to the prisoner—the child was then in perfect health, and she left my place about 5.30—as she left I said "I hope you have got a good home for the child, she has had a good one here;" she made no reply—I said "Have you brought me any money?" she said "I have got none now; I told you in my letter I was going to pay you in a fortnight"—I never saw the child again—before I had the child, on the 11th September, I received these two letters. (<hi rend="italic">These were from the prisoner to the witness and contained the following expressions:</hi> "I do hope they will soon be taking me away, for I think it will send me out of my mind"—"I had better have Cis home, for I shall never be able to pay you"—"I have spoken to mother about Cis, and she says that you could have her")—I think this letter marked E is in the prisoner's writing.</p>

               <p>on the side of it towards the bridge I found the body of a female child between 3 and 4 years old, I think—it was quite cold, and on the top of the water, so that I could see it—the grating had stopped it from flowing down into the reservoir—the water there is about 5 feet 6 1/2 inches deep, and the depth at Woodberry Road Bridge is between 4 and 5 feet, and a little deeper in Seven Sisters Road—I took the child out, put it in a shed adjoining, and sent for the police—Percival came and Dr. Duncan—Percival took charge of the body—I had examined the grating on Sunday night at 10 o'clock, and the body was not there then; I felt down to the bottom with a rake, and nothing was there.</p>

I am a draper's assistant at 23, Latimer Road, Forest Gate, West Ham—on 15th March, about a quarter past 10, I was near Wanstead Flats with the two prisoners, whom I had never seen before—I met them that evening, in the Golden Horse, in Leyton Road—from there we went to the Holly Tree Inn, Wanstead, and had three half pints—we left there at closing time, and outside I partook of a bottle of gin which was produced—I was proceeding with them across a footpath which was my nearest way home, when 1 was, struck in the mouth, thrown to the ground and held down—one had hold of my throat, and there was another hand over my nose and mouth—I could not see who did it—I had suffered from rupture, and when down could not help myself—they took from me my watch and chain and some money; I could not say how much—I had my watch in the public-house—when on the ground I felt a tug at my pocket, and felt the chain drawn through my waistcoat—I cried murder and thieves—one of the prisoner said, "Put your hand over his mouth," and I then felt the chain taken—they ran away—a gentleman came up and found me there—I could not move at the minute through their ill-usage—I was taken to the station by two constables—I bled a good deal—this is my watch; the bow is broken; the chain which was attached to it is not here—the prisoners are the two men.</p>

Stevens 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash as security for samples and cash sales, to be returned on leaving the employ"—he put a stamp on at my request—I parted with my money believing his statements to be true—he took me round and introduced me to customers—we went to Norwood that day—after that he gave me samples—I told him I wanted to leave—he said I must give a week's notice—I did so—I remained till the following Saturday—he paid me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the first week and a commission of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I drew 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account the next week—he said I had not been doing my work and he would go to the shops and see if I had called on them, and if I had he would give me back the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Tues<lb/>day—I went on the Tuesday—he offered me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but did not give it me—I went several times to try and get it, but never succeeded—on one occasion he gave me a shilling—I never saw any customers at the house—he said he had girls to do his work, I never saw any there—I received this letter from him dated 20th February, saying, "I find I shall be able to settle with you on Wednesday evening, call between 7 and 8"—I called, but he was not at home.</p>

I live at 29, Cannon Row, Woolwich, and am an unfor<lb/>tunate woman—on Saturday the 14th, just before 8 p.m., I was going home, and saw the prisoner leaving the Duke of Cambridge public-house—she was very drunk, and fell down, and I picked her up and took her to her room, and said, "Sally, go to bed for a little while"—I then saw a man lying in her bed, asleep—I went out of the room and left her there with him—about 8.15 I saw her coming out of her room, and tried to persuade her to go back again—she said, "How can I get rid of him?"—I said, "Let him lie and sleep for an hour"—she then laid down on the bed with all her clothes on—she said, "I will lay down if you will call me"—I said, "You can come to my room, if you like," but she stayed where she was, and laid down by the man, and I went out, and I did not see any more of her that night—as I passed the house about 10 o'clock I saw the man that I had seen lying in the prisoner's bed, being carried out by the police with cuts upon his face—when I saw him lying in the bed his face was all right, and no blood on him, and the room was as usual.</p>

I live at 4, Short's Cottages, West Street, Car<lb/>shalton, and am working at the Carshalton Railway Station—the prisoner is my nephew, but he does not live in the same house with me, he lives at Croydon—he very often comes to see me—on the 22nd January, about 7 in the evening, he came to see me, and I walked along the High Street, Carshalton, with him, and we turned to go into his grandmother's house—I saw that there was something the matter with him; he did not seem altogether himself—I asked him what was the matter with him, and he said that he had shot some one—he produced this revolver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and said that he thought if he had hurt the person he should shoot himself, and that he felt inclined to shoot himself—I told him he had better give me the revolver, and he did so—I took it home, and when I saw the reports in the newspapers I gave it to Inspector Jones—I examined the chambers of the revolver next morning, and found all the chambers were discharged except one; that contained a charge; I drew it out and threw it away—when he said that he had shot at a person he said that it was a girl.</p>

               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">JONES</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On 22nd January, about 9.30, I saw Judith Allan, who made a communication to me, and next morning I went to East Croydon Bail way Station, and found the prisoner at the coal office there, Messrs. Rickett and Smith's, adjoining the railway station—Detective Foster was with me and young Mr. Allan—Detective Foster said to the prisoner "You will be charged with shooting at this young gentleman's sister"—he said "Do you think I am mad?"—I told him he would have to go to the station, and took him there—he was charged with shooting at Miss Allan with intent to murder her—when I was searching him he said "You will find something which will interest you in an old kitchen drawer at home"—I went to his house, and in the kitchen-table drawer I found this six-chambered revolver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was not loaded—I took it to the station and saw the prisoner, and said "I suppose this is what you alluded to when you said that there was some<lb/>thing at home of more interest?"—he said "Yes"—I received from the nurse of the young lady a description of the spot where these three shots took place, in consequence of which I went to the spot on the following morning and made an examination—there is a garden wall adjoining the footpath described by the two women where they were standing at the time the pistol was discharged—it is not a brick wall, it is partly flint and partly stone—I found a fresh mark on the wall, as of a bullet striking it; there was some lead adhering to it at the time—I received the pistol No. 1 from Newell—there was no charge in it when I received it—three of the chambers appeared as if they had been recently fired off, and it smelt strongly of powder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have had experience of shooting from pistols—in my opinion the effect of a pistol without a bullet being fired at a person within 18 inches would depend upon what wad it had in it—if it had a wallet in it it would depend upon the weight of the wallet whether it would penetrate—if a pistol was fired at three inches from these clothes it would burn them very much more than they are burned—it would do so at three inches with powder alone where the outer garment was cloth, as this is, an ordinary woollen cloth as against cotton cloth, it would burn it more than this is burnt—a pistol without shot, with powder alone, would have to be fired at a distance of from two feet to a yard to make a hole like this, to make these marks—I do not know that a pistol of this sort would not even mark white paper at that distance, and if you told me so I should be surprised—the length of the wall at Duppas Hill, where I found the mark of a bullet, is about 220 yards—Duppas Hill is a regular holiday resort, but it is not a regular play place for all the boys in the neighbourhood; it is for a great many—I think there is something surprising in finding a piece of stone chipped by a bullet where boys go to play—it is not a kind of pistol which is in the common possession of boys, it is not a toy pistol by any means—they described the spot where they stood as directly opposite the drinking-fountain—the drinking foun<lb/>tain is not about 15 feet long; the fountain is simply the place where the water starts out of the wall—I found the mark just opposite there. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming that that bullet was the one shot, can you account for how it came round her body and struck the wall?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you ask my opinion I do not think the bullet which struck the wall was the bullet which struck the prosecutrix.</p>

               <p>searched by the wall of a garden at Duppas Hill, and saw a mark which appeared to have been freshly knocked off; it appeared to be lead— I searched and found this bullet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) about 6 feet from the mark—it shows marks as if it had come into contact with something—it is a whole bullet—the mark was near the top of the wall, on the coping—I found the bullet nearly opposite the drinking fountain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. It appeared that the bullet had sprung some little distance; it was in the roadway, 6 feet from the footway—I think this bullet has struck the wall—I cannot say whether it is more likely that these impressions on it were formed by a pair of pincers; I think they are perfectly opposite each other.  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>.

                  </hi> I practise at Croydon—I examined Judith Allan on the same evening as the occurrence , with a view of seeing whether she was wounded—I found a circular abrasion just below her left blade-bone; it was about the size of a threepenny piece— there was considerable swelling round the place; the skin was broken, and it was bleeding a little—I also found a graze on her left shoulder—I noticed her face; it was dotted over with black specks on the left side of her nose—gunpowder would cause those black specks if discharged from a pistol close to her face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The skin was broken—I mean that the outer skin was removed; I call it an abrasion of the skin—the hole in this corset seems to be a little more stretched by handling it, than it was when I first saw it—this knitted silk bodice in the first instance showed simply a track; there is not a hole now, there is still only a track, but is like the other, a little stretched by handling—seeing so little injury to the clothes, I can still account for the wound on the body; there is quite sufficient—I have not had experience in gunshot wounds, and cannot tell you the effect of firing at that distance at a person's body.</p>

               <p>December last, at Green Man Street, Ewell,—no-one lived there except I and the prisoner—on the evening of 18th March, after tea, the prisoner said I could go to the Lecture Hall—there were dissolving views there—I told her I did not wish to go, and she said I must go—she had promised to pay for Miss Hawthorne—she lives next door but one—the Lecture Hall is two or three minutes' walk away from the prisoner's house—she gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for myself and Miss Hawthorne, and we went, and got there a little before 7.30—about half an hour after I had been in the hall the prisoner came in—I don't know if any one else was with her—I did not see her come in—she did not sit with us, she sat in the middle of the hall—when I left the house to go to the hall it was perfectly safe, there was a little fire burning in the front room grate and a paraffin lamp burning on the table—I had not smelt anything about the house on that day—I had been in the hall about half an hour when the prisoner pulled my arm and said "Come out, there is something the matter"—I followed her out and went down to her house; the prisoner was first and Mrs. Lee next, I followed Mrs. Lee—when we got to the prisoner's door she wished me to open it—I said "No, you were the last one out, you had better open the door"—she had got the key; she took it out of her pocket, and opened the door, when she did so I saw the place downstairs full of smoke—two young men had followed us three women from the hall—I went into the front room, it was full of smoke, and smelt of burning and of paraffin—when I went out there was a lamp burning on the table, when I got back there was only the remains of it— I recollect the bottom part of it being carried out in the tablecloth on which it had been standing the night before was burnt, in the front garden, where it was thrown out that night—I did not go to the cupboard—Barrow was one of the two young men—Symonds went to the cupboard—the prisoner told him not to go; she told him not to take a light there, something might explode, there was some paraffin there—I did not see whether he went to the cupboard—I was told to get a light, and I went to find a candle—I had been to Sutton the previous day; before I went out the prisoner asked me if there was any paraffin wanted—I said "Yes"—there was none in the house—she mentioned no other articles as being wanted—she told me a week before I might go out for a day, and I proposed Tuesday as the holiday—she had never sent me for a holiday before—I did not get any paraffin on that day; I was in the habit of getting half a gallon at a time—I never bought any benzoline the whole time I was at Mrs. Frith's—next day, at dinner time, I said to the prisoner, "It was rather a strange thing, fire being found in the cupboard, that could not have happened from an accident to the lamp, as the cupboard was in the back of the room, underneath the stairs, and the lamp was in the front room, on the table"—I knew the fire had been found in the cupboard under the stairs because I saw Mr. Symonds bringing out a broom with fire on it and finding water to put on it—that was on the same night—after I had been for the candle I helped Mr. Symonds put the broom out with water—I saw another broom brought out of the cupboard alight—I did not smell anything on th brooms then in the confusion—I saw nothing else in the cupboard alight—when I said it was rather a strange thing, fire being being found in the cupboard, Mrs. Frith only laughed and said I made more than a fuss about a little fire— I said of course she did not care, as she</p>

I am a labourer and live at Green Man Street Ewell, next door to the prisoner—I have known her as a neighbour for two years—she was a widow, living there with her servant—on Wednes<lb/>day, 18th March, my attention was attracted by a very strong smell of paraffin at about a quarter past 11 o'clock a.m., it smelt as if coming from her house—I looked at my can and in my own cupboard, and satisfied myself it was not coming from my house and took no particular notice of it—I take about about a quart of paraffin a week—that evening about a quarter—past 8 o'clock I was stifled with smoke in my house—I opened the window and front and back doors and cleared the smoke out and shut up again, and in about five minutes it got as bad as ever—Mrs. Lee, my sister-in-law, called my attention, and I went round to the prisoner's house to see what was the matter while she went to the lecture hall—the prisoner is not related to me—Mrs. Lee fetched the prisoner from the lecture hall and then came round to me—I followed her through the passage to the front—on going in at the gate I was met by Barron bringing out the tablecloth smouldering—I went back through the passage and got a fresh can of water and went in at the back door—when I got back there the prisoner was there—we held a consultation about how this fire could have happened—when my wife drew my atten<lb/>tion to the cupboard and said "Have you looked in the cupboard?" I said "No, I have not, I will do so"—the prisoner said "For God's sake don't go there with a light" (I was going to the cupboard under the stairs with a light in my hand, she pushed me back) "as there are things there that might explode, there is a gallon of paraffin, I know"—I said I should insist on looking in the cupboard—I put the light down and opened the cupboard under the stairs and found the things piled on one another and smouldering—a bass and hair broom were crossed like that, with part of a silk apron and the valance of a curtain upon them; the things were a very few inches off the wall, leaning against the wall—the brooms were half burnt through, and the things on the top were smouldering—I carried the brooms outside—directly one got to the air it blazed up, and I had to put it out with water—the other broom was flaring out when the air got to it—I had to put it up the chimney alight—the apron and</p>

I smelt paraffin all over the house—the I table was spoilt, only the tablecloth was on fro—the staircase was not burnt, the screen adjoining was the next day—the door was not alight, no part of the house was alight at that time—the prisoner wanted to go away that night and take the servant with her—I persuaded the servant not to go for her safety—she wanted to go, and said she would not sleep alone—I got Mrs. Lee to remain with her all night—the prisoner and servant and Mrs. Lee remained in the house all night—the police were not called in then—the fire was put out, and there it remained—the next afternoon (the 19th) my attention was attracted by smoke coming out of the prisoner's back bedroom window—I took a can of water and went in at the back door, and then found that the screen or partition, which was canvas painted and papered, and which divided the front room from the passage, was all in a blaze—I put it out—I passed by the prisoner—she was between the middle door and the side door—after I had put the fire lout I said I should give her in charge if no one else would—she said, "What a fuss to make about a paltry fire!" folding her arms—"A thing like you give me in charge!"—I can't say if she was sober—the servant was sitting beside the kitchen fire sound asleep—I had to shake her to wake her—she had been sitting up all the night before—I sent a special constable for the police—they came about 20 minutes before 2, searched the house, and took the prisoner into custody.</p>

               <p>then drew a revolver out of his pocket and flashed it about in my face, and pointed it at my face within about three inches of it—Whittaker took hold of my arm and led me away, saying "Don't touch him, because he Threatened to shoot any one that touched him before he came out"—the prisoner followed us down the road—I looked round, and he was standing just by my shoulder, almost touching me, pointing the revolver 1 straight in the face—I was going down the road towards my house, and he walked about 10 yards then, I should think—I told him I would fight him in the road if he liked—he said, "No, I won't, I will shoot you"—my brother said to him, "You are all talk," or something like that—the prisoner said to him that he would shoot him as well—I said, "No, you won't," and I hit him in the face with my fist—I said to my brother, "Run and fetch a stick"—my brother went and brought me this stick—at this time the prisoner was standing against a wall pointing the revolver at me—I walked with the stick towards him—he went backwards up the road, still pointing the revolver at me, about 20 yards on the footpath—when I got close to him I believe he tired the first shot at me, and then I must have hit him over the head with the stick, but I won't swear whether I hit him first or whether he fired first—I do not think the first shot struck me—another shot was fired about five seconds after the first one, and about five yards farther on—I then felt my leg give way—I called to my brother and said, "I am shot"—I was struck on the inside of the thigh—my brother came up, and I went into my father's house—the prisoner was a perfect stranger to me—I knew Whittaker and I knew Balls by sight—I was in bed for about three weeks after this, I think—the bullet has never been found, and is still in my thigh—I can feel where it has gone down my leg.</p>

On the evening of 26th March I went to the Walmer Castle, and found the prisoner detained there for uttering this bad florin—I asked the prisoner where he got it from—he said, "At a coffee shop in the Walworth Road, opposite East Street"—I said, "Have you got any more money about you?"—he said, "No"—I searched him there first, in' the street; and then, because of the crowd, I took him inside, and found in his pockets three florins, 31 shillings, and a sixpence, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, all good—I took him to the police-station, where I made a further search, and in the lining of his waistcoat I found 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers, all good money—he had a purse—he said nothing about where the money came from—he gave the name of Thomas Williams, 16, Adam Street, New Kent Road—he said he was a bricklayer—I found a latch-key on him—Mr. Widdington gave me this bad florin.</p>

I had the bad florin in my hand—I said at the police-court, "I said, 'Have you got any more money about you?' and when I did that I held up the bad coin"—he may have thought that I was asking him if he had any more bad money about him—he went quite quietly to the station—the woman was searched at the station—I have not heard of any<lb/>thing having been found on her except two shillings and some bronze, good—the only bad money traced either to her or to the prisoner was this florin.</p>

I am superintendent of the Ludgate Hill Station of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company—on the morning of 3rd March last year, about 10 o'clock, I was sent for to the station; I went into the cloak-room—when I got there a porter named Stephen Holland called my attention to a bag—he left our service about two or three months after the occurrence, and we don't know where he is—I examined the bag and its contents, this is, it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had been opened by the porter, but it was undisturbed—on the top, lying on some newspapers, I found the back plate of a clock—on lifting the newspapers I saw some cakes of dynamite, or rather I saw some cakes in brown oily sort of paper—there was found to be 45 separate packets; they were each marked "Atlas powder A"—that was printed on them—they are flat slabs—I had then heard of the explosion at the Victoria Station—I then went to the Bridewell Police-station, close by, and brought back to the cloak-room a constable named Taylor—I found the bag as I had left it—the cakes with "Atlas powder A" end the whole of the contents were put back into the portmanteau, and Taylor took charge of it and took it away to the Chief Office of the City Police, in the Old Jewry—I followed close on—later on in the day I saw Colonel Ford, one of the Inspectors of Explosives, and he examined the bag and its contents while I was there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Sergeant</hi>). On Saturday morning, 3rd March last year, I was sent for to the Ludgate Hill Station-I went into the cloak-room and saw this bag on the counter-I saw that it was packed with some newspapers on the top; when I removed them I saw some little slabs with "Atlas powder A" printed upon them—I also saw some clothing in the bag and a tin case with a clock, and inside the tin case there was one of the slabs containing 10 detonators; they were stuck in with plastic stuff; they were in front of the muzzle of a pistol attached to the clockwork, and there were 45 slabs packed round, outside the tin—they were like this slab (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) only not quite the colour, but that size, that is 4 inches by about 2 1/2 inches—when I saw this stuff I took charge of the bag; it was in the same state; there was one and part of another slab inside the tin case; the mouths of the detonators were facing the mouth of the pistol—I took the bag and contents to the City Police-station in the Old Jewry; I saw my Inspector first, and Colonel Ford came afterwards and examined the bag and contents—I then noticed the trigger of the pistol had gone down but not exploded the cartridge—Colonel Ford drew the charge from the pistol and also the detonators from the slab in my presence—he took charge of the pistol, the clockwork, and the detonators—I did not notice that the cartridge was blank, without a bullet—I took charge of all the slabs of dynamite—I also saw when these things were taken out of the bag a number of strips of paper, 47 altogether, marked "Atlas powder A," as if they had been stripped off other slabs; they were printed exactly in the same way as the others—I took charge of the various slabs and took them to Woolwich the same day in the bag; they were taken them for safety by the direction of Colonel Ford—at Woolwich I gave them to Sergeant Hindes of the Woolwich Dockyard Police; I left them in his custody—I took possession of the bag; it has been in my possession until I produced it at Bow Street—Colonel Ford carefully examined all the things—I noticed a mark on one of the handkerchiefs inside the bag: "Washington, S. H. Green &amp; Sons" printed.</p>

I am station-master at Paddington—two or three days after the explosion at Victoria Station I examined the luggage in the cloak-room at Paddington, and found this portmanteau, which was heavier than usual—I think I unstrapped it—I unlocked it at all events, and found 45 or 46 cakes of some kind of composition, moat of it in one compartment—on feeling it I felt something hard, and found this cash-box full of dynamite, and the clock in the centre-the dynamite was all round it—a pistol was attached to the clockwork, and a detonate was affixed to one cake of dynamite inside the cash-box—one or two of the cakes were labelled "Atlas powder A"—the size of the cakes was about 4 inches—the trigger of the pistol was connected with the clock-work, but the pistol had not gone off, nor had the detonators been exploded—my opinion is that the trigger was not properly set; it was too stiff—the hand was set for 12 o'clock, and the clock had stopped at 9—I do not understand it myself, but Colonel Majendie came and explained it to me—one of the newspapers in the portmanteau was the New York Sun of February 6th, 1884—there was a small label of the South-Easten Railway on the portmanteau, but no steamship label—I handed it with the contents to Colonel Majendie.</p>

                  </hi>.

               <p>he was up in his room—after he had gone I found some crumbs like cheese, yellow, one tray of a cash box, and a little wooden box like the one produced, which I broke up and burnt—I found the tray of the cash<lb/>box under the dressing table—it was a day or two after handed to Inspector Swanson—I swept the crumbs up and threw them into the dust-hole—the second man left on Monday, the 25th—he was gone between 7 and 8 in the evening, when I went into his room—he paid for his room for Monday night when he had his breakfast in the morning-he did not return, nor the first man—the second man's luggage was gone when I went into his room—I found in his room a wooden box without a lid similar to the one produced, and the inside flap of a portmanteau, which is now produced—I found the flap under the bed—I threw it in the dust-hole—I used the wooden box for buttons, and aftewards handed it to Inspector Swanson—I saw him take the flap out of the dust-bin—the two men appeared before others to be strangers to each other—they hung their heads down, and did not look at each other, but I could hear them talking when I went to the coffee-room door, bat as soon as I entered they dropped the conversation—each paid every night for his room, and their meals as they had them so they paid for them—I have not seen the men since—I should know either of the men if I saw them again."

I am a clerk in the cloak-room at Charing Cross—the cloak-room is situated entirely under the hotel at one side—on the 25th I was on duty there at 12 o'clock midnight—I heard of the explosion at Victoria on 26th February, and on the 27th, Wednesday evening, I examined the luggage soon after 11 o'clock—I don't par-particularly remember if I had seen a portmanteau marked 314 on Tuesday, the 26th—I first saw that portmanteau on the Wednesday, I am quite sure there was one marked 314, this is it—I discovered it, it was then locked—its weight attracted my attention, it was very heavy on one side—it was strapped each side with a small strap, I got a key and opened it in the presence of Shepherd—I found an English newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> of 21st February, 1884, and underneath the paper cakes of Atlas powder—I don't know how many cakes there were, I did not count them, there were a great number; one side was very near three-parts full—I found this part of an overcoat, I am chiefly guided by the buttons; these buttons were then on the coat, one has been cut off and others have gone since then like this, they were buttons of this character—I also saw portions of trousers and braces. I could only see part because they were under the Atlas powder; I don't mean there were half a pair of trousers there, I could only see a portion of the whole—these appear like those trousers, they seem to me to be the same—this seems to the same tin box which was covered with cobbler's wax and covered with the Atlas powder, I did not look inside it—I pinched a piece off one of the cakes, and in consequence of that I communicated with Inspector Briden, and it was left in charge of Sergeant Middleton and Inspector Briden—I was on duty on the evening of the Monday; I don't know whether the last witness took this portmanteau in, out of the great number of people we have during the day it would be hard to say—there is nothing to attach the taking in of this portmanteau to my memory except the 314 upon it, and that shows it was taken in on Monday, 25th February.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Eldon Terrace, Southampton, and am a licensed porter at the docks—on Wednesday, February 20th, 1884, the Donau came into the river, and passengers came off from her in a tender—I saw three of them; Burton is one of them—I have no doubt about him—he was in the company of two men—Burton asked me it I could show him where he could get a wash and a dinner; it was between 12 and 1 o'clock—I took him to Mr. Day's, Terminus Hotel, near the station he was carrying a black American valise—Burton and one of the others went upstairs at the hotel—going there he had asked me if I could show him where he could buy a second hand portmanteau or two—I said I would show him after going to the hotel—I said when he came down-stairs at the hotel "This way"—we two went alone to Bennett's, 64, Oxford Street, a second-hand shop—in Burton's presence I said "This man wants buy a second-hand portmanteau or two"—Bennett took down from the</p>

I have been at Southampton as a licensed porter for a long time—passengers' luggage is always examined there; I do not know if that of the passengers from the Donau was, but it was the custom of the port at that time to make such an examination—the last time I saw Burton was against the Cunard Hotel near the dock gates, about four minutes' walk from the station; he was wearing a long brown overcoat—I have not seen the second portmanteau since, nor the valise, which was more an American valise than this bag—one of the two men with him asked about the starting of the boats from Cork and Dublin; I believe I saw one of those on the 6th April last year—when he said he wanted to buy another one for his mate he had bought this one—I advised him to keep the one I thought was the cheaper and stronger; it was a better bag, I believe.</p>

Webb lave a shop at 68, Oxford Street; they are trunk, portmanteau, and bag manufacturers—I know Robert Thomas, a dock porter at Southampton—remember his coming to Messrs. Webb's shop on 20th February last year; he brought a passenger—American boats stop at Southampton—Thomas and the passenger had a portmanteau with them, a secondhand one—I recognise Burton as the man that came with Thomas—there was portmanteau also purchased by him.; I made the bargain with Burton, talked to him, I had a full opportunity of seeing his face—the port-manteau that he purchased was exactly the same class of thing as this; The paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—this is the portmanteau that Burton brought in; it needed repairs, it required a new hasp—I effected those repairs, I find my work on it; I put on a new hasp, I recognise the hasp; I also put a new key, it is not there now—I put on the hasp with French pins—such pins are used for such a purpose, for putting on a hasp; they are also used for the nailing down of the rand, which is the band which covers it—it is not usual to do such work on the rand with French pins; I used them because he was in a hurry and I had no tacit near me—I can cognise my work on the rand; some of the French pins remain—this is hat I call the rand, this is the hasp, and these are the pins (<hi rend="italic">Pointing them out</hi>)—when the portmanteau was brought to me it was a little torn I had to tear it open to get at the place where the hasp was fixed on—is is the hasp that I put on—it was fastened on by three little French pins, that is usual; one of the pins remains in it now—there are some 1 tacks here; it had evidently been repaired before—I usually use tacks brass nails, studs, but not French pins for the rand—this is a French hasp, I recognise that also—I have not the slightest doubt that this is the portmanteau that I mended when Thomas and the man brought it—it is my own work that I recognise—it took me about two minutes to do the</p>

Burton," and dated "New York, 7th December, 1884"—after I received it the prisoner came again to my house on Monday.

I keep the Liverpool Arms Hotel, at 31, Robert Street, Liverpool—I very often attend at the arrival of the boats carrying passengers from America, and a good many of these passengers stop at my house at different times—on 20th December last I was attending at the landing-stage awaiting the arrival of the tender from the Adriatic—I met it at the landing-stage—after it had arrived I saw the prisoner Cunningham—I didn't see him actually step off from the tender—he had come out of the Custom House when I first saw him—I spoke to him and asked him if he was going to stay in Liverpool—he said "Yes"—I said "Have you any place to stop at?"—he said "No"—I then gave him a card of my house—after looking at it he said "All right, I will come and stay at your place"—I asked him if he had any friends on board, and he said "No"—at that time he had a bag and a small bundle with him—I perfectly remember a box similar to that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) coming to my house some time after I had had this talk, whether it belonged to Cunningham or not I am not positive; I believe it did—I know the porters Heston and Carroll—I do not recollect seeing them at my house on that day—I might have done and might not, because I am frequently seeing them and I might be mistaking one day with another—I walked with Cunningham to my house—I am not positive whether this trunk I have been speaking of was at my house while Cunningham was there—to the best of my belief it was there—he stayed with me two or three nights—I have no entry at all of the time he stopped—I don't remember his giving me any name—he might have done so but not to my remem<lb/>brance—I recollect his going away, but not exactly the day he left—I know a cabman named Mclntyre—I can't say whether I called him to take Cunningham away—I have fetched him off his stand more than once—I went with Cunningham in the cab, but I can't be positive whose cab it was—I went in a cab with Cunningham to the Lime Street Station—I have no recollection as to the driver of it—Mclntyre has driven cabs more than once or twice from my house—when Cunningham went he took a bag with him—I couldn't be positive of anything else—I couldn't say for certain if he took a box—to the best of my belief he did—it was a box similar to that produced—I wouldn't positively swear that that was the box or that he had a box; as to the size, shape, and colour I couldn't say, because there are many similar to it—to the best of my recollection this is the same in size, shape, and colour, and general appearance—I can't swear that I helped Cunningham to bring that trunk or box of which I have been speaking down from his bedroom—I did help to bring a trunk down from Cunningham's bedroom, but I couldn't</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the service of the Metropolitan Railway Company—on January the 2nd I was under-guard in the front break of this train, and was in the compartment next the engine—I attended to the front part of the train, and the guard to the back part—the second carriage was a third-class with a break in it—passengers luggage is sometimes put there, and persons sometimes travel in it—it is part of my duty from time to time to look into the break to see if there is luggage in it, and I had looked in that evening before the explosion, at Bishops<lb/>gate, Aldersgate, and Farringdon—I can swear that there were two people in it, and there may have been more; Cunningham is one of them—I am positive he was in the break van—after passing Gower Street box there was an explosion—I was in a stooping position near the break wheel, and it threw me forward on my hands and knees, and 32 windows of the train were broken—I got out at Gower Street, and said "All change," and the train was taken on to Edgware Road to be inspected—I went through each compartment and examined it, but found nothing—I next saw Cunningham at Bow Street with several people, and pointed him out as the man—I saw Police-Sergeant Crawford at Gower Street.</p>

On Friday, January 2nd, about 9.15,1 was on duty outside Gower Street Railway Station, on the south side of the Euston Road, where the trains run from the East end towards Paddington-part of the station there is open—I saw a flash and a cloud of dust, and heard a report of an explosion—I ran down the stairs into the station on the same side I have been speaking of, and arrived then about two minutes before the train came in from the City—I first saw the engine and the guard's break; the next carriage was the spear break, which stopped opposite the ticket-collector's box by the stairs—I saw Taylor the guard jump out, and I believe he opened the door of the spear brake—I looked in the spear break and saw three men there standing up, they came out and stood still a few seconds—other people got out of the train—I heard a lady scream behind me; I went to her, and found her bleeding from the nose—the three men disappeared while I was writing down her name and address—I wrote down several names and addresses—I don't know which way the men went—after this, about February 2nd, I went to Bow Street and saw nine or ten men in a room—I saw the Prisoner Cunningham there—I touched him—I swear to the best of my belief he was one of the three men I saw that Friday night—on the 5th February I went to King Street Police-station—there were fourteen or fifteen men there, amongst whom was Burton—I touched him—to the best of my belief he was one of the three men I saw that Friday night.</p>

               <p>Cunningham, but I have spoken to him since at the police-court after I had given evidence—I did not speak as to other men, I never saw Sewers till I saw him at the police-court—the third man in the break was a tall man, about 5 feet 9 inches, dark coat, and rather dark whiskers—I saw nothing else in the break-the three men were standing apparently in conversation—the train was at a standstill—that was after the explosion—I have not heard that there were only two men in the break—I will swear there were three men—I saw them before they came out, because I had an object in looking in the carriages—I began to look in at the spear break—I was standing waiting for the train coming in—I saw Taylor there—I had not seen Burton before to my knowledge—I was not able to describe these men minutely the day after the accident.</p>

When I saw the cloud of dust I was between the two stairs—I am stationed in the district—there are a number of blow holes all the way down the Euston Road, one near the Charlton box—that is used used as an ordinary obelisk; no one could throw anything over, the railings are so close together, a child could not put his foot through—you could not put your fist between them—any<lb/>thing smaller than a finger could go through—the brake stopped opposite the signal box—the men could not have run out without giving up their tickets—all persons there were excited—I would not swear to this photo (several photographs produced) they are rather deceptive—one looks rather like Burton when he was young—I did not know him when he was young—I did not ask the three men for their addresses—the majority of the people rushed to me—I did not see a picture of Cunningham in the police-court before I identified him—I have since ascertained there was, but it was nothing at all like him—that was a sketch—the Police Gazette comes out twice a week, once with photos—it is not my duty to look at it—it is hung up in a portion of the station—I go to that portion of the station because we have no Gazette; it is my duty to look at the Gazette once a week—it was not my duty to have looked at it before I identified Cunningham—his sketch appeared on the 2nd or the 30th—I never looked at it after Cunningham was arrested.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Constable</hi>). On the morning of Saturday, the 10th of January, I was directed to watch Burton, and went to Mitre Square—I saw Burton at 5, Mitre Square, at 9.35; he went up Mitre Street, along Aldgate, crossed the road, and went into Baverstock's Restaurant in High Street, Aldgate, about three doors from the corner of the Minories—I went back to Mitre Square to make inquiries, and then returned to Aldgate six or seven minutes after that—I then saw both prisoners coming up High Street, Aldgate, from Whitechapel towards me, about 10 yards off—when I first saw them I was then standing outside a public-house next to Baverstock's, waiting for Burton to come out; it was raining very hard at the time, and Burton had his coat collar turned up—the prisoners were is conversation with each other, walking side by side; Cunningham on the kerb side—they passed by me—I had a thorough opportunity of seeing Cunningham's face—I have no doubt as to his being the man who was with Burton—I followed them down the Minories—Burton must hare I come out of Baverstock's during my absence—they turned to the left down there—I followed them about 100 yards down; they stopped at the corner of Goodman's Yard, which leads to Great Prescott Street; they I parted company there—Goodman's Yard is a public thoroughfare-Cunningham went down Goodman's Yard towards Great Prescott Street—Burton came back through the Minories, crossed the road, and went into No. 23, Aldgate High Street, another Restaurant, between Duke Street and Mitre Street—he remained there about three-quarters of an hour, and then he came out, lighted a cigar, and walked down towards Whitechapel—when he got to Middlesex Street, commonly known as Petticoat Lane, he crossed the road to Mansell Street, and went into Binson's laundry, on the left-hand side—he remained there five or seven minutes, and then came out, went up Aldgate Avenue into Mitre Street, where he bought a newspaper, and went into No. 1, Mitre Square—I have not the least doubt Burton was the man—on the 4th of February I was taken to the House of Detention, different prisoners were in different cells; the cell doors were opened—the warder and deputy-governor were in front of me, and after five cell doors had been opened I recognised Cunningham in the sixth as the man I had seen with Burton—I saw Burton afterwards at King Street—I had seen some sketches of Cunning-ham in the Police Gazette before I went to the cells, but I did not think it</p>

I went there for to get those pocket-handkerchiefs, which the landlady had for me, and I received them. Then I went to this restau<lb/>rant between Mitre Square, or Mitre Street, and Duke Street. I think it is the Cafe Royal they call it. I went in there and I had my break<lb/>fast. I had some tea for breakfast, and then I left there and I went down Mitre Street and I bought a morning paper and I went into Mrs. Capella'a and I stopped there, I cannot say how long; it was very short, and the morning was wet, and as I was leaving, Mrs. Capella proffered me her umbrella. She said she thought I might need it, it was better I should keep from the wet as much as possible. I accepted the umbrella and I went into Mrs. Whitteridge's and I got my bag, which I had all ready to take away. I bid the lady good-bye and I went to Fen-church Street. I took the train at Fen-church Street, and I arrived at the nearest station to where I took my luggage, and I stopped in this lodging I believe all that day because it was wet. If I had gone out in the morn<lb/>ing I do not remember. That is all I have to say."</p>

I am unmarried and reside at 30, Great Prescott Street, Whitechapel—on 24th December I had some lodgings to let in my house, and Cunningham came in the forenoon—I asked him if he would have a double-bedded room or a room to himself—he chose a room to himself, the front bedroom on the third floor, for which he was to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he said he wanted it for a week, he had no luggage with him at that time—he said he would go for it; and he afterwards returned in a cab (I was standing at the door when he arrived) with a box like that—I cannot say it was the same one, as far as I can judge that is the box—I see no difference between the box he brought and that one—he had also a small bag, it might have been about that size, I did not look at it; he took the box upstairs himself without any assistance—that same evening he paid me the week's rent—this was Wednesday, the day before Christmas Day—I can't say what day it was, but one Sunday he was indoors, and I said "I have not the pleasure of knowing your name," and he said his name was Gilbert, and I called him Mr. Gilbert—I asked him where he came from—he said Liverpool, and that he was a traveller—he remained with me exactly three weeks till Wednesday, 14th January, paying his rent week by week in advance—he went out about 8 or 9 o'clock and came back in the afternoon to his own room and sometimes sat in the parlour—on Tuesday, the 13th, the day before he left, I remember his knocking at the street door, I let him in—in the evening he said the brown box was not his; that he was going out to buy a small one, and that he expected a friend to call for the large brown one—he left no message for his friend and said no mow about him, and did not give me his name—up to this Tuesday the brown box had been in his room—in the daytime I was sometimes in the kitchen in the basement—I know nothing about the brown box going from my house, but on the Wednesday morning when I went into his room the brown box was not there—I saw him in the morning, but not immediately before he went away—he told me he was going, but not where to, nor did he give me any reason for going—while with me he made no complaint as to the way his room was done or how he was treated, and who were always on friendly terms—after he said the large box was going away and he was going to get another, I let him in, and he had a black box, but I did not notice it because the gas was not alight and I cannot say what it was like, but he had something of the shape of a box with him after he said he was going to buy a smaller one—I did not go into his room the morning he was going away.</p>

I am a cab-driver—on the night of Monday or Tuesday, 12th or 13th January, I was on the Aldgate rank with my four-wheeled cab, when Burton came and asked me whether I was in charge of this first four-wheeled cab—I replied "Yes"—he asked me what I would charge to drive to the Turner Road, Burdett Road, Bow—that would be within a few yards of two and a half miles; a portion of it is without the radius—I asked him the number of persons and the luggage—he replied, "There is only myself and a box," or trunk, I would not be sure which, which was empty, and by its weight I judged it to be so—I asked him where I was to take up—he said in Great Prescott Street—that was close on 500 yards from my rank—I asked him what number I was to take up at—he said, "I will show you, it is just past the Roman Catholic church"—we had some discussion then as to the fare—I asked him half-a-orown; he said it was too much; ultimately I agreed to take 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said it was too much because he could get it down by rail for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but there was the difficulty of getting the box to the station—he got into the cab; I drove him to either the first or second house eastwards of the Roman Catholic church—I saw a box come out of an iron gateway leading to the house facing where I stopped my cab—it had an area in front, with steps going down, I think—I put up my rail behind, and by the time I had done that it was waiting on the pavement—he handed the box up to me himself, I placed it on the roof—he then gave me the address, 90, Turner's Road, Burdett Road, Bow, to drive to—he said it would not take me long as I could go through some back turnings—on the road we stopped at a public-house and had some drink together—he then told me to get ready, and he went into a newspaper and cigar shop and said he was going to get a news-paper—when we got to Turner Road, Bow, I merely, lifted the box off the roof and placed it between us on the fore part of the cab, and he lifted it off himself and carried it to the door—considering the size of</p>

I live at 138, Upper North Street, Poplar—on 24th Jan. this year I went with Elizabeth Bailey to the Tower of London—I could not tell what time we got there—I met my friend about half-past 1 o'clock—we got tickets at the ticket-office, and first of all we went to the Jewel room, and then came out and went towards the White Tower—there will a place on the steps where we had to give up our tickets—we then went up a number of steps into a chapel—until we got to the top of the steps we saw nobody; we then saw two little boys in the chapel—there was Do one except the two boys and a warder in the chapel—we then went out of the chapel and into the Banqueting Hall—the boys were in front of us—as we turned round the corner we saw a little smoke coming up from the right; it seemed to be coming from the floor—I could not say how far it was from where I was—after that there was a dreadful noise, and it seemed as if I was being driven back—after the noise gave over I was lying down with the arms on me—somebody helped me out and I was taken to the hospital, and remained there till the 4th February.</p>

               <p>days—I finished my dinner about half-past 1, and was walking about after that in the Banqueting Hall near the entrance to the chapel; that is where I had my dinner—if a person came into the White Tower and wanted to go into the Banqueting Hall he would have to pass me at soon as he left the Chapel of St. John, he would pass me before he got into the room upstairs—if a person is making the regular round as the visitors do he comes from the chapel in the south building and goes &amp; step or two and comes into the gangway to the north, and then he bends to the west again till he gets to another staircase, the north-west stair case, and goes up into the Council Chamber—at the time of the explosion I was near where they come straight from the chapel up towards the north; I was about four feet away from that passage when the explosion took place about within three feet or so—there is a parting wall. (<hi rend="italic">The learned Judge here pointed out upon the plan the various places to the witness.</hi>) This is the gangway, and I was about here (<hi rend="italic">Pointing with his finger on the plan</hi>), and this is the other end of the wall, there is a thick wall, and this leads into the other rooms—I saw the dark young man, the shortest (<hi rend="italic">Cunningham</hi>), on this Saturday in the Tower between the figures 8 and 9 (<hi rend="italic">Referring to the plan</hi>)—he was then coming from the figure 7 to go over 8 and 9 till they get upstairs to the Council Chamber—that is the usual way, there is no other way for visitors to go—he passed me from the figures 8 to 9—I have no doubt that is the man I saw—he did not come back that way again, if he had he must have passed me again-I have seen him round the White Tower before, in the month of January, I could not give you the date—on the Monday after the explosion I saw him at Bow Street amongst seven or eight other men, and I picked him out—I heard an explosion a little while after Cunningham had passed me—I finished my dinner at the half-hour, and he passed me some minutes after that, some short time after—the place was set on fire, and the arm-racks were knocked about—my head has got a severe shock, my eyes are running with water, it dims my sight sometimes—I had seen the prisoner Burton a week or so before the explosion; I have seen him pass through the Tower, but not on that day.</p>

I did not see Cunningham with Burton—Saturday is a free day at the Tower; sometimes we have good many visitors—when I saw Cunningham go by I was coming from the west window, coming back towards No. 7—I used to walk backwards and forwards; when I came to No. 7 I could see down to the right where the explosion took place—I met him past No. 8; he was going towards No. 9; he was coming from the east towards the west—he was close by No. 8; he seemed to walk on not taking any interest in the objects that were about him—this photograph I should take to be a portrait of Cunningham when he was younger; I will not swear that I did not see any persons like that there that day—there were not many passed by me between 1 and 2 o'clock that day; it was rather a slack day; there were about 10 in the hour—when I was having my dinner I went into a small recess away from the view of the public—I attend Great Prescott Street Church; I am one of the collectors there—I had never seen Cunningham there; many might go in without my seeing them—I do not collect all round—I should think it must have been 20 minutes after Cunningham passed me that the explosion occurred—I have been at the Tower some time—after you go upstairs on the first-floor and then descend opposite</p>

This (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the ordinary guide-book which is sold inside the Tower gates in the ticket office, most strangers would buy one—I have been on duty in the Tower nine or 10 years—this guide-book says, "On quitting the White Tower the visitor would proceed across the Green to the Beauchamp Tower"—that is the way in which visitors would generally go after coming out of St. John's Chapel and the Banqueting Hall, it is the general route—I don't know how many people went out between a quarter-past 1, when I saw the prisoner go in, and 2 o'clock—I came back from my dinner about 25 minutes to 2 o'clock, I can't say how many people went out between that time and two o'clock, but I know it was a very Black day; that day slacker than usual, some people went out—I didn't look at the clod when the explosion took place, but I heard the clock in the White Tower strike 2 o'clock—when I heard the explosion I ran and closed the gates—that was about three minutes after; that was not by order, I used my own discretion—there was an alarm given that there was an explosion in the White Tower, and directly I heard the alarm given I ran and closed the gates, the alarm was given to me by a military man in the Tower—he ran out and said there was an explosion in the armoury in the White Tower; I expect he ran from the White Tower down to the gates, so that there would have been an interval of about two or three minutes as near as possible—the explosion didn't excite me, it it is a general occurrence to hear the guns towards Woolwich, but we were surprised to hear the explosion for the moment, it seemed to be near at hand and caused a little excitement—there were very few people passed out besides the gentleman and lady and little boy, if any, I didn't notice them—I didn't see anybody like that photograph go into the Tower, that might be a likeness of Cunningham when he was younger than be is now—I have not been in Court this morning; I have not spoken to Munro or anybody else about anything in this Court—I don't know either of those two photographs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was not my duty to take parcels from people, but to direct them to leave them in the parcels' department—I didn't see Cunningham carrying a parcel, there was no appearance of anything concealed upon him—my business called me out at times, I had other business to attend to—I saw nothing to lead me to fancy that he had anything about him, I didn't pay particular atten<lb/>tion to him more than any one else—I might identify a good many of the people that went in between 1 and 2 o'clock that day.</p>

               <p>the explosion since I had seen any one pass through the Banqueting Hall to the upper part in the ordinary way—when I got to the places where the explosion was, just by there within a few yards I found the two boys Stratton and George, bleeding, having been knocked over by the explosion; I took hold of them and carried them down to where Deveral was; I also saw one of the young women close by there—I at once assisted in putting out the fire; it was burning for about 20 minutes.</p>

About 40 minutes past 2 on Saturday, 24th January, I was called to the Tower, and found the gates closed—a number of persons who had been in the Tower at the time of the explosion were gathered together at the gates, waiting to get out: they were shut in by the gates having been closed—I received instructions to take the names, addresses, and occupations of the different persons who were inside, and it was done—an inspector and sergeant wrote down the names and addresses, whilst I stood by and assisted in getting from the various persons their names and so on—among the persons who were gathered round the gate was the prisoner Cunningham—he came in his turn about a quarter to 4 to pass through the gate, and gave the name of James George Gilbert—when I came to his address I understood him to say "Cherbourg Street"—I asked him where Cherbourg Street was—he replied "Whitechapel"—I then asked him what part of Whitechaped this street was in, as I knew no such street—he said, "Near Great Alie Street"—upon that the inspector who was writing down the names said, "Do you mean Scarborough Street?"—he said "Yes"—he was then asked what he was by employment—he did not answer at first and I did not know whether he understood the question, and I asked him myself, and he then said, "Labourer"—I then inquired where he was employed—he replied, "Nowhere"—I then asked him what countryman he was—he replied, "I am an Englishman," but not so readily as I am answering, he repeated every question I put to him—when he said he was an Englishman I asked him where he had been last employed—he said, "Liverpool"—I asked him where at Liverpool—he said, "At the docks"—I then asked him what he was doing in London, and how long he had been here—he replied that he had been here two or three weeks and had come to better himself—I asked him how long he had been at</p>

               <p>Liverpool—he replied, "Two or three months"—I thought it, right to pass him into the police-office which is at the Tower; it was close where I was standing, the door was on my right, it is just underneath the Bayard Gate—the Assistant Commissioner, Mr. Monro, and Superinten<lb/>dent Arnold were in there—I then went outside to attend to the other persons, intending to speak to the prisoner later on if there were no others there—when I came back I found a written statement had been taken, which was read over to him—I was absent, I should think, three-quarters of an hour—I heard him then say that he had resided at 30, Great Prescott Street, Whitechapel, and he was known by the name of Gilbert, and had removed from there to 32, Scarborough Street—I took from him three keys at the Tower, one of which was the latchkey of 32, Scarborough Street; the other two keys related to the black box and the bag—I went with him to his lodging in Scarborough Street, where he pointed out in his room the black box and bag produced—he was taken to Leman Street Police-station, and the bag and box were taken to the station, I sent Sergeant White for them—shortly after we arrived at the station a telegram arrived from Liverpool, and I said to Cunningham, "We have received a telegram from Liverpool, and no such person appears to be known at the address you have given, and Stock says he had no person working at the docks"—he said that what he had said was perfectly correct—the name of Stock and the address came from a written statement—White brought the bag and box from Scarborough Street to Leman Street Station—they were locked—I put them in a small ante-room, which was locked up, attached to my office—I took possession of the key, and on Monday evening, the 26th, I first examined the contents—the locks had not been tampered with, they were in exactly the same state as I left them in—Jarvis called out each article, and I made the list—there were two walking coats, some waistcoats, and the natural articles a man would have, and a few books. (The Guide to the Tower was found on his person.) When I came to the bottom of the box Jarvis handed me this envelope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and this piece of metal, which was then bright; I thought it was the top of a pencil-case at first—there was some white substance in it which glistened like what you see inside percussion caps—it was taken to Scotland Yard; I initialled it and I afterwards gave it to Dr. Dupré Colonel Majendie also saw it—on the Saturday evening, while Cunningham was detained, I went to 32, Great Prescott Street, and saw the landlady, Miss Kelly, and in consequence of what she told me I spoke to Cunningham, and took a note next night of what he said; this is it—I said to Cunningham, "We have made inquiries at 30, Great Prescott Street, and find when you arrived there you had with you a large brown box and bag; the landlady states that you afterwards took the brown box away, and you told her you had borrowed it from a friend; now if you like to refer me to your friend we will make inquiry if you think it will be for your benefit"—he replied "She says I had a box, does she? she is lying"—at that time I was quite in doubt about his guilt or innocence—he was charged at Bow Street on Sunday, the 25th, and gave his name George Gilbert—he after<lb/>wards asked me what name we had got down—I said "James George Gilbert"—he said."My proper name is George Gilbert Cunningham"—I found on him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a silver watch and chain, a cigar case, and a guide to the Tower of London—at that time and up to the examination</p>

Lazarus, 244 to 246, Shoreditch—inquiries were made as to what had become of the American box, in consequenae of which Jarvis and I went to Burton's room, 90, Turner's Road, where we found this brown American trunk, which we have produced, and this black bag was in the ante-room—I found in the box a map of London, which came from Dickens's Dictionary of London for 1884—there was Dickens's Dictionary of London, a guide to the Beauchamp Tower, a guide to the Palace of "West<lb/>minster, a part of a New York newspaper, and several other newspaper including several English ones—14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on his person—the books were on a shelf in his room, and a few of the papers in his bag—in the large box there was a calico packet, some envelopes and writing paper, and some light brown paper—Great Prescott Street is about 200 yards from 30, Scarborough Street, which is about 900 yards from the Tower—it took me three minutes to walk from 5, Mitre Square to Aldgate Station, and from Mitre Square to Great Prescott Street seven or eight minutes.</p>

               <p>sequence of what Cunningham said I left the police-office and telegraphed to the police at Liverpool, and before I got the answer back I went with Sergeant White to 32, Scarborough Street, Whitechapel, and there went into a room which was pointed out to me as Cunningham's room, I there saw the black box produced and the bag; the bag was locked—I obtained several hundreds of keys, and got one that fitted the box—the box was not full at that time; there was some clothing, brushes, and toilet requisites in it—Sergeant White handed me out the things, probably half a dozen or more, and they were laid on the bed (<hi rend="italic">there was nothing on the bed at that time</hi>), I then felt round the bottom of the box, but found no letters or papers—at the time I felt round there was some underclothing, socks and such-like, at the bottom, that I had not taken out—I had never taken the things from the bottom at all—I found no letters or papers, and put the things from the bed that I had taken out back into the box, and locked it—I then examined the bag that was in the room; it contained wearing apparel; I felt in that, but there wen no letters or papers there—I then left the room with Sergeant White—this was between 5 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon—when we got out into the street we met Inspector Abberline coming along with the prisoner Cunningham, and I went back with them to the house, No. 32, but I did not go into the room again; White and Abberline, and the prisoner Cunningham, did—afterwards Abberline came out, and I and he tool Cunningham to the Leman Street Station—afterwards I went to 30, Great Prescott Street and saw Miss Cannon, and made some inquiries of her—I afterwards received this telegram (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said to Cunningham that we had received a telegram from Liverpool, and read it to him-this is it: "Chief Superintendent Williams, Liverpool, to J. Momo; Assistant Commissioner, Leman Street Police-station. No. 28 in street Stock keeps beerhouse, 31. No person named Gilbert or Cunningham has lodged there; has had no lodger that works at docks"—when I read that to him I said, "Your statements concerning yourself when in Liver<lb/>pool are untrue," he replied, "I don't care what they say; what I hare said is true"—I also said to him, "We have also inquired at Scar<lb/>borough Street, and the landlady is positive you gave the name of Dal<lb/>ton, and did not mention Gilbert"—he said, "I don't care what she gays; I gave my name as Gilbert, but she called me Dalton, and I didn't think it worth while to correct her"—that was all that passed then—later the same evening I spoke to him again; I said, "We have inquired at Great Prescott Street, and the landlady, Miss Cannon, says that when you arrived on Christmas Eve you had with you a large brown American trunk and a hand-bag, and that you afterwards told her the trunk belonged to a friend of yours who you expected might call for it, and that is the reason you gave her for purchasing the black bag you now possess. Can you give me any information about that trunk, or your friend?"—he replied, "If she says that she is lying; I never had but the one trunk, and that is the one I have got now"—afterwards Sergeant White brought to the station the black box and the bag, in the same state as I had left them—Cunningham was detained at Leman Street Police-station on this Saturday night, and on the following day, Sunday, he was taken to Scotland Yard, and afterwards to the Bow Street Station, on Monday, 26th January, I was at Bow Street, and Inspector Abberline gave evidence that day for the purpose of a remand—after the remand I</p>

I said, 'Will you sell that trunk?' He replied, 'Yes.' I then asked him how much he wanted for it. He replied, '10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.' I said, 'I will give you 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.' He replied, 'All right, I will take it.' I paid him in silver. The man then looked after it while I fetched a cab, and I then brought it here. I did not know the man I bought it from, and I have never seen him since"—He also said, "I arrived from America on Christmas Eve, by the steamer Oregon, stayed in Liverpool one night, and came up to London on Christmas Day. I have been here before. I came over in April last year, and returned in September. I am a cabinet-maker by trade"—we had this conversa<lb/>tion in his own room; that large American trunk was there, the bag or valise, and a black Gladstone bag—I took, possession of the trunk, and informed Burton that his statements were not quite satisfactory, and it would be necessary for him to accompany us to Scotland Yard pending farther inquiries, and that was done—I took possession of the box and the bag and the things in the room the same night—he was charged on Thursday, the 5th, before Sir James Ingham, and remanded till the 9th so as to be brought up and jointly charged with Cunningham—he was formally charged with being concerned with another man in custody in maliciously causing an explosion at the Tower of London on 28th January—he denied that charge.</p>

               <p>handed them to me—I knew that an explosion had occurred, and had read of it being carried out by means of a fuse with a detonator—I was looking for anything suspicious or anything in the man's favour, not for papers only, but for anything to throw any light on it, or anything relating to the explosion—I was in the room probably ten minutes, but the box was only open a few minutes while Sergeant White and I were engaged at it—I made an ordinary examination—I saw Cunningham, many times previous to his appearance at Bow Street, at Leman Street, and Scotland Yard—I saw him at the Tower, on the way to Scarborough Street, twice on Saturday evening at Leman Street, and two or three times on Sunday, and on Monday in the yard before he was taken into Court—I only had conversation with him on the two occasions that I saw him at Leman Street on the Saturday evening—I made no suggestions as to statements he had previously made when he was before the Com<lb/>missioners on Sunday—I did not produce written copies of his state<lb/>ments—I don't know who did—I had charge of the case with another officer under the superintendent for the Saturday and Monday, and did as I was directed—I was doing nothing else but this case during that time—I knew about 5 o'clock on Sunday afternoon that the prisoner would be charged with treasonable practices-he was placed in the dock at Bow Street about mid-day on Mouday, about 19 hours afterwards—we made no further examination of his box during that time.</p>

               <p>"James George Gilbert aged 22 (Father, Joseph Gilbert) of 28 or 31 Robert Street Liverpool, dock labourer, states:—That he left Liverpool about a fortnight back, has worked in the Canada Dock under a man named Swanson, about two months prior to that worked at the Alexandra Dock. Wages paid by one O'Dea for about two months. Has been in Liverpool about four months. Stock was my landlord. He is a married man. There was another lodger there whose name I do not know. He was a shoemaker. I think he was English or Welshman. I left Liverpool to come to London to better myself. Before I came to Liverpool I was in New York and lived at 194 Franklin Street and worked at Morgan's Dock as as a freight handler. I was born in the parish of Scull in the county of Cork near Skibbereen. My father died when I was six months old. My mother is about 50 or 60 years and is supported by her daughters. I have one sister Kate in Brooklyn. She is a house servant, don't know where. My father had a bit of land near Scull but it was taken from him before he died. Another sister named Mary worked as a servant some time ago at the Hygeina Hotel Seight Street New York. She helped to support her mother and I suppose sent the money through the Chambers Street Bank as she told me this about six or seven months ago while she was working at the hotel. She left the hotel two or three months ago. Julia a third sister is a domestic servant in New York but I do not know the address. My mother is living at Gurtamona Schull and my two remaining sisters both married live near my mother one named Ellen Hellen the other Margaret Connor. Connor her husband a labourer is alive. I went from Queenstown to New York about five years ago. I worked at Morgan's Dock the most of the time. I also worked on the Pennsylvania Railroad and lived at the same address all the time viz. Mrs. Crimmons 194 Franklin Street. I worked as a freight handler on the railway. I left New York two or three months ago and came to Liverpool by the 'Adriatic' in August or September last. My passage ticket was in the name of Cunningham by which name I was always known. When I reached Liverpool I met Stock at the dock and he took me to his house. He is an emigration agent. When I came to London I went to Great Prescott Street No. 30. I do not know the landlady's name. I paid 5a. per week. I do not know the names of any of the other lodgers. I stayed there two weeks and then went to 32 Scarborough Street where I am still lodging. I do</p>

               <p>not know the name of the landlady. She called me Dalton and I did not correct her. There are other lodgers there but I do not know their names. When I came to London I brought 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me. I have now 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and have spent the rest. I have bought a box for which I paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and that is now at my lodgings. I have been looking for work but could not obtain any. I do not know any one in London. I have not been to see any of the sights of London except St. Paul's where I went last week. I left home to-day about half-past 1 and was in the Tower before 2 o'clock. At the time of the explosion I had gone through the Chapel and was going up the stairs at the other end. Some other fellows were going up with me but I do not know them and was too much scared to notice them. I have been to the Italian coffee place in Aldgate two or three times to have my meals. I sent some money to my mother from New York through the Chambers Street Bank, who was to pay it I don't know but I suppose the Dublin Bank. I have sent money this way more than once. My mother acknowledged the money to New York. I have also been to another coffee-house in Whitechapel on the other side of the church, also one in Aldgate below the Italian place. I bought a Cardigan jacket in Whitechapel about a week ago also a shirt at the same time and place. I bought the coat I am wearing about a week ago in Shoreditch and paid 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it. I think I also bought the braces I have on about a week ago at the same place I bought the jacket and shirt. The knife I have I bought in Aldgate. When I took the apartments at Scarborough Street I gave the name of Gilbert I am positive that I did not give the name of Dalton."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Second statement of Gilbert, alias Cunningham, taken at Scotland Yard</hi>:—"When I arrived at Broad Street I just put my things in the luggage room and walked round. I walked some way and saw an advertisement for lodgers and I went inside and asked. I did not know the way there but found it. Having left my traps at the station I went for them afterwards. I went back the same day. I arrived here Christmas Day or the day before. I arrived at Broad Street the day before Christmas Eve. I left Lime Street about 12 o'clock and arrived here between 4 and 5. I paid 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my two packages. I took them with a cab sometime in the afternoon 3 or half-past 3. I paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the cab. Nobody helped me in with the packages. They did not ask me for my name but gave me a ticket. I don't know the number of the ticket. I have friends in Americaas I told you yesterday. I was there for about five years. You can write to the lady that I was lodging with in America 'Mrs. Crimmens' Franklin Street, five or six blocks below the Canal. I don't know of any more at present. There was a lot of stranger people. I could not tell their names. Peoples was the 'boss.' I think he lived in Brooklyn. I was paid in the dock. I worked for a man named 'Driscoll.' I don't know where he lived. I don't think it is necessary to write to any more of them. A fellow named 'Casey' was 'boss' there for some time while I was there, and Murnell or Marnell I am not sure of spelling but Peoples was the 'boss' most of the time. I brought fifteen or sixteen pounds from America. I had it in English money. I changed it there in Chambers Street Bank. I changed about sixty or seventy dollars and came to Liverpool in the name of 'Cunningham.' I know 'Stocks.' He said he was an emigration agent. He might keep a</p>

               <p>beerhouse. I did not see it. I gave the name of Gilbert because I did not think it would make any difference. I left "Stocks" house about the 23rd of the month I think and came straight here. I had my bag and there was paper outside the clothes and a brown paper parcel. I went to the 'dock' walking. I took both packages myself. Yes it is rather peculiar that Stocks does not know me. I can give no explanation of that. I gave the name of 'Gilbert.' I generally took my meals in coffee places. There were several in 'Scotland Road.' I cannot tell their names. I took my meals in Scotland Road most. I don't know the numbers but it was near the lower end. I sometimes took my meals in 'Stocks', 'bread and butter and tea breakfast. I don't think I ever had dinner there. I could get it cheaper outside. I don't know 'Dale Street.' I have seen the name but I don't know where it is. I have seen a man named 'Day' at the Alexandra Docks. I was there about a couple of months. When I went to the docks first I did not particularly ask for work from anybody but I saw the foreman and he sent me to work at once. His name was 'Day' but it might be 'O'Dea.' I saw him when he came up for the men to send them to work. I was not working there steady. He found me at the end of the 'dock.' He came up to me. I cannot tell the names of the men who worked with me at the dock. He never asked me what work I had been doing. The work was ordinary loading and unloading. I used to wear old clothes. I think I threw them away, but there are clothes at my lodgings. There are two old pairs of trousers there. When I got in the carriage I put my baggage right overhead. I took it out at Broad Street and put it in the luggage room and then I took a cab. I cannot tell you who I saw at 'Stocks'. 'I never went to church there. I have went there. I did not go to church in Liverpool. You must not believe my landlady. I left her because she was always drunk—she never used to fix my bed for me. I told you that I did not like the room. I don't know her name. I never asked her for it. I used to go in sit down generally and read. I bought the books in New York. I have also a dictionary there."</p>
               <p>Taken at Scotland Yard on 3rd February, 1885. "My name is Harry Burton. I came to Liverpool on Christmas Eve and left New York on the 17th in the name of Burton. I was known in America by that name. I cannot say who the officers were or mention the steward's name. I only knew one man who was called Harry the Sculler. The number of my berth was the number of my ticket, and I don't exactly remember it. I don't remember the quartermaster's name or any of the passengers'. If I was sitting down quietly alone and not feeling as I do now I might remember. I can take my oath I am telling you the names as far as I remember. I recollect one now—it was a young man called 'Courtney'—I think coming from America and going home to a farm in Ireland. He told me it was in the county Fermagh or close to it. I cannot remember any other names at present they are mostly English<lb/>men. I never made any acquaintances and seldom inquired about names. There was another young fellow whom I became acquainted with in New York but can't remember his name. I went across on the Alaska from. Liverpool on the last occasion but I cannot remember the names of any of the officers; feeling nervous and sick I never paid any attention to these things. Before that time I came over in the Oregon. I have only</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188504200144"/>
               <p>been two trips. I recollect that the officers were changed; that was also mentioned in the New York papers. I lived in Lower Nee Street, but only stayed there one night, and then came here for the purpose of attending St. Bartholomew's Hospital as an out-patient. I brought 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold besides a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note with me. I worked for a firm called Herman, and was directed to their factory by a man whom I met in Petticoat Lane one Sunday morning who looked like a mechanic in my own line. I have been at work there since I arrived. I came over first in the Oregon in the spring about April and stayed here till September. I was at work here when the explosions took place at the club houses and Scotland Yard. Later on in the season I went to see some public build<lb/>ings in the summer. I think I went to the Houses of Parliament at Westminster on a Saturday. I don't remember having gone to any other public buildings then. I visited the Tower of London the second week after I came here this time, that was on a Saturday, and I did not pay anything. I went with a young lady who was anxious to see it, her young man being at work during the day I volunteered my services. I don't remember her name. The young man was called Hayter or Ayter and resides at No. 13 Pulling Street. I have not been to the Tower since the beginning of January. I was at work on the day of the explosion there from 7 till 2 in the afternoon. I think it was half-past 2 before we were paid off. I am quite sure of that. My foreman is Mr. Deitz, the other is Mr. Pinmer. When I bought the trunk I was going along towards the church down Great Prescott Street in the evening. I saw a young man carrying it. I said do you want to sell that box. He said yes, and asked 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it. I said I will give you 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I then bought it, as the man said he would take charge of it till I returned. I went to the station for a cab, and I took it to my lodging, where it has remained ever since. I got it to keep my tools in, and when I bought it there was nothing inside except a few envelopes and papers. The man who sold it spoke in an English way. I should certainly take him for an Englishman. I did not take particular notice but I think he was dressed in a black coat—dark clothes. I examined the article more than the person I bought it from. I thought it was a chance for me, and did not think there was anything peculiar in buying it like that. I do not know where I was born but I think it was in Scotland Road. I have no relations that I know of in America and none in London. I have made few acquaintances except my shopmates, who are nearly all Germans. Their names, as far as I remember, are Hennecker, Neuman, Mellor, and Dicker."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). On Saturday, January 24th, I was on duty in Westminster Hall—I was then a private constable—I was just inside the crypt at 2 o'clock, that is the end nearest Palace Yard—there are a few steps at the end of the Hall farthest from Palace Yard—as you pass down the Hall the crypt is on the left hand of those steps—I was standing just inside the crypt itself when a lady called my attention to something—I think her words were "Policeman, there is one of your mats on fire on the stairs"—I went to the place she indicated, which was on the bottom Eight of stairs leading to the crypt, and saw a brown parcel with a small smoke issuing from the upper end of it—I turned it over, and it had the appearance of a lady's quilted petticoat—I put my hand on the upper portion of it and turned it over—it appeared then to have a lot of pockets—the material it was made of appeared just the same colour as the exterior, except the things that were projecting from the pockets—a light brown paper packet was sticking out from each pocket about half an inch—this (<hi rend="italic">A cake of Atlas powder</hi>) is as near as possible the colour of it—there were four pockets and four rows, making 16 in all—the parcel was about two feet long or an inch or two more, about 14 inches wide, and an inch and a quarter to a half thick—the top of it appeared to be at the bottom of the steps, and the bottom at the higher part—it was lying in a diagonal way on the steps, and that part where the band extended across, which was apparently a boot webbing, which flopped into my hand—there appeared to be a piece of elastic or something black which prevented the cakes falling out—the packet in the inner corner was about half an inch above the pocket, and the other was an inch above it, and that is why I noticed the string on that packet there was a band at the top which was like a piece of boot-webbing, and where I have made this black mark (<hi rend="italic">On a sketch</hi>) there appeared something which I had not sufficient time to see as I carried it along—that band seemed to extend five or six inches beyond the pad itself—these are rows of pockets and these are the marks of the little piece of elastic to keep the packets in—this round mark is to show where the light was coming from, but when I turned it over the light or fire and smoke seemed to extend almost all over the pad instantaneously—I think this strap is sufficiently long to go round a person's body, it is the same as goes at the back of boots, about an inch wide, and of a yellowish colour I ran up the stairs with it into Westminster Hall—it was still on fire, and</p>

               <p>some<lb/>thing hot and sticky like glue ran from it into my left hand and burnt it so I dropped it from my left hand and held it with my right; and as I got on to the steps into the little corner adjoining Westminster Hall I found it burning my hands, and threw it down—it dropped on to the little step and slipped on to the flap, and almost directly it went to the ground it exploded—I was a great deal injured and never even heard the report—I was in the hospital till March 19th; while I was there Colonel Majendie showed me a cake very similar to this produced—I think a person could have carried under his coat the parcel 1 had in my hand.</p>

Cole took it into the hall and threw it down and then the explosion took place—that was at 2 o'clock—I fell into the hole made by the explosion—I saw Colonel Majendie on 31st January—I gave a description to him of what I had seen in the pockets, and after I had given the description he showed me a cake of stuff similar to the stuff I saw in the pockets of this parcel—from what I saw of the parcel I think it could have been quite easily put round the body under a greatcoat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Chief Inspector of Explosives and have been so since 1875—on the 28th of February last I went to Woolwich Arsenal and saw the black leather portmanteau which bat been produced as having been found at Charing Cross Station-—I found in all forty-five cakes of Atlas powder A—all the packets were marked in that way—the total weight would be between 201b. and 21lb.—the slabs were about the size and shape of that (<hi rend="italic">Model packet produced</hi>)—Atlas powder A is a form of dynamite in which wood pulp is substituted for the ordinary absorbent kieselgrund—when frozen it is hard, otherwise it is soft; it freezes very easily—each slab which I found was wrapped in paper like the model produced, only that is rather whiter—they were a little yellower than the model—each slab would weigh rather under half a pound—Atlas powder A is not a licensed preparation in this country, I believe it is manufactured at the Repauno Chemical Factory, Philadelphia—it is not of any commercial use in this country—it is exploded by a detonator in the same way as ordinary dynamite—I found these slabs of Atlas powder packed round a tin box, which contained a clock, or a portion of a clock, with a pistol, or a portion of a pistol, attached with copper wire; the wire was fastened to portions of the clock which would not impede the working—the clock is what is called a "Peep-o'-day" clock—it was set to go off at a particular time; I could illustrate it better if I might have the clock. (<hi rend="italic">The clock was handed to the wintness</hi>) This is the clock, and it was arranged with the pistol as it is now substantially; then the clock winder had been turned down and fastened with copper wire, so that when the alarum went down the clock winder would come into contact with the trigger of the pistol and fire it at whatever time the alarum was set—it was set in this case to go off at 12 o'clock—in addition to the clock and pistol there were seven detonators</p>

               <p>embedded in a portion of a slab of Atlas powder, with their mouths pre<lb/>sented towards the muzzle of the pistol—the hammer had fallen upon the cartridge, but failed to explode it—there was a cartridge in the pistol loaded with powder only, a metallic cartridge—if this cartridge had exploded it would have exploded the Atlas powder in the portmanteau—a bullet in the cartridge would be unnecessary, perhaps a little in the way—the pistol was a Remington, or an imitation Remington—it had no maker's name on it—the cartridge was a metallic cartridge loaded with powder, and similar to some made by the Union Metallic Cartridge Company, Bridgeport, Connecticut, U.S.A.—I took possession of the detonators, cartridge, and clock—I caused the dynamite, with the exception of some which I retained as a sample, to be deposited in our magazine for seized explosives—on the same day in the evening I went to the Great Western Railway Station at Padding ton and saw there the small brown portmanteau which has been produced—it contained the same number of slabs of Atlas powder A arranged substantially in the same way, round a tin cash-box, similar to the one produced—inside this box were the pistol, clock, Atlas powder, and detonators, arranged in the same way as before—I took charge of these as I had done in the other case—there may have been one detonator more or less, bat substantially the arrangement was identical—it was set to go off at 12 o'clock, but the pistol had dropped so far that the handle which should have pulled the trigger caught upon a little piece of the mechanism, and it subsequently went off by itself I believe—there were ten detonators in the Paddington case—on the 26th February I went to the Victoria Station of the London and Brighton Railway—there had been an explosion there; it originated in the cloak room or left luggage office—it had done a great deal of local damage—the <hi rend="italic">débris</hi> was sifted in my presence—pieces of metal were found, and shown to me—one piece which was found before searching commenced was apparently a portion of a spring of a clock, and was similar to the springs in the other clocks I had seen—from the character of the explosion it would be caused by firing some nitro compound, such as dynamite—Atlas A powder is a form of nitro compound—had this one gone off it would have produced the appearances 1 have found—Colonel Ford examined what was found at Ludgate Hill—I cannot speak about that—on 30th May, 1884, there were explosions at Scotland Yard, the Junior Carlton Club, and at Sir Watkin Wynn's—on that night I was at Scotland Yard—I was shown a black bag which had been cut open, and some Atlas powder A; there were 18 1/2 slabs and a small piece—they were exactly of the same description I had seen in the railway portmanteaus—in one of the slabs some detonators were embedded attached to the fuse produced—it is known as the safety mining fuse; an ordinary mining fuse—attached to the two fuses were strands of cotton which form a slow match—if the cotton was ignited it would burn till it came to the fuse, when it would ignite the fuse, and that would burn in its turn more rapidly till it came to the detonator—that would be a short time, because the length of the fuse was short—a slow match burns about a yard in eight hours, and a fuse about a yard a minute—with the strands attached to this fuse it would not burn more than three or four minutes—you may delay the lighting of the fuse as long as you like by attaching a longer portion of slow match for 5, 10, 20 minutes, or even an hour—a fuse may be lighted in different ways; not easily by a match, but with</p>

               <p>a fusee or pipe-light it may be lighted very readily—it would burn shut up and does not need exposure to the air, because it contains it own elements of combustion—a slow match does not cause a very strong smell—I should detect it if burnt in this room, but it is not like the smell of a fuse—there is a very marked smell to a fuse, and smoke—there is very little smoke to a slow match—if not open to the air neither smoke nor smell might be present—I examined the scenes of the three explosions—at Scotland Yard it originated in a urinal connected with one of the offices; at the Cerlton it was in the area, and at Sir Watkin Wynn's on a window ledge above the area—those explosions had been caused by some glycerine compound—I remember the explosion between King's Cross and Gower Street on the 2nd of January, between 9 and 10 p.m.—the next morning I examined the tunnel, and also the train—I found the brickwork of the tunnel on the right-hand side of the train going west, injured, across the line of rails—there were marks of explosion on the train itself-—the train was a good deal knocked about—several carriages sustained more or less injury—that explosion was caused by a small charge of nitro com pound, which, I believe, had been fired by some form of, percussion fuse—that might be caused by throwing it from the train—it was impossible to have been caused by dropping an explosive through the grating at Gower Street—there was no means of introducing it in that way—on the 24th of January I went to the explosions at the House of Commons Westminster Hall, and the Tower—in my judgment they were caused by some nitro compound, such as slabs of Atlas A—about five or six pounda would suffice to produce the effects which I saw in each case—a time fuse would produce a similar light smoke to that noticed in Westminster Hall—the stickiness described by Cole I attribute to the melting of the tar matter with which the fuse is coated—that melts as the fuse burns, and comes down, and would get on to the hands of anybody carrying it—I saw Cole in the hospital, and he gave me a description of what he had seen—some days afterwards I showed Cole a piece of Atlas powder A from the Paddington seizure; I also showed it to Mr. Blake—on the 28th Inspector Abberline showed me a small detonator—that has been produced—I gave it to Dr. Dupré for examination; I went there with Abberline-that was a detonator that a time fuse would explode—the detonators that were found were like one another in the railway, station cases—I have specimens of each of them here—the small detonator differs from the others in being marked or stamped at the bottom with what appears to have been intended for an eagle, otherwise it is the same character—I have not come across one in this country before that was so marked—a licence is required for the importation of detonators—I have since been able to discover some like it, but not in commercial use—the others I have seen since not in commercial use were not exactly like this—I have seen one which I did not obtain in this country like this—to fix a detonator on a fuse it is pinched with the teeth or pincers—this has marks which make it appear to have been pinched or attempted to be pinched on to a fuse.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LITTLE</hi>. I have had a good deal to do with explosives used in this country and abroad, and I have a record of all the more recent explosions in this country—the London Bridge explosion was on 13th December, 1884—I have spoken of three groups of expla srons according to time and occasion, 1 have not classed them in three I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188504200151"/>
               <p>classes as regards their general character—I should class the London Bridge explosion with all these as bearing the same general character, probably a larger charge of explosive was used—it was certainly caused by a nitro compound—I have no means of knowing how it was caused, as it was partly under water, and traces were washed away—I cannot tell the method in which ignition was effected—in three of the railway stations attempts the mode of ignition was by clockwork and pistols, and I believe the same mode was used in the fourth, which exploded—I have no doubt that in the second group, Sir W. Wynn's, the Junior Carlton, and Scotland Yard, a fuse was employed, and I believe that at the Tower an arrangement similar in its main features was used, but having a longer fuse or a slow match—I would place the second and third groups together as regards the primary means of ignition, not the ultimate means—I have not heard any suggestion made that at Sir W. Wynn's the explosion was caused by throwing the explosive—I made that suggestion with regard to the Gower Street one, but Sir W. Wynn's, I think, was caused by an ignited fuse—a fuse of half a minute would be safe for any one throwing it over the area and running away—I do not think a slow match or fuse could have been lit and thrown on the under<lb/>ground railway some time before the explosion there, because the explosion had taken place a foot above the ground, and therefore the explosive must have come in contact with the brickwork, otherwise it would have taken place on the ground—the explosion at Gower Street is distinct in the method of ignition from all others in my opinion—there are several descriptions of Atlas powder; "A" is the highest and strongest quality, "B" is inferior, and "O" is lower still—it is a commercial designation, all are Atlas powder, but distinguished by letters—in October last year Atlas powder "C" was found on a Hungarian landing at Liverpool and brought to me, three detonators were taken at the same time—he gave a satisfactory explanation of it—Colonel Ford will be able to speak about the dynamite found in the Harrow Road in February or March, I was ill at the time; it was since Cunning<lb/>ham was in custody—this dynamite is used for mining purposes in America, and I believe all over the world—I do not know if that is how the Nibilists get hold of it so easily in Russia—nitro compounds are used wherever mining is carried on in all civilised countries—you can use it here if you have a licence and a police certificate, but not Atlas powder "A"—I don't remember Mrs. Sternam's evidence at the police-court—the small cheese-like fragments found at the Waverley Hotel, Great Portland Street, did not come to me, Colonel Ford or Dr. Dupré would be able to speak to them—if you were to break up Atlas powder and put it in a portmanteau in the way described it would probably leave frag<lb/>ments which would be very fairly described as "crumbs like cheese"—the date of the explosion at the Admiralty was 22nd April—I have no doubt that was caused by gunpowder.</p>

The detonator said to have been found by the police in Cunningham's box differs from the others in con<lb/>taining the distinctive mark of the Eagle—I have inquired about those Eagle detonators of the London agents of Messrs. Brown and Blewin, manufacturers, Dusseldorf—they were able to produce some recently brought to England, but not yet distributed—the source was German, but they supply the whole world—I cannot say if there is any prohibition</p>

               <p>in England as in other countries on those things; miners buy detonators constantly, you would be able to buy them in a mining district—by itself a detonator would cause no structural damage whatever—a detonator must have been employed in the Tower, because the effect was that of a detonated nitro compound—the Gower Street explosion was by some percussive action—it would be possible for the explosive to fall through an air hole on the top of a carriage and to remain there for 150 yards without going off if it was not fitted with a percussion fuse—if the fuse had burnt itself out and the explosion had taken place on the top of the carriage the effect to the carriage would be more serious, and the effect to the tunnel <hi rend="italic">nil</hi>—the bottom of the crater of the explosion from the ground was about a foot—it was opposite to the side on which the trail was going, there was a line between the train and the side of the tunnel affected—the nipped detonators would have been perfectly effective—the Peep o' Day clocks are quite a common type of clock; the American pistols are not quite so common, I was unable to get one exactly like it—you can never find any remains in the <hi rend="italic">débris</hi> if the thing is properly detonated, we found parts of a clock spring at Victoria—the length of fuse which would burn for three-quarters of an hour would be, if all fuse, 45 yards—I thought a short fuse was used at Sir Watkin Wynn's.</p>

The explosion at Westminster took place at 2.9 o'clock—that was the first, I did not hear the second—the lever of the clock had gone down and struck the cartridge, but the cartridge had mis-fired—it is impossible to tell when the lever went down—it is quite possible that the person who set the whole contrivance may have put it in that way—there is nothing to show that it was not so</p>

               <p>—I went to Harrow Road Police-station and saw some ligneous dynamite composed of 94 per cent. of glycerine and nitrate of soda—that is not so high a character of explosive as "Atlas powder A"—it does not contain so large a percentage of nitro-glycerine, but it is a very dangerous explosive—I was in the case of Reg. <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Deasy and others—as far as I recollect the dynamite in that case did not contain nitrate of soda—it was a rougher description altogether—it was made of a different kind of wood powder to that found in the Harrow Road, and different from "Atlas powder A"—that in the Harrow Road was a better kind than this, as if it had been made in a factory; whereas the dynamite found at Liverpool might have been made by an amateur—I am informed that similar dynamite to that found in the Harrow Road can be obtained from the Safety Nitro-Powder Company of San Francisco—that found in Harrow Road is not licensed for usage in this country—I saw that in the Harrow Road on 11th February, 1885, long after the prisoners were arrested.</p>

The detonator found in the prisoner's box would not do any harm to a building, no structural damage—it might go off by dropping—it is an essential part of an apparatus for causing an explosion—dynamite can only be exploded by a detonator, unless it is strongly confined in a shell—it struck with a hammer it would most likely go off—if thrown from several hundred feet high it might go off, and it might not—by essential I mean if you have it in a given place and it is essential to explode it, you would have a detonator to do it or something of a similar nature—a percussion cap would not do it.</p>

I am single and live at Miss Cannon's—I work at Mr. Taddy's, a tobacco and snuff manufacturer in the Minories—I remember Cunningham coming to reside at Miss Cannon's, I first saw him there on the Sunday after Christmas—that was December 28th—I met him first in the parlour, but did not meet him there often—on Friday night, January 2nd, Miss O'Brien went for the papers, and I saw her sell a Shamrock to Cunningham—he was reading it, and she went out to church—I remained indoors, and when she came back, about 8.55 or 9 o'clock, he was still in the parlour—he had been there all the time—she might have gone away about 9.30—Cunningham was there the whole of that time—he left the room between 10.30 and 11 o'clock, and as far as I know he went to bed—it was between 7 and 8 o'clock that I went into the sitting room that evening after my work was over, and from that time to 10.30 he did not go out of my sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He lodged at Mies Cannon's three weeks—I was in his room once, it might be a week before he left—I saw a large box there, what they call an American box—I cannot say whether it was like the, one produced, as I did not remain many minutes in the room, but it was something similar to it, the same description of box—I did not know that Cunningham was charged with being on the Metropolitan Railway on 2nd January till I saw it in the paper when the trial was going on at Bow Street—I did not know it at the time I made my statement at the Treasury—it first came to my mind that it was Friday, January 2nd, that I saw Cunningham when Mr. Quilliam came and made me and Miss O'Brien acquainted with it, I then recollected it at once; he saw us both together—I said at the Treasury on February 4th "I first saw the man, I believe, the first Sunday after Christmas"—Christmas Day was Thursday, I saw him sitting in the parlour—that is a room used for the lodgers,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188504200156"/>
               <p>especially on Sunday evenings—he was very respectably dressed—he did not speak to me nor I to him—I saw him every evening in the week, mostly in the parlour, I cannot say what evening it was—I cannot tell when Mr. Quilliam came, I did not take much notice, it was when the trial was going on at Bow Street, but I cannot tell you how many weeks ago it was—I have seen Cunningham five or six times, I usually passed the early evening in his company—Miss Cannon was in the kitchen the whole evening, she may have come up once; she was upstairs and down<lb/>stairs seeing after her place—I cannot say whether she came up while Miss O'Brien was there—the prisoner went by the name of Gilbert—no one ever called to see him that I know of—I do not know that he was doing any work or that he was employed in any way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mr. Quilliam has not offered me any money to come and make this statement—he recalled the evening by mentioning the <hi rend="italic">Shamrock</hi>, and that at once reminded me of the interview—I am perfectly certain that on the evening he bought the <hi rend="italic">Shamrock</hi> he never left the room till 10.30.</p>

He then gave as account of his proceedings in London, and as to his seeking for employment, and as to his purchase of the American trunk referred to in his statement to the police</hi>.</p>
