You must first give me the money"—I gave him the money and went back and told the firm's cashier—later in the day I went with my father to Bow Street—I remember going to the Mansion House Police Court, where from about seventeen men I picked out the prisoner—I recognised him at once.</p>

                  </hi>. Last October I was employed by the London Stereo<lb/>scopic Company in Cheapside as errand boy—I have left them now—on October 2nd I received a camera from Mr. Summers to take to Mr. Horne 4b, New Broad Street—I saw it packed; it was about the size of this one—I took it to New Broad Street, and outside No. 4b, which is a photographic shop, the prisoner met me and asked if I had a camera for Mr. Horne from the London Stereoscopic Company—he was in the street just outside the shop—I said, "Yes"—he asked me if I had the slides inside the parcel—I said, "Yes"—he told me to go back and get a camera case, and to hurry back as the customer was waiting for it, and he gave me 2d. for the 'but fare—I gave him the camera—he did not ask me for it—I asked him for a receipt for it and he signed my book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in an endorsing pencil—it appears to be, "H. Nelson"—I went back for the casc but could not get one—I was sent out to try and get one, but did not succeed—I returned to Home's, where I was told something, and I then returned to my employers—I made a complaint to the police, and on December 14th I went to the Mansion House Police Court, where I saw a number of men from whom I picked out the prisoner—I looked round and then picked him out—I cannot say how many men there were—the prisoner is the man.</p>

Any property that I find there I shall bring back and star you"—I proceeded to his address at 8, Mentmore Terrace, Hackney, with Detective Walton—he had a bed-sitting room there—I there found a large trunk which contained seven cameras and a quantity of other photographic appliances; this Lesco camera is one of them—we conveyed the trunk to the Minories police station, where I laid the contents out—I showed him this camera and he said he had bought it at Stevens' sale rooms—I took him to mean Stevens, the well-known place off Covent Garden—I said, "How did you buy it—under the hammer? Have you any receipt for it?"—he said, "No, I bought it of! a man in the room"—I asked him for the man's name, but he said he did not know—I did not ask him the price—on December 14th he was brought up on remand, and on January 11th, after his release from the Court, I charged him with stealing this camera and lens—he nodded his head and said, "Yes"—I showed him the camera.</p>

I was going to Newington Butts to look at them"—I said, "Have you any more?" and he said, "No"—I then made a further search, and in his left-hand vest pocket I found another counterfeit shilling, loose—I said, "Where did you get this one from?" and he said, "I found it; that is quite good enough for you"—I then told him I should take him into custody, and was taking him back to Kennington Lane station, when we passed the public-house where I had seen him pass on the opposite side of the road, and he said, "That is where I picked it up"—I pointed out to him that it was very wet and muddy, and was actually raining at the time, and that the packet was perfectly dry and clean—he made no reply—at the station he</p>

It is bad"—the prisoner said, "It is mine"—I said to Mr. Abett, "Give me that coin," and I took it from his hand—I told the prisoner that I should take him into custody for passing base coin—I took him outside the shop and placed my arms around him, and with the assistance of another officer conveyed him to the station—on the way he said, "I met a man on the tram at Angel Lane, Stratford. He left the packet on the seat. He said, 'Take this packet; it will do you a bit of good.' I took it and returned to Bow. I had only just started <hi rend="italic">pitching</hi> for him when you got me"—"pitching" means passing base coin—I searched him when I got to the station, and in his left vest pocket I found twelve florins done up in tissue paper wrapped round with brown paper, and two loose florins—in his coat</p>

A man accosted me whom I had seen several times within the last year or so. He said, 'Would you like to buy a bicycle?' as his son wanted to get this year's patent. I said, 'No, I have no money.' He says, 'Do you know of anyone who will buy it?' I said, 'I might be able to sell it where I am living.' He said, 'Where is that?' I said, 'Rowton House, King's Cross Road.' He said, 'I will come over with you and stop there.' We both stopped there that night. On the Tuesday morn<lb/>ing I met him in Rowton House. He had a bicycle with him and asked me to take charge of it. I left it in the parcel room of Rowton House. On the Wednesday morning, while out together, he asked me to lend him 10s. I said, 'I cannot do it.' He then asked me if I would pawn his chain. I said, 'I do not like the job.' He said if I took it in he would let me have the ticket, so that I could get it out for myself, seeing that I was wearing a black ribbon as a watch guard. On the Thursday or Friday he again asked me for some more money. I said I had none, but I might be able to borrow some. I went to a friend of mine and borrowed 15s. and I gave him 10s. deposit for the machine. He saw me arrested and got away. I can give the address where I borrowed the money."</p>

               <p>J. Davies—that letter lies been destroyed; at all events it has gone from the letter file—I afterwards received Exhibit A: "Be good enough to forward me a copy of my cousin, the late Merquis of Anglesey"—I had painted a miniature of the late Marquis, and I replied to 38, Charlwood Street, to that effect—I then received Exhibit B, making an appointment to be photographed, which was not kept—on June 22nd the prisoner came—I saw her—she said she was Lady Muriel Paget, a cousin of the late Lord Anglesey, and she wanted to see a painting of the miniature of him, and that she also might want portraits of herself, for which she made an appointment to sit the following day—she said it was very foolish of her secretary to have made an appointment for the 20th, as she knew she would be at Ascot that day—she also mentioned that there had been a motor accident in Piccadilly, that she had run into the back of an old lady's carriage, with her mother, and had upset it—at that interview she simply ordered the miniature of Lord Anglesey—she came the following day and sat for her own photograph—on July 1st, after I had sent proofs of her photograph, she came again—she ordered from her proofs her own miniature, four dozen whole plate photographs, two Cosway pictures coloured, two Hogarth frames, and a gilt rim to be fitted to Lord Anglesey's miniature—the value of her own miniature was twenty guineas, and the Anglesey pictures were to be twenty-five guineas, the rim was to be two guineas, the four dozen photographs sixteen guineas, and the Cosway pictures £3 17s. (6d.—I call myself Cosway, and my establishment the Cosway Gallery—she sat several times for her miniature; it had to be reduced—she said she had been staying at Anglesey Castle, and when she was there Lord Anglesey was always wanting to call on her, and try on her dresses, and that she used to call him "Poor Cyril"—she sent Lord Anglesey's miniature back for a glass to be fitted to preserve it from damp—those letters were all signed "J. Davies"—when I received Exhibit D of July 27th from "Hove, Portslade," I did not know that she was a nurse at a sanatorium—we addressed a letter to Portslade, end it was returned—she gave the various addresses in the letters pro<lb/>duced—we sent the goods she ordered, and the amount of our account comes to £77 7s. 6d.—it is made out to Lady Muriel Paget—I do not know anything about Wyndham Paget—I never heard that name given—we were never paid—on November 18th I instructed our solicitors to write to Lady Muriel Paget, when the debt was repudiated—on November 20th I went to 5, Churton Place, Pimlico—the prisoner opened the door—I asked if Mrs. True lived there—it was rather dark, hut I afterwards recognised her—she said she was Mrs. True—I told her she was not Mrs. True, but was the woman who had been posing as Lady Muriel Paget—she asked me to go in after I had remained with my foot in the doorway—I told her I was very dissatisfied, and that I had been consulting our solicitors and had told them to take what action they thought advisable—she said she had a perfect right to the name, because it was the name she had before she was married—she afterwards wrote from 5, Churton Place, "Since you wish for an acknowledgment of my indebtedness, I give it; I have had both miniatures, but nothing further.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">E. DREW</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). On November 24th I received the letter produced—about 9 p.m. on November 21st I went with Duggan to 5, churton Place—I left him outside—I found the prisoner in the first floor back room, sitting on the bed, and a man in the uniform of the Army Hospital Corps—I told her I believed she was Sirs. Prebble—she said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190602050032"/>
               <p>"yes" and pointing to the soldier, she said, "He is my husband; he knows nothing about it"—I said, "You must have heard your landlady tell me you were not in"—she said, "Yes; I told her to say I was not in"—I said, "I have a warrant for your arrest on the charge of obtaining two miniatures and other portraits from Esme Collings, Limited," and I then signed for Duggan to come into the room—the prisoner then said she had got them downstairs, and she would hand them to me—when Duggan came in he recognised her as the woman who had personated Princess Soltykoff—the rest of the conversation has been related by Duggan—she went downstairs and pointed to the top of a cupboard in the kitchen, in which were found two pawn-tickets relating to miniatures in an envelope which was sealed with sealing wax, and with a crest, a coronet, and a "P" similar to that used on the letters written by the prisoner in this case—she was taken upstairs and the warrant read over to her—we began to search the room—she said, "I do not know what made me do it; I must have been mad"—she was afterwards taken to Vine Street police station and charged—she was taken before the Magistrate the following morning and remanded two days, during which time the letter produced came to me, dated November 24th, in which she states, "I never told Mr. Cosway, I am sure, that I was Lady M. Paget, or at least that I was the person he speaks of; I stated it was my name like I could take yours if I did not claim to be you"—on December 13th the prisoner was charged in this case—from inquiries it was ascertained that she had obtained goods from Debenham &amp; Freebody—when the charge was read over to her, she said, "The whole of the things came after I left the asylum, and were in the hands of the railway company for some time, and when I did get them about a month afterwards I gave them all away. I know who I gave them to. One was Mrs. Smith, of Arundel Square, one the landlady of Charlwood Street, and I think I gave the blouses to Miss Hall, the landlady's daughter at Churton Place."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in her defence on oath, maintained that she had a right to call herself Lady Muriel Wyndham Paget, that name having been given to her by Major Paget, who had made her an allowance, and paid her bills for her; that she did not falsely personate Lady Muriel Paget, as her stated relationship with the late Marquis of Anglesey, with whom Lady Page admitted she had no relation, showed; that she had got none of the goods by false pretences or fraud, but that she could not get proper accounts, nor even all the things she was charged with obtaining; and that she could not recolled all she did in consequence of having acquired a habit of taking drugs, vodka and stout, in her trouble at the loss of Prince Soltykoff, to whom she had been married, when, believing him to be dead, she was afterwards married to Prebble in the name of, not Lena, but Nina Margaret Stolterfoht to hide her identity.</hi>

I am a Doctor of Medicine at Cricklewood—about 12.30 a.m. on January 16th the prosecutor was brought to me—he had a cut across his throat from two and three-quarters to three inches long, and he had lost a good deal of blood, but there were no large arteries severed—it was three-quarters of an inch deep—I disinfected the wound and sewed it up—he is now entirely out of danger—he was able to attend the Police Court on January 18th.</p>

Go and fetch Dr. Morrow"—he said, "I will fetch him myself," and went out—I did not see him come back, as I had gone to my brother's place—when Daniel went for Dr. Shaw father kept saying, "It was only a tap"—I went to fetch my brother Eugene—mother had generally been in good health; she seemed to be quite strong—on this day father seemed to be sober, and so was mother—mother had not been nagging him; she never answered unless he prompted her and made her answer; it was <hi rend="italic">him</hi> nagging her all day.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner at Bush Hill Park—on Sunday, December 24th, about 4.15 p.m., the prisoner came to my house and asked me to go to his house to attend to a cut on his wife's head—I asked him if the cut were a bad one and he said it was not—I then asked him, if the cut were not a bad one, could his wife not come to the surgery and have the wound dressed there—he said she would not come—I asked him how she got the cut and he said she had been getting on to him in the afternoon and he had been cleaning a tool</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190602050040"/>
               <p>for his work and gave her a tap on the head with it—I asked him if he had been drinking and he said only a glass or two of beer—he went away and I followed him to his kitchen, where Mrs. Cosgriff was—it was a bed light and a dark room—I asked for a light and the prisoner lit a small lamp—I examined Mrs. Cosgriffs wounds and found a wound on the right-hand side of her head, almost at the top—I cleaned, dressed, stitched and bandaged it up—the next day I went back to have a better look at it in the daylight—I removed the dressings and found a considerable quantity of clotted blood on the left side of the head about three inches from the first wound on the other side of the head; it was further forward over the frontal bone—I washed the clots away and found a wound, which I dressed temporarily—I examined her skull and found two small pieces of broken bone at the bottom of the wound on the left side—I advised that she should be taken to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first wound went down through the scalp; it was between a quarter and half an inch deep, and the second wound was about the same depth, rather deeper, perhaps, about half an inch—this hammer has a sharp blade and is very heavy—a blow struck with this sharp edge on the head would crush through into the brain; it would almost cut the head in two and certainly cause instant death if it entered the brain any distance—if struck with violence it would go several inches—a hard blow from this blunt end struck with two hands would probably crush the skull in considerably, and might cause instant death.</p>

I am senior surgeon at the Tottenham hospital—Mrs. Cosgriff was admitted there on December 25th, about 4 p.m.—I saw her about 5 p.m.—I examined her—she was conscious and did not complain of any pain, but she was sick once—on examin<lb/>ing her skull I found two rather small wounds, one on the left side near the forehead and the other on the right side a little further back—in each of them the bone was depressed—in my opinion an operation was neces<lb/>sary, and I performed the operation of trephining about 6 p.m.—she lost a great deal of blood from one of the wounds, which made her very low at the time, but she soon rallied, and by the next day she was going on satisfactorily—we felt no anxiety about her till December 31st, when she was decidedly worse—she died on the early morning of January 9th—from my examination of the skull I do not think any great violence had been used to cause the wounds—this hammer is extremely heavy—the violence of the blow would depend very much on the way it was held—if it was held with one hand at each end, as one of the witnesses showed, it would require more of a blow, but if it was held away from the head the weight of the hammer would have been sufficient to have caused the wounds—I do not think they could have been caused so readily</p>

I have a right to bum them if I like; they are my things in my own house. I gave the caretaker notice that I was going out on Saturday. I was getting rid of my things when somebody came"—I told him I should take him into custody, but he made no reply—when charged with setting fire to the dwelling house he said, "Who told you that is a liar"—he was drunk all the time.</p>

You ought to have come at 8. As it was a special I intend to do it myself. I shall go to the shop and may fetch some work"—he then left—Mrs. Libovitch then came in and said to the prisoner, "We are very slack now; it would be better for you to look after another place. We have not enough work for ourselves"—the prisoner then took his pair of shears from the table, put them in his pocket, went into the kitchen, and all of a sudden I heard screams—Mrs. Libovitch ran into the kitchen, screaming "Murder!" the prisoner following her—I tried to stop him and he stabbed her three times with the shears—Police Constable Garrod then took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner</hi>). I have been for fifteen years in the employ of C. &amp; J. Weldon, of 130, Cheapside—for the past twelve months I have been first salesman in the silk twist department—I have known Kerner about two years through a friend of mine in the City, who used to do business with his brother—his brother is a tailor's trimming merchant at 81, Berwick Street, Oxford Street, on his own account—I have disposed of silk to the prisoner from early in 1905—I took silk from Messrs. Weldon's premises, sent it to my home by a carrier, then took it to a cloak room and then wrote to "Mr. Kerner," the prisoner's brother, making an appointment to meet him—the prisoner would meet me cutside the Tube station in Newgate Street and I would give him the ticket in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190602050045"/>
               <p>return for money—the first time I said, "I have silk for sale; are you open to buy?" he said, "Yes, I will give you 8s. a lb. for it"—I accepted that and told him I had 5 lbs. and that I had left it in the Lud<lb/>gate Hill cloak room—he said, "Here is the money; I will give you 8s. a lb. for it"—he accepted my statement and paid me there and then and I gave him the ticket—on subsequent occasions I have sold him from 2 to 5 lbs.—I got it out of the firm's premises generally by sending it by a carrier to my home, but sometimes I have sent it by one of Messrs. Wel<lb/>don's porters to the Post Office Tube station—I never directed the letters to Noah Kerner, but only to "Mr. Kerner" at 81, Berwick Street—I have disposed of about twelve parcels of silk in that way during the last twelve months—I have handed the ticket to the prisoner's brother on about two occasions—no bill or receipt were ever given—on December 30th, 1905, I sent a parcel of 5 lbs. of silk by carrier to my home and took it to Ludgate Hill cloak room on the following Tuesday morning—I wrote to "Mr. Kerner" to meet me at 5.30 opposite the Tube station in Newgate Street that night, and the prisoner met me—I told him I had 5 lbs. of silk for sale, and that it was all right—he paid me £2; I gave him the ticket and he left—I invariably met him outside the Tube station in Newgate Street alone—my firm made inquiries of me and I wrote a letter of confession on January 9th and was taken into custody on the 10th—on the 9th I met the prisoner in St. Paul's Churchyard and he told me he had been arrested with silk in his possession and was out on £20 bail—I have not seen him since—I never mentioned Cannon Street station to him, nor was that the station I ever used for putting the goods in—I was committed for trial and I have pleaded guilty to this offence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On January 10th, when I was arrested, I made a statement that I left the silk at Ludgate Hill cloak room on the Monday—that was true as far as I could remember at the time—I have heard that the prisoner is eighteen years of age and is employed by his father at a restaurant, but I did not know it then—I thought he was assisting his brother—I was not with the prisoner when he was arrested—I started in Messrs. Weldon's employment as a young lad, have been promoted, and was receiving £10 a month as first salesman—I was in a position of trust—I have been robbing them since the early part of 1905—it was a lie when I told them I had only robbed them once—I do not say I negotiated the sale of this stolen property with this young lad—I wrote to his brother, and his brother sent him—all my dealings with the prisoner were that he received the cloak room ticket and handed me money, on every occasion except two, when I saw his brother—the bargain or the nature of the transaction was not discussed with the prisoner—I was introduced to his brother by a friend of mine—the introduction was not an ordinary introduction; he was pointed out to me as being a buyer—I wrote to him and he sent the prisoner down—I told the prisoner on each occasion the quantity the cloak room ticket provided, and he gave me the amount of money on the scale which I had arranged with his brother.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Sergeant, City</hi>). About half-past 5 on January 3rd I was in Newgate Street—I noticed the prisoner Kerner and another man about the same age, not in custody, loitering about and acting sus<lb/>piciously—they were about twenty yards from the General Post Office Tube station—the prisoner left the other man three times and rejoined him again; then the prisoner went into the Tube station and returned with a parcel like the one produced—they walked down Warwick Lane towards Ludgate Hill—I followed them up with the intention of stopping them—the other man apparently saw me and ran away—I stopped the prisoner and said, "I am a police officer; what have you got in that parcel?"—he said, "I do not know"—I said, "Who gave it you?"—he said, "A man gave it me"—I said, "What did he tell you to do with it?"—he said, "He told me to take it to Cannon Street"—I said, "What part of Cannon Street?"—he said, "Cannon Street station or any other station"—I said, "Well, how are you to know where to meet him, then?"—he said, "Well, he told me to take it away, put it down anywhere"—I said, "I shall take you to Snow Hill police station, where you will be charged with the unlawful possession of it"—at the station I opened the parcel and found it contained silk sewings, about 5 lbs. in weight—he there repeated the statement that a man told him to take it away and put it down anywhere—he was taken to the Guildhall Police Court and remanded until January 12th, when in consequence of Hosegood's arrest he was charged with him at the Mansion House for stealing and receiving the property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner gave his address as 28, Berwick Street, Oxford Street, a restaurant kept by his father—I have ascerta ned that he has been working there as a waiter—has father has been there some seven years, and the prisoner has been here since he was seven, and hat had a board school education—so far as I know, he has borne the character of a decent and well-behaved lad—the man with him was a stranger to me; it was not his brother—his brother carries on business at 81, Berwick Street—he was bail for the prisoner—I took the prisoner on the Wed<lb/>nesday evening—I gave the conversation from memory; I did not take notes—he seemed startled when I seized him—I am quite certain he said, "The man gave it to me and told me to put it down anywhere"—whether that is reasonable or not, that is what he said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single and live with my father and mother at 68, Robert Street, Hampstead, and am seventeen years old—I have known the prisoner for just over two years, and in 1904 I had a child by him, and once or twice since he has been intimate with me—on December 29th, 1905, I went to the theatre with Ted Harvey, who is my young man I am walking out with now—on that day I left him about 11.30 or 11.45 p.m.—I had not seen the prisoner at all that evening—after leaving Harvey I went to bed in a room where I sleep alone—I was roused during the night; I think it was about 1.30—my attention was first attracted by seeing the window being pushed up by the prisoner—after he had opened it he came in through the window and crawled on his hands and knees to the bedside—he did not speak before he got to the bed, but when he got there he called me by name, "Louie"—I said, "What do you want?"—he asked me what did the young man mean by saying he would knock the top of his hat in—I said I did not know what he meant—I knew he meant Harvey by the young man—he said, "Will you come away with me this minute?" and I said, "No, I will not"—he said, "I will help you to get your things out and I have sold my business and have got £15 in my pocket"—I said I would not go—he said, "If you do not have me you will have nobody else"—I could see his form in the dark, but I could not see his face—when I said I would not go with him he said, "You won't?" and seized me by the throat, I think with his left hand—I turned over on my left side and screamed out—I next felt something sharp go across my throat, and I put my right hand up to my neck and my fingers got cut—I was also cut on my left side and had a slight scratch on my right shoulder—I had not seen anything in his hand—the wound on my left shoulder was very deep—my father and mother came in just as the prisoner was going out by the window—he did not say anything more before he went through the window—about two months before Christmas I had stayed with him at 77, Graham Street, but I cannot remember anything that he said to me then.</p>

I live at 45, Cadogan Gardens, and am a member of the Guards' Club—on October 10th last I was in the smoking room of the club about 5 p.m. and remember drawing a couple of cheques—I know Leonard Caffrey as a waiter in the smoking room, but I cannot say if he was the waiter in that room on that day, because when I wrote the cheque my back was towards the waiter, and I was facing the window—I first rang the bell and sat down at the writing table, and the door opened—I looked to see if it was a waiter, but did not look at his face and I said, "Bring me Cox's cheque book"—the cheque book was brought while I was still writing—I took out a cheque, which I wrote for myself for £10, to be cashed in the club, and the waiter went away with it to cash it—the second cheque I put on the writing table in front of me, but I do not think I filled it up then, but I did fill it up for £30 to Mr. J. H. Saunders—it is an order cheque, not crossed—I always put my initials and the date on the counterfoils of cheques with the amount—I believe I did so on this occasion, and I also put "Paid" on the counterfoil, as we pay a penny for each cheque—I finished writing my letter and put the £30 cheque into the envelope and posted it in the letter box which is kept in the smoking-room—there was no one else in the room, and I then left the room and went down to the front hall, where I met three other members who asked me to come up and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190602050054"/>
               <p>play a rubber of bridge—we returned to the same room about ten minutes after I had left it; no one was in it when I came back—we called for cards, which were brought by the smoking-room waiter, and we played bridge for about an hour and a half—I think I left the club about 7 p.m.—the letter box is similar to this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—next day I left town and returned on the 16th and went to the club on the 17th in the morning—I found no acknowledgment there of my cheque to Mr. Saunden, and I left town again by the 2.22 p.m. train, returning on October 20th, when I went to the club in the afternoon—I still found no acknowledgment of my cheque and I had heard by then that Mr. Saunders had not received it—I sent for the secretary of the club and an inquiry was instituted for the counterfoils—all the counterfoils which could be found in the club were produced, but I could not find the counterfoils of these two cheques—I found one of a cheque which I had written since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was alone in the smoking room when I rang for the waiter, and he came and handed me the cheque book—I cannot remember if that book was nearly exhausted, but it was not the first cheque in the book which I took out—I tore out the two cheque forms; the books are in fifties—the numbers of the cheques which I tore out were 582847 and 582848, so there would be two forms left in the book—I would not swear that I filled up the counterfoils, but I always do so and I always pay the waiter for the cheque forms at the time I take the cheques—when the waiter returned and brought me the change I was still writing my letter with my back to the door, and I think the other cheque was lying blank in front of me—I think I should finish my letter and then fill up the cheque—the waiter then left the room and would not know what I was going to do with the cheque—I should think it was then 5.5 or 5.10—I had nothing else to do in the smoking room besides write the letter and I should think I left the room about 5.20—I have no idea how many members would be coming in and out of the room while we were playing bridge, but the club was very empty that night at that time—I do not remember the boy coming in to clear the letter box while we were playing bridge, but I should probably have noticed him if he had.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Guards' Club and Leonard Caffrey has been a waiter there since March, 1901—he was the smoking and card-room waiter—in October last we obtained our cheque books from Cox's bank, some with their name on and some without, what we called a plain cheque book—they were supplied to me and I handed them out to the two head coffee-room waiters, each of whom would have a Cox's cheque book and a plain cheque book, which he would get from me upon paying 4s. 2d.—the only other waiter who would have a cheque book would be the card-room waiter, who would have books exactly the same as the head coffee-room waiters—when Caffrey was not on duty his two cheque books would be still in the smoking room at the disposal of the smoking room waiter for the time being—up to that time they had been lying in a drawer in the morning room, which is just below the smoking room, so that any waiter could get them if asked to—the waiter would fetch the cheque book if it was wanted in the smoking room—I issued the cheque books to the smoking room waiter, and other waiters had access to them, so if a morning room waiter wanted a cheque book he would not go to the smoking room waiter and ask him for it, but would go and get it—we cashed cheques for members during the day and got them changed every morning into notes and gold—these notes, 61199 and 61200, never came to me from Cox's—the coffee-room waiter would cash cheques, but the morning-room waiters and the others would have to go to the coffee-room waiter to do it; they have no money—the coffee-room waiters have £200 a day to work upon, supplied by me, and when the money came from Cox's in the morning it was all brought to me—Leonard Caffrey's days on duty would be two long and one short, the long day being from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. next morning, and the short days would be from 1 to 2.30 p.m. in the afternoon, and then he would come on to help from 7.15 to 9 or 9.30 p.m.—October 10th was a long day, October 11th a short day, and October 12th a long day—on his long days he would not be assisted by anybody in the smoking room, but was the sole smoking and card-room waiter—about 5 p.m. the other waiters would be very busy, the morning room being more or less full at that time, so they would not have time to help Caffrey—this (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is the letter box from the smoking or card room, and I have suc<lb/>ceeded</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190602050056"/>
               <p>in getting a letter out of that box quite easily without unlocking it—it is kept in the smoking room, locked, and the page boy goes round and clears it and has a key for the purpose—he puts the letters in a bag and takes them away—on October 20th Sir Francis Corbett spoke to me and I called for the cheque books to look through them—on the morning of the 21st I saw Leonard Caffrey and asked him to produce the counterfoils of the cheque book from which the two cheques had been taken by Sir Francis Corbett—he told me the counterfoils had never been kept and that the counterfoils of that particular book had been destroyed as well as others in the usual way—I looked through the counterfoils which were available, but could not find those—on October 20th I found a cheque book which was then in use in the smoking room with some counterfoils in it, as well as cheques (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), but it did not include the cheques drawn by Sir Francis Corbett—it would be quite possible for the smoking room waiter to have the end of one book and also a new book in use at the same time—this cheque book (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 8) is probably the cheque book next before the one which is missing, but I might not hand the books out in their proper order—members very seldom fill in the counterfoils, but I was surprised to hear the counterfoils had not been kept—the system at the club was intended for the convenience of members, so that they could get a cheque and cash it—I do not think the question of fraud occurred to anybody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Leonard Caffrey was entitled to two cheque books, one of Cox's and one blank one—there were two waiters in the morning room and hall named Herman and Jarman, but I have never issued a cheque book to them; they would get it from the coffee-room waiter—I would issue a cheque book to any waiter in the club if he gave me 4s. 2d., provided he came from the head waiter or the coffee-room waiter—when Caffrey was off duty I think Jarman or Herman would take his place—if one of the other waiters came to me and said, "The smoking-room cheque book is out and Caffrey is not in, will you give me one?" I should do so—if Jarman came to me and said he wanted a cheque book and gave me 4s. 2d., but said nothing else, I should give him one—as far as I can find out, all the cheque books which have been used in the smoking and morning rooms are kept in the morning room—nothing has gone wrong before this—for the whole five years that Caffrey has been employed at the club, cheque books which he had access to, as well as the other waiters, were, I believe, kept in the morning room, but I cannot tell if that was so before I entered the service of the club last May—from my inquiries that has not been departed from until I issued directions in consequence of this trouble—the morning room waiters would use the same books as the smoking-room waiters—these (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are the counterfoils of the book which was in use on October 20th—I have looked through it on several occasions and I should say about two-thirds are quite blank and a lot of the others have only got "Paid" or an initial—as a matter of record they are practically useless—the coffee-room waiters have made a practice of keeping their counterfoils, but they cashed cheques, the head waiter acting as cashier—if a member dining at the club wanted some money, he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190602050057"/>
               <p>could get a cheque from the coffee-room waiter, hand the cheque to the waiter and get the cash, so the waiter would get the cheque back and see the name and could fill in the counterfoil, but in the smoking room the member tears out the cheque and fills it in himself—on October 20th Caffrey was off duty, it being his short day, and he was away when I was making inquiries, and the waiter who was then on duty in the smoking and card room was one of the morning-room waiters and was present when I went into the room—I saw Jarman and Herman together and asked them for the counterfoils and they told me at once it had never been the practice in the smoking or morning rooms to keep the counterfoils, and I believe up to that time there had never been instructions that they should be kept—the waiters had to account to me in the first instance fox the value of the stamps on the cheques, but so far as I was concerned that was an end of the matter and he had to get his pennies from the members as he could—it was before I saw Caffrey that I was told the counterfoils were never kept—when I saw Caffrey it is possible that I said that I had been told counterfoils had been destroyed and asked him if it was true, and I told him in future he had better keep them—it appeared to me to be an irregularity to throw them away, but when I came to understand the thing more clearly I do not admit that it is an irregularity—I think it is very likely, having seen the numbers on the cheque showing that only two more would be remaining in the book, that the book would become ex<lb/>hausted on the 10th, so there would be ten days for the book to be finished and to be thrown away in—there is' nothing in the fact that two cheque books were in use at the same time, as the waiter would never allow one took to run out before he applied to me for another—if a member having dinner desired to pay for it then, he would pay the coffee-room waiter, and he might do so in gold or note, and the waiter would keep the note until it was necessary to pay it into the bank, or if a member wanted change the waiter would give it to him—there is only one boy to clear this letter box until 8 p.m., when he goes off duty—the staff in the club is thirty-three, and I should think about a dozen would be on duty at the same time—the thirty-three includes housemaids; there are about a dozen men altogether—on October 10th the waiters would be about the club between 5 and 6, and in addition to them at that time members would be dropping in before dinner.</p>

I did not have anything to do with him and came out and got into a tram"—I do not remember his saying anything which took place with the girl in the post office—he said, "I got into a tram and a man followed me in and said to me, 'Won't you have this note? It is perfectly all right' "—I said, "Who is this man?"—he said, "He said his name was Scott, and as he appeared to be a respectable man I took the note from him and gave</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190602050062"/>
               <p>him the gold"—I said, "Do you know where that man lives?"—be said, "He gave me a card with Warham Road on it. I do not remember the number"—Warham Road is nearly opposite No. 18, Grand Parade—I said, "Have you got that card now?"—he said, "I think I have it in my other clothes," and he went into another room and shortly after<lb/>wards returned and said, "I cannot find it; I must have destroyed it"—I said, "You had better endeavour to find it, as this note was part of the proceeds of a forged cheque"—I then went away—at that tune I did not know that he had a brother who was a servant at the Guards' Club—next day I went to the club and saw Mr. Evans and had a con<lb/>versation with him, and went back that day with him to 18, Grand Parade, and again saw Algernon Caffrey—by that time I did know about his brother and I said to him, "Have you communicated with your brother?" and he said, "Yes, I wrote to him last night"—I said, "Is your brother in?"—he said, "Yes, I think so"—I was speaking to him in the shop and he went out to the private door by the side and opened it, and I saw his brother in the passage—I pointed him out to Mr. Evans and asked him if that was the man employed at the club as a waiter, and he said, "Yes"—I said to Leonard, "Your brother has been found dealing with a £5 note which is part of the proceeds of a cheque which has been stolen and forged belonging to Sir Francis Astley Corbett of the Guards' Club"—he said, "I do not know anything about it. It seems to me my brother has been made a dupe of by someone who has got a grudge against me"—we then all went back to the Guards' Club, where I asked Leonard for the letter his brother had written to him, and he handed it to me (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Dear Len,—You will be surprised to hear that I have had a visit from a detective to-night. You remember I told you some time ago that I went to Finsbury Park Post Office to get some £5 notes for gold. A man there in the shop offered to let me have some, which I told you I refused on the advice of the girl behind the desk, but I never told you that I afterwards accepted on meeting him in the car on the way home, because I thought you might think me a fool for doing so, but I did, and you see what a mess I have caused by so doing. The detective told me the note was stolen, and, therefore, I am under sus<lb/>picion for changing it. Do not tell anyone, as he told me to keep it secret. The fellow gave me a card with Scott, Warham Road, on it, but nobody lives there of that name, so it must have been false. Trusting it will end satisfactorily, I remain, Your Affec. Bro., Alg. I am keeping my eyes open for the blackguard, so I am quite an amateur detective. N.B. Splendid trade this week"—I made inquiries at Warham Road and looked up the local directory, but could not find anybody named Scott there—the prisoners were charged at the police station and Leonard said, "Absolutely not guilty," and Algernon made no reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have made inquiries respecting both the prisoners and find they are both highly respectable young men—I have ascertained that in addition to his duties at the Guards' Club Leonard had saved money and carried on a laundry business at Harringay with his brother, which, I should say, is a fairly good one—they have let off a portion of the premises</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190602050063"/>
               <p>there, and although the rent is £130 a year they receive about £120 from tenants—one of the tenants, a doctor refused to give me any information, and I do not know if he pays his rent monthly; I believe the others pay weekly—the prisoners have a receiving office at Holloway—I found that the person who had tendered the £5 note had done so at a post office im<lb/>mediately opposite his place of business and had given in writing his correct name and address, "A. G. Caffrey," so probably he must have known if there was any question about the note that it could be traced quite easily—Algernon said at once that he had been to Finsbury Park Post Office to get notes for gold, and I think something was said about the young lady behind the counter there, and on the way to the station at Algernon's suggestion we went to the post office—last Session I said, "He said that the girl behind the counter at the Finsbury Post Office told him that she was glad that he had not taken the note of the man," and that is correct—it was in consequence of that, that I went to Finsbury Post Office with him, and the young lady said she remembered such an incident; she could not swear what man, but a man had called there a short time ago and wanted notes for gold—I do not think she said any<lb/>thing about being glad the prisoner had not taken a note from another man—I heard that young lady called at the request of the Recorder last Sessions; she was not called for the Prosecution at the Police Court—the statement made by Algernon was quite frank and there was no appear<lb/>ance of concealment, and he went with me to the post office to look at the directory to see if we could find Scott of Warham Road—I asked him if he had communicated with his brother previous to receiving that letter, and he said he had—the person named Rushton, whose name appears on the back of the note, was in England at the time of the Police Court pro<lb/>ceedings, but she was not called as a witness—I told Algernon that he had better keep his mouth quiet and look about for himself, as he was in a funny predicament.</p>

I am a salesman to Mr. Stanley Wylde, who carries on business in the Central Meat Market as Wylde &amp; Sons, butchers—on January 4th last a Mr. Brook brought the prisoner to me—I had not known him before, but I knew Mr. Brook some years ago as a butcher—he in<lb/>troduced him as a purchaser of his business, and said that the prisoner had paid him a deposit on it and they had come to London to complete the sale—the prisoner said he could do with two sides of beef—Brook looked at the beef and then went out of the shop—the prisoner asked me the price of the beef—I told him 3s. 4d. a stone—he picked it out with skewers—the sides were quartered and weighed—the prisoner went to the desk—the</p>

               <p>clerk told him how much they were—I was called to the desk—the clerk said, "This gentleman has tendered a cheque and cannot give a reference in the market"—I then asked the prisoner if upon presentation of the cheque at the bank at Southend it would be met—he said I had no need to fear that, "I have hundreds of pounds at the bank and I am a large moneylender at Southend"—he handed me a card—he said that he was in the habit of lending large sums of money to different hotel managers and that he wanted the meat for them—I went outside to Brook and came back and told the clerk to accept the cheque, which was for £14 8s. 7d.—it, was paid into the bank the same day and returned on January 8th—is has never been paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> But for what I was told when I went outside the shop to make inquiries, I should not have accepted the cheque—Brook had a butcher's shop in Essex Road—he looked at the beef before the prisoner picked it out—Brook did not choose it—I do not know, as a matter of fact, that the prisoner is a moneylender's agent—he new mentioned any names—I learned subsequently that our meat was sent to Brook's place—I did not know it at the time—it did not at the time strike me as funny that a moneylender, who was introduced by a butchet, should pick out the meat—I do not know who filled the cheque up.</p>

I want a sovereign for the ticket; I will go with you and pay the interest, and if you are satisfied you can take it out"—the prisoner said, "All right"—I went with him to Fisher's, paid the interest, and showed him the ring—on the way there he said he was a big buyer, that he had bought the Pavilion Theatre and had got a lot of property in Southend, where he lived; also property in Poplar—he looked at the ring—I said, "The stone weighs over a carat; the ring is well worth the money, and any time you like I will return you the money"—he said he had not got cash; he would give a cheque—the pawnbroker refused to accept a cheque—I said, "It does not matter;</p>

                  </hi>. I have carried on the business of an antique dealer at 18, Burlington Street, since June 25th—Mr. Graham, a friend of mine, brought the prisoner down to me and told me that he might be a great deal of use to me and be able to sell things for me on commission—nothing</p>

               <p>was done at that interview—the prisoner came again a short time after that, and he came several times between that and the end of August—he always examined my stock—some time in August he came in and picked out a pair of Sheffield candlesticks which he had seen before, and asked me to allow him to take them away to show them to someone—I allowed him to do so—he took them on sale or return—they were never returned—they were worth about £2—he called between that and September several times and I asked him if he had sold them—he said, "I cannot say positively, but I will let you know in a few days"; he always put it off—on September 15th he saw a diamond necklace of mine worth £110, the price then asked for it being £125—he said if I would allow him to take it down he thought he could sell it; he had a friend, a diamond merchant, called Brodie, who he thought would buy it—I believed him and let him have it on the condition that he brought it back the next day—about three days after, he brought it back—he came again and asked me if I had sold it and I said, "No"—he said, "Well, may I take it again? I do not think I can bring it back to you to-morrow"—I said, "Yes, on condition that you retain it to me in three days"—he took it away—at the end of three days he came in and asked to be allowed to keep it for three days more, and I agreed—he did not come for several days, so I wrote to him more than once for it to be returned at once, but he never replied—he came in eventually and told at he had sent it to a friend in the country—I told him he had no right to do that without my permission and he said he would get it back at once—he did not come back and I wrote to him several tunes—he has never returned it nor accounted for the money—he called in October and inspected six Sheffield plate candlesticks—I asked him several times about the necklace—I allowed him to have the candlesticks for a special purpose; they were to be sent to Mr. Simmons, of Orchard Street, and returned on the following morning—the necklace was still supposed to be in the country—up to that time I supposed him to be honest—Messrs. Simmons are well-known antique dealers, and he told me they were great friends of his; he had previously told me he was going to bring Mr. Sim<lb/>mons down to look at some pictures I had—subsequently to his taking the candlesticks he called again and began to make excuses about the necklace and other things, and he said I should have them back the next day—the six pairs of Sheffield candlesticks were worth £12—on October 30th he came in and said he was going to write to Mr. Simmons and get them back—that was the last lot of goods he got from me—I brought an action against him in the High Court and got judgment against him, but nothing came of it—after that I went to see Mr. Simmons, and in consequence of what he told me I communicated with the police and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

The capture of lobsters, crabs, pawns, shell fish, etc.; in general, all kinds of fishing"—lower down it says, "Profits. We have here two means of securing profits, each of which being a source of income capable in itself of providing for the 12 percent., leaves sufficient margin for a big bonus"—a little further on: "Ships are always divided into sixty-four shares, no matter the size and value of the ship"—lower down: "A registered ship or a share therein may be made a security for a loan." "To further develop the business 12 per cent, mortgage bonds are being given to Investors. The mortgagees thereof enjoy also a monthly bonus. The preference will be given to those investing the largest sum"; then come, "Rules and regulations for mortgagees to secure principal sum, interest and bonus"—No. 1 is, "By South &amp; South-West coast it is understood that the fishing is mostly carried on from the mouth of the Thames to Valentia"—3, "The mort<lb/>gagor will be the present manager of the syndicate, in whose name the ships are registered, and who alone has power to mortgage them. All sums to be invested are paid to the mortgagor in person"—5, "The mortgage must be on a ship, propelled by steam of no less than 60 tons gross register and no less than 99 feet long. It will include all boats, fishing gear and all accessories on board, or housed on shore"—6, "Each month the profits are shared for the previous month's work, and share sent as bonus to the mortgagee, together with interest calculated at the rate of 1 per cent, per month"—9, "Each £25 invested by the subscriber to the following form of application is represented by a mortgagee of one share in the ship mortgaged. This must be a first and only mortgage and the share or shares thus mortgaged can in no way be mortgaged to any other investor or in any other way. The future mortgage of other shares than the one or those applied for on following form can in no way affect the said shares, either in percentage a year or in amount of estimation of share"—15, "The manager is bound to follow up the fishing by being present, or near the fishing grounds, unless otherwise engaged. He will from there be in communication with the investor when neces<lb/>sary"—further on it says: "To estimate future profits we go by profits of the two last years. The year 1903 gave £293 5s. per £50 invested, The year 1904 gave £320 5s. per £50 invested"—with that document there was another document described as the "Half Yearly Report to Holders of Mortgage Bonds or Mortgagees entitled to Interest and Bonus according to Article 8 of Rules and Regulations"; it is headed, "First Six Months of Third Year" (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 4)—it says: "Gentlemen, I am happy to report that the cumulative interest and bonus due to entitled mortgagees for the month of June last is £28 5s. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per £50 invested. This sum, added to that of the five previous months, makes a total of £183 17s. 9d. for the first lit months of the present year (1905). This shows a steady increase</p>

               <p>compared with the year 1903, which was for the whole year £293 5s. and 1904, which was £320 5s. per £50 invested"—on the back then is a note as to their inventions (<hi rend="italic">Extract read: Stating that their invention were attracting considerable notice, and obtaining flattering press opinions and splendid reports from scientific sources; that their contrivance for saving life in cases of drowning was predicted to have a world-wide use; and that the manager wished it to be understood that in many instances he was only lending his name; that others deserved the honours, and their investors a fair share of profits</hi>)—it says farther on: "It is hoped the present mortgaged will invest part of their interests in same 12 per cent, mortgage bonds, though I know that in most circumstances they require their money for other purposes. In any case they may know that a few more bonds an now available, the invested money to be secured by mortgages at 12 per cent, a year, with bonus, according to Rules and Regulations"—that is dated July 1st, 1905, and is signed, "The manager, W. Davenport"—there was also enclosed a blank form of mortgage (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 5), having on the top, "Prescribed by H.M. Customs with the consent of the Board of Trade. Form No. 11"—then there are spaces for the name of the ship, whether a sailing or steamship, and then follows a form of contract by which the mortgagor covenants to pay back the principal advanced with interest and as security share or shares in a ship are given, the mortgagor covenanting that the share in question is free from en<lb/>cumbrances—there is a note at the bottom: (g) "If any prior en<lb/>cumbrance, add, 'save as appears by the registry of the said ship,'" and there is a note at the side: "The prompt registration of a mortgage deed at the Port of Registry of the ship is essential to the security of the mortgagee, as a mortgage takes its priority from the date of production for registry, not from the date of the instrument"—I find printed in red in my mortgage after it was issued: "Registered (blank) day of (blank) 1905, in the offices of the South &amp; South-West Coast Syndicate, Steamship (blank) registered as fishing boat," and so on—I also received Exhibit 6, which purports to be a copy of extracts from different papers headed "Press Opinions"—this is an extract from the "Sunex Advertiser" (<hi rend="italic">Read: Stating that by joining the revenue expected from sale of royalties, fishing and business connected with same, the South &amp; South-West Coast Steam Trawling &amp; Fishing Syndicate were able to offer a fixed interest of</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">per cent, a year; that substantial security was given on one or more steamships and that the sum one ship could be mortgaged for was limited to a very low figure; it followed, therefore, that the investment were pretty safe</hi>)—this is one from the "Mercury" (<hi rend="italic">Read: Stating how mortgages could be obtained on ships which secured the interest as well as the principal sum; that special forms were issued by H.M.

               <p>who was able to influence them a good bit, and who could get some good investors—on the next occasion that I saw Davenport he introduced him to me as the Reverend Mr. Moyle—that was after I parted with the first sum I invested—Moyle took no part in persuading me to join—on one occa<lb/>sion afterwards I went to the office and found Davenport out, but Moyle was there—in a general conversation we had he said he hoped the business was all right, as he had got influential friends who wanted to invest in it—I said I hoped so too—he handed me this visiting card: "Rev. V. H. Moyle (Minister) Pembroke College, Oxford, 2, St. Stephen's Square, W." (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 23)—the addresses are in ink—on one occasion I asked Davenport how he disposed of the fish, whether it came into London, and he said it was sold at ports of call—the first return I got for my investment was on September 4th, when I received this letter, enclosing a postal order for 10s. and a paper (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 13, <hi rend="italic">read: Enclosing P.O. for</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">being at the rate of</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">per cent, per year; and that he expected he</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Walton</hi>) <hi rend="italic">would next month have full bonus; that he hoped very shortly to write him about a good piece of news, and enclosing a paper which he might keep, Signed</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">W.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MUIR</hi>. I cannot name any promise Davenport made that he did not fulfil—I have no idea why the police came into communication with me; it was before Messrs. Blandford sent the postal money order, so it could not be through them—I have been no party to any civil proceedings—from my careful reading of the prospectus I understood that the company would not only deal with fishing directly, but promote companies to do so—I had experience in dealing with shares—I cannot say how many years I have been investing in shares in public companies; not many cases—sometimes I have made a good investment and sometimes bad—I have not prosecuted the people with whom I invested money and lost it—this is not my prosecution—I know sometimes very large profits are made from promoting companies—I read in the prospectus that one of the appliances that this syndicate was dealing with was a special kind of trawling net—I did not go to the Fisheries Naval Exhibition—I was given to understand that there were models there to be seen, but I had no knowledge of what was there—I heard this from Davenport, and I could have gone and seen it if I had liked—he told me that Moyle was there explaining the apparatus, amongst it being this so-called life-restoring apparatus—what was said about that life-restoring apparatus had no influence on me as far as investing my money was concerned—I believed the statement, "The business of the syndicate is dealing with appliances directly or indirectly connected with shipping and fishing and promoting same"; Davenport added nothing to that—I thought well of the photograph of the propeller, but I have had no means of verifying it; it influenced my mind at the time—I thought it was likely to save money—I do not think I heard the evidence of Mr. Cubbin at the Police Court; I did not stop after giving my evidence—I thought the idea of feeding animals on fish was a good one, but I do not know if it was carried out; it may have been—I thought it was in an experimental stageem as regards my money, I looked upon the mortgage deed as security at good interest; I was not paying particular attention to the profits—£ looked at the blank form of deed that was first sent to me; it had no red printing, and I noticed that upon that the mortgages took rank in the order in which they were registered—according to the deed, the repayment of my principal is not due—everything that has become due has been paid to me up to the time of the prisoner's arrest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, of Imperial Buildings 39, New Bridge Street, which is close to Ludgate Circus—I have known Moyle for some time past as a customer—he came in the summer of last year, bringing with him a number of documents which he left with me to read, at my leisure—one of them was a prospectus similar to this (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 3), a document similar to this half yearly report (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 4), and "Press Opinions" (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 6)—I understood him to say he was a bondholder and that the syndicate had been very successful as far as he was concerned, and that he had the whole of his amount back again from the syndicate in interest and bonuses—I heard that more than once—I believed what he told me and the state<lb/>ments in the papers which he left, and I handed him a cheque drawn in Davenport's favour for £50, dated August 10th—I do not know that when I handed him that cheque that he told me the amount he had invested at that time, but they had been very successful so far—my dealings with Davenport were entirely through Moyle—Moyle gave me a receipt (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 96): "Received of Mr. Oldfield cheque for £50 for one mortgage bond in the South &amp; South-West Coast Steam Trawling Fishing Syndicate of £50 for Mr. Davenport, with thanks.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOMBE</hi>. My first interview on this matter was August 10th—I had known him as a fairly regular customer for two and a half years—I understood he lived at St. Stephen's Square, Westminster—he did not volunteer any information what he was doing down in the City, and it was not my province to ask him—they were all cash transactions I had with him—he did not tell me he was employed by the syndicate—he told me personally that he had invested money in it, which had helped him with his charities—he also told me that friends of his had invested, and he mentioned the name of Mr. Sheriff Bowater, which considerably influenced me—I have seen Mr. Bowater, and he told me that he was an investor—Moyle said he was a vicar in some parish in Berkshire, and I assumed that it was Berkshire that he was referring to—I think he did tell me what he invested, but I would not like to say for certain; it seems uppermost in my mind that it was £50; I think he told me so himself—whatever I said at the Police Court, I say now—I said then, "He did not say he was going to invest if he came into some money"—I am most emphatic that he told me he had invested, and the same statement was made when I introduced him to a gentleman on my premises who would have nothing to do with it—he he is not coming here to-day—he told me he got a commission for inducing persons to invest, but I am not talking about that when I say he told me he had an interest in the matter—I read the papers before Moyle spoke to me about the matter in detail: my mind was not quite made up then—what went to make up my mind were partly statements in the papers, and partly his statements, and partly the fact that he told me Mr. Sheriff Bowater and his other friends had invested—I learnt from him that the syndicate would have some interest in certain trawling inventions, life-saving apparatus and so on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am not quite certain whether he told me he had pro<lb/>cured Mr. Sheriff Bowater to become an investor; I fancy that he had myself—this gentleman whom I introduced him to asked Moyle if he was satisfied with what he had invested in the concern, and he said he was perfectly satisfied—the gentleman evidently was not, because he did not invest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the Rev. Mr. Carlyle, of 5, Camden Grove, Kensington—in August I saw an advertisement in the "Daily Mirror" similar to this advertisement in the "Daily Chronicle" (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 106, <hi rend="italic">read</hi>): "£1 a day and 12 per cent, a year for each £50, withdraw able deposit.

Prospectus free. Write Dept 9, South Coast Syndicate, 156, Stamford Street, London, S.E."—I wrote to that address and in reply I received a number of documents, amongst them being Exhibit 41a, which purports to be a prospectus, "Fifth and Last Issue, September, 1905" [<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Signed</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">V. H. Moyle</hi>")—I do not remember that I noticed in particular he signed himself "Rev. V. H. Moyle" in Exhibit 111; I knew he was a reverend gentleman—that influenced me, because my husband is a clerk in Holy Orders—I went to the Naval Exhibition—I saw Moyle and said, "If I wish to put more money in can I see the balance sheet?"—I meant my solicitors really—he said it had always been in the hands of the syndicate and that I could not see it—he said he had seen it—I understood he was a member of the syndicate, but I cannot remember what it was that made me think so—I had a request from Davenport to send my bond in, and on November 8th I wrote, enclosing it (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 118, <hi rend="italic">read: Enclosing bond to be registered, and stating that she noted from his letter that</hi> £7 10s. <hi rend="italic">was due to her for October, and that she would be glad if he would send her that amount by Saturday</hi>)—on October 31st I received this letter from Moyle (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 120, <hi rend="italic">read: Stating in reply to her letter of the 30th that as she was already a mortgage bondholder every consideration would be shown to her by the managing director, Mr. Daven<lb/>port, and that the company would be registered during the coming months; that the balance sheet was the property of the syndicate members only, and they kept to that rule, and generally as to a scheme for providing cooked fish tor the poorer classes, and asking to give his kind regards to</hi> "<hi rend="italic">Mr. C" Signed</hi>, "F. <hi rend="italic">H.

When I wrote the letter of November 8th, returning my bond to be registered, I did not notice that the red ink form on it had not been filled in—the bond is dated at the end, Sep<lb/>tember 11th, 1905—the red printing is filled in with the date of November 18th [<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>them—Moyle was dressed as a clergyman then—my reason for investing was that I thought there would be a fair interest and some bonus; I did not expect such a large bonus as they promised; I expected that some months it would be less and some more.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOMBE</hi>. I saw Moyle twice, once at Earl's Court and once at my house—at Earl's Court he spoke principally about the syndicate—he repeated what he had written me—he told me he was working for the syndicate in explaining the life-saving apparatus, and I was there when he did lecture—he lectured for about ten minutes—he illustrated from this Japanese doll the artificial respiration which could, be brought about in a person who was apparently dead—I do not re<lb/>member the particular leaflet, where it said that if a person was actually dead he could be restored to life; I cannot say whether they were on exhibition there at all—we also had a conversation on various things not connected with the models, and on the work the syndicate intended to do, and of the idea of the syndicate's to sell snacks of fish to poor people in London—I cannot remember that he explained to me he had been interested in various charities in the country—I remember him saying that he was particularly interested in the humane aspect of the proposal to sell fish to poor people—I thought he had money in the syndicate; he did not tell me he had—he did not give me the impression of being an employe—I do not know if he was paid for this lecturing work—he was twenty minutes at my house when he came to see me—in any mention he made of the syndicate he might have referred to Davenport, but I do not remember that he said Davenport—I do not think he talked about Davenport and the syndicate more or less indiscriminately—I cannot be sure that he did not tell me he was in the syndicate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Police Surgeon to the H division—on December 3rd I saw Constable Clarke at the police station about 12.15 a.m.—he was then in considerable distress, apparently from injuries to his abdomen—he complained of contusions about the position of the navel and on the right elbow; his puise was 108 per minute—I saw him to his-house and visited him the next day—I was sent for the same evening before his removal to his house because he had had a fainting fit—he was removed to his house on an ambulance—on the 4th he complained of pain in passing water—his abdomen seemed sensitive, though less than it had been—on the 5th he passed a motion with streaks of blood in it—I did not see it, as his wife threw it away, forgetting my instructions to the contrary—on the 7th he passed another motion with some half-digested blood in it, which I did see—he then made progress as I thought, and I put him on duty again, but he was unable to remain on duty, as I happened to see him in the street and could tell that he was quite unfit for his work, therefore I sent him to the head sergeant—he has practically been on the sick list over two months—his internal organs had been injured and probably the intestines—you do not find bruising in the abdomen, because there is no hard surface behind to injure, but only soft tissues; that is to say, no bone except at a very great depth—about 2.15 a.m. the same day I saw the prisoner Clarke, who was suffering from a lacerated scalp wound on the left side on the heads an inch and a half in length—it was a typical truncheon wound—I examined Cole also: he was suffering from contusions about the shoulders and a contused eye which had been inflicted some time before I saw him, and when I saw him at 2.15 he told me that his black eye had been inflicted earlier, but was made worse in coming to the station—a black eye changes its colour, but I inferred from what the prisoner said, and the appearance</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know the six or seven men, but I knew Clarke's voice—there was no argument—I did not attend the Police-Court—the prisoner Clarke asked me to come here—I made no com<lb/>plaint; I simply went home after I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it done—there was no assault on the constable; he ran away—he walked out from the road to the pave<lb/>ment—when he went into the butcher's shop he was not injured to my knowledge—I did not see anybody hit the constable or kick him in the stomach; I only saw him go into the butcher's shop—I saw no one on the ground.</p>

I am a butcher, of 49, Carr Street, Stepney—on Sunday, December 3rd, about midnight, when I was about shutting the door of my shop the policeman ran in; I shut the door and shut him in—I did not know him—that is the man (<hi rend="italic">Constable Clarke</hi>)—he asked me for permission to go out through the back, and I sent my man with him to show him the way—I went afterwards and saw him get through a window, which is about 7 feet from the floor, and there is a copper about 3 feet high—he got on the copper and out through the window by himself—there is no glass in the window; it is open like a skylight to let light into the back—I cannot say what drop there is outside; I have not looked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the door when the constable came—it was open, as I had not shut up the shop—it had been open all day while business was on—nobody was with the unstable—plenty of people were in the street—I cannot speak to the character of the neighbourhood, as I am a stranger—when the constable got into the shop he did not sit down; he asked for permission to get out; he asked the way—I snowed him the way out at the back—about ten minutes afterwards another constable came and I shut the door, because I did not want any more in.</p>

He did so, and found nothing but a box of matches and a key. He took me into custody and shouted to the sergeant, 'Claim that man.' These two men were walking down the other side.

A friend of mine has arranged to take them if he can get them all at once"—the prisoners said, "You will have to come with us to Ludgate Hill, as we have borrowed money on the consignment notes"—we went to the King Lud in Ludgate Hill in a van which was going that way—Ward went away to get the consignment notes, and brought one back, like this produced—I pointed out that there must be some mistake, as no 26 sacks could weigh 4 tons—Bendall said that must be a mistake of the clerk, and that that would be put right at Paddington—after we had settled the bill Bendall said, "Give my friend the money," and I gave Ward £2 13s. and another 1s., as he said, "Let me have 1s. for a drink"—Ward went away, and I never saw him again till I picked him out at the Bridewell—when Ward had gone Bendall wanted to get outside, and I said, "I think you have had me, but where you go I am going"—he took me to Ludgate Hill Post Office—I got a message from Paddington—I discovered it to be a swindle—I said I would give Bendall in charge, and I called a constable and gave him in charge—I have learned since that these consignment forms hang up at railway stations for the convenience of consignors.</p>

I have made inquiries, and find that Bendall has a very good character—his bail was £20 and a surety of £20, which was immediately forthcoming—I made inquiries of a man named Bow, who stated that Ward had approached him a few days previously, and offered to sell him corn, and that Row stated that he had introduced Bendall to a publican in Fetter Lane, and that Bendall after some time promised to find him a customer for the oats, and upon that statement, and that of Mr. Moggridge, we obtained a warrant for Ward's arrest—a great deal of assistance has been given to the police by Bendall, whose statements have been corroborated in every detail.</p>

               <p>where I stopped five months, and I had a still-born baby there—after that I went to the hospital—I had not been out of the house for some time, but as I had no money I was compelled to go, and he came and saw me off by the tram—the father of my child was the prisoner, and no other man—he wanted me to do several things that were wrong and bad, but I would not; I was frightened for my life—when I came out of the hospital he told me that the marriage at Brixton was illegal, and not a real and true marriage, and that it would be good for me to have a real and true marriage—he went out one morning, and when he came in he said, "Little one, get up; you can be married to-day"—I said, "Married? I have not got any breakfast yet," but he told me that the marriage at Brixton was not legal, and a priest came, and said, "You must come and get married," and I went and got married at Rathmines Chapel, a few yards from where I lived—after that I went to several apartments; then I went to Liverpool and returned to Dublin—after that I came to London again and lived at 190, Alexandra Road, Kilburn—that was about five months ago, I should say; I do not know—the prisoner came there several times, drunk—one night he was as drunk as ever, and he walked backwards—there were some papers lying on the table—I said, "What are those?"—he said, "Those are the divorce papers, little one. Listen: I do not get any except divorce papers"—I said, "Divorce! For what?"—he said, "I was married before I married you; read them through. I am going to be arrested to-night"—I said, "Arrested to-night?"—he said, "Yes, my first wife is going to have me arrested; a detective is after me, and at any minute I may be arrested"—I said, "I will go and give you in charge now"—I went to open the door, and he dragged me back and said, "You bitch," and cut my head, and swore, and said everything against me he could—the next day my head was bandaged—I had been crying all day, when he said, "My little one, I must see a man to-morrow," and he said that he would tell me every<lb/>thing, that he had arranged to get some money from his brother, and that it would be settled—he got some money, and he sent the papers off, and I do not know what he did—there was no quarrel, but he threatened to take my life at Dover, when I said I could not live with him, and he would not give me any money to go to Ireland—he had a razor, and caught me by my hair, and pulled me down—I said, "Do not kill me," but he opened the razor to cut my throat, and I said, "Remember, Fred, murder is never hid; you will be hung," and he dashed the razor against the floor and did not speak, and I was on my knees, crying all day—the next day he went away and left me, and I did not see him again—I did not hear from him, because he was afraid, but I had a few telegrams—after that I went to the police station and told them there that he was a deserter from the Army, that he had committed bigamy, and all I knew about him—I waited at Dover till I saw my brother, when I left Dover, and came to London, and I went straight to the police station—I have been in service some time, but first I went to the Salvation Army, who took me in, as I did not know where to go, and was in debt.</p>

C. R." or "K.," we could not make out which—I believed he came from Vander &amp; Hedges, or I would not have sent the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Henry Street, Battersea, and am a labourer—on January 10th I was at Barnes with Charles and the prisoner—we knocked off work about 12 to go to dinner, and while we were having it, sitting in the mess room, someone threw a lump of bread which hit me in the eye—I got up and accused the prisoner of throwing it and we had a few words and he struck me in the face and knocked me down—Charles jumped up and told him he ought to take my part more than hitting me, and the prisoner said he should throw the work up and see Charles to-night and then he went and drew his money—he said that before 7 o'clock he would be in the South Western police station, as he meant to have brains to-night, but he did not say whose—at 5 p.m. I came out of Clapham Junction railway station, where we had arrived by train with Charles and Mr. Cox—as we were walking across the road we heard a terrible thump on Charles' head and he fell at our feet—as he fell I saw the pri<lb/>soner run past us with this chopper (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in his hand—this (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is the hat Charles was wearing—I followed the prisoner as far as I could in Falcon Road and then I left off running, and the next I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> of him</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon of police at Batter<lb/>sea—directly after 10 p.m. on January 5th I went to the police station and examined Lowery—I found that his fifth rib on the left side was fractured, and around the fractured place there was a swollen, red and recent bruise—the sounds of his heart were very feeble and whistling, such sounds being given off from a bruised heart—he was very faint and appeared weak, so I ordered him on the sick list and sent him to bed—I examined him the next day, and attended him up till the 19th—the next day, the 6th, he started spitting Wood from a lung which had been injured through the fractured rib; the bag of the heart called the pericardium became full of blood, owing to the inflammation set up from the bruising of the muscle of the heart, and caused pericarditis—the heart became glued to the pericardium, causing what is called adherent pericarditis—in consequence of this gluing the heart has to do extra work, and the muscle of the heart became thickened—in consequence of this thickening of this muscle of the heart the left cavity of the heart has now become dilated or stretched—in consequence of this dilation or stretching of the heart the valves of the heart are also stretched and now cannot work in their proper position, and the consequence of that is hypertrophy of the heart, which is a very</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JENKINS</hi>. From £40 which he said he paid for the bay mare to £18 he sold it to me for, did not seem to me a big reduction, because he said the mare had had an accident and had got a big leg—nobody could help seeing that; one leg was twice the size of the others—when I said he had better let me have it back again I wanted to see if I could not get it to work, and I was rather busy and I wanted it—I had satisfied myself it was perfectly hopeless, but I wanted it back because I did not see any likelihood of any other horse coming; I was doubtful of getting my money back—I could get the horse to take an empty trolley backwards and forwards to the station at times and I wanted it till the other one came—it was no good for anything else—it would only pull an empty trolley all right at times—I cannot say if it was a <hi rend="italic">green</hi> horse—my idea of a <hi rend="italic">green</hi> horse is a horse that is turned out into the fields, or a horse not broken in—according to the prisoner this horse was four years old—the roan mare is still in my stables and has been there since the 3rd of last month—I have had it out day after day in a coal trolley, not always empty—on a hard road it will pull a ton, but as soon as it gets on a soft bit it will stop dead—a good many horses will do that if they are overloaded perhaps—a horse of this description ought to pull two tons, but it has not got the heart to do it—I never started any civil proceedings for this money, because the I.O.U. said till January 18th—I went to the police and made a complaint of my own accord before I got the roan mare, about January 1st—I swear that Gillan never came to me first—after I had been to the police station Gillan did not come and ask me to give evidence as regards my one—they said when I went to the station they could not see the case was clear and I went away—I did not see Gillan; I saw the officer in charge behind the desk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn merchant, of 149, High Road. Streatham—on Tuesday, January 9th, the prisoner came to my shop and said that he had heard I had a horse for sale; his man saw one working in one of Mr. Bell's carts—he had heard that Mr. Bell had not bought it and asked if it was for sale, as he had heard it was a good puller—he said he was a carman and contractor and he had a lot of work for horses in chains, pulling-out work—I said the horse was a very good puller—as a matter of fact, my reason for selling it was that it was too free for the pair-horse work that I had bought it for," and consequently it would be just suited to a single job, where it would be pulling out of shoots—I gave him my card and he gave me his business address as 48, North Road, but he said he had not enough accommodation for his horses; he was having another place altered for him—he said he had three or four hones all the time in the chains, pulling out—horses in the chains would imply that they would be pulling at a cart to assist the horse in a difficult position—I said the very lowest price I could take for the horse was £26, and he said no doubt he would buy it; the only thing that remained was, would I be contented to let him have a day's trial; he had heard a very good account of it and he was satisfied with that, but for his own self he would like to see it—I let him have the horse, believing that he was a carman and con<lb/>tractor, and that he had several horses working in the business; I would not have allowed it to go but for that—I sent it by a man to Tooting the following morning—I received a telephone message later in the day from the prisoner, saying that the horse had not turned up quite to time and he was afraid he should not be able to give it a trial that day—that aroused my suspicion, and later on I was communicated with by the police, who said that the man was not what he said he was, and they went afraid I had made a mistake.</p>

You have known me a number of years. I will tell you where I got the horse from. I got it from a corn merchant at Streatham. I told him I was a large carman and contractor and had several horses working chain work, and was doing a big job"—on the way to the station he gave me Mr. Keevil's card and said, "That is the owner of the hone. Let me take it to the owner; it is all right"—I went to see Mr. Keevil and he got his horse back again—when the charge was read to the prisoner he said, "I did tell Mr. Keevil I was a carman and contractor"—I have known him for five years and during that time he has never done any carman or contractor's work to my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Bluett said before the Magistrate</hi>: "Between the 2nd and 4th I am charged with breaking and entry. At the station I gave no address because I did not want it known because of my relations. On the Mon<lb/>day and Tuesday before Christmas I was working on the Barnes Local Board, and it took me three-quarters of an hour to get home from when I was working. After having my tea I came out between 7.30 and 8 on the Monday night. On the Tuesday I arrived home at 7.30 and came out after my tea at 8.30. On Wednesday morning I went to work without any breakfast, having no food all that day. I finished work on the Friday morning. On the Saturday, between 1 and 6, I was in a shop just outside St. James Park station, where I bought some things, and arrived at Rich<lb/>mond between 7.30 and 8. As for breaking and entering, I have no more to do with it than you have. On the 2nd and 4th of December I was at home at the time that this breaking and entering occurred." <hi rend="italic">Baller said</hi>: "On the Saturday night, the 2nd December, I met Thomas Houston at the Station Hotel. He said, 'Are you going to have a drink?' I said, 'Yes.' I said, 'You have got some money, <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> you?' He said, 'I have got a couple of shilling.' I kept in his company till 11 o'clock. We then came out of the Station Hotel and went down home. I got up on Sunday about 2 o'clock, and soon after a soldier sent round for me to go and see him because he was going back to Jersey. I went round and saw him and we went up the town together and had a few drinks till 3 o'clock. We then went home again and had dinner, and I stopped in till about 6.30. I then came out and went and met him again, went up the town again until about 10 o'clock, and then went home and went to bed. I got up next morning about 10.30 and went up the town, and outside the Station Hotel I saw Thomas Houston. He said, 'Fred, come</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190602050132"/>
               <p>with me. I will get you a couple of shillings.' I said, 'Where to?' He said, 'Twickenham.' We went together to this pawnshop and he showed me some clothing which he said he was going to pawn. We made up a parcel and pawned it for 10s., came back to Richmond and took two suits and pawned one at Mortlake for 13s. He then said, 'Come up to King's Gross and I will do the other suit in.' I said, 'No.' I then met the soldier and saw him off at the station about 9 o'clock p.m. and then stopped in the station till 11. On Monday or Tuesday before Christmas I met a man and said, 'Do you know anybody that wants to buy some clothes?' He said, 'Yes, if they are any good,' so I took him and showed him two waistcoats and two over<lb/>coats. He said, 'I know a man who will buy them.' I said, 'Is he safe?' He said, 'He is all right. I have sold him things before.' He took these things to Tiller's house. I said, 'Ask him 25s. for them.' He took them to his house and we went to the theatre to see Tiller. Tiller gave the man 3s. I said, 'We do not want this in dribs and drabs; we want it in a lump.' He said he would give me half a sovereign on Saturday and the rest on Monday. We then went up the town and he left me. Bluett has nothing to do with it. I saw this man on the Saturday. I said to him. 'Have you got that half sovereign?' and he said, 'No, I have not sent it.' I have not seen him since."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Bluett, in his defence on oath, said that he had had nothing to do with breaking and entering these premises; that on Monday, December</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th, he met Batter, whom he had known three years, who told him that he had several lots of clothes to sell and asked him to procure a purchaser; that he sold some to Tiller for</hi> £1, <hi rend="italic">portions of which he received at different times, receiving a small sum for himself; that he was a had carrier and he had been in constant employment when his health, which was bad, permitted him to be; and that he had no reason to suppose that these clothes were stolen property.</hi>

I am a labourer, living at 36, Clifton Crescent, Peckham—on December 19th last I was in the Fox and Hounds, Peckham, about 8 p.m.—I went away and returned again about 10.30—I remained till closing time, 12.30—I played a game of "coddem"—whilst doing so the prisoner came in about 10.50 or 10.55—he threw out to the company a challenge for him and another one to play the winners of the game—I replied, "You will?"—he said, "Yes, I'll play you for half a <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> if you like"—I asked him where he got his money from, know<lb/>ing he had been out of work for some time—he said, "I get my money the same way as you do: work for it"—he then said, "You have not got all the money; who are you?" and two or three other remarks—I lost my temper, got up and struck him; it was more of a slap than a blow—it was done with the open hand—the landlord came on the scene, told me to sit down, and ordered the prisoner out—as he went out he turned round to me and said, "All right, Matt., I have got this for nothing. It won't end at this; I'll have my own back"—at closing time me and two more friends came out—I then went to the urinal at the side of the house by myself—I saw the prisoner leaning against the corner of the house as I passed him—that was about 4 or 5 yards from the urinal—he was by himself—nothing was said by either of us—I had not got more than two steps past him when I felt a blow, behind my right ear—I did not see the blow struck—I remember nothing after that till I saw a man named Moore strike a match, asking me how I felt—I do not know how long afterwards that was—I was taken to a doctor and afterwards sent to the infirmary—I am still an in-patient—I have known the prisoner a good many years.</p>

I am the landlord of the Fox and Hounds, Peckham—December 19th was the "share-out" of our slate club—I remember the prosecutor being there—I cannot say what time he came in; it was about 8 o'clock, I believe—I saw the prisoner there during the evening—I cannot be certain of the time—he was there at 11.30—there seemed to be a row going on in the bar—the prosecutor was in a threatening attitude—I took him by the coat and told him to come into the room and told the prisoner to go home—he said, "All right, but don't forget you can't take these for nothing "; at the same time, pointing to an old scar on his chin, and turning up his lip, he showed a small mark inside the upper lip—it appeared to be a fresh mark—he turned round to walk out, but before he went he shouted out to Evans, who was in the tap room, "Don't forget, Matt, it won't end like this"—he then went out—about 12.10 he came back and said to me, "Is Matt still there, Fred?"—I said, "Yes, he is still sitting in the room; do you want him?"—he said, "No, it doesn't matter; it's all right"—he seemed to be quiet and cool—he drank up a glass of ale and went out again—he was about five minutes in the bar that time—I shut the house at 12.27—the prose<lb/>cutor, who seemed to be perfectly sober, and the others all went out—the next thing I knew was someone knocking on the window and asking for water—I went out and found they were just bringing the prosecutor round; he was smothered in blood—I got a cloth and handed it to some<lb/>body, who bathed his head—this was in the yard where the urinal is—I was handed this chopper and took it inside—I saw no blow struck—About 3 a.m. on the 20th the prisoner knocked at the bar window—I opened the door, when he said, "Don't you think Matt got what he de<lb/>served?"—I said, "I don't know anything about it; I think you are a silly little fool, and you had better get off home at once"—he went away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the prisoner came into the bar the second time I did not say to him, "Hullo, Bill, who has done that to your face?"—I am not mistaken—I noticed an old scar on his face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The scar was on the chin and had healed up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 78, Bridson Street, Camberwell—this chopper is my property—on December 19th the prisoner came to me at 11.30 and said, "Will you lend me your chopper?"—I said, "Yes, my boy"—he has been in the habit of borrowing it for chopping wood—he was not drunk—I noticed nothing wrong with his face—the Fox and Hounds is About five minutes' walk from my house—the prisoner lives near me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at 9, Bridson Street, Old Kent Road—on December 19th I was at the Fox and Hounds about 9 o'clock—I stayed there till 12.30—the prosecutor was there when I arrived—the prisoner came in about 9—the prosecutor and three more were playing "coddem"—the prisoner said he would take the winners—Evans</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190602050135"/>
               <p>said something and the prisoner said, "Yes, I will play you for half a <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>"—Evans asked him where he got his half <hi rend="italic">quide</hi> from—he replied the same as him: worked for it—Evans told him to take his half <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> somewhere else and to shut up—the prisoner said he could not shut him up—then Evans lost his temper and struck the prisoner, I believe twice—the landlord came and pulled Evans back and told the prisoner to get out of the house—the prisoner came back to the room and, pointing to his chin, said, "I got this for nothing and I am not going to take the other for nothing"—he then left—we remained in the house till closing time and then left—Evans asked me to wait a minute while he went round the corner—he went and I heard him speak to another man and then he shouted, "Oh"—I went round and saw him in a helpless con<lb/>dition leaning on the window-ledge with his two hands round his head or his ears, and blood running down—I asked him who had done it—I then turned round and saw the prisoner with something in his hand; I could not see what—he was in a threatening attitude—he ran at Evans, and I caught him by the throat, and another man came and knocked him down—I suggested to Evans to go to a doctor—I do not know what became of the prisoner—Evans asked me to find his cap, which I did, and also the chopper, which was lying there—I gave the chopper to the publican.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say Evans was in the public-house about three and a half hours—he did not have a good deal to drink—I am friendly with both the prosecutor and the prisoner—I never heard of people being "down" upon the prisoner—I heard that he had had a row with a man and got a cut over it—the prisoner began the trouble in question by wan<lb/>ing to join in the game—Evans was the first to use violence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant superintendent at the Greenwich Union Infirmary—shortly after 3 a.m. on December 20th I admitted the prosecutor to the infirmary—he was in a semi-conscious condition—he had four incised wounds on the scalp, one serious one being behind the right ear—the bone of the scull had been pulverised and pushed right in—this chopper might have inflicted the wounds—it was surprising that the injury behind the ear did not do more than render him unconscious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Evans smelt of drink—"smell" is a question of degree—a small quantity of drink will smell the same as a large quantity, especially of four ale—I should say he had been drinking beer.</p>
