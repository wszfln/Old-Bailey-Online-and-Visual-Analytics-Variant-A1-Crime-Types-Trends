Mr. Crause said there was 2 l. 7 s. deficient; he was searched, but nothing was found about him besides a knife; I sent home my son, with information, to make my family easy.</p>

               <p>Did you see them again that day? - Yes, I told my husband, when he came in, they went away, and my husband was coming down the gateway; one of the prisoners beckoned him, with that I was in a great fright; I did not like the looks of the men.</p>
               <p>Did they return to your house after that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What time of day might this be? - About twenty minutes, or half past four; they then came again, and I called my husband; he came out of the parlour, and said what do you want with me; says they, what do not you know us; he said no, and if they did not go about their business, he would send for somebody that should make them; the prisoner Watts said, he had borrowed a shilling of him; I was inside the shop; I did not see where the other stood; I had seen them peeping backwards and forwards before the other came in; my husband declared to me in their hearing, that he had never seen them in his life.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure these are the men? - I am positive sure they are the two men that came to our house on that occasion, that I am positive clear in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130005"/>Mr. Scott, Prisoners Counsel. What is your husband now by profession? - A milk-man, and green-grocer for seven years.</p>
               <p>He was obliged to retire from his business a little while, I believe? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>What was the cause of that? - A little misdemeanor between him and me.</p>
               <p>Has not he been at Bethnall-green? - Yes, he was in the private mad-house a little while, and I wish I never had done it; he staid three weeks under the care of Mr. Bowman.</p>
               <p>You recollect his going to the play on the 26th of October last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How long is it since he came out of that private mad-house at Bethnall-green? - I will shew you Sir. (Produces a receipt, the 12th of September, 1785.) He was going on the 27th of October last to the play, to see the same he had seen the night before.</p>
               <p>What company was he in that night at the play? - A Gentleman, a clerk to the Custom-house, whose name is Dell.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Dell here? - No; but if you will give me time I will have him sent for.</p>
               <p>Did not your husband mention any other company? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What time did he come home? - About eleven, on the 26th of October.</p>
               <p>What particular observation did you make as to the persons of these people, you say, you seemed a good deal surprised at the time? - I was Sir, because my husband never drank.</p>
               <p>Were they dressed as they are now? - Yes; with dirty shirts.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the examination of your husband in Bow-street? - No, Sir; I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Was you there when he gave his testimony? - I was only sent for by Sir Sampson to know whether he was in Bedlam, I said, no; he asked me no farther questions or else I should have told him; I put the receipt in my pocket on purpose.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have never paid any thing to Bethnal-green since the 20th of September, 1785? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason to believe since that, that your husband has been disordered in his mind? - No, Sir; not in the least; he went out about eight to the play with Mr. Dell, and the next night he was to go, and see it all full; he came home about eleven.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hardy. At the time that you say Watts came to your house, what distance might I be at that time? - I cannot say; at no great distance; you was down the arch way.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did I stand when you first saw me? - Not quite two doors off my house.</p>
               <p>Was it to the right or left of your house? - To the left.</p>
               <p>When you was fetched to Bow-street, who fetched you? - Mr. Tallboy the constable.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - Sir Sampson wanted to see me about Bedlam.</p>
               <p>When Sir Sampson asked you whether your husband was or was not charged with insanity, did not you say he never was in any mad-house, or in Bedlam? - No; the word mad-house was never mentioned.</p>
               <p>Did not you say it was his two brothers and not him? - I did say he had two brothers in Bedlam through drink; but they are well now.</p>
               <p>Did you hear us ask your husband whether it was not perfect day-light at five o'clock on the 27th of September, and whether he did not know our persons? - I did not hear any such question asked; I was not there.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect Mr. Bond saying to your husband, come forth as a man and deny what you have sworn against these two men? - I was not there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She was in the room at the time.</p>

               <p>Upon what business did you first see, them? - I had been out with my carrier and came home about twenty minutes after four, and found my wife in doors; says I, what is the matter? says she, we have had two ill looking men here; says I, do not be frightened; in about ten minutes Watts came in, says he, is Mr. Austen within? says I, what do you want with me; says he, Mr. Austen, you know you owe me a shilling; for what? says I; says he, you know you borrowed a shilling; says I, I never did, I should like to be informed better; says I, you seem to be a couple of blackguard fellows, and if you do not go along, I will send for a constable; the other man, Hardy, stood at the door; whether he heard I do not know; but he certainly must if he had a pair of ears on.</p>
               <p>He was within such a distance he must have heard? - I should have thought so; then they went immediately after I said they were a couple of blackguard fellows, and if they did not go I would send for a constable; and with my speaking a little sharp they went away.</p>
               <p>I ask you on your oath, whether you had ever been in company with these men? - Never.</p>
               <p>That you are clear and positive of? - That I am clear and positive of; I staid and drank two or three cups of tea; I was going with the intention of going to the play, and at the top of Butcher-row, I saw these two men peeping through an eating-house window.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to them at that time? - No, they saw me pass them, and I turned my head and looked at them; and just at the end of the dark passage, going into <placeName id="t17861213-2-crimeloc9">St. Clement's church-yard</placeName>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130007"/>When did you next see the persons that had robbed you? - On Sunday morning:</p>
               <p>Court. When you heard the dog bark in the one pair of stairs, did you attempt to open the door? - No farther than there was a thing that turned round, and we tried to open it, and it did not open; and then we left it; I went up to Sir Sampson's that very night, with the constable and the butcher, and I gave the descriptions of them; on Sunday or Monday I heard they were taken; I went to the house where this woman had denied having any lodgers; I went up stairs, and there was Mr. Macmanus in the room; says he, now, Mr. Austen, be on your guard, if you know these men, say so; if you do not, say to the contrary.</p>

               <p>In what room was this? - In the one pair of stairs; in the same house where we had been before; when I entered the room, Hardy was in the outer room; the other was dressing himself in the inner room; says I, this is one; and then the other came out, and I said, this is the other; then one said, we know you very well, Mr. Austen, you have been here several times; the landlady of the house knows you very well: they were both in the room when that was said; I do not know which it was that said it; says I, Mr. Macmanus, these fellows may be rogues, the woman below will not dare say she has not seen me here; let us go down and speak to her; and we all five went down together; when we went down in the passage, we all five stood in a rank together; now, says Macmanus, pray Madam, who do you know amongst us? I know, says she, Watts and Hardy to be my lodgers, and says she, I know Mr. Talboy, the constable, very well.</p>
               <p>Was she asked at that time whether she knew you? - Says Macmanus, what nobody else, do not you know this gentleman? that was meaning me; no, says she, I never saw him in my life, to my knowledge; Hardy says, recollect yourself, Madam, did not you light this man up here one night, exceedingly drunk? no, says she, never in my life; from that we all went up to Bow-street, to the Brown Bear, into the back parlour; this was on the Sunday morning; and the prisoner Hardy wanted to go out, and Talboy took him out and left me in the room with Watts; Watts says to me, you would not go to take our lives away for seven shillings and sixpence; says I, it is out of my power to take your lives away; but the law shall have its course; he made answer, and said, we have enough to swear where we were at that time that you say; no doubt on it, says I, such company as you keep, I dare say, you have; says he, if please God, we ever get over this here, if you do not do we, we will do you; what they meant by the word, I cannot tell; then we went over to Sir Sampson; they made no charge against me; they believed me to be a very worthy honest man, they said, they had known me about a month.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoners before? - To say about seeing people it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see them to know them? - Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott, Prisoners Counsel. Have you a perfect memory at this time, is your memory good? - I think it is.</p>
               <p>Then will it furnish you to remember what day you went to the play with Vaughan your servant? - I never went with him.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - I never went with him; I had a servant of that name; I suppose he must have left me about two years and a half; but I cannot say the exact time.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you was not in company with Vaughan at Covent Garden playhouse a fortnight or three weeks before the robbery in the one shilling gallery? - I do not mean to swear that.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect going to the public house when you came from the playhouse? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect being at the playhouse at all? - I have been there several times;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130008"/> I have never been there to see a whole play this season; I believe once I may have gone in at half price.</p>
               <p>Who was in company with you? - A Mr. Dell, a young gentleman that lodges and boards at my house; he never introduced me into any company; we went from our house together, and came back together; I never stopped at any public house; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Was that the first time you ever saw this man at your own door? - I cannot say that; it might be the first time I ever saw them; for I might see you in the street; it was the first time I ever spoke to them; I recollect I never borrowed a shilling of no man in the world of that kind.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by that? - By bearing such a character; I never borrowed a shilling at all not of these men.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect borrowing a shilling the night you came from the play-house? - No, I do not; I positively mean to swear it.</p>
               <p>When was the first time that you think you saw these two men? - The first time that I ever saw them to the best of my knowledge, was the 27th of October; it was that further man, his name is Watts.</p>
               <p>What might he say to you? - When he came to me, he says Mr. Austen, you owe me a shilling; says I, what for; he accosted me in a very civil way; I said, I owe you a shilling! I should be glad to be informed a little about it; I cannot swear whether he might not say he would summon me to the Court of Conscience; when I got into St. Clement's churchyard, they were just lighting up candles; it was the 27th of October; it is a passage of considerable thoroughfare; sometimes there is fifty or sixty, and sometimes not one; it was done in less than a minute, all of it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the account you gave of that robbery at Bow-street? - I do, and I believe it concurs with this.</p>
               <p>What colour was the back of your coat then? - All white, tumbling against the wall; the wall is all white, and the intermixture of the bricks; I know very well that wall is brick and mortar, and the mortar coloured my coat; I am sure I never was at this man's lodgings.</p>

            ? - I certainly know him very well.</p>
               <p>What was he? - He was my milkboy.</p>
               <p>What is he now? - How do I know?</p>
               <p>Did you never in your life go in company with him and me to Mrs. Sorrell's in James-street, Govent-garden, and treat us with a glass of brandy? - Never.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect yourself? - I recollect the truth.</p>
               <p>Then I shall ask you a few more questions what time of night was it? - The candles was alight.</p>
               <p>Was it a wet evening or a dry one? - It was very foggy.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light? - I do not know whether it was moon-light or star-light.</p>
               <p>Do you know what time it is dark at that time of year? - No, I do not, the candles were brought in.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect Mr. Justice Bond putting his hand on your coat, and saying, speak the truth like a man? - He said, if you are an honest man, if you have said wrong, now declare it; says I, I have spoke nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you, you could not make him believe it, and you could not make the Court believe it; and did not he say again, he would have no objection to taking bail for these two men; and then did not you make use a of subterfuge? - When they heard you stood prosecuted here for extorting money from a banker's clerk, they committed you.</p>
               <p>Hardy. My Lord, I defy malice itself to impeach my character, and I hope to make it clear to your Lordship and the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. How long ago is it since<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130009"/> you were discharged from the mad-house? - I believe it is eighteen months ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watts. I beg to remind him of one particular night, whether he was not up in our apartment at Mr. Hardy's lodgings; and it was a very wet night, and he came up with his umbrella, and began to spout?</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hardy. Did not you say you could play tragedy and comedy? - I dare say I did; I never was at their lodgings before we went to search after them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Watts. Did you know a Miss Gale in your neighbourhood? - I do know her; and I believe there are a great many gentlemen in this Court know Miss Gale as well as me.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the time that you swore that she took a hat from a man's head? - I never did any such thing.</p>
               <p>Nor she never brought any action against you in the Court King's-bench for perjury? - If she did, all that I have said shall go for nothing; this man pretended to swear before Sir Sampson, that I defrauded Mr. West, my cow-keeper, out of a seventy pound bank-note; and would have sworn it.</p>
               <p>Court. You say when you came home, your wife was alarmed at these two people having been there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you seen them before you got into the house? - I do not know whether they were not at the bottom of the street, and they waved their hands, but I did not know it was at me, so I took no notice of them.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I was applied to by Mr. Austen, the 27th of October, near upon six o'clock; I cannot say to ten minutes; Mr. Walker, a butcher, in Butcher-row, brought Mr. Austen to me; the man seemed to be very much in agitation, very distressed in his mind, and was exceedingly sick; he puked prodigiously; he had received a blow on one side of his eye; he said he had been robbed in St. Clement's church-yard; he described their persons, and some part of their dress; says he, I watched them into a house in Milford-lane; he said there was nobody passing just at that time; one of them seized me, and grasped me down behind, and the other gave me a violent blow in my body, which rendered me as unable of speech, as if I had been a corpse: I went where he directed me; I went down this lane; there are three houses all alike; and the others fall in six or seven feet, and have little yards before them; he shewed me the house which he thought was the right one; I saw a woman coming down this yard, where there was water in a tub, and I asked her if they had a couple of young men lodged in the house, she said yes; I went gently up stairs, and looked through the keyhole, but there was no light at all; the woman came up stairs presently; says she, I suppose there is nobody at home, so I went down stairs, and asked the woman of the house, if the young men that lodged up stairs were at home; says she, I have no young men, I have nobody but Hooper, who lodges up stairs, and a young fellow that has been with him lately, a gentleman's servant that was gone to place in the Temple; she said, she had nobody else but an old waterman or fireman; knowing this Hooper, we went down to him; and he said he lodged in the garret, and from something that he said, I made further enquiry what kind of people lodged in the house; I went again on the Saturday, and saw Macmanus, and I communicated the business to him; says he, I will call on you to-morrow morning; and he and I and Townsend went to the house; the woman of the house was then in bed; I said, are these young men that you chuse to deny to me at home now? yes, says she, but I beg your pardon, I recollect myself, I thought you was come to take down names for the militia; this was my excuse, says she; they belong to the play house, and very honest young men they are indeed; I went up stairs, and knocked at the door; one of them was just got up; he opened the door to me; I then opened my commission, and told them I was come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130010"/> to take them about a robbery; then I fetched Mr. Austen, and the minute he came up, he pointed to the two men; there, says he, are the two men that robbed me, one pinioned me; they then said, why Mr. Austen you know us very well; you do not mean to swear our lives away, and the landlady will prove it; when we came down stairs, the woman said, she knew the two prisoners to be her lodgers, but did not know the prosecutor: good God, Mrs. Mercer! says one of the prisoners, do not you remember his coming with his boots and umbrella under his arm; did not you light him up? When we came to the office, Hardy called me out several times, and wanted to send me of an errand, and wanted to shuffle to go to the necessary, and seemed a good deal upon the fidget, and I did much like it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. Was Austen perfectly sober the night you first saw him? - Yes, he stood close to me, and if he had any liquor, I must have known it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hardy. What kind of latch did you find at my door? - I found no latch.</p>
               <p>Did you hear a little dog bark? - I cannot say; I will not say.</p>
               <p>Do you think there is no latch to my door? - No.</p>
               <p>When you took us, did not you ask us, can you prove where you were at that time? - You said you could prove it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did these men tell you, when you took them on the Sunday morning, where they had been on the Friday night? - I do not recollect that they did; their discourse was to Macmanus.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Did not we tell you where we were on Friday night as we were going up Bridges-street? - I do not upon my oath recollect.</p>
               <p>How many beds were there in the room? - One bed; it is a little room separate from the main room; a little dark room with no window; there was but one bedstead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hardy. Was I in bed or up when you came in? - You was in bed, and when I fetched Austen, you was up.</p>

               <p>Did they in the presence of Austen, charge him with any offence? - Yes, they did, and said he had been there, and brought a boy with him; they said he had been there several times; I searched them; one of them had no money at all, the other had fourteen or fifteen shillings; there was a crown piece, and the rest in silver; I shewed the money to Austen; he knew nothing of the money.</p>

               <p>Did not you say yourself, after the man had sworn to us, that you was of opinion we were innocent men? - No, I do not think I did; I said, I did not like to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130011"/> any thing to do with the business, and if I had known of it, I would not have gone after you at all.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect immediately on these men being charged by Austen the prosecutor; their declaring where they were at the time of t he robbery? - I do not know that they did then, but they did in an hour afterwards, or something less.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the place that they mentioned? - They mentioned several places; I cannot say I can charge my memory with any of them, except that they mentioned drinking with a servant near Old-street-road; some brewer's servant, I think, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hardy. Was any body suffered to come near us till the Monday morning? - I do not know.</p>

I owe you none; yes, says I, you do, and if you do not pay us, I will summons you for it; this was about fifteen minutes after four; Hardy was waiting the corner of Gough-square; we went immediately from there to Old street; I went to enquire for

            , who has lived in the brewhouse many years; a maid servant came to the door; he came to me, I asked him how he did, and told him that Hardy was at the outside of the gate; this might be about half after four, or wanting a quarter to five; then he was without his hat, and he came to me to the outer gate, and Hardy was there waiting; then we talked of having something to drink, and we went to a public house in Golden-lane, the sign of the goat; I did not know the house so well as Hardy; he called for a pot of beer; Buchanan was without his hat; Hardy asked Buchanan to lend him half a guinea; he said he was going to enquire after a woman of the name of White, who was dead in that neighbourhood; he said he would lend it him; he said, he must go home again for it; he went home for the money, and returned again with his hat on, and he brought a slice of bread and cheese in his pocket; when he returned, he brought a crown piece, and five shillings and sixpence; and we had another pint of beer put into the pot we had been drinking out of; then he went home, and Hardy and me went down Golden-lane; and at a very short distance, Hardy saw two women, which he knew very well, and he asked them to have something to drink; they sometimes sell roots, and sometimes fish; and we went into a wine vault, and gave them something to drink; he enquired of them concerning Mrs. White who was dead; how she was buried; and they directed him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130012"/> go to another woman in the same neighbourhood, to a person they called Coney, who was a blind woman where Mrs. White died, where he learned the particulars respecting her burial; he also saw another woman in White-cross-street, whom he asked to drink, and he gave her a gill of sweet wine; then we went to a person by the name of Strong, there we had two pots of beer, and there was some spirits, and Hardy was very sick, and he went out in the yard; this was about eight; we then came from Golden-lane to Princes-street, Covent garden, to the house where we had lodged before, to Mrs. Price, where we staid till eleven, before we went to our lodgings; and we were taken on the Sunday morning; Mr. Macmanus and Talboy came up; I was startled; Mr. Macmanus said, I believe they are innocent men, I will not take them; you go Mr. Talboy, and fetch the prosecutor; and when he came, I was the more astonished, because the prosecutor had been three times at our house, particularly one time when it rained very hard; he came up with an umbrella, and spouted a great deal, talked many parts out of tragedy and comedy: Sir Sampson Wright examined me for an hour; I gave him a particular description where I had been, and what way of life I was in; then Sir Sampson called in Mr. Hardy; then Sir Sampson said, send for these people again on Monday; we went there, and they did attend before Sir Sampson; Sir Sampson was in doubt, he did not know what to do; he cautioned him several times, from the circumstance of his contradicting himself; and Justice Bond said, he could not admit the evidence of an alibi there; it must be before your Lordship; he said, whatever our opinion is of your innocence, we cannot do it, it must be before the Judge; and on our second examination, Justice Bond said to the prosecutor, come forward like a man, and retract what you have said, and say, that out of malice, you have sworn this against the two men; we there produced the evidence; and then Sir Sampson said, he must commit us. My Lord, we are innocent men, and here are persons in Court who will prove to you where we were at the time; and I am sorry to add, that the prosecutor has only done this through wilfulness, he could not say it was a mistake, because he knew us, and could not be mistaken; that I am very sorry to inform your Lordship is the case.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Coker, the brewer; I have been in the family twelve years; I know the prisoner Watts; I knew him a boy.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect his calling upon you on the 27th of October? - I do, perfectly well.</p>
               <p>What time of the evening was it? - About half after four; he called at our house, and I spoke to him, and asked him to walk in; he said, he had a person waiting at the gate; I went to the gate with him, and we walked on talking to Golden-lane; I was without a hat; I said, I would not go any farther, and I asked him to drink; we went into a house and had a pot of beer, and during the time we sat there, he said, he had been out of employ sometime, and would be very much obliged to me to lend him half a guinea; I went home and brought a crown piece, and five shillings and sixpence; there was an old gentleman, my mistress's uncle; and the maid servant said, he had had his tea; I looked at the clock, and it wanted a quarter of six; I am perfectly sure of the time, because I took the candle and looked at the clock in the kitchen; they sent to me on the Monday morning following to speak to me at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Who was that other person who was at the gate? - It is the man that stands here; I am perfect of it; he went into the public<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130013"/> house with us; the two men at the bar were the two men that drank with us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are intimate with Watts now I presume? - I never saw him since I saw him in Bow-street; I knew him from a boy; I was first acquainted with him at Ipswich in Suffolk; I was only acquainted with him by seeing him by chance; I have heard since he has been in trouble now, that he has been in difficulties before, but I do not know it to a certainty.</p>
               <p>Then it is only by chance that they met with you? - Not lately.</p>
               <p>It was perfectly an accidental visit? - It was.</p>
               <p>I suppose he did not know where you lived? - Yes, he did, for about a month before, I met him in the street and told him.</p>
               <p>What are you now? - A servant to Mr. Croker of Old-street.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the day of the week that you was drinking at this ale-house? - Friday; it is the Goat, the corner of Cherry-tree-alley.</p>
               <p>Who keeps this house? - I do not know; I never was in the house before nor since.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been paid this half guinea which he borrowed of you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask him for it at Bow-street? - No Sir; I could not think of asking a man in trouble for half a guinea.</p>
               <p>You had no acquaintance with Hardy before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Court. Having no acquaintance with Hardy before, you are sure it was not Hardy, but Watts you lent the half-guinea to? - It was Watts I gave it to.</p>

               <p>Would you have lent it to Hardy, a perfect stranger, if he had asked you for it; - I do not think I should.</p>

               <p>Do you take notice of every person that comes? - Our business lays by the sight; by taking notice of people.</p>

               <p>Did you ever miss him from home? - Not before the 29th of October to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>In what state of mind was he? - Sir, he seemed to be very much disordered at his first coming, but he had got rather better of that, but he was not well when he came away from me; I acquainted his wife with it when he went away; he came one evening in a coach to our door, and demanded a man and maid to go with him to fetch his wife; he was told we should not; he got a man and maid at the next door.</p>

               <p>I live No. 1, Milford-lane; I have known the two prisoners since the 23d of August; they were very regular; they used to go out in the evening; they left their candle with me, and lighted it and went up stairs; they came home sometimes at eleven, and sometimes later; I did not know that they followed any business; I had a good character of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. They both lodged in your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They followed no business? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>How did they live? - I do not know; I always enquire their character, so far that they were sober honest people; and that they would pay me; I was told that they were very honest men.</p>
               <p>What business did they tell you they followed? - They were gardeners by trade; Mrs. Hardy came backwards and forwards every week of her life; she did not constantly live there; Hardy told me she was attending a person that was sick at Hoxton; I let every body in and out.</p>
               <p>And they came in and out constantly every night? - Always; they never slept out of the house a night; they first came to the house on the 23d of August.</p>
               <p>When were they taken up for this offence? - That I cannot justly say the day.</p>
               <p>I will tell you, the 29th of October? - They never were taken up before at my house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130016"/>Were they taken up in September? - Not in my house; they slept in my house regularly every night, from August till October.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that the man was in custody in September? - No.</p>
               <p>Then that could not have happened without your knowing it as you let him in every night? - Mr. James and his wife were in, if Hardy was not; they took the candle of me, and always left the candle in the morning, till the morning they were taken; they went out about eleven; they went out sometimes sooner and sometimes later.</p>
               <p>What hour did they in general go out? - Sometimes by ten o'clock; sometimes they did not go out till after dinner.</p>
               <p>Now these two honest men used to go out about ten, then at what time did you use to shut up your doors to go to bed? - About eleven, or half after eleven.</p>
               <p>Did not it strike you as very odd that gardeners should lay in bed till ten o'clock in the morning? - I knew they were out of business.</p>
               <p>What business were they in? - Why kept a shop in Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Of what kind? - Green grocers and other business too, that is what Mrs. Hardy told me; that was not since I knew them.</p>
               <p>How came you to deny them to Talboy? - I never did deny them to Talboy.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes, I can safely swear it; my mangle was making a noise, I told Talboy I had a Mr. Hooper in the garret, and a young man that had not slept in the house some time; he was in the country; he is with me now.</p>
               <p>How came you to forget these two friends of yours in the one pair of stairs? - I did not think of them; he did not ask me, he only asked me for the others; says I, he has never asked me of the one pair of stairs; but if he had I could not tell their Christian names.</p>
               <p>How many beds were in this room? - When they came they had two beds and one bedstead; they had but one bedstead; I saw the things come, they came in a cart.</p>
               <p>When did you first learn their Christian names? - He was always called James in the house; I could not have told his Christian name when Talboy came; I have learned since Mr. Hardy always called him Jem.</p>
               <p>Then you knew his Christian name? - I say I did not know Hardy's Christian name.</p>
               <p>Hardy's wife had no apartments at your house? - She never did lay there that I know on; the wife was with a lady in the country.</p>
               <p>Court. There was but one bedstead then? - No, one bedstead and two beds; I never was in the room once, since he has been in the house; I never was in Hardy's room at all, when he was in it, only once with his wife.</p>
               <p>Did not you know how the rooms in your house were furnished? - They had their own furniture; I saw the bedstead conveyed out of the yard into the cart; and there was was only one bedstead and two beds; I do not know how they laid in the beds.</p>
               <p>Then one might be in one room and one in the other? - They might move them one into each room, because one is a dark room and one a light one.</p>
               <p>When you was in Mr. Hardy's room how was it then, was there a bed in that room? - No, not in the fore room.</p>
               <p>Have not you been in the fore room more than once? - Never but once, only since Mr. Hardy has been confined; I never was in the back room at all; the way into the back room is through the fore room.</p>
               <p>When you was in the fore room there was no bed in it? - No, no bed.</p>
               <p>Did you know Austen? - I knew him by serving me with milk and garden stuff, when I lived in the Bolt and Ton passage, that is about a year and a half ago; when I heard who he was, I recollected his face again; but when he came down stairs following Mr. Hardy, I could no more have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130017"/> known him than a person I never saw; I did not then recollect that I had ever seen him before.</p>
               <p>Had you lately seen him before in your house? - No, I had not, my servant had; I once saw him go out of doors; I think he was the same man, but I cannot be sure; I saw his side face, and I said, to my girl, there is that tall gentleman that goes up to Mr. Hardy; she has a deal more opportunity of seeing people that come to my lodgers than I have.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose it would have been impossible for Hardy's wife to have slept with him night after night without your knowing it? - Yes, I think it would.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester to Perry. Do you know how long he was in custody on that charge that you bailed him for? - As nigh as I can guess about two nights.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. (After summing up the evidence.) Gentlemen, the fact of the robbery rests on the positive testimony of the prosecutor; and there is no other positive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130018"/> proof of that fact. One extraordinary circumstance is, that at that time of the evening when Butcher-row is so full, they should commit the robbery; another extraordinary circumstance is, that they should go directly to their own lodgings. It rests with you to consider which side you will believe, for it is certainly impossible to reconcile the evidence; it is so contradictory; and there must be perjury on the one side or on the other. It is for you, considering all the circumstances I have stated to you, to say on which side in your opinion the truth lies; whether the story which is told by Austen, confirmed in the circumstances in which it is capable of being confirmed, as you have heard it, liable to the objection from the nature of the robbery itself, in a frequented street at that time of night; or whether the story of their witnesses is true; that they were at another part of the town till eight that night, before which time, if at all, this robbery must have been committed. You will weigh the matter well, for you will consider that a great deal depends on your determining this matter right; for it would be a very shocking thing that two innocent men should be convicted on that evidence, which was not true, and which was known to be not true by the prosecutor at the time. On the other hand, it is a very great aggravation of their offence, to attempt now to blind the eyes of a Jury by false witnesses. You have the whole of the evidence before you; you will consider all the circumstances, and pronounce whether the prisoners are guilty or not.</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice WILSON.</p>
               <p>N. B. When sentence of death was pronounced on the capital convicts, the prisoner Hardy addressed the Court as follows: My Lord, we are innocent men, and our prosecutor knows it, though he has sworn our lives away; he knows he was our acquaintance before: there never was so deliberate a piece of villainy brought before a Court of Justice; we have prepared a letter to send to the prosecutor, and we are endeavouring to make our peace with God; but we are really innocent men if we seal it with our bloods.</p>
               <p>Court. Having now been convicted, it rests wholly with your Sovereign; the Court has no power.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoners Counsel. What because it is dirty, and has a hole in it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is the only reason you have for swearing to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where does Dacre live? - About a mile and a half from me.</p>
               <p>Does he pass his own house in going to some of your customers? - He may make it so.</p>
               <p>A man is very likely to do so if he has a wife at home, I should think? - Very likely.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his wife laying in and having a barrel of twopenny of you? - No, it was a firkin; I swear to these marks.</p>
               <p>No attempt to disguise it? - Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>Was he your head drayman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had this man lived with you? - Dacre and M'Donald about four or five months, and Tillingham about ten or eleven.</p>

               <p>Was there any body else in the shop? - No customer.</p>
               <p>How long did she stay in the shop? - Not above two minutes; then I secured her, and took the muff from her; she endeavoured to force it between the bars of the area; I got assistance and secured her.

               <p>So that you do not very well know what happened? - No; I lost my money, and as soon I came to myself, I found they were endeavouring to get my watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>You perceived that? - Yes, I did, I helped them to take it out; they got the watch, then they grumbled among themselves; one of them wanted me to be dispatched; I think that was the term they made use of; however, the rest prevailed, and they went away, and I returned home.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130025"/>What sort of a night was it? - It was very dark, I could not see even their clothes.</p>
               <p>You did not know any of them, I suppose? - Neither of them.</p>
               <p>Was your watch ever found? - I heard of it two or three days after.</p>
               <p>Had you advertised it? - No.</p>
               <p>How did you hear of it then? - One of the officers of East Smithfield came and acquainted my brother of it; my name was on a paper in the inside; I went in the evening to the Justice's office, and the watch was then produced, and I swore it was mine.</p>
               <p>Was any body in custody there? - Two men.</p>

            ; Justice Smith's man, Mr. Dawson, came to my house with the prisoner Bead, and asked for a watch pledged for one guinea, in the name of Bead; I went and looked for it, and found it; I immediately recollected that Bead was not the man that pledged it; I never saw him before; I attended at the Justice's, and described the man that brought it; Bead and Fitzsimmons were in custody be fore the Justice; but neither of them were the man I took the watch of; I do not rightly know the man; he was remarkbly tall; I do not think it is any one of these prisoners; two or three days after it was pledged, Bead was brought in custody to my shop; he asked for the watch in the same manner as if he had pawned it himself; he said, I want the watch that was pledged a day or two in the name of Bead for a guinea; I looked for it, and found it, and said, I was positive I did not take it in of the prisoner, for he was a much taller man that brought it; and when I went to the office, there was another man in custody, but it was neither of these men; about a week or eight days after, the officer came and told me, he had taken the other man; and I attended at the Justice's again to see if I knew him; and I am not able to swear to any of them; the man that was at the second examination was that tall man; he appeared to be very much like the man that pawned the watch with me; but I have a doubt about him, for he was not in the same dress.</p>
               <p>Was it that tall man or not, are you able to say? - I do not think it was; I believe it was not any of them; Bead made a kind of confession in my hearing.</p>
               <p>In the first place was there any promises of favour made to Bead if he did confess? - I understood from himself from what little conversation he had with me that he had been promised; but I did not hear the officer say so; I only heard him say so.</p>
               <p>Did the officer admit or deny his intimation of having a promise made him? - He denied it before the Justice.</p>

               <p>Was there no expectation given this man on the part of the crown, that he should be shown favour if he made a confession? - No, I tell you the plain fact; I declare there was no promises made to him of any kind whatever; at that time I did not know the prosecutor, so far from that I put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130026"/> on a pair of hand-cuffs to him immediately; I went with him to the pawnbroker's where he directed me; when he came in, he called for a watch in the name of

             brought me this watch about the 22d of September, to raise what money I could to pay his rent; I shewed it to several people to sell it; I put it into a little drawer in my bar; and one night while I was in my cellar, between eleven and twelve, the prisoner conveyed the watch out of the drawer; I missed it about the 21st or 22d of September; however, it was within three days of the time he brought it to me; I could not tell who to lay it to; I saw it the day before, and shewed it to some people; this passed on for about six weeks; this prisoner was amongst the coaches, and about our house, and picked up what he could, and he went on errands; about five weeks after I lost the watch, the prisoner was brought to my parlour by some people, and he confessed he had robbed a man of some money, and there I heard him confess he had taken the watch, and pawned it in Whitechapel; the next morning he went to the pawnbroker's, and they produced the watch.</p>
               <p>Donaldson. I can swear to the watch any where; I know it by the string which I put on, and the key, and every thing; he said when I was gone down in the cellar, he put over his hand into the bar and pulled it out; I made him no promises; I heard none made about the watch, and what promise was made in the parlour about the money, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Is any of these people here? - No, I did not know they were required; the Magistrate said me and Donaldson were enough.</p>
               <p>Who was the Magistrate? - Mr. Girdler.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They promised me if I would tell them where the watch was, that I should be done nothing to; one was Mr. Brown a coachman; I have not a friend in the world, but God and you.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. What may the value of the watch be? - Two guineas.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Bensford a woollen-draper, No. 24, Ludgate-hill; he had a house in the country, in the parish of Wilsdon, near Mr. Oliver's house; I slept that morning at the prosecutor's; I was awaked in the night by a noise of somebody breaking into the house; I was alarmed about half after three in the morning; I heard the glass fall, and I came down stairs in my shirt, and saw the prisoner standing at the window; I immediately opened the door and clapped hold of her.</p>
               <p>Was that before the patrols came? - They were in the yard at the same time with the woman; I observed the casement window was broke in three or four places; some pieces of glass were broke out, and some hung in; and I observed one pot on the sill of the window, and the other lay by the sink hole against the window, ready for taking away; I observed the prisoner's coat was all smut.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether it was fresh? - Yes, I observed it was fresh; I put my hand upon it, and it rubbed off.</p>
               <p>Is there any house near that has a view into this yard? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you observe in the morning where the bar of the window was? - It lay down in the sink.</p>
               <p>How could this bar be removed by a person on the outside? - The casement opens on the outside; she opened the glass; it goes with a catch; she put her arm and unhasped it, and pulled it open; she got a thin bit of stick, which she said she found in the back yard, and there was a crack in the shutter that gives room enough to push up the bar; she owned the next morning in the tap room how she opened it; we asked her how she opened it.</p>
               <p>Did you charge her to tell the truth, did not you always advise her to tell the whole story? - I asked her myself.</p>
               <p>I suppose you told her it would be better for her? - Yes, we did.</p>
               <p>(The pots produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Did he speak to you at all? - No; the prisoner said, has he any money; Glaves said no; the prisoner said, d - n your eyes, feel again, for I know he has got some money; with that he turned round and jostled me up against the coach again, which they had no occasion to do, for there was no person nigh enough to push them up against me; then Glaves felt again, and I caught his hand a second time; then I turned and said, my friend, you had better be quiet, or else I will have you hobbled; with that the third person that was with them, said, is it me you mean? no, says I; says another, is it me? no, says I; then says he, it must be you; no, says I, I have nothing to say to you; I was glad to get rid of them for fear of being ill used; there were many people near, but I was afraid to speak to any of them for fear of speaking to their acquaintance; they went away, and I followed, resolving if I saw any, body to give charge of them; I missed my pocket book immediately as they quitted me; it was taken out of my great coat pocket; then I lost sight of the other two, but still kept sight of the prisoner at the bar; I caught hold of his arm, I was near losing him, but he turned round, and said, d - n my eyes, do you mean to pick my pocket, I have lost my knife already; I then followed him a little farther, and I heard the name of Bill, Bill, called; he said, halloo, and went to the same two; and they went away about two hundred yards, they saw me following them, and they turned again, and the tallest of them, neither the prisoner nor Glaves, asked me what I followed them for; they all three turned about; there were some men coming along, and I asked them to assist me; but they would have nothing to do with it; then they ran away; before they ran away, they said, if you follow us further we will knock you down; upon which the prisoner said, do not knock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130033"/> down, let him go about his business; Glaves was soon taken; the officers came up; I never lost sight of him; I do not know what became of the other two; the prisoner was taken on the Tuesday following in the Borough; they took my hat off my head, it was very tight on, and they pulled it off when they pulled me down from the coach wheel; I never got any of my things again.</p>
               <p>Was there much light? - Yes, the lights at the burying shewed a good distance; there were many lamps.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake positively to swear to the man from such a short observation on such a night? - I can positively swear to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He never mentioned that before the Justice? - I never mentioned any such word.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And before the Justice he declared he had lost his hat? - I said, the hat was taken from me.</p>

               <p>On the 11th of November, in the evening, I, with five more officers, having a little leisure time, went down to that spot to see for a person I wanted; I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw a man running and another after him without a hat; I followed one who dodged under a coach; I got fast hold of him; that time the prosecutor was up with us; says he, that is the man that has robbed me; I asked him of what; he said, he knocked or dragged him off the coach wheel, and had taken his hat and pocket book; I then took him into custody, and in taking him along, I gave him to Treadway and Beamish, who were with me; I found a mob of people following us very close, with several imprecations, and I was rather afraid of some mischief; Beamish hallooed out to me, take care, Freeman; I turned round, and observed a stick over my head; the prisoner was making a blow, which Beamish prevented; I turned about, and told the people not to attempt to rescue the prisoner; I drew a pistol, and said, I would shoot the first person that attempted to rescue my prisoner; I did not apprehend the prisoner but the other man; they still swore, and I drew a pistol, and told them, that the first man that attempted to rescue my prisoner, I would blow his brains out; I got him into a public house; I then got a coach, and took the prisoner Glaves to St. Giles's round-house; I was informed that Glaves called himself a Boroughnian; and I thought to go to the Borough; on Monday I went to take my prisoner to the Magistrate, and found that he had made his escape; I went into the Borough to Ward and Smith, and enquired after Glaves, and says I, I believe you know a partner of his; and I described him; yes, says they, his name is Allen; I told them to apprehend him, and bring him to me; on Tuesday, the 14th, they brought him to me; I knew him directly; I then put him into custody, and sent for the prosecutor; when he came, I put the prisoner, which I usually do in those cases, among many more people, and one of my brother officers went in with the prosecutor, and asked him if he knew any person there, and he pitched upon the prisoner directly.</p>
               <p>Now, what opportunity had you of seeing the prisoner that night, or had you any but what you have just described while he lifted the stick? - I never saw the prisoner before that night, but going to the public house, there were several lights, and I observed the prisoner as he was making a blow at my head, which Beamish prevented; I noticed him particularly; I am positive that is the man that followed me, and attempted to strike me; the prisoner said before the Magistrate, I advised Glaves not to knock you down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I saw the men; but was not in their company; one said, cut him, and another said, knock him down, and I prevented them.</p>

I immediately laid hold of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130035"/> Lucas, and out of his hand he dropped a little leather purse; I then searched him, and in his breeches pocket I found a razor, and two pawnbrokers tickets: this is a duplicate for a silver watch; I do not know the name of the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the third man? - Another of my partners had hold of him.</p>

               <p>Then why was not you positive at first? - My meaning was this, I might put my head out of the door, but not my feet; that is my hand writing; I saw them sign it before the Magistrate, and signed it myself; the Magistrate asked them if they were contented, and they said they were.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>When did you see him first? - Yesterday was a fortnight; about the evening, at Norwich; he sent for me in a public house, and shewed me the goods to sell; I live at Norwich; I deal in clothes and silver; there was a gold watch, and the things mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130039"/> in the indictment; he sent for me, and asked me to buy them; I told him yes; he asked me first fourteen guineas, and then ten; and then I thought he did not come honestly by them, as I thought they were worth above three times the value; so I stopped them, and took him before the Mayor: the prisoner said he bought the goods in Ireland; I carried the things up to the Mayor, with the prisoner; I delivered them to the Mayor in the hall.</p>
               <p>Did you see the goods at any time? - Yes, when Mr. Hebb came down, I saw the goods brought along and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Who brought them along? - That man.</p>
               <p>Did you know them to be the same? - Yes, I do know them to be the same goods; they are particular goods; any person can swear to them at any time.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him how he came by them? - Yes; and he said he came from Ireland.</p>
               <p>Had you known the prisoner before? - No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Were these goods that you have in your pocket, produced before the Mayor of Norwich? - Yes, they are the same goods.</p>
               <p>And can you take upon you to say that they are yours? - They are some old shop-keepers, and old acquaintance of mine; I am sorry to say we have had them in the house so long; as to this box, we have had it twenty years; it was sold in our sale, and the Jews returned it again; I could have sworn to it any where.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of these things? - I look upon it to be thirty or forty pounds all together; there is no putting a real value upon these things; this box is eighteen guineas in my father's time; it weighs seven pounds; I suppose it may be worth ten pounds; it is such a fancy trade, we lose such a deal by fashion.</p>
               <p>Court to Isaac. Look at these things, and tell us whether they are the same you carried to the Mayor of Norwich? - Yes, they are the same goods.</p>

I said, not long; we walked to the watch-house; he turned off the pavement, and said, he would be d - nd if I should stop him before he got to Cock-hill; I then said, I insist on your walking on that side of the way; we got to the watch-house; I called for assistance; and he let the iron drop on the ground; the beadle and the watchman came out, and with some reluctance we got the prisoner into the watch-house; I went to Mr. Green's, and found no reason to believe his story; he said, in the morning that he had been drinking at a public house in Rose-lane, and was hired to carry it to Cock-hill for sixpence and a pint of beer.</p>

               <p>I work facing Mr. Hodge's shop: on the 18th of November, near four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Hodge's shop, with this glass under his arm: Mr. Hodges was talking to my mistress, and she sent me after him; I followed him thirty yards, and he put down the glass on the pavement; I pursued him thirty yards more and took him; he never was out of my sight; he desired me to let him go, and not to degrade his friends; I took him to the watch-house; somebody else took up the glass, and carried it to the prosecutor's; I know it to be the same by the form and make; I had seen it before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was sent of an errand, and two lads ran by me, and they took them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses; who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Why did not you go home? - It was too late.</p>
               <p>What at ten at night? - Yes; I never lodged there before nor since.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - I had had some beer, and been a little merry, but not drunk; I went to bed in a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the house alone? - The prisoner went with me, and the landlord and his wife, they were with me, but I did not know them before; they met with me at the Hare and Hound public house, and asked me to take a bed with them that night.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner lodge at Murphy's house at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many apartments had Murphy in that house? - There was but one room; they slept there; there were two beds joined together; we were to sleep there; this woman sat by the fire when I went to bed; and about eleven, she thrust herself along side of me, with her clothes on; and about a quarter past twelve she was gone; and I dreamed I had been robbed, and I jumped up, and I found my money was gone; she went and left the place a long while; at last I heard of her, and took her up; I called the man and his wife, and he and me pursued after her, but could not find her; she went to another country, when she heard the constable was after her: I lost five guineas, and a half, and three half crowns: I had been about my business that day; I had a wife and children in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. You had better have gone home to them.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol of Mary-le-bone parish; at two in the morning I heard something fall, about twenty yards off; and I made up to the report; it was by James-street; and I seized the prisoner at the top of the iron rails; I saw a man coming with something under his arm; he saw me, and turned back into Gray's mews; I followed him, and saw this lead standing up against the wall; he then turned down Grey-street; I followed him and kicked this hold-fast before me; I waited to see who came for it; and in half an hour after the prisoner came past the end of the mews, and stopt the space of a minute: then he turned into the mews and caught hold of the lead; for a minute I stood against a door way; I caught hold of his collar, and we took him and the lead under his arm to the watch-house; we took the lead to Mr. Evans's and it fitted exactly; it was taken from the top of the door; it weighs twenty-five pounds.</p>

               <p>Was it the nearest way to come over Tower-hill? - No, it was not; but there was a poor man that was distressed in the spunging-house there, and he sent for me; I went to him in at the front door, and I came out at the side door, and I missed my turning; I came down to the bottom of the Minories; I have often came over Tower-hill of a night; when I came to the middle of the Great hill, I saw the prisoner coming towards me on the right; it was a high wind, and a good deal of rain; it was moon-light; he came pretty nigh me; and I said, I wish you would keep at a distance; and I think he said, what is that to you? there is room enough for us both; says I, that is the reason why I wish us to be separate; he still came towards me; and I at last said, are you determined to rob me? to the best of my knowledge he said, he did not know but he might, or some words to that purpose; when that was the case I did not know how to act, for the wind was so high I thought I could not run; and I believe I turned round and said, what, are you good at that; I had a stick in my hand; he struck at me with a stick or bludgeon, and I returned the blow, and we had several blows of one another; and at last I got one on my head which brought me to the ground; it stunned me; I had on a pair of black callimanco breeches, and he tore the pocket down to the knee; and I remember him raising me up, and he stripped off a blue coat, and a great coat that I had on; and I found myself very helpless; and I said, take what you please, spare my life for I have a family; immediately upon that he left me; I saw him run; I got home as well as I could; I lost a good deal of blood.</p>
               <p>Was you quite sober at that time? - I had been drinking; I had had a few glasses of wine at the spunging house which were not remarkably strong; but I was not intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Were you quite sober? - I will not declare myself quite sober.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen this man before? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this is the man? - I am sorry, my Lord, I have not a doubt of it I lost my hat and my stick; my hat was not found.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the waiter at the Carolina coffee-house; I saw the prisoner come into the coffee-room, on Tuesday, the 5th of this month, a quarter past seven, with an umbrella in his hand; he asked me for a glass of brandy and water, which I served him with, and he paid me immediately; he drank a part of it by the fire; and then he went and set in one of the boxes; he sat there some considerable time; then he moved into the box, where the great coats hung.</p>


               <p>Did you see the great coat hanging there before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know whose it was? - Having some suspicion of him, I was determined to pay attention to him; and I saw him, about five minutes after, draw the coat off a curtain rod where it hung; there were two or three other great coats; he left the great coat at the end of the bench; afterwards he got up, and walked to the fire place, and looked about him, and seeing no person about the fire, he went in again.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - I was behind the door, looking through a glass door for the purpose of watching him; when he had been in the box about a minute, he came out with a great coat rolled up under his arm; he had no great coat on when he came in; and I came from behind the door and caught him; I asked him what business he had with that coat; he signified that it must be a mistake; my master came up immediately, and caught hold of him, and sent for a constable, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Was he a customer of yours? - He had been two or three times before; the reason I suspected him was, a gentleman had lost his great coat about the same time; I should know the great coat again.</p>

            : on the 9th of December, I missed some gold and some silver, which we had given to the prisoner to melt; the prisoner worked with us about a month; I gave it him on the 9th of December, about thirty penny weights, and he took six; we did not find so much upon him; he was to melt it at the top of the house in the shop; when he came down to go to dinner, we searched him, and a small quantity, two or three grains, was found on the ground, which he acknowledged he dropped, and I picked it up myself close by his feet; there was about a penny-weight of gold; he said it was not our property, it was his own.</p>

               <p>Having reason to suspect the prisoner, I weighed him about thirty penny weights of gold and silver, and gave it him up stairs, and desired him to weigh it; he put it into the scales, and told me there was an ounce and a half, which is twenty-two penny weights, which was under what I gave him; I made no reply; I desired him to melt it; he did, and I weighed what he had melted, and found it was twenty-two penny weights, that was all gold, the silver was afterwards separate; I weighed it below stairs in the shop; he did not see me weigh it; that was about twelve, or half after; after he had melted that, he melted a quantity of silver, which I was not so particular in weighing; it was fine silver which I gave him to melt; and when I searched him, I found a piece of the same silver about him; he was the last man that went to dinner; I searched him with the constable, whose name is Holmes, and we found some silver, and two or three other little grains of gold, with some other gold of a coarser nature; some of the grains of gold were found on the ground some little time afterwards; we found the main quantity in the lining of his hat, where the button is joined to the outside, and being thin, it was not easy to be found; there were two pieces of gold; I took them out of his hat myself.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose you could not know it was your gold? - Yes, perfectly well, because it was gold that had been made thin.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to swear that these pieces of gold that were found in his hat, and in his pocket, were your property? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In the melting, might so much have been lost? - Then it must have been in another state; it was in the state that I gave it him.</p>

               <p>On the 8th of November, or rather the 9th, at a quarter before two, I was in Hedge-lane; I am patrol; I was with my partner; we observed a man come down; I crossed the way to him, which is the accomplice Cozens; I held him and searched him, and in his pocket I found a pistol.</p>
               <p>Was it loaded? - Yes, with three slugs; I took it from him, and took him to the watch-house, and laid a charge against him as a suspicious person; in the morning we had him before the Justice, and he was admitted an evidence immediately; he cried directly, and owned his fault, and said, there were some more people concerned.</p>

               <p>What is the meaning of that? - I do not know what meaning they give to it, without it is a gentleman; Mr. Williamson was going down Rupert-street; says Brown, we are going round the corner, and we will have him there; as soon as he came to the corner, Brown caught hold of him, and says, d - n your eyes stop, your money or your life; Mr. Williamson made answer, do not hurt me, you shall have all I have; with that he put his hand into his pocket and gave him some money, I cannot say how much; Crawley says, where is your watch? says the gentleman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130075"/> I have no watch; he says, d - n your eyes, frisk him, he has got more money; then Brown was putting his hand in his pocket, and Williamson says, stop, I will give you all that I have; Brown took out his hand and Williamson gave him some more money; says Brown, d - n you, what have you in your coat pocket? he said, nothing; he was going through Ryder's-court, we says to him, d - n you, you shall not go this way; when he got up the court, I myself says, d - n it, go down, or I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Did not you say to him sherry? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Brown was with you, and took the part you have said? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. I never saw the man before with my eyes, nor know nothing of him; that man has perjured himself; he is swearing my life away to save his own; I saw the accomplice before; I have had people waiting to appear for my character, but they are gone.</p>

               <p>Should you know them again? - I was so terrified I could not undertake to swear to them, though I saw them at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You told my Lord, you was so terrified that you cannot swear to the persons? - I think it is the prisoner at the bar, but I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Do you remember saying that you thought both the men that came into your house were taller than those you saw at the Justice's? - I saw him at the Justice's, and when he had the hanger in his hand, I really thought him to be a head taller.</p>
               <p>I believe you said very honestly, being so much terrified you would not for the world swear to him? - That is the truth.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Lyon a thieftaker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What has he said to you and the little girl about the reward? - He said, as he broke no locks, that there was no reward; that they had nothing for their trouble, and did it all at their own expences.</p>
               <p>Did not Lyon say something about swearing that the outer door was shut when they came in? - They looked particularly at the latch; it was a spring latch.</p>
               <p>What has the thieftaker Lyon said to you about the door? has not he said this to you, that if the door was not broke they would have nothing at all? - Really I do not remember; he said, if the door had been locked, then there would have been forty pounds; and I asked this thieftaker, says I, and you will have part of this forty pounds? no; says he, as they broke no locks there will be no reward of forty pounds.</p>
               <p>This was said in the hearing of your little girl? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted you left the business of indicting this young man entirely to them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they ever tell you that they had indicted this young man for a burglary? - No, I thought it would come to transportation as he broke no locks; I enquired of them what it would be; I believe it was only said, to get a shilling or two out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. The street door you say was open? - Yes, it was hooked back.</p>
               <p>Was the shop door shut or open? - The shop door was shut with a spring latch.</p>

               <p>Do you know the nature of an oath? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know when you are sworn what you are bound to do? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know what you ought to do when you take an oath? - Tell the truth.</p>
               <p>What will happen to you if you do not tell the truth? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard, if you were to tell a falsehood when you take an oath what would become of you? - I should go to Hell.</p>
               <p>That is a bad place, is it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will any thing happen to you here before you die if you take a false oath? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know that people that swear falsely are punished here by the law and the officers of justice? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Well then, I will tell you that they are, therefore take care to tell the truth? - I was in the shop with Mrs. Bearblock when these men came in; the street door was hooked back; the shop door was shut, and upon the latch; they came in and shut the street door after them; they did not lock it, only shut it; then they opened the shop door, and shut it after them, then they drew a hanger or a cutlass, and said to my mistress, your money or your life; then my mistress said, I keep no ill; I have no money; then my mistress came behind the counter, and the man came and looked behind a little curtan, and took two tea spoons; then they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130084"/> put one hand in one pocket and the other in the other, and took what money there was; I did not see what money it was; then they said, they would not go away with what they had; then my mistress took her watch and laid it on the table.</p>
               <p>Did they say any thing that you recollect before she gave them her watch? - They asked her for her watch two or three times before she gave it them; they said, they would have it, they would not go away without it.</p>
               <p>Did they say they would do any thing if they had it not? - They said, they would not go away with what they had, and they asked my mistress for her watch two or three times; then she took her watch from her side and laid it upon the table.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>You do not remember that you said any thing at that time? - I do not remember I said any thing.</p>
               <p>Were you much frightened at that time? - Very much; after they had got the watch, they took the candle and put it down in the entry; then they took the key of the street door, and opened the door and took the key and double locked it and went away, and took the key with them.</p>
               <p>Have you your recollection well enough to know the men afterwards? - I know this one.</p>
               <p>How soon did you see him afterwards? - I only saw him at the Justice's the very next day.</p>
               <p>Who sent for you to the Justice's? - The runners came for me, I do not know their names.</p>
               <p>What did they tell you when they came for you, what did they say to you? - I do not know indeed what they said.</p>
               <p>Recollect as well as you can? - They shewed us this young man.</p>
               <p>But before you went, when they came for you to go to the office, did they tell you what you were to go to the office for? - No, I do not know.</p>
               <p>What did they say? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Recollect my girl, tell us as well as you can, recollect what the people said when they came for you to go to the office? - They said they were going to take me to the office.</p>
               <p>Did they tell you what they were taking you to the office for? - No, they did not; I went with my mistress.</p>
               <p>Did you know what you were going to the office for? - I went to the office in expectation of seeing somebody that was taken up, and to see whether this was the young man.</p>
               <p>When you got to the office who shewed you this young man? - The runners brought him out of a place into the office.</p>
               <p>They shewed him to you, and asked you if that was the person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know him when you saw him? Yes, directly.</p>
               <p>Was he dressed in the same clothes that he had on when he was in the shop? - Yes, all but the great coat; he had not the same great coat on.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was the person? - Yes, Sir, very sure.</p>
               <p>Should you know the other man if you saw him? - No.</p>
               <p>Why do you think you should know the prisoner better than the other man? - Because he had been in the shop two or three times before he did it; I am sure he had been there three times.</p>
               <p>When was that? - I did not mind when it was; but I am sure I have seen him in the shop three times before.</p>
               <p>What to buy things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you saw him in the shop the night of the robbery did you recollect that you had seen him before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If you had seen him any where else but at the office should you have known him? - Yes, Sir, any where.</p>
               <p>After they had taken your mistress's watch, did they say any thing to you in the shop? - No, I do not remember that they did.</p>
               <p>Have you told us all that you recollect about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, my little girl, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130085"/> saw this young man at the office the very day after the robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you as positive to him then as you are now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Look out the examination at the Magistrate's.</p>
               <p>Did not you say this several times over,</p>
               <p>"I remember there were several people present, I am not sure to the man, I think the men that were in the shop were taller than the prisoner?" - My mistress said so.</p>
               <p>You heard her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you say the same as your mistress several times over? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Was not you several times distinctly asked whether you were certain to him, and whether your answer was not several times over, that you was not sure that he was the man? - Yes, I think they did say something like that.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect that you several times told him that you was not quite sure? Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not the very farthest that you got no farther than this, I verily believe that he is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After a great deal of examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then before the Justice you never did say positively that he was the man? - I do not know whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Did not you before the Justice say you thought they were taller? - I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Then did not you tell the Justice you thought your mistress was mistaken? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, it seems to me to be a great grievance that they draw up the examinations in a legal form, and we never get them in the words of the witness.</p>
               <p>Court. The information should be taken in the words and language of the witness, and not corrected, even in false English afterwards; and there is the same grievance in drawing affidavits in our Courts, and still more so in drawing up interrogatories; I pay little attention to interrogatories; the case that we tried yesterday, on the trial of Griffiths, for the murder in Black-friars was as clear a case for the perfect acquittal of the prisoner as ever came before a Court of Justice; not withstanding which, upon the depositions, though they were the same witnesses, I thought it at the best, a very bad manslaughter, if not a murder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Upon the circuit, Lord Loughborough took this course, there were confessions taken, and they were constantly put into legal shape, he constantly rejected them, and desired the Justices might know, that if they sent them in that form, he would constantly reject them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, my little girl, in the course of what your mistress said, you had heard her tell the Justice the men were a head taller than the man you then saw? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you mention to the Justice that you thought it was a mistake? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear positively that you did not say so? - I do.</p>
               <p>Now, when they came to take you to the office, they told you, you were going to the office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they tell you they had got one of the men who had committed the robbery? - They said, they believed they had one of the men that committed the robbery; that my mistress and me must go and see whether he was the man or not.</p>
               <p>Do you remember somebody asking you to go backwards and pick him out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was before this man was brought out to you? - No, Sir, it was not; for I saw this man; and then the next night they took me down into a room full of people.</p>
               <p>Did not you see this gentleman, Mr. Bowen, at the Justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it not proposed at the first to go and see whether you could pick him out? - No, Sir, I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>You are sure that he had not on the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130086"/> great coat that he had on when he was in your shop? - I am quite sure he had not; in the shop he had a striped brown and white; when I saw him at the Justice's he had a dirty blue on.</p>
               <p>As different as my gown and your cloak? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know Lyon the thieftaker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you had any talk with Lyon since this man was taken about this business? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Recollect what Lyon has said to you, about this man, and about the robbery? - He said, he belonged to creditable parents in Rathbone-place; and that was all he said.</p>
               <p>How came he to tell you that? - When he came to our shop.</p>
               <p>That was before you went to the Justice's, what else did he say at that time? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Did they say they were sure he was one of them? - No, but they believed that was the man.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you that he had found your mistress's watch upon him? - Yes, Sir, going into a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>That was before you went to the Justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That made you sure that he must be the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that Lyon told your mistress and you, at your own house? - Yes, and another man that was with him brought the watch to my mistress, and shewed the seal, and said, he had found it on the person of this young man going into a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Now, I want to know what Lyon has said to you since this young man was committed? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Have you had no talk with Lyon or Mansfield, or Hyde, about a reward? - They said, there was a reward about it; I heard them say two or three times, that they believed it was, but they were not sure, as there was no lock broke.</p>
               <p>Now, if there was a lock broke, what was the reward to be? - I do not know, forty pounds.</p>
               <p>How was that reward to be got? - It was to be divided amongst them all.</p>
               <p>Was you to have none of it? - No.</p>
               <p>How was it that Lyon told you to help him to this reward? - I was not to help him to it.</p>
               <p>What was you to have to help him to this reward? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with him about the street door being shut or open? - They asked us if we were quite sure, and could swear, that the street door was on the latch.</p>
               <p>Why did they ask you that? - I do not know; about the reward.</p>
               <p>Why that would make all the difference? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who told you so? - All of them; I do not know whether it was the carrotty one.</p>
               <p>You like a good girl told them you would not swear more than was true? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it that Lyon asked you if you could be positive to the person of this young man? - I do not know what day.</p>
               <p>Did he yesterday? - I think he asked me just now since we was turned out of Court, whether I was sure and positive that that was the man at the bar.</p>
               <p>And that while your mistress was under examination? - Yes; I told him, I knew his face very well; but he was dressed all in black.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He asked me if I could be sure of the man's person; I said, he was all in black, but I was sure of his face; he said no more, but walked backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Had he ever told you that unless you swore to him they would not get the reward? - They said, unless my mistress would swear to him they should not get the reward; she would not swear to him, because she was not sure.</p>
               <p>They said that in your hearing? - They did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130087"/>Had they said any thing of that sort to you before you was examined at the Justice's? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell you at any time, that if you swore to the man you should have a part of the reward? - They said all along that I should have a part of the reward if I swore to the man, and if I did not, none of us would have it; I think it was Lyon that said so, the man in the carrotty hair, and he is the man that talked to me at the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever say at the Justice's or any where else, that you was not sure whether this was the man or not? - I said, at first, I was not sure; then they told me to look at him, and I looked at him a good while; and then I swore to him.</p>
               <p>Now speak honestly, and tell me whether you know him now, and whether you should have known him if you had seen him any where else? - Yes, I really should; and I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>You are sure, independent of what those men have said to you, that if you look attentively at this man you should have known him elsewhere? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you never think that both the men were taller than this man? - No, the other was a full head taller than this man; this was the man that riffled my mistress's pockets; the other did nothing.</p>
               <p>Jury. What induced you to change your opinion? - Because I looked at him.</p>
               <p>Court. There is at present no imputation on this young witness, but a very strong one on the conduct of these people; at first it did not come out, but now it does come out very strongly.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer belonging to Litchfield-street; on the 8th of December, information came to the office about half after seven, or near eight, that the prosecutrix had been robbed; they mentioned the watch and other things that had been lost; in consequence of that information, I and two others went out to look after some people; I went into the Black Dog, St. Giles's, and at a pawnbroker's shop facing the Black Dog, we saw the prisoner and two other men at a distance with him; it was on that same night about half past nine; it was at the corner of Bowl yard, in Broad St. Giles's; the prisoner was at the back door of the pawnbroker's shop in a dark passage.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts were the other two men? - They were more in the Broad part of St. Giles's; he was more up the passage.</p>
               <p>At what distance might they be? - They might be twenty feet from the prisoner; he was in the yard, and they were in the street, at the entrance into the yard.</p>
               <p>How far was he up the passage? - I believe it to be twenty feet from the back door to St. Giles's; the back door is under the gateway.</p>
               <p>How far up is the back door from the entrance of the gateway? - I believe it to be about twenty feet.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was the prisoner? - He was at the back door, the other two men were in St. Giles's, at the corner of the gateway; I said, to the two young fellows that were with me, look after them; and they went and looked, and they began to move off; I went up to the prisoner and asked him if they sold gin in that shop; he said, no, it was a slap bang shop.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of that? - I take it to mean where they sell leg of beef and pease soup.</p>
               <p>You understood it to be an eating-shop? Yes; I told him if it was, I would go in and have twopenny-worth; and I took hold of him at the same time; I sent Lyon into the shop to see if he had pawned any thing, while I kept him at the door; Lyon came out and said, bring him in; before we got in, Lyon took this watch from him.</p>
               <p>Did you see the watch? - Yes, it was in his hand.</p>
               <p>Where had the prisoner the watch? - He had it in his right hand pocket; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130088"/> not see the prisoner take the watch out of his pocket myself; I saw Lyon take it out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Have you had that watch in your possession ever since? - Ever since that night.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say when the watch was found upon him? - I asked him whose watch it was; he said, he was going to pawn it for a young woman, a relation of his; I asked him if he could tell the maker's name or number; he said, yes, he could; I called for a pen and ink to write it down, and he could not tell the maker's name, but he told the number.</p>
               <p>You had him in the shop then, he told the number right? - Yes; after that I left him in custody, while I went in pursuit of the others, but they got off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Upon your oath were they not Oakes and Petit? - Upon my oath I do not know; I heard the prisoner mention one Oakes before the Magistrates; he might say he had this to pawn for Oakes; and that the two men were Oakes and Petit.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear him tell the Magistrate that he was going to pawn the watch for Oakes? - Yes; I did not tell the Justice.</p>
               <p>Have you never said, he told you at the pawnbroker's, that he was going to pawn this watch for Oakes? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Have you been after a man of the name of Oakes and Petit for this robbery? - No; I heard 
               <persName id="t17861213-82-person725">
                  James

             say he had been after them.</p>
               <p>Whether the two young men you saw at the corner of the passage were taller or shorter than the prisoner at the bar? - I believe one to be about his own size, and one about half a head taller.</p>
               <p>After you took this young man you had not the notice of this robbery? - I had not seen the information; but I had the notice second hand.</p>
               <p>Did you go out first having notice of this robbery on Mrs. Bearblock? - I had heard of it before I went out.</p>
               <p>As soon as you went up the passage and desired your companions to follow the other men they got off? - Yes.</p>
               <p>On your oath, do not you know who these two men are? - No, I do not, they were not old acquaintances of mine; I had not heard from Lyon or Hyde who they were; I had never seen them before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You searched this young man afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you find any key of any street door on him, any fire arms, any cutlass, any hanger? - No, nothing but a bad shilling and a good shilling.</p>
               <p>Have you had any talk with any body after you was sworn to day, since you went out of Court, about the prisoner's person? No.</p>
               <p>Have you heard any body talk about it? No.</p>
               <p>To that little girl? - No, nor I have not spoken to her since I saw her before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Where is Lyon now? - He is out of Court.</p>
               <p>Have you been in his view ever since you have been out of Court? - Not all the time; I went into the porters room; I never saw any body take notice of the little girl.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation about the reward? - I have had no conversation about it; I did not give myself so much trouble; I have known Lyon about a couple or three months; he was there some years ago according to conversation; he is no particular acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Does not he attend office regularly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know as little of Mr. Hyde since he returned from transportation I suppose? - I know so little of him I did not know he was there.</p>
               <p>(The watch handed to the Court.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. You was with Mansfield when this young man was taken? - Yes, I went into the shop, I said to the prisoner, what have you got? says he, what is that to you? says I, I must see, you are upon no good, or something of that sort; Mansfield was out of doors standing on the steps, and Hyde was on the other side; says the prisoner I have got this, and pulled this watch out of his waistcoat pocket; says I, whose is this? says he my own; says I, this is not a man's watch, it is a lady's watch; upon which he said he was sent to pawn it; I asked him by whom; he told me he was sent by Mrs. Simpson, No. 4, Rathbone-place; we did not believe him, and took him to St. Ann's watch-house; we took him to the Cock first; he wanted to speak to Mr. M'Dolland; we let him speak to him; and then took him to the watch-house; he gave me nothing but the watch; the other man found the seal afterwards.</p>
               <p>Who did you give the watch to? - To one or other of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you write down No. 4, Rathbone-place? - No, I kept in my head, and the next morning I sent Hyde up there.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the Justice he had said so? - I was asked no questions at all, only whether I took the watch from him.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the oath you took? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not tell the Justice what he said about Mrs. Simpson? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body else near the pawnbroker's? - Yes, two men.</p>
               <p>Who were they? - I cannot tell for a certainty.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, who do you believe they are? - I believe they were some accomplices of his.</p>
               <p>Do not you believe they were Oakes and Petit? - I do not believe any thing about it; I have never been after them.</p>
               <p>Were the two men that you saw, taller or shorter than the prisoner? - They were both of them taller; he stood on the step, but they were a good deal taller.</p>
               <p>Was this young man examined in the same clothes at the Justice's that you took him in? - I believe he was, he had a great coat on.</p>
               <p>Was the watch shewn to the prosecutrix? - I do not know whether it was or no, I did not shew it her; Mumford had the watch.</p>
               <p>What trade was you? - I had been a painter and glazier.</p>
               <p>Whom might you work with? - For Mr. Southey in Wild street.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you prosecute this young man for the reward? - I will answer you all legal questions; I do not wish for any reward, but if there is any reward to be given, I expect it.</p>
               <p>Have you talked to any people about the reward? - I talked to a good many people; you know young beginners want to learn; you know you called me a sucking thief-taker the other day.</p>
               <p>Young beginners, sucking thief-takers want to learn a little, do they? - So you said.</p>
               <p>What do you say to learning girls? - I do not deal with little girls.</p>
               <p>Have you had any particular conversation about the reward for this young man? - No more than what was said in open company; other people instructed me what to do.</p>
               <p>You gave instructions to indict this man? - I got the instructions made out.</p>
               <p>Was you so good as to instruct any body else about it? - I did not know</p>
               <p>Then of course you did not? - No, I did not, that I swear positively.</p>
               <p>You never told any body, that if he was sworn to positively, there would be a reward? - No, never in my life.</p>

               <p>Have you talked to her to day? - I said is that the man at the bar, and she said yes, but he has got a black coat on now; I said no more, but turned away.</p>
               <p>You did not ask now if she could not swear positively to his face? - I asked her that certainly, when I said is that the man at the bar.</p>
               <p>Then you said nothing else to her? - Not to my knowledge, but I do not take upon myself to remember every particular little thing.</p>

               <p>Court to prisoner. I think it right to tell you before you leave the bar; notwithstanding your youth, that the fact upon which you have been convicted on the clearest evidence, is of such an aggravated nature, and so extremely dangerous in its consequences, that you can expect no mercy from your Sovereign; you must therefore prepare yourself accordingly; the circumstance of your having been well brought up is an aggravation to your crime. I feel for your relations very much.</p>

I found Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Conn, two neighbours, in the parlour, drinking a pint of porter, the prisoner was asleep on one side of the fire place; as we had lost a parcel out of that room, they suspected the prisoner, and suggested he was not asleep;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130094"/> they went out of the room soon after; and I went and searched in the cupboard to see if there was any thing I could lose; I looked in the cupboard, and saw nothing but a few brass candlesticks; I went into the tap-room; and I heard a lock shut; I went into the room, and saw the prisoner turning from the cupboard to the fire place; in about a quarter of an hour, I saw the prisoner come through the room with a bundle under his left arm, he went thro' us all, and was taken with the bundle upon him; I saw him taken, it contained a great coat and a pair of boots belonging to the prosecutor, which were in the parlour.</p>
               <p>- WHITAKER sworn.</p>
               <p>I looked thro' a sash door, and saw him open this cupboard door of Mr. Clarkson's, and shut it again, in consequence of which I went into the yard, to see if I could see it plainer, when I was in the yard I could not distinguish any thing in the room, then I followed after him; and he was stopped about fifty yards from the house; I was six yards distance, he had this bundle under his left arm; I asked him what he had there, he seemed very much alarmed, and said it was a great coat, I asked him if it was his, he said no, but he had lost one; it contained a great coat and a pair of boots, this is the bundle, I have had it ever since.</p>

               <p>As to my swearing, that I saw him with these boots and things and bundle I did not, there was a curtain to the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I am afraid I shall not be able to say as much as I could wish in my own defence; but however, as I am convinced I shall receive every indulgence, I beg my defence may be read.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, this is his defence, which he wishes to be read; and I can assure the Court I have not altered it, it is his own composition. -</p>
               <p>(Read.)</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am well aware how much incapable I am of addressing myself to you, on so critical and so trying an occasion as the present; but as I am convinced you will afford me every indulgence consistent with my situation, I must request your attention, to what, I hope, will at least excite your pity, if not prove a mitigation for my punishment. The fact for which I am here arraigned, has been so very fully established, that I will take up but little of your time in animadverting upon the evidence received by your Lordship from the witnesses; that little, will be merely in observing, that as all the witnesses (except Inshaw, the owner of the property) have uniformly declared, that they watched me throughout the whole proceeding; I wish to suggest, that in consequence of their testimony in that respect, whether it does not do away the capital part of the offence; inasmuch as they might have prevented me from removing the property out of the back parlour, much less out of the house, as I had the tap-room to pass through, where the witnesses were in waiting, and the bar also to pass by; how far the construction of the law may in that case be in my favour, I leave your Lordship to inform the Gentlemen of the Jury: - My Lord, I have great reason to suppose (although I know not that it will avail me any thing) that the prosecution has been carried on at the expence of the Parish, in which the fact was committed; and that the matter would probably have been dropped, had that not have been the case: I have likewise to mention the extreme unwillingness of the owner to prosecute: He comes from Birmingham, and he much wished, I believe, to drop the prosecution; for, on being sworn at Bow-street the morning after I was apprehended, and, on entering into a recognizance for his appearance, he, unacquainted with his situation, and the necessity there was for attendance at this place, asked Mr. Justice Bond if he was at liberty to return, as he much wished to proceed upon his own affairs; he received an answer in the negative; but was at the same time informed, that if it was distressing to his circumstances<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130095"/> to attend the trial, by an application to this court, he would be reimbursed his expences; from all which, I infer, that had Inshaw, the owner of the coat and boots, been left to his own discretion, the prosecution would not have been carried on, had the expences attending it, not been defrayed by the parish. My Lord, this being the first time I ever was brought to this, or any other bar, I hope will have its due weight with the Court: My friends, who attend in my behalf being numerous, and all men of excellent character, and approved integrity, of my former general character they will give you the best account: My Lord, five years (a great part of the late war) I served as midshipman in the navy, and I hope with credit and reputation to myself; I have here three certificates to prove my character, both as an officer and as a man; I have no doubt but that the Captain, by whom two of them are signed, would have willingly appeared, was he in town; but he is at present on board his ship; if, however, he had attended, he could not have said more for me, than he has already done in those certificates. My Father was formerly in a respectable, if not a capital line of business in the Strand; but by unforeseen misfortunes and accidents, is now much reduced; his friends, however, did not forsake him; and through their interest it was I got the situation in his Majesty's service I have mentioned; at present, therefore, it was not in his power to support me:</p>
               <p>I need not inform your Lordship that on the peace being concluded, I, with hundreds more of the same rank, was left destitute and unprovided; but I have to acquaint your Lordship, that since April, 1783, I have supported myself genteely, and maintained that character, which I have only to grieve I ever lost, embracing every opportunity of getting an honest livelihood, in hopes that my friends would at last have found out an eligible prospect for my getting a living; until about two months ago; when losing every hope, I was compelled to pledge most of my own books, wearing apparel, &amp;c. of which I had a good quantity, and at last to do that act for which I now appear at your bar: Among many other occasions of procuring subsistence was that of officiating as a <rs id="t17861213-84-deflabel439" type="occupation">clerk to Mr. Alderman Watson</rs>

My Lord, after the very humiliating and mortifying circumstance of appearing as a criminal in this Court, be my fate what it may, I cannot but think it an indispensable duty, to my numerous and respectable friends, to quit this kingdom; I have only therefore to request, that if it lies in your breast, I may rather be permitted to become a VOLUNTARY EXILE than leave my native country as a WRETCHED CONVICT.</p>
               <p>I beg leave, in the most unfeigned manner, to return my sincere and hearty acknowledgements to this Court, for the great indulgence I have received by taking up so much of your time, and for the attention that has been shewn me during the whole of my trial; assuring them, that I shall receive with the most profound humility, that verdict which a Jury of my countrymen shall think proper to inflict, at the same time acquainting them, I throw myself entirely on the mercy and lenity of this honourable Court.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner last Thursday was a week, about half past seven in the morning, in Mrs. Followell's yard; I lodge in the house; I did not see him go in; he was taking this lead and cock off the top of the tub; I saw him shaking it, and give it a twist off; I did not see him with any knife in his hand; he had a white cap on and no hat; I was frightened; I went into the shop and told a young woman; I could not see into the yard then, so that I did not see what he did with the lead.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he saw you when you saw him first? - I am not sure; that young woman went into the yard and she called, and said, who is there? he did not answer the first time; then he said, yes; says I, there is a thief in the yard has cut the cock off; he came out with his hand behind him, and he came to me, says he, d - n your eyes, you bitch, what do you make such a noise for? says I, you have been cutting the cock off; so he ran away, and said, d - n you and your cock too; I ran after him; he cried stop thief, very loud; he was taken; he was not out of my sight; he was brought back to our house.</p>

               <p>How could you see the knife if the candle was put out? - Why, it was remarkable moonlight, not only so, I particularly noticed the girl as I was going down stairs, for I had a dread on my spirit on being in such a place; I noticed her particularly before the candle was put out, and when the candle was put out, there was no light but the light of the moon.</p>
               <p>What doors or windows were there to let the light of the moon in? - There was only a door and that was shut.</p>
               <p>Was there any window to the passage? - No.</p>

Bentley was at the bottom of the stairs when the other lighted me down, and she took hold of my gown; I saw her at the bottom as I was coming down; as soon as the other put out the candle they both began to strip me; one had hold of one gown sleeve, and the other the other; when they began to strip me they threw the door wide open; and I began to scream out murder; then they shut to the door again; Whitehead opened and shut the door.</p>

               <p>Relate what passed after he came there? - When he came, I went out, he followed me, and said what he had suffered by his wife leaving him, and a young family, and threatened he would have me taken up for harbouring his wife, who had left a husband, and a sick family.</p>

               <p>Did he do so? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You seem to me to have given a very fair and full account, and not to have suppressed any thing; the purpose of this man's coming, was to see his wife and child? - Yes; the wife slept with me; she was no relation to me, I only lodged in the same house with this man's wife; Lee was own brother.</p>
               <p>There was a boy that was in the blue-coat school? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know these people much? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lee which is dead, was one of Mr. Romaine's congregation, was not she? - Yes, she was a pew-opener.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect this man's saying that he should complain to Mr. Romaine? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>You say she was black in the face; do you remember her saying that he was a rascal and villain, and that if he attempted to deprive her of her bread, she would lay him in gaol for life? - Yes, I do; her hands were clinched, and she was black with passion.</p>
               <p>To all this he said, madam, your age and sex protects you, but if you do provoke me, I will throw down all your tea-things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Has Lee both his arms? - Only one.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing this man bloody, soon after he was knocked down? - Yes, I do; my hands were all over blood endeavouring to part them.</p>
               <p>Did not Lee instantly after he knocked down this man, take hold of the poker and endeavour to get it? - They were all struggling at one time.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you may have heard from Lee that he did take the poker? - Yes, Lee told me at the same time that it was a mercy there was never a knife in the way; he said he went to the poker in his own defence; all their hands were at the same time at the poker; I got some blows in endeavouring to part them; the first thing I saw was the poker in Lee's hand at the bottom of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing the prisoner's son there, the blue-coat boy? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Now after this man had thrown drown her tea things, did you hear the deceased hooting at him and saying, now you have done it finely? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had no idea that this woman had received any blow while you was in the 
room? - No, Sir.</p>


               <p>Upon the oath you have taken, do you believe that any wilful blow was given to that woman by any body? - No Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Lee's swearing that he would massacre them? - Yes Sir, he had the poker and kept the others off; then one of them said, lay down the poker and fight us like a man.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not know this man before that time? - No.</p>
               <p>You have seen him since that time? - I never saw him since that time till to day.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130111"/>Have you had no conversation with him since the affair happened nor since you gave your evidence before the Coroner? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you had no conversation on his behalf since you gave your evidence before the Coroner? - I have had no conversation with any body but his wife.</p>
               <p>You said just now that you had no notion of this woman having received a blow till you came down the stairs? - No Sir, I had not.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell us that you saw the woman down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you then conceive that she had received a blow? - No Sir, I never saw the least of a blow in the world till I saw her down at the door all over blood.</p>
               <p>Have you had no conversation with any body about your evidence, since you gave your evidence before the Coroner? - No Sir, not particularly, many have asked me, and I have told them; I did not recollect every circumstance at first; I was much frightened and so was she.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. From this evidence I submit whether Lee is competent to be examined; for one or other of these men, either by accident or design, has occasioned her death?</p>

               <p>Relate now what passed in the room with the prisoner and yourself, one Morgan, and Mrs. Peter, and your mother. - I came home in the interim, and saw all the place in confusion, and as soon as I entered the room, I hit my brother directly, and he hit me again; I hit him a blow as soon as he came into the room.</p>
               <p>I believe you hit him a pretty hard blow; you knocked him down the first time? - Yes, I did, upon that I instantly got hold of the poker, and hit him again with the poker.</p>
               <p>How came you to lay hold of the poker? - Because he and the other young man in the room were going to hit me again, and I laid hold of the poker and hit them both.</p>
               <p>Morgan had struck you then? - Yes, he had hit me.</p>
               <p>Tell us distinctly what happened in this unfortunate business? - I was in the affray, and received a blow on my head with wringing the poker out of my hand, then I got hold of the prisoner directly, and pulled him out of the room.</p>
               <p>Court. I will ask you at once the question; did you see your mother receive a blow, before you pulled the prisoner out of the room? - No Sir, if he had been my own brother over and over, if I had seen him, I would have done so.</p>
               <p>You did not know of that misfortune till after? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Then in what way that blow was struck, whether in the struggle for the poker by you all three you do not know? - No Sir, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was your mother in the state of a dying woman, any time before early on Wednesday morning? - I cannot say, for I was not in the room with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not suspect that this man had any design to kill your mother? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the witnesses behind, are only for the purpose of proving that the blow given to this unfortunate woman, from whose hand soever it proceeded, was most undoubtedly the cause of her death; but if it is not proved that that blow was given by the prisoner, that death cannot certainly be imputed to him in any degree; and here there is no evidence at all from either of the witnesses present: Mr. Lee has given a very fair evidence, and he states expressly, that he did not see the blow given; and therefore it does appear that this was an unhappy accident arising from the affray.</p>

               <p>Was this the first time you heard your husband complain of being hurt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you hear him complain of being hurt? - On the Tuesday morning; but he was ill directly; I had much ado to get him back from the Compter; he complained of being in very great pain.</p>
               <p>Where did he complain of the pain? - All the pain he complained of was in his stomach and belly.</p>
               <p>How did he appear to be the following day? - He was very full of pain all that morning, and the whole day, and at six on the Tuesday evening, I sent for a surgeon.</p>
               <p>When did he appear to be dangerously ill? - He complained very much the whole time; and he died on Friday morning, ten minutes after five; during the Thursday, he was very bad during the night.</p>
               <p>Did he apprehend himself on the Thursday night, to be in danger of his life? - Yes, he always said so.</p>
               <p>On the Thursday night or Friday morning, did he say any thing respecting this hurt? - I did not hear him, but there is a man that did.</p>

               <p>Your husband I take for granted, was more than usually jovial on the occasion? - I do not know but he might, he had not drank a great deal; we had but three bottles of wine, and there were eleven or twelve drank out of them; my husband was not sober, nor so much in liquor then, as as I have seen him.</p>
               <p>This young man, beyond all question, behaved very imprudently? - He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk or sober? - I do not recollect in my flurry.</p>

               <p>Was he taken up again till after your husband died? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Do you remember your husband saying, that they need not take him to the Compter, for they would settle it by making him ask his pardon and give a treat? - I did not hear any such word pass.</p>
               <p>Was your husband a very lusty man? - Yes lusty, but not very lusty.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that while you staid at the watch-house, there was no punch nor drink of any sort had? - I saw none, we did not stop three minutes.</p>

I have got my death's wound, which was his cry till he died; I was the person that was with him; he said, oh; that villain has given me my death's wound, he said in his privates, where one man should not hurt another; he said that he was both kicked and punched; and the last breath that he drew but one, he said oh! that villain has been my death; and the last breath that ever he drew, he said, oh! that villain.</p>

               <p>But at the time when the scuffle happened between Mr. Delew and him, what words passed? - I cannot say, they scuffled some time before they fell; I did not see any more falls but one; Mrs. Delew was in the parlour; she was holding her husband down; he complained, and he said oh! my dear, I am hurt very much;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130116"/> and he did not tell her till she got him his hat, and went with him to the watch-house to give a charge.</p>
               <p>Court. During his illness, where did he complain chiefly of the pain and illness? - The apothecary ordered him to be bathed with oil; he kept saying to me, I do not mind you being my mother; I do not like a stranger to bathe me; I beg you will bathe me lower, and lower; there was his pain.</p>
               <p>Did he complain that his pain was in his private parts? - Yes, more than any where else, and when he was dead the mortification took place.</p>

               <p>The prisoner and two others came in about twelve in the night, on Monday the 27th instant, I think it was; they asked at the door for me; Mrs. Delew opened the door; she came into the parlour, and told me there were three persons wanted me; I went into the tap-room, and found the prisoner and two others, and they were a little in liquor; I begged of them to be as peaceable as they could, and I asked them to walk into the parlour, and have something to drink; they had a shilling's-worth of punch, and two bottles of wine; a third was called for, and while the landlord was gone for it, the prisoner went to Mrs. Delew, and stroked her down her handkerchief; I begged of him to desist and behave like a man; upon that he quitted her, clapped his two hands on each side my face, and kissed me; I took and knocked him over the table; he immediately returned the blows, and several passed between him and me; after that was over, some altercation took place, between Mrs. Delew and him; several bad words passed, and she slapped his face three or four times; I do not know whether the watch was sent for; and he endeavoured to escape before they came to get out of the house; I stopped him near the door; the deceased came, and insisted he should go to the watch-house, and a scuffle ensued between them at the bottom of the stairs, and several blows passed on each side; with that I interfered, got the prisoner upon the settle, and Mrs. Delew got her husband up and set him on the stairs; we separated them; in the interval the watch came and took him to the watch-house, and charge was given to take him to the Compter; he made his escape going to the Compter; I never heard that Mr. Delew was hurt till the next morning; I saw the deceased the same morning between five and six, in his bedroom.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you been long at Mr. Delew's? - No Sir, the Change chimes were going twelve as I crossed Cornhill; I was asked on account of Mrs. Delew's birth-day; Mr. Delew was in liquor; he was a lusty corpulent man, a very stout able man; I have worked in the shop with the prisoner, five or six years; I have observed him very much adicted to women.</p>
               <p>You never had an idea of his kissing you? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Is he an ill-natured cruel sort of a fellow, or a good humour'd fellow? - He is the best humoured fellow I ever came nigh; when he was sober, there was hardly a possibility to rouse him; I have known people angry sometimes to see him put up with so much; not a man of a cruel revengeful temper; Mr. Delew was very angry at his behaviour to his wife; Mr. Delew dragged him to the foot of the stairs; I do not recollect any expression; I separated them as soon as I could.</p>
               <p>How many blows might they have given to each other? - I saw Mr. Delew give him one or two on the side; which I think he rather cried out at, and there was a severe struggle; I cannot say which had the best of it; I had no idea this man was mortally injured till four in the morning; I do not recollect whether I saw Mr. Delew at the watch-house, but I remember seeing her; I have no recollection of any drink.</p>
               <p>You was close to them when they were striking in the passage? - I was.</p>
               <p>If this young man had repeatedly kicked</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130117"/>Delew in an improper manner, must not you have seen it? - I think I must.</p>
               <p>Did he kick him at all that you know of? - He did not indeed that I know of, I did not hear any such complaint in the house, nor till I heard it in the watch-house; I stopped him in the passage, he then seemed to be desirous of going.</p>
               <p>What was the charge made against him at the watch-house? - For ill treating, and ill using Mr. and Mrs. Delew; he went to his work the next morning, and after that, came and surrendered himself to the constable; I was present; the constable told him he was not his prisoner then, without he chose to surrender; he said he was willing to go before a magistrate; the deceased being a very good man, he said no, if he will only acknowledge himself in a fault and come down a bit of something, I will forgive him; at that time I had no idea of its being a serious injury.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you quite sober yourself this evening? - I was strictly sober, as sober as I am this minute.</p>
               <p>Then you had an opportunity of observing all that passed distinctly? - I had; Mr. Delew had been drinking.</p>
               <p>All that you saw was a scuffle? - I saw no other to the best of my knowledge; I was the nearest person to them.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Delew present at any part of the scuffle? - Not till she came to separate them.</p>

               <p>I live in Wallbrook; I attended Mr. Delew; I saw him first on Tuesday evening, the 28th of November; I attended him to the day before he died; I saw him on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Court. What was his complaint? - When I first saw him, he told me he had a kick in the belly, and that he had great pain; he had with this a very considerable fever, and in consequence of the remedies that were ordered, the next morning he was considerably easier; during that day he was very sick, and on the Thursday, the sickness increased, and his pain also returned to a greater degree of pain, and the sickness continued during the latter part of Wednesday, and the whole of Thursday; on Thursday afternoon I dined out of town; the fever and the sickness were both very violent in the evening of Thursday; they sent to the apothecary; I saw him no more after; on Friday evening at six o'clock he died.</p>


               <p>Did you examine the body? - Yes, the bowels were very highly inflamed, and the caul that lays before them, and in some parts there were small livid spots, the first stage of a mortification; the inflammation of his bowels was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There was an incipient mortification? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From what that proceeded you do not affect to know? - By no means.</p>
               <p>Was he very corpulent? - He was.</p>
               <p>You would not have been at all surprized if he had died of a mortification in his bowels? - Not at all; we are all liable to that, particularly corpulent men who live free; he told me his pain was in his belly; he told me before he had been kicked in the belly; he shewed me; he put his hand on his belly; his private parts were not hurt, nor did he complain of them to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was there any mortification in the scrotum? - There was no blow on the scrotum.</p>
               <p>Did you order fomentation? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon the whole, can you from the view of the body, both before and since his death, form any probable judgment, whether the inflammation was occasioned by external violence or not? - A blow is a very common cause of an inflammation, especially in persons of his habit of body; a man who has drank very much, is more liable to mortifications from external injury.</p>
               <p>Was there any rupture? - There was none, that was the most probable cause of all the symptoms, but there was not the smallest disposition to it; I examined and found none.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. As far as the prisoner's character for humanity can be proved, I have a number of people.</p>
               <p>Court. It cannot be necessary after the evidence of Trott, and the character he gave him.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. You have had the misfortune of being the cause of this unfortunate man's death, and your conduct has been far from blameless; though you certainly did not intend what ensued, it is proper you should abide the consequences of what has happened. You, without any other apology, but that of being in liquor, insulted and ill treated his wife, and the violence that you used was the cause of his death. I am satisfied it was not the result of a malicious disposition; and I think it right also to say, that the aggravating circumstances that were given in evidence by one of the witnesses, Mrs. Cox, will not make any addition to your punishment; but if that circumstance had been fully proved, I should have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130119"/> thought it a manslaughter of the most aggravated kind; as the rest of the evidence against you has authorised the Court to lay that circumstance out of the question, of course the rigour of your punishment is considerably mitigated; therefore, the sentence of the Court is, that you be <rs id="t17861213-107-punish539" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>I know the prisoner very well; I saw him sign that confession; and I saw Mr. Bond the Justice sign it; there was not a single thing said to him; it was perfectly voluntary; I signed my name only once; but I heard him make two.</p>
               <p>What was the occasion of his making two? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was he talked to, was he persuaded? - I said nothing.</p>
               <p>Did any body say any thing to him to induce him to make the second? - I believe the only reason was, the man had made one confession, and he afterwards heard not a word from me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did Mr. Bond say to him? - I did not hear a word.</p>
               <p>Did not Mr. Bond say something like this, you have not told us all, is there not something more? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How was it that a man who had made one confession should make another? - From the time he had made the first confession; I was always in company with three or four people.</p>

               <p>Do you say, what he afterwards said, was without any inducement, and that without any persuasion he made another confession? - To the best of my knowledge he did.</p>
               <p>Did he say, now, Mr. Justice, you are but a fool of a Justice, for I have been making one confession, and I have not told you all? - No.</p>
               <p>Did the Justice say to him, now, Mr. Sumner, there is a great deal behind, and you had better tell the whole truth, was that the way? - Why Sir, as to that particular<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130120"/> way I know nothing about; it was nothing like that.</p>
               <p>What induced him to make a second confession? - I tell you once for all, I do not know; I did not hear any thing; but he said, he did it voluntarily; I did not see the second confession signed; I believe my name was to the first.</p>
               <p>What was the result of all this? - I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see this man sign two confessions? - I saw him sign one, no more.</p>
               <p>Which was that? - I think it was the confession about the bedstead.</p>

I said to the woman, open the door, we are officers; she immediately opened the door, and I went into the yard, and saw the prisoner Stevens; I seized him, there was a large quantity of property spread about the yard; here is the cuff of a gown the same as one that was lost; I found this tea spoon in the yard afterwards, the prisoner said, he would go very quietly with me; as soon as we came out on Saffron-hill, there were near a dozen of men that struck at Weaver; I saw them knock him down, endeavouring to rescue the prisoner from me, but Stevens did not do that himself; after I had secured him, I put him into New Prison, and searched him; I found in his breeches pocket six guineas and a half; in the cuff of his coat I took out a small piece of coin; I said, George, what is this? he said, it was a threepence; I saw it was a fourpence; I went back to the yard again, and found a picklock key, which key I tried at the prosecutor's door when double locked, and it opened it in the presence of the prosecutor; I then went to the house of Mrs. Mason, and searched and found three gowns and the rest of the things I have here; I took her in custody; and brought the things away; I did not know that a person of that description lived there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. Mason was examined before the Magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did she continue in custody? - Near a week; six days I believe.</p>
               <p>She is now admitted an evidence for the crown I suppose? - Yes; and she attends here.</p>
               <p>What did she say about Stevens when she was first examined? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Do not you remember that she said this, that the prisoner Stevens knew nothing about the things that you had found; that she declared on her oath that he was innocent; and that if they should swear to him it would be taking away his life wrongfully? - I do not recollect that; though I would not venture to say she did not; I believe she was up three times; I think she said the first time she did not know how they came there.</p>
               <p>At that time she did not say any thing against him? - No.</p>
               <p>She was brought up a second time? - Yes, the second time she said, that Stevens was one.</p>
               <p>How long had she laid in custody? - Five days.</p>
               <p>The Jew gentleman was already a witness? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - I really do not know; I believe he was admitted to bail last Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Had he made no charge against Mrs. Mason? - No, Sir; he knew nothing of her, nor she of him.</p>

               <p>How came you to buy these things? - These things the prisoners Stevens, and Robinson and Andrews, otherwise Anderson, brought into my house on Sunday se'night, in the evening, about eight o'clock; they brought them to me to buy.</p>
               <p>Do you deal in clothes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you usually buy and sell clothes on Sunday? - No, my Lord, I did not buy any before, nor I did not buy these, but I should have bought them if I had not been deterred by the officer; for before I could make the bargain the officers came.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to ask where they got them? - No.</p>
               <p>That would have been a dangerous question I suppose? - I never bought any thing before of them; they have bought things at my shop.</p>

               <p>Then you was examined the second time, and you told him the same story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, upon your oath, the first and second time did not you say that Stevens knew nothing of the matter? - I said no such thing; I never swore any such thing neither on the first or second examination.</p>
               <p>You know Mr. Lucy? - Yes.</p>
               <p> Lucy She said, if Stevens did not bring them there, she did not know how they came? - I did not say that; I did not know Stevens; I said, that the first time that Stevens was in my house, I did not know that he brought the property.</p>
               <p>They did bring it? - I told the Justice that at the first examination.</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury: It is necessary for me to state to you, that the indictment now preferred, imputes a crime to the prisoner of the last importance in a country, circumstanced and situated as this is; without a free and uninterrupted circulation of the paper money of this country, in which an infinite proportion of it's property consists, it is evidently clear that trade can no longer exist; and so sensible has the legislature been of this, that for many years last past, they have thought no security could be sufficient against the embezzlement of letters, or bank notes contained therein, excepting the exposing the transgressor to the hazard of his life. Gentlemen, I state thus much to you, God knows not to prejudice the prisoner, or tincture your minds in the smallest degree against him; but to convince you, and every man in this Court, that a frivolous or vexatious prosecution is not laid before you; and that there is public and essential, and material ground for this prosecution: I say this, knowing as I do perfectly well, that no twelve gentlemen of this City can get into that box, without being impressed with a still stronger duty, which is the attention to the interests of their fellow subjects, and fellow creatures: on the one hand therefore, you will be impelled by public necessity; on the other hand you will be impressed by the feelings of men, and from these two contending forces, your judgment I am convinced will go in a strait and right line.</p>

Gentlemen, enquiries were made by Mr. Fawcet after this letter at the General-post-office; no account could be given there of any individual letter; but you will see the channel into which it got, and you will find it was in a regular course of transmission to him; Mr. Fawcet was casting about in his mind how he could trace so, valuable a letter; it so happened, that on the 27th of October, one of these bank notes so inclosed was paid at the Bank; it occurred to Mr. Fawcet in the course of these six or seven days, that it was no very uncommon accident that it might possibly have slipped in among those letters, that the Post-office are in the daily habit of sending to the General penny-post-office; because if it be beyond a certain district they deliver it over to them to deliver; accordingly Mr. Fawcet made enquiry, and on the 30th or 31st of October at the chief Penny-post-office in Throgmorton-street, he learned that on the Friday, the 20th day of October, a letter which had been received in London, addressed to a person of the name of Mr.

             of Bucklersbury, and he desired a Mr. Hayward to make a memorandum upon it, and that it might be returned to the Penny-post-office in Throgmorton-street; in this return this crime was committed; Mr. Hayward being so advised to write upon it Pancrass-lane, he did so, and Mr. Gibbs put it into the box to go to the chief Penny-post-office, all the letters so to be returned, being regularly placed in this box for that purpose. Gentlemen, between seven and eight that evening, Mr. Hayward took the letters out, and this letter of Fawcet's, which had now become remarkable; he did in the common course of office tell the number of letters, and the amount of the postage; the number of letters were fifteen, which were so taken out of the return box; the postage was eight shillings and fourpence; he tied them up, and prepared a ticket to go with them, having arranged them according to the usual course of the office, they were ready for the person that was to take them back to the principal office; about eight the same night, the prisoner, whose employment it was to take them back to the principal office, came to the South office, and he took the letters and the ticket to carry to the great Penny-post-office; these letters were delivered by Dobson, all of them, but this one, between eight and nine that night, at the chief office; on the next morning, on looking at these letters, it was found that there was not fifteen but fourteen, and that there was a very considerable difference between the sum that these letters amounted to, and the eight shillings and fourpence charged for postage, for in truth it amounted but to six and twopence, which is two shillings and twopence short of eight shillings and fourpence; on the 31st of October, when all these circumstances were known, the chief letter sorter of the Penny-post-office sent for Gibbs, who checqued this letter as I have mentioned, and the prisoner at the bar were both examined about this matter, that is material<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130129"/> for you to advert to; of course he would say he delivered all the letters, and Gibbs was very sure that this letter had been amongst them, however he denied it; and there the matter rested for that day; on the 1st of November it was Dobson's duty to have attended, in order to be further employed in the course of the business; but he did not attend on that day, and on enquiry at his lodgings, no such person was to be found; now, these are the two circumstances that are to be connected together in your minds, that he had notice on the 30th of October, and on the 1st of November he absconded; on the 1st or 2d of November he was advertised in all the public papers; this advertisement, it is more than probable, might have come to his knowledge; and accordingly a letter was received by a woman of the name of Kinneaman, at No. 4, Colchester-street, Whitechapel, without any name, but in the following words.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Kinneaman,</p>
               <p>"I most humbly obliged to you if would</p>
               <p>"put the inclosed into the first Penny-post-office</p>
               <p>"as soon as possible, and as in</p>
               <p>"duty bound to pray for you." This was directed to a gentleman of the name of Horne, Mrs. Kinneaman knowing the letter to be of the prisoner's hand writing, though there was no signature, she carried this letter immediately to the General-post office, Mr. Horne opened this letter directed to him, and found it contained twelve bank notes, eleven of 20 l. and one of ten; on comparing these notes, there is every reason to apprehend, and good reason will be given to you to believe they are the same notes; from these circumstances it was adverted to where this letter should come from, and finding upon it the Bawtry post mark, the prisoner was traced and apprehended at Lithgow in Scotland; and on his being apprehended, from what motives I do not know, he himself chose to reveal every circumstance of the case; no sort of insinuation, no intimidation whatever was used, but in the same spirit that he returned all these notes, of which probably he had not made any use, in the same spirit it was, that his mind induced him to tell the whole story. Gentlemen, I think I may venture to say, that that will be demonstrated to you as clear as possible; it will be proved to you, that Tennant during his residence at Liverpool, never had in his custody more than four ten pound notes, one was sent to him by a gentleman of this city of the name of Bowman; and he received the other three from Fawcett, and three of those I can assert to you in the most clear and satisfactory manner, three of the thirty bank notes which I have mentioned to you, were ten pound bank notes, the numbers were 7055, dated 9th July, 1785; 1204, dated 7th July, 1786 and the note stated in the indictment 7553, dated the 26th of September, 1786: now, gentlemen, this was on the 12th, that Fawcett forwarded these notes to Liverpool, of course they were there on the 14th, which is material; Mr. Bowman sent on the 6th of September, one ten pound bank note with other notes, the number is 6042, dated 6th of September 1786; these notes sent on the 16th, must have arrived on the 18th; and this sent on the 12th, must have arrived on the 14th; between the 14th and 18th, therefore, Mr. Tennant was in possession of those four bank notes, and those only he will prove to you; and they will be traced, that he paid away three of those bank notes at Liverpool; two on the 16th, therefore these must be two that Mr. Fawcett sent; the other was paid on the 18th, which was the day of its arrival at Liverpool; and the fourth was transmitted to London on the 18th, in the letter to Fawcett; therefore it is clear that three of those notes were not Mr. Fawcett's notes, because you will have the numbers and dates of those three spoken to; and if three were paid away, that one which was not paid away of such a date, must be the one sent to Mr. Fawcett in the letter. Gentlemen, you will see that these two 7055, dated 9th July, 1785, and No. 1204, two of those sent by Fawcet to Tennant of Liverpool, were paid into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130130"/> Bank on the 18th of October; consequently they must be two of those that were paid to Mr. Tennant of Liverpool; those notes that were paid at the Bank, were paid on the 16th; now the third note, which is the ten pound note, that was put off at Liverpool, was paid by Tennant to a gentleman of the name of

             of that place; he paid it to Mr. Medcalf; he gave it to Mr. Vose, another clerk in that house; he entered from the note itself in the bill book a description of the note, in which it will appear to you, that this note was 6042, dated 6th of September, 1786, and is that identical note that was sent by Bowman on the 16th of October down to Liverpool, Gentlemen, the consequence of this deduction will be, that it will be very clearly proved to you that the note of ten pound No. 7553, was that note that was contained in the letter that was so embezzled; you will clearly see that two of these notes sent by Bowman, were paid at Liverpool, came here to the Bank and were there paid in cash; one of them sent by Bowman was also paid at the Bank; then the only remaining one which never was disposed of at Liverpool, or at all, which never has come to the Bank, and been received there, and which never was received by Mr. Fawcett, is the one that is left, therefore must be the fourth note; in as much as only four notes were in Tennant's possession there, and three of them are traced from his hands to their's. Gentlemen, this is the scope of the evidence I have to lay before you; that such letter was put in by Tennant of Liverpool; that such letter did find its way to the Post-office, at Saint Saviour's, Southwark; was observed and noticed, came into the hands of the Post-office; that a letter was missing, and a considerable portion of the total of the sum of the postages short; it will be proved to you, that four notes of ten pounds were in the hands of Tennant of Liverpool; that three of them were there disposed of; and the necessary and the irresistable consequence, is, that the fourth is this ten pound Bank note; if this evidence is proved, I should conceive that there will be but little doubt of your being under the melancholly necessity of finding the prisoner guilty. If you should think upon the whole, that there is not evidence enough to risque the life of a fellow subject; I am sure there is no man if it be done on good grounds (of which I am not aware) that will be more satisfied than I shall be, with the prisoner's acquittal; at the same time I am perfectly convinced that from the materiality of the case in either view of it, you will freely give it that portion of extreme attention which a case of this sort demands at your hands.</p>

               <p>Was there any thing written in the letter addressed to you? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>What was contained in it? - Upon the receiving that letter, I imagined from the direction of it, it was Dobson's hand writing; the letter contained several bank notes, and one 10 l. bank note, all of which I indorsed with my own name. (Looks at the bank notes.) This is the cover that contained them, and this is the ten pound note that was in that cover.</p>

               <p>Do you remember the maker's name? - I think it was Chivers.</p>
               <p>How long have you had that watch? - About six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Did you wear it constantly? - No; I sometimes wore it, and sometimes left it upon the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>Did you lose your watch any time in September? - Yes, I missed it in September.</p>
               <p>What day, do you recollect? - No, I do not; I believe it was in the beginning of September.</p>
               <p>Where did you miss it from? - I did not miss it; it was my maid that missed it; a gentleman came to take the lodgings, and after he was gone about a quarter of an hour, she missed the watch off the mantle piece, she told me.</p>
               <p>Had you seen it there? - Not that day.</p>
               <p>How long before? - I really cannot recollect how long before.</p>
               <p>Did you usually leave it there? - No, I did not make a practice of it.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time leave it there? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>In what room was it? - In the dining room.</p>
               <p>Did you know the number of it at that time? - Yes, I think I did at that time.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the number of it? - I really cannot say how long; I put the number upon a bit of paper since this happened.</p>
               <p>What have you done with that bit of paper? - I was looking for it, but I could not find it.</p>
               <p>As soon as you missed it what did you do? - I went to Sir Sampson Wright's.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the last witness? - I went to several pawnbrokers, and among them to Mr. Cooper's in Wych-street.</p>
               <p>At what time did you go to him? - I believe it was about three the same day.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him the number and name? - Yes, I believe I did.</p>
               <p>What sort of a chain had it then? - It had a steel chain.</p>
               <p>When was you sent for again by Mr. Cooper? - I cannot tell when it was; I was sent for the same day in the evening; I first called at his shop and then went up to Bow-street, there I saw a person that was detected of taking the watch.</p>
               <p>Is that the person that was in custody? - I really cannot tell you; if it is him he is very much altered indeed.</p>
               <p>Then you do not mean to swear to the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you never saw the prisoner before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him since he has been in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you for to see him? - He sent for me to let me know about his friends.</p>
               <p>When was that? - About two or three days after it happened.</p>
               <p>Was he then so altered that you did not know him? - No, he was not so altered then; there is a great deal of difference now.</p>
               <p>Do you know the watch enough to swear to it? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, upon this evidence I think I need not call the prisoner on his defence; you are to deliver<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130140"/> your verdict upon the evidence that is before you; and whatever one thinks of Clifton's evidence, he is to answer for that, that is between God and his own conscience; he will not swear to the watch; I think you cannot convict him.</p>

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Baron HOTHAM.</p>
               <p>Court to Clifton. I said to the Jury that the evidence you have just given was between God and your own conscience; the man is acquitted by the laws of his country; but as to you, it is impossible but any man that has heard your evidence must be of opinion that you have now in a very gross and scandalous manner concealed a fact that you might and ought to have proved against the prisoner; it is impossible not to see that you have sworn in the manner you have done, in order that he may evade the justice of his country; he has evaded it by your means; I hope that escape will induce him to lead a better life hereafter; but as to you, you have most scandalously transgressed the laws of your country, in giving the very prevaricating evidence you have done; it is impossible to believe that you could so suddenly forget the man you saw in custody, or the number of your own watch, when you did know it immediately on your loss, and when your passions were warm, you then went to the pawnbroker's, and told him what the watch was; at that time you had had no conversation with the prisoner; since that you have been bought off to enable him to evade justice; and you will now go home with the mortification of having been thus disgraced in the eyes of your country, and of having committed a gross offence in the eyes of God; therefore go and make your peace with him for your conduct to day.</p>
               <p>Court to Pawnbroker. Who has the watch? - I have it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then keep it; it does not belong to the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>How do you know those breeches belonged to the prisoner? - I have seen him two or three days before he went away, and he owned them to be his. He absconded on the Tuesday night. I lost these things; they were found on the Tuesday night. Between eight and nine I met him in Holborn; he passed me; I thought it was the same, and I followed him back, and I saw it was him, and I collared him, and charged him with the robbery; he said, by heavens, I should not hold him; I told him, that hold him I should. When I charged him with the robbery, he said he heard I had lost some clothes: I said, how came you to hear that, when you have never been at the place since? I took him back to my lodgings again, and sent for this constable, and sent him to the round-house.</p>

I went with the prosecutor, and he charged me with the prisoner; there was Mr. Moore, Mr. Magg, Mrs. Martin, and her husband. I took him to the round-house; I did not search him; the next morning I brought him up to Justice Walker's in Hyde-street, and I received this property: it is a pair of whitish breeches, part of a knife, and a knee buckle. I have had them ever since.</p>

               <p>These knee-buckles were mine for six months, I had them in a pair of breeches which I had from my last master, I never took out the buckles. The Justice asked all her lodgers if we had any dispute from the time of coming there, they said we had not; she said she had a dispute against me on account that I spoke indifferently of her coming on board a ship; says the Justice dismiss this man, here is spight and malice, she has changed these things out of the man's breeches, the reason of my leaving the lodgings, was, there was a young man a hair dresser, who had some stockings of mine, and I went in pursuit of him, I staid there till pretty near day light, and I went to a night-house in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Is this young woman here that you gave the breeches to, to mend? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Moore. What were the things worth that you lost? - The coat cost thirty shillings, the waistcoat fifteen shillings; and the breeches five shillings. I had not worn the breeches much.</p>

               <p>I am one of the shopmen of Messrs. Wiltshire and Marriott. I was in the shop when the prisoners came in, they asked to look at some muslins; and they were shewn them by Mr. Dawson; and none would do, they went out, and he went out at another door, he said they had taken a piece of muslin, and asked them to come back, and they came back, and he went before them into the back shop, and he said they had a piece of muslin, and they said no, they came back willingly; and whilst he was going to search them, I was behind, and

               <p>Did you see her drop it from her clothes? - I saw it drop, I was close behind her.</p>
               <p>Are you quite clear that you saw it drop? - I am very sure.</p>
               <p>How near did it drop to the counter? - Very near the counter.</p>
               <p>Was that the same counter where the muslins lay? - The same counter.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure you saw it drop from her? - I am quite sure, there was one end of the muslin in a little place in the counter, she tried to throw it in a hole that was in the counter.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure it could not drop from the counter? - I am quite sure it did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. James, did you take the trouble to go before the Justice? - Not that evening.</p>
               <p>How happened that? - I was busy in the shop.</p>
               <p>You are not busy now? - We are pretty middling; but our governors were not at home.</p>
               <p>So your governors are at home now? - Yes; I stood behind.</p>
               <p>There was a little hole in the counter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So the woman dropped it there from the front? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You stood behind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you saw it better than Dawson? - He might have looked.</p>
               <p>When you saw this drop, how was your friend Mr. Dawson employed? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was not he tumbling the muslins over,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130146"/> to see if it was on the counter? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Did not Drudge say, look on the counter, probably you may have overlooked it in the number of things you have tumbled over, look among them and see if you cannot find it? - I did not hear that.</p>

             when she had dropped it? - He was going to begin.</p>
               <p>Why he has told us he had searched her? He had begun when she threw it down.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear Sir, that he had searched her? - He had begun to search her.</p>
               <p>Will you tell us what you call an incipient searching, and what you call a compleat searching? - I never searched one, I do not know whether he did or not compleatly, I was behind them; and he was in the back shop, I know he had began.</p>
               <p>What had he done towards searching her? - She opened her cloak, and that was the time I saw the muslin going down from her.</p>
               <p>Had not Dawson compleated his search? - I do not know he had.</p>
               <p>You do not mean to say he had not? - No.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. James this was nine yards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not made up close? - It was made up as muslins are, it was close out of the piece, it was not open from one end to the other.</p>
               <p>Was it not open? - It might have been open.</p>
               <p>Was not it loose when it fell on the ground? - It was not loose.</p>
               <p>Was it folded tight? - As muslins are, just as we put them up in paper.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath at the time this was picked up from the ground, had it not been opened, or was it close and firm? - It was rather close.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a linen draper? - Four or five years.</p>
               <p>Did you say to your friend Dawson, did not you see her drop it down on the ground, if you did not you must be blind, for I saw it distinctly? - I do not remember saying so, I do not recollect it, I was not before the Justice till I went to the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go before the Justice? - I was very busy in the shop, I thought it was of no consequence.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see either of these women take the muslin? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Who else was in the shop? - Another young man.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - Coleman.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>There was nobody but you three in the shop at the time? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the muslin in the usual folds? - I have it in my pocket, it was just as it is now (Produced.) This is the piece of muslin that is my masters property, I gave it to Dawson.</p>
               <p>Dawson. It is the same piece, it is my masters property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Dawson. Did Drudge tell you what she wanted this linen for? - No</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to James. Do you remember Coleman turning over the muslins on the counter after the prisoners returned, looking for it? - No, I did not see him, he might, I was serving a customer at the other end of the shop, he might look them over, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Did you see him or did you not? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Can you say then whether this piece did not drop from the counter where it was laying, did she not stand so near the counter that her cloak touched the counter? - I believe she did, she had a loose cloak on, she stood quite close to the counter.</p>
               <p>Then can you undertake to say, that as she stood so very near the counter, the muslin<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130147"/> might have dropped from the counter, and have appeared to have dropped from her cloak? - One side of her cloak just leaned to the counter: I am very sure I saw the muslin drop, as plain as any thing in the world from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to Dawson. What is the value of the muslin? - Two guineas and nine pence is the prime cost.</p>

               <p>My partners are as described in the indictment; I was sent for to look at some goods at the public office in Bow street; two pieces of printed callico; they were supposed to be stolen from a vessel that was working at Yarmouth, bound to London; these goods were our own property, manufactured by one of our own partners at Glasgow, and consigned to us in London; there were marks upon them.</p>
               <p>Court. But how did these marks come to your knowledge? - The name of Stirling was upon each piece.</p>
               <p>Stirling or Stirlings? - Stirlings; I have never seen these goods before.</p>
               <p>Then by what means can you with certainty say these were part of the goods consigned to you from Scotland? - Unless the name was forged, it could not be any other; besides it is a particular pattern which no others use to my knowledge of this print but ourselves.</p>
               <p>Is there no other house of the name of Stirling? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Is the captain of the vessel here or any other person that can speak to the goods being shipped? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor any of your Glasgow partners? - No.</p>

               <p>I found part of these goods on Thursday, the 16th of November; I was sent for by a woman, she shewed us Hobson, and he acknowledged he had offered it to sale to her; I took him into custody; he said, he picked it up; it was part of a ship's cargo that was wrecked in <placeName id="t17861213-119-crimeloc599">Yarmouth-roads</placeName>

               <p>Court. What persuasion was used to make this prisoner Hobson make this full confession? - The prisoner Richmond began first to justify himself, and laid the blame on Hobson; then Hobson finding that, said, he could tell more than he could; then he began; we found nothing on the mate; Richmond said, that Hobson began it, that he had a piece then in St. Catherine's, which he had left the over night.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You know nothing with respect to Blythe? - No.</p>
               <p>Then when you say all you do not mean him? - He confessed nothing that is in this indictment, nor did not appear by the confession of the others to have any hand in this.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Richmond acknowledge having anything to do with this particular piece? - Yes, he did; he confessed that Hobson was selling that to the woman who gave the information for him; and that he had left a piece in St. Catherine's to dry; it was wringing wet when we found it; the other piece was dry.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Of a Thursday night, (I do not recollect the night, but it was the night before I gave it to Mayne) two seafaring men came and asked for a bed; I had only room for one; the other went on board.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man? - I do not know that I should; there is a great number of seafaring men about.</p>
               <p>Did you attend to the oath that you took just now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you swear to do? - To tell the truth of whatever I know concerning this matter.</p>
               <p>But you swore something more, you swore to tell the whole truth; so that if you spare any circumstance that you do know, or if you deny any thing that you do know, you are guilty of a breach of your oath; I ask you again, whether you know the persons that came to your house with these goods? - I have seen one of them, but the other I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know him you have seen? - I may have seen him among seafaring men at a public house facing me; but I could not take my oath that I have seen him; I thought I knew him when I saw him at the Justice's; the man's name is Smith.</p>
               <p>Now, look round the Court, and tell me whether you see him here or no? - The furthermost man, if I know any of them.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the man that lodged at your house that night? - I am sure that that is the man, if either one is; he had a bundle.</p>
               <p>What did he do with that bundle? - He kept it in his own possession till morning; when he was going out about five, and he desired he might leave it with me; and I said, he might.</p>
               <p>Was that bundle the same that Mayne had afterwards of you? - It was.</p>
               <p>Hobson to Dawson. Whether I did not ask when I was before the Justice, to be an evidence, as they promised me if I told the truth I should get clear by it? - He wanted to be an evidence, but I do not know the reason why they would not admit him; I had never promised him any favour, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Court to Hunter. Did you hear Blythe say any thing with respect to these particular goods? - No.</p>
               <p>Was any promise made by you, or the Magistrate, or any other person to your knowledge, to Hobson or to Richmond, of any degree of favour, if they told the whole truth? - No promise at all; he wished to be admitted an evidence when the room was clear, but he told a story which was not believed; on that account the Magistrate did not admit him an evidence; he asked to be admitted an evidence when he was by himself, and he would discover the truth, but when he began to tell his story the Magistrate did not believe a word he said.</p>
               <p>But suppose he had told the truth, did the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130149"/> Magistrate give him any expectation that he would admit him an evidence? - He did not absolutely say that he would; but I suppose it conveyed such an idea to his mind; Dawson was not present then.</p>
               <p>Dawson. I believe Mr. Hunter will recollect it was after the parties were bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Court to Hunter. Was that so? - It was; this is the piece marked Stirlings; the other is cut off from it.</p>
               <p>Dawson. That part that is marked, is the part that the woman brought to me that Hobson offered to sell to her.</p>
               <p>Court to Hunter. Was that the usual mark to your goods? - It is; there was no other ever upon it.</p>

               <p>After we had taken these goods in at Yarmouth, we came to London, and delivered the whole cargo; there were several people that worked at stowing them about; the boxes were very much damaged, and afterwards we were cleaning a hole out after the goods were all out, and we found these two pieces laying together there.</p>

               <p>What passed besides? - He told me that my son ordered him to come and tell me that he was ill used at school at Paris; I said, I could not think any such thing, for he had been three years and a half at school and made no complaints; and I fetched a letter where my son tells me, he is a favourite of his master's, and wishes to have his brother with him; an while I went to fetch the letter, he made shift to take a table spoon; he told me he had come from Paris with only seven shillings and sixpence in his pocket, and he had begged his passage over, and he was in necessity for fifteen pence to pay his lodging; I gave him eighteen pence; and after he was gone about five minutes I missed my table spoon.</p>
               <p>Who let him in? - Another son of mine, about ten years old; my son was never out of the room.</p>
               <p>Upon missing these things what did you do? - I sent my son to tell the maid she had not brought the spoon up, and she told me she had, when she brought the tea things up, she brought three tea spoons up and only took two down; and my son said, the lad was off his chair, and went to the table; then I said, it must be gone that way; so I endeavoured to find the lad in order to clear the maid.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see this table spoon in the room, nor the tea spoon? - No; I traced him out; and took him to Bow-street;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130151"/> and there were two prostitutes said the prisoner was the person; and one of them confessed she sold the spoon for six shillings to a Jew; that the prisoner received the money, and gave it to her; the other woman that bought the tea spoon was bound over to prosecute, but that woman is not to be found; the examination is down here.</p>

               <p>Do you know where he was the 7th of December? - He was with me the 7th, in my shop, in the Bear-dock, Tooley-street; I brought him up to the business these ten years; he went to work on the afternoon of that day; he came about a quarter before twelve; he said, father will you go any where to drink, and we went and had two or three-penny-worth of crank, and we staid till near one, and he went home and dined with me, and went to work afterwards; he continued with me at work till he was taken; we had had some words, and he went to work for some gentleman for two or three months, but he frequently came on a Sunday to dine with me, and of a Sunday evening to see me; he had been at my house the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>How came you to be positive as to the time of his coming to your house, as to the time of day, you say it was a little before twelve? - Yes, I am positive it was that time; it was before twelve; I cannot say to a quarter of an hour; I can take my oath it was before twelve, because it is the time we generally go to get a drop of drink; I asked him to go and dine with me; and I asked him to go to work with me, I had a job in a hurry; and he did; we dined at one, and went to work at half after one.</p>
               <p>What distance is the Hartshorn brewhouse from Tooley-street? - The one is on the one side of the water, and the other on the other; I dare say from my shop, to walk round, it is a mile or more.</p>
               <p>Are they directly opposite one another on the river? - No, not opposite; the brewhouse is a good way lower down on the other side.</p>
               <p>Is that young man a relation of yours? - Son-in-law; I married his mother.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue to work with you after that? - Till the evening he was taken.</p>
               <p>Did he talk of going to Lynn? - Yes, he sent several letters to a relation of mine; he was to go the next morning after he was taken; he was going over Moorfields to the pump maker's; the ship was to sail the next morning.</p>
               <p>Did you expect him to come on the 7th of December? - No, I did not expect him at all.</p>
               <p>Then on the Sunday before he had not told you that he was then out of work? - No, he never said any thing of the sort, only he came and told me three or four times he was going to Lynn; I did not expect him on the 7th of December; he brought nothing with him, no tools, or leather or any thing.</p>
               <p>What time did he come on the Sunday before? - He came every Sunday to dine with me; he came about twelve o'clock; I always asked him to dine with me every<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130156"/> Sunday, or any spare time when he had an opportunity.</p>
               <p>You had parted upon some little quarrel, what had you for dinner that day? - We had some cold ham from a shop; that was all we had, and some bread and beer.</p>

I am going about my master's business, where do you think I am going? says I, you have been stealing it; no, I have not says he; and he tried to throw it down on my toes; I caught hold of the string, and held it in my hand, and he got away; then Mr. Alfred seized him; Mr. Alfred took Sears in about twenty minutes after.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. There is no doubt of the identity; when your horse was missed from the door, your friend Mr. Peacock advised you to go to the Green-yard? - He did.</p>
               <p>You walked to the Green-yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which way did you take? - Down James's-street, and so on to the Piazza, Covent Garden; we went for the shortest way.</p>
               <p>How far was you from the Green-yard before you met this man with your horse? - Not far.</p>
               <p>In what way was he riding, briskly or how? - No; he was walking the horse.</p>
               <p>You immediately went up to him, and pulled him off the horse? - Yes; when he got to Sir Sampson's he said, he found the horse astray, and was taking him to the Green-yard; he said, some boys were driving the horse in Long-acre, and some men recommended it to him to take it to the Green-yard.</p>
               <p>Was he within three or four hundred yards of the Green-yard? - He might, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>He had not got to the Green-yard? - No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Was this man drunk or sober? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How did he appear to you? - He looked very reasonable.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be somewhat in liquor? - I cannot say he was.</p>
               <p>I believe it struck you in such a way that you expressed yourself in some such way as this; I wish I had given him a horse whipping? - I said as I had my property I wished I had let the man go.</p>
               <p>Court. What part of Long-acre does Mr. Peacock live in? - The corner of an alley near the middle.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. You have been convicted on very clear and satisfactory evidence of a theft, though not of a value that affects your life, yet it is attended with circumstances that strongly call for a public example and severe punishment; as it appears clearly from the circumstances of this case, that that theft was committed by you, at a time when you was upon duty as a watchman; intrusted by the parish, and employed for the benefit of the public, to protect the neighbourhood from depredation and violence. There is an end to all safety to society, if those that are employed in the night to guard the persons and property of the King's subjects, become themselves the plunderers; therefore in such a case no punishment that the law authorises can be too severe: had the value been such as to have found you capitally guilty, I certainly should have recommended it to the Jury under the circumstances of your case not to have reduced the value, and there would have been every reason to believe that your Sovereign would have ordered you for speedy execution; it therefore becomes my duty to set as strong an example as can be; I shall not only sentence you for transportation, but the severest transportation that the law permits, the place of which must be Africa; you are therefore ordered by the Court to be <rs id="t17861213-128-punish646" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>JOHN MORE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am footman to Mrs. Nesbitt; these are the property of Mrs. Nesbitt; I know them well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Is that the old livery? - This is his proper livery at this time.</p>
               <p>Then this was the newest? - It was.</p>
               <p>How long had he been in the family? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How long have you been there? - Nine months this last time, but I have been in the family fourteen years; he had been a year and half next month; he is paid up to that time.</p>
               <p>When was this livery to become his property according to custom? - We have no regular custom.</p>
               <p>When would he have had a new livery? - When my mistress thought proper to give us one.</p>
               <p>When do you think that would have been? - I cannot say for my mistress's disposition.</p>
               <p>How long had it been worn? - I cannot say how often he wore it.</p>
               <p>How long had it been made? - About fourteen months.</p>
               <p>How long have you wore your last livery? - I wear my own clothes.</p>
               <p>Does Mrs. Nesbitt give her livery once a year, or in two years, or in seven years? - It is at her pleasure.</p>
               <p>Does a man wear his livery coat and box coat, two years in her service? - Most familie do.</p>
               <p>Does Mrs. Nesbitt do so? - I dare say she does.</p>
               <p>Were these clothes in wear when you came into her service last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And for some time before? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any instance of which this man's honesty was tried, besides that of shooting a man? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect a circumstance of a gentleman's coming there and sleeping at Norwood, and leaving any bank notes in his chariot? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who found them? - Them that had no business to look for them.</p>
               <p>Who found them? - The coachman.</p>
               <p>Was it not the prisoner at the bar, says he, Mr. Moore, here are some bank notes I found in the chariot? - The chariot was on a journey; he did not clean it; I suppose he looked into the chariot through curiosity.</p>
               <p>Do you know the amount of these? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Were there several hundred pounds? - Not several, two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Were there some hundred pounds? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard there was some hundred pounds worth? - I did not hear what the sum was.</p>
               <p>Did not he deliver them to you for the benefit of the owner of the carriage? - He did.</p>
               <p>Where had that carriage stood all night? - Opposite to our coach-house door in the common yard.</p>
               <p>Was that after your stables were once robbed after the man was shot? - It was; the gentleman had been brought there by post-boys.</p>
               <p>Did your mistress esteem him as a very honest fellow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If he had been disposed to have robbed Mrs. Nesbitt, could he not have done it? - Yes, he certainly might.</p>
               <p>Such a livery as that you get very little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130164"/> for? - I suppose the whole lot would not fetch more than twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Where did he say that he got the bank notes from? - From the inside of the carriage.</p>
               <p>Did you see the gentleman to whom the Bank notes were restored? - I delivered them myself.</p>
               <p>Was the coachman there? - No, he was in the house.</p>

               <p>When you returned you had no remembrance of it, till he mentioned it to you; there was a great croud? - A considerable croud.</p>
               <p>Which way did you go? - Through Old Palace-yard.</p>
               <p>You was not in the hall? - I was not.</p>

               <p>On Saturday, the 11th of November, I had occasion to go out; I expected a draft from Doncaster; I put into a bag a thirty pounds note, eight guineas and a half, and one shilling and sixpence; six of the guineas were very bright; the money and the note were in the bag; I gave it to my son about ten; says I, George, there is the money; I returned home in about an hour; my son told me that his wife and his sister wished to go and see the Princess Amelia lay in state; he asked me to let him go with them, I did; when he was gone, I searched for the bag; I looked for the money; I did not find that he had left it; and while I was seeking for the money the banker's clerk brought in the draft; I had sufficient in the house, and I discharged it; I was rather unhappy concerning him, and was very impatient for his return; and about one he and his sister returned but not his wife; and I said as soon as ever he returned, George, you have made me uneasy, did you take the money with you to pay the draft; yes, says he, I did; he clapped his hands to his pockets, oh, good God! I have been robbed, what shall I do; I took out my pocket book, and took out my memorandum, and sent him to stop the bank note at the Bank, and he went.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the number? - 8641, the 8th of October 1786.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you any note of whom it was signed by? - I will shew you my memorandum. (Looks at it and at the indictment.) After he was gone, I went to Westminster, where his wife and sister were, and told them what had happened; his wife returned back with me; I had not been home an hour before I heard somebody was taken up, and in consequence of that I went to Bow-street, and asked if there was any pick-pocket taken up; and they said, yes; I asked if there was any bank note; and they said, yes; he asked me the number of the note, I told him; he looked in the book, and said, your note is very safe, you must attend at six in the evening; I attended there on Tuesday following; then the prisoners were committed; I never saw the prisoners till I saw them before the Magistrates; I swore to my note; there is a mark on the back of the note of my own hand writing; I received it at the Bank, and I put a B upon it for Bank.</p>
               <p>Did you see the bag? - The bag was never produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Of course all that you say is, that you had such a note, and that you gave it to your son, and that that is the note you lost? - Yes.</p>

I then took this bank note from between his legs: I then said to Macmanus, says I, let us take them into a public house, and search them all three directly; we took them into the back room of a public house close to the spot, and they were searched there; and Macmanus will tell you what money was found; this note has never been out of my custody since.</p>

            , and just before the gaol delivery 1785, I met Sir Sampson, and he told me that he understood that it was not the intention to prosecute her; the gaol delivery was held again last-summer, then that woman, as knowing her in the way I described her, and another woman were brought up; they had both been committed, as I saw by the calendar for returning from transportation, and they were discharged; after they were discharged, money was given them to maintain them, they were sent up at the expence of the corporation in a waggon to London; I have heard that the other woman had actually got into an honest sober way of life, but that she has since fled on hearing that this woman had been taken up, she was in Bristol, for no charge but this; I enquired about it.</p>
               <p>Court. This case is attended with some singularity; fortunately for her, Mr. Recorder of Bristol has attended here, and has given such evidence upon the subject, as induces us to think that this woman ought to be acquitted; we are of opinion that as she was discharged by proclamation she was set at large by legal authority, she could not have continued in gaol if she chose it; therefore she is at large against her consent; we think her life is not to be taken away by this charge.</p>
