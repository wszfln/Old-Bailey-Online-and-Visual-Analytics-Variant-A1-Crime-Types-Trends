The things mentioned in the Indictment were part of the furnitures; she pretended, she took them for a gentleman that she resided with, one capt. Dampier. She staid in the lodging six or seven weeks; I cannot exactly tell the time when she came. I remember she gave me a note on the 22d of July, and the Monday following she went out with a pretence to get money, and never returned again. My wife can give the best account of the things.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I sent all these things by that woman, but Mrs. Skryms knew of it, but her husband did not. I was to get them home unknown to him.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Skryms. If you imprudently have let the prisoner send these things to pawn, you must tell the truth. What say you to it?</p>
               <p>S. Skryms. It is all false. I never pawned a thing, or gave a thing to be pawned to any one, in my life.</p>

               <p>S. Skryms. One of them was left in a drawer in the dining room, which room she had the use of. I was going to remove it. She said I need not, she had no occasion for that drawer at present. The watch was in a parlour behind the shop, and one of the large spoons was taken out of a cupboard in the same parlour, and the other gown was missing from off the horse, as it hung to dry in the kitchen. All these things were taken away unknown to me.</p>

               <p>How could I look for this watch when I did not know that she had one: As to the gown being sent to fetch home the spoon, it was on this account, she had been drinking, and said her husband would miss the spoon, so bid me take that gown and carry it to fetch home the spoon; I remember she had veal that day for dinner: It is very odd I should be called by all these names: I took the lodgings by the name I always went by.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Skryms. She took the house by the name of Wade, and after she was there a person came and asked for Mrs. Lindsey; she came down stairs, and said that was her name. She went sometimes by the name of Levistone, and sometimes by the name of Nelson.</p>

               <p>M. Brook. It was a moon-light night.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd?</p>
               <p>M. Brook. He had a blue great coat on; he put his pistol into the coach, and said, give me your money directly - make haste, and do not let me use worse means; he was a middle-size man, with his hair tied behind, and dark eyes; I cannot tell directly how much money I gave him, I know it was more than 10 shillings; it was loose, not in a purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come on that side you sat on, or the other?</p>
               <p>M. Brook. He came on the opposite side to me; there were three passengers in the coach besides me.</p>

             had an information there was a horse left at an inn in Tyburn-road; he thought it might belong to the man that robb'd the Worcester coach: We were inform'd the man was to be found at the Blue Lion in Gray's-inn passage: When we came there, the prisoner came in: We laid hold of him; he said, What do you want with me? We told him, it was about a horse left in Tyburn-road. He made answer, No, I suppose it is for robbing the Worcester stage, or Worcester machine, I suppose. We searched him, and found a little key he had in his pocket. He had lodged there some little time. Then we went up and searched his box; there was nothing there. The next morning we went and searched the box again, and found a purse with three bullets in it.</p>

            . On Tuesday night, the 3d of August, a quarter after 12 at night, a gentleman came on horseback into the inn yard, at the George in Tyburn-road, as I was driving my coach into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Cockerton. I am a hackney coachman. The Gentleman desired I would take his horse in, he stood just behind my hind wheel; he said he would give me a shilling, if I would take him in. I said I could in no wise do it. He still desired I would. So I did take him in. He dismounted by the coach side, and turned his horse loose into the yard, and flung this great coat upon the door of my coach, and went away. I never saw his face. (The coat produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was the horse warm, as if he had been rode hard, or not?</p>
               <p>Cockerton. I did not feel of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was he?</p>
               <p>Cockerton. He was a brown horse with a switch tail. He was there till the Monday following, when Mr. Pettifer took him away. He is master of the yard; I drive for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the horse belongs to?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The man is here that owns him. I acknowledge myself to be the man that put up the horse there. Pray. Friend, had I not a silver laced hat on, and a silver laced coat.</p>
               <p>Cockerton. I can say nothing to that; I never looked at the man; he flung his coat on the coach door, and away he went.</p>

I said a dark horse with one eye; I asked him if he had left any thing else? he said Yes, a great coat he had left with my man who drove the coach; he said he would go and get his boots and cloaths on, and come again; but he never came back for his horse; I saw no more of him till before Justice Fielding.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you let him for?</p>
               <p>Weston. I let him for two days, and the prisoner paid me for the two days before he went out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My case is something hard and singular. I have laid in prison 20 weeks. Last sessions I was admitted to bail, and my father being a clergyman and desiring I should not come to an ignominious death, thought proper to keep me here till he can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176212080007"/> send me to sea. [He was continued in gaol for a debt.] I lay some time in New Prison for all the coachmen that had been robbed to look at me, and was marched up to the Blakeney's head by Mr. Fielding, backwards and forwards, with thousands of people to look at me. My father is worth 500 l. a year. I have lately had above a 100 guineas of him. I was at Stanmore with a young woman that I courted at that time, I did not chuse to subpoena her, as my friends did not chuse I should have her. I met a Gentleman at Marybone that night; I asked him what time it was? he said about 4 minutes before 4 o'clock. I came through the turnpike, and missed my road, and came into Oxford-road again, and put my horse up. I made no resistance to my box being searched. My character has been very much scandalized on this unhappy affair. The attorney came with my prosecutrix to New Prison, and got out of me all he could, and then pointed me out to the woman, and Justice Fielding's people took 6 d. a piece for showing of me, as I walked up and down Bow-street. I had a Commission which was taken away, and I have nothing now to trust to, but my seamanship. Please to call Mr. Allen.</p>

About six weeks after, a particular acquaintance told me there was a china mug at the house of the prisoner; I went and found my mug there which I had lost, (producing one) this is it.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner at the bar go up to the prosecutrix's door, up two pair of stairs, about twelve o'clock that very day the things were missing. I live in the same house; I was coming out of my own room at the same time; I went down, and did not stay above a quarter of an hour, but I was going up again, and met him coming down the stairs again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him?</p>
               <p>M. Selby. No, he had not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Selby. I am, after that I went out of an errand, and met him again, coming down a court called Thackham's-court, with a white bag folded or roll'd up under his arm. I might stay at the chandler's shop about five minutes; by that time St. Martin's clock struck two; I was about going up stairs, and saw him again up about seven stairs; he came down with a long white bag, in his hand, full of things; I call'd to the people in the shop below to know if they knew any thing of that man; they said, what man? I said, that man with a bag in his hand. He then turn'd and look'd at me; then he went towards Round-court, and I never saw him after till before Justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he off when you shew'd him to the people?</p>
               <p>Selby. By the time they were got out of the shop he was got ten yards or more; he threw the bag over his shoulder and walked on.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the people in the shop you call'd to?</p>
               <p>Selby. They were only women.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue him?</p>
               <p>Selby. No, we did not; I had no notion of his being a thief, he was so well dressed; I ran up to see if any thing was lost, and when I came down he was quite gone. I went to Sir John<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176212080009"/> Fielding's, when the prisoner was there, and told him the same I have now. I am certain the prisoner is the man, I saw him four times that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have got another mug here, the fellow to that mug: I buy and sell china, but I have not that here.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Are you certain this china mug is yours?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I am. I know it by a spot near the edge: it is a new mug.</p>

               <p>I have used that mug above a hundred times; it is possible a chip or mark may be upon another as well as on her mug; that mug I bought and paid for honestly, and have a quantity by me, I dealt in china these two years last past.</p>

            . I live in Bell-court, Cannon-street, near Abb-church-lane; I have three rooms, part of a house there; the doors come all out into one entry.</p>
               <p>Q. How many tenements is the house divided into?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Into three or four; it is a large house. On Sunday the 17th of October, I was invited to dine with a mistress that I have done business for a great many years; we lock'd up our doors very safe about half an hour after 12, and I and my wife went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any body left in the house?</p>
               <p>Lewis. There were other people in the house below stairs; my rooms are all upon the second floor; we return'd in the evening about 6 o'clock; I opened the door of the kitchen, and went in and struck a light; my wife went to go into the best room to undress herself; she call'd to and said the door was open; our three room doors come separate into the passage; we found our drawers, which had been lock'd were empty, very possible the room door might be open'd with a false key; but the drawers were broke open, the wood-work of them were cut away with a chissel or knife: I set the things down that we missed, and had them advertised the next day, there were a flower'd cotton gown, an apron of the same, two white dimity bed-gowns, a purple and white bed-gown, three white aprons, one cheque apron, two table cloaths, one sheet, one shirt cut out for making, one shift cut out; one Irish linnen apron, two handkerchiefs, one pillowbier, two diaper clouts, twelve small pieces of linnen cloath, six small pieces of purple and white cotton, one striped linnen waistcoat, one black sattin capuchine, a pair of woman's shoes, a pair of worsted stockings, a pair of white cotton stockings, a pair of scissars, a deal box with mettle pocket-pieces, buckles and buttons in it, a king William and queen Mary's half-crown, and 5 s. and 4 d. in other money. Mr. Francis happened to see the advertisement at the coffee-house, he came to me and said, I understand you have been robbed: I said I had; he said, as he past the end of our court last Sunday, he saw a man that he knew to be a rogue lurking about; he knowing the prisoner had been in custody in the new-goal, Southwark, went with me to Mr. Strange the turnkey, and described the prisoner, and said it was a man tried at Croydon, for stealing a watch in the parish of Christ-church, Surry. Mr. Strange took the book, and said that was Jos. Derbin, and that he often came to a little house near St. George's church. I then went and got a warrant from Sir

               <p>Prisoner. I have got the smelling bottle that that stopper belongs to producing one.</p>

            . I remember seeing the prisoner at the bar near the prosecutor's house on the 17th of Oct, near three in the afternoon; he stood idling about as if he did not care which way to go; I said to my friend with me, I know that man to be a very bad man; upon reading the advertisement two days after, I call'd upon the prosecutor, and told him my suspicion, and that he might be found out by inquiring at the New-Goal, by which means he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present before Justice Fielding when the prisoner was examined?</p>
               <p>Francis. I was there, the prosecutor swore to these things he has here; the prisoner denied the fact.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. How near Bell-court did you see me, or which way did I direct my course?</p>
               <p>Francis. He came down to the corner of Abchurch-lane, and directed his course across Cannon-street. When I first saw him, he was within three-doors of Bell-court, he was loitering about.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. I should be glad to know what you mean by loitering about?</p>
               <p>Francis. He came down at an easy pace, and when he came to the corner, he turn'd about and look'd round him, divers times, in such a careless manner, which I call loitering.</p>

            . I live in the same house where the prosecutor does. I was standing at the door, when such a sized man as the prisoner came. Just before sermon was done, a little after three o'clock that Sunday; he came by me with a large bundle from above stairs; it was in a strip'd cotton handkerchief: I said nothing to him; I saw only one side of his check, he turn'd his back to me and went by me,</p>

My child has a coat of the same as she swears to, it has been in wear some time; I dare say there is more printed of that pattern than she ever saw; I bought the bottle and stopper, and bit of chain with other goods; they go by the character of trinkets. I have dealt with most of the principal auctioneers in town for such goods. Some of that small money I have had 14 or 16 years; there is one piece was given to my child at the birth, about four years ago. My friends said I was got into the hands of such bad people, they were foath to come into court, but their wills was good. This is done for nothing but the reward in case they can get it.</p>

I have got 14 dozen and two pounds of it again. I have not yet got the particulars from the country of what was lost yet. I believe there more lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the butter packed?</p>
               <p>Brook. It was in batts or baskets. Every master of a stage that keeps a book-keeper, sends with it a bill of lading; when such comes into the inn yard, it is in my custody, and I am answerable for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it first missing?</p>
               <p>Brook. I believe it was about 3 quarters after 6 in the morning of the 12th, when I first got up. Part of the waggon was unloaded.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know there was butter came up in the waggon?</p>
               <p>Brook. I know that by the bill of lading. There were butter from 10 dairys came up, which goes to different places and markets. There is also a bill of the contents put into each basket to the person to whom the butter is sent. On the 13th the hostler seing the prisoner with his cart in the street, came and told me, he thought that man must have the butter, he having been in our yard the evening the butter was lost. I went and took him up; he said he lived in the Flying horse yard, Hackney. I went to inquire his character, and found he had got a quantity of butter. The mark on the end I could not see, for it had been what is called broke down. Soon after a man came to me, and said, the prisoner had confessed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him confess it?</p>

            . I am ostler at the Three Nuns. On the 11th of Nov. about half an hour after 6 the prisoner came into our yard with a little cart, and desired to feed his horse with half a peck of oats; I put him up and fed him; he turned his cart about; I then did not perceive any thing in it. About half an hour after 8 he went out; then I perceived there were baskets in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be sure there were no baskets in it at coming in?</p>
               <p>Sutliffe. To the best of my knowledge, I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say, there was nothing in the cart?</p>
               <p>Sutliffe. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of baskets were they you saw in the cart at going out?</p>
               <p>Sutliffe. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he was in the yard, where was the Chippingongar waggon?</p>
               <p>Sutliffe. That came into the yard in the time he was feeding his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that waggon loaded with?</p>
               <p>Sutliffe. That was loaded with live calves; but the hind part of the waggon had butter baskets and other luggage, some of which we were obliged to take out to get the calves out. On the 12th in the morning these baskets of bu tter was missing; on the 13th I met the prisoner coming along Leadenhall-street with the same horse and cart; when he came near our gate, we took him into custody; he was charged with robbing the Chippingongar waggon; he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him confess it?</p>

I asked him, what he sent for me for? Some of the gentlemen told me, he was suspected of robbing a waggon of butter; they urged him pretty much to confess; he said, Gentlemen, if I am innocent, you would not have me confess? they said, by no means. One of the gentlemen said to me, if I was to go into a private room with the prisoner, perhaps he would speak to me. He and I went into a private room; I urged it pretty much to him, and said, it might go much the better with him; thinking by that meant it might be made up. Upon that he said, he had got it, that was all he said.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by got it? What was you talking about?</p>
               <p>Griffin. We were then talking about butter taken out of the Chippingongar waggon?</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where it was?</p>

               <p>Griffin. I understood he meant the butter; I had heard the particulars mentioned before, so that I thought it needless to mention it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any quantity mentioned?</p>
               <p>Griffin. No, there was not.</p>

               <p>I was charged with stealing some butter. I desired they would take me to the place where it was taken from. I went in, and said, I knew nothing of stealing of it. They asked me, if I was in the inn that night? I said I was, and staid there I believe till 8 o'clock. I went in to get me a pint of beer; when I had drank it, I went about my business to Houndsditch, to meet my friend that wanted to go home along with me. He did not meet me. I came back, and had another pint of beer, and ordered my horse to be got ready to go home. I carry goods home for a great many people. When I came home I perceived baskets in my cart, which I suspected somebody had put in it, to be left in town. I took them out; there were no marks upon them. I did not know from whom they came, or whose they were. I said to my wife, I would leave them till somebody pleased to call for them.</p>

            . I live in Tylers-street Carnaby-market, am an ironmonger and brazier. The prisoner brought to me these 3 copper pots and 2 stew pans and covers on the 13th of Nov. (produced in court) He said, he wanted to dispose of them. I asked him what he asked a pound? he said 3 d. a pound; (to be sure they are worth 9 d. a pound) I bid him call again on the Monday, and I would talk further about it. He said, he kept a house in George-street, Hanover-square; I took that and his name down, upon observing them, after he was gone, the king's mark upon them. Then I went to the King's brazier, and let him know of them; He went and acquainted the King's cook of the affair, who came to my house and saw them, and said, they were the property of his Majesty. The prisoner after this came, expecting the money for them. I sent for a constable, and took him before Justice Fielding.</p>

               <p>Samul Williamson. I am second mate of the Cecily, which is going to the Havannah. On the 21st of Nov. I was taking in some goods on the forecastle, there were four hands down below to take them away as they were struck down.</p>

               <p>Williamson. She lay at Shadwell on this side the water. About five o'clock the people having done work, I called them up out of the hold, I lock'd the main hatches down, and went to secure the fore-hatches. I went down to see if all things were secure; I saw, by the light of the candle, some pieces of paper lying about; I looked farther, and saw a box broke open, which had some gold laced hats in it, and many were taken away. I came up and informed the chief mate of it; we desired all hands might be called to muster, to see if any of the people were gone on shore; we missed three of the men that had been down in the hold at that time; the prisoner and

The chief mate and Mr. Carson came down stairs and brought two hats, which they said they found put up the chimney; we found two more stuffed down into a vessel of corn up stairs, (four gold laced hats produced in Court) these are they, they were taken from on board our ship. The prisoner said, if we would let him alone, there should be nothing lost, but every thing returned; but he never would tell where the rest of the goods were. He also confessed, there were four of them concerned; and that each of them had two hats; he mentioned himself, Bunch, Lawson, and another man, I do not know his name, he got away.</p>

            . I lay on board with my husband, and returned home on the 31st of Dec. about seven in the morning. I went to put the key into my door, and the door came open. I had left it lock'd over night; I believe the lock had been pick'd with a nail, as one was found on the floor by the door; I examined, and found I had lost things, among them were five silver tea spoons, and a pair of tea tongs, I had seen them about a quarter of an hour before I went out; then I went on board the ship and told my husband; the prisoner was at home at the time I missed them, my husband came on shore, and went to the justice, and got a search warrant; there was no reason to suspect any body but she. We began the search first in the parlour. We went on and search'd all the rooms regularly. When we came to the garret, the constable found the spoons and tongs. At first she took a wrong key, and scrupled opening the box. The constable insisted on having the box open'd; upon these words she put her hand into her pocket and took out a single key, and open'd it directly. There lay the spoons and tongs.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in what part of the box they lay.</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. I did not look into the box, but before the lid of the box was open, she turn'd about to the other side of the room, and said, you bitch, you'l swear my life away; the constable desired us to take notice of these words.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been disputes between you and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. No disputes, only words.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know she was to put you in the Commons.</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. I never heard she was, I never heard her say such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear your husband say, he had heard her say, she would put you in the Commons for words you had said?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. No, I never did; I never heard any thing of that till since she was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. What rooms had you in that house?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. We had one room, up one pair of stairs, and a garret over head.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did capt. Burton lodge?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. He lodg'd in a room equal to mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a lock on the garret door, where the spoons were found?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. I do not know whether there was or not; it always appear'd to be shut.</p>

               <p>Q. When you came home from on board where did you go?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. I went into my own room where I lie.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only room you went into?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. When I missed the spoons, I went into the garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there to see for the spoons?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. No; I was sure they were in the one pair of stairs room when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business in the garret.</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. To know what else I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in the garret?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. Not above 10 or 13 minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in the garret in which the spoons were found?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. Never but once, then I had liberty to hang my cloaths there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose there?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. A pair of buckles set in silver, a blue silk gown, and a piece of cheque.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those words the prisoner spoke, spoke to you?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176212080016"/>J. Hanks. I do not know who it was spoke to.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not then upon ill terms?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. No; We had had a quarrel; she would not allow people that come to our room the privilege of coming up and down.</p>
               <p>Q. When the spoons were found did you immediately go away?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. Yes; that was the last box we opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing taken out in order to look for the spoons?</p>
               <p>J. Hanks. I did not see the inside of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. to R. Hanks. Was the box emptied before you finished the search?</p>
               <p>R. Hanks. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not search to the bottom in order to find the other things?</p>
               <p>R. Hanks. Because the box was not big enough in appearance to contain the gown.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have look'd farther for the buckles?</p>
               <p>R. Hanks. The things were not all taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your gown taken from?</p>
               <p>R. Hanks. That was in a trunk in the garret, and the buckles in a drawer in the same room.</p>

            . I am constable, I was applied to by Mr. Hanks to search the prisoner's house last Wednesday evening, they said they had lost 20 yards of linnen curtain cloth, a pair of paste buckles set in silver, five tea spoons, and a pair of tongs. We began the search in the fore room on the first floor; then the back room; then we went to the garret; the prisoner was with us; when she open'd the last chest we found five tea spoons, and a pair of tea tongs, (produced in court tied up together in a piece of cloth, with both ends to be seen.) There was something lay upon the corner of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box full of linnen?</p>
               <p>Constable. I don't think it was a quarter full, the prisoner unlock'd the box, and took them out herself, there was nothing in it but rags and chings, it was captain Burton's box.</p>

            . I was with them at the search; first the ground floor, then the one pair of stairs, and then the garret. When the prisoner opened the box, she took the key, and turn'd round, and said to her servant, you'l swear my life away. To the best of my knowledge this was before the box was opened.</p>

               <p>I don't know any thing how the spoons came there; when Mrs. Hanks came home that morning, she went up into the garret; my girl said she was going to make a fire; she heard something snap in the garret. She believed she was breaking of sticks. He came down and said nothing to me, and went out and return'd between twelve and one with the constable. They went up stairs, and said nothing to me. Presently they came all down together, and said, they had lost some things, and must have a search. I opened every place. When we came to the chest, Mr. Hanks said, this is the chest, if there is any thing. I opened the chest; there lay the spoons at one end of it. He said, O Lord, these are my spoons. I turned to Mrs. Hanks, and said, you jade, that did this, will not scruple swearing any body's life away. Then they took me before Justice Scott.</p>

            . I have known Mrs. Meers a great while; she bears a very good character; I was chairwoman there; I remember a dispute between Mrs. Hanks and she; it was a fortnight ago last Saturday. I was by, Mrs. Hanks sent for me up into her room, and wanted some stuff which I have for a cough; (this was at night) she began to mention some words Mrs. Meers and she had had before. She called Mrs. Meers worse than that of a common woman; said, she had had a bastard child, and used her very ill. Mr. Hanks and his wife too threatened Mrs. Meers; they said, they would do for her by Monday; this was on the Saturday, before the tea spoons were lost. There were many words past; they said, they would confine her before she was much older; this was when they were scolding. Mrs. Meers was below and Mrs. Hanks above, she in bed, and he walking up and down the room. They said, they would bring 5 people to prove Mrs. Meers had had a bastard child; and Mrs. Hanks said, she knew more law, than any body about the other, and she would give Mrs. Meers a guinea to swear falsely, and me another if I would swear false for her.</p>

            . I am between 14 and 15 years of age. I live with Mrs. Meers. Mrs. Hanks came into the house that morning from on board a ship between 7 and 8; she went up stairs into her own room, and then into the garret. We heard her go up; but I don't know which garret she went into. When in the garret, I heard some sticks crack. I thought she was going to light a fire. I went in and told my mistress, that Mrs. Hanks was going to light her fire. (A large deal box produced in court.) I saw the tea spoons lying within about 4 inches off the end of the box upon the other things, when the lid was open. This is Captain Burton's box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lock upon the garret door where this box was?</p>
               <p>E. Hutchinson. No, there was not. When the box was opened, my mistress turned about to Mrs. Hanks, and said, you jade, if you can do these things, you will swear my life away. Mr. Hart went to try if he could get the spoons into the box when it was looked on the Wednesday night; and either Mr. Hanks or one of the headboroughs took it out of his hand, and said, you shall not have them, that is not the right way. I heard Mr. Hanks threaten my mistress on the Saturday night before, ( when they had some words about a fishwoman) that he would bind her in a faster place before a month was at an end.</p>
               <p>Captain Burton. On the 25th of Nov. I was at change. I came home to dinner. (I lodge at Mrs. Meers's) Mrs. Meers said, there had been a little difference about a fishwoman going up stairs. There was a girl crying chesnuts in the streets, as I was at dinner. Mrs. Hanks called her to come up into her room. I stept out and said, ours is a clean house; I don't like people should make the stairs so dirty. Mrs. Hanks came and abused Mrs. Meers, and had I not been there, I believe she would have struck her; her husband came down and abused her too. This box is my property; it has been in my custody ever since Mrs. Meers has been in custody. I observed these marks on it when I first looked at it, after the spoons were found; they seem to be done by some instrument in forcing the lid up, by which means it was easy to put them in without unlocking the box. (The Jury inspect it, and found it easy for a man to get the palm of his hand in.)</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mrs. Meer's character?</p>
               <p>Captain Burton. I have known her a good while. She bears a good character. I look upon her to be a very honest, decent, orderly good woman; She is a person well to pass in the world.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley. I was present when Mr. Hart desired to try if he could not get the spoons in by lifting up the box lid. Mr. Hanks, the constable, and Eleanor Hutchinson were present. Mr. Hanks, or the constable, said, nobody should try any more. I desired to try, and he would not let me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart. I was at Mrs. Meers's house when the constables were there; I had the spoons in my hand, I desired to try if I could not get them into the box. I began to try, and said I believ'd I could get them in, was I to strain the place. They said it must not be strained. One of them took them from me. I then observed a mark upon the box, and told it to the constable, and said there was a vacancy enough to put the spoons in. The box appeared in the very same manner as now.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mrs. Meers?</p>
               <p>Hart. I have known her between 12 and 13 years; she once lived servant with me; she behaved extraordinary well. I always looked upon her to be a faithful, honest, sober person; there cannot be an honester person in the world.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Miss Winter, who had known her between 10 and 11 years; Mr. Smith and Mr. French about 4; Mr. Merryman 12 or 14;

I went with her, and staid there till Thursday. I was very uneasy, because my father did not know I was gone there. I set out on Friday morning for London; when I came to Billingsgate, I was informed, she had robbed her master, then I went and told where she was.</p>

I was the only servant, except a boy, in my master's house.

The prisoner at the bar was taken up on suspicion of stealing a coat, about the beginning of this month; the Justice before whom he was carried, was Mr. Pearson, a pawnbroker; his servant-maid hearing the name Cannon, said, she remembered a watch was pawned there in that name; I hearing of this, I went and described my watch, it appeared to be mine that was lost in the dormitory. The prisoner was there at the time I heard him own he pawned it. (Produced in the court, and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Thomas Lane. I had this watch of Mr. Pearson. I was by when the prisoner was examined about it, he said it was his own.</p>

               <p>I was going through the Mews, I passed by a Jew with a green bag on his arm, with a pair of leather breeches. I asked him the price of them, he said 12 s. I wanted to go to some house to try them on; going a little farther there was a coach house door open, I went in and tryed them on there. I bought them for 10 s. Then he asked me if I would buy a watch; he shewed me this, and asked 50 l. for it, I bid him 7 guineas. I bought it for 45 s. I being a little sort of a judge of these things.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Bopard. The two prisoners came together to our shop with this watch. The man said, he bought it of a man in the Minories for 4 l. and before the Justice he said, he bought it of a young man, a sailor. I bought it of him, as he said it was his own.</p>

               <p>I am a young lad lately come from sea. I hope your Lordship will take it into consideration. I can't explain myself as I could wish. I come home from the West-Indies; I brought a letter from this woman's husband; I found her out, and told her, he was well; she asked me to drink; I got in liquor; from that I became acquainted with her. I received 15 guineas for my voyage; there was a young man wanted to sell this watch; I said, how much do you ask for it, Cock? he said 2 guineas; she persuaded me to buy it; I gave him 2 guineas for it. After that I wanting money, went with her to Mr. Bopard's, and sold it.</p>

            . The prisoner was a sort of a chairwoman in the house where I live. I missed some things, but thought not proper to take her up without some proof against her. I went, and by enquiring at the pawnbrokers I found at Mr. Davis's on Ludgate-hill 2 of my shirts pawned there in the prisoner's name. Then I took her up; she confessed she had pawned 7 others at Mr. Wybourn's in Fleet-street; we went and got them according to her directions; we found also 2 yards of linnen cloth, a pair of silk, and a pair of worsted stockings at Mr. Wybourn's. I took her before Mr. Alderman Blunt, where she confessed the same.</p>

Said he, how can you deny it, when we found 2 of the shirts upon Ludgate hill? then she begged for mercy, and confessed to the taking 7 more, and said they were at Mr. Wybourn's; I took her there, and found them, and also a remnant of cloth, a pair of silk, and a pair of worsted stockings, which she owned she had pawned.</p>

I said, I would buy it of him, if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176212080022"/> came by 3 o'clock. Accordingly he came with Steers to the Amsterdam coffee-house, I took them into a room and asked Buckey, if this was the man that had the India bond? they both answered no, that the man was at the Fleece alehouse in Threadneedle-street. They had before offered to sell them for 5 l. under value, I offered them 90 l. a piece for them. There were then 2 mentioned. Steers said he would go and ask Stevens whether he would take that money; he went, and returned, and said, Stevens humm'd and haw'd about it, but believed he would take it. I told them, I could not then stay, but if they would go to the Fleece, I would come to them. I did accordingly, then there were the two prisoners and Buckey; I made an excuse and went to the officer in Change-alley, Mr. Sivers, he was not at home; I left word, that two of the bonds that had been advertised had been offered to me. I went to the Fleece. Steers was gone, there were Stevens and Buckey; then they went to the Four Swans in Bishopsgate-street, there they were all three together. I told them, I had brought the money and desired them to give me change out of a 200 l. note; Stevens then produced the bonds to me from out of his pocket-book; I compared them, and found they agreed with two of the three lost. I made an excuse out, and Buckey followed me. I said, had they not the other? he said, he believed they had not, but he would ask them. We went in again. I wanted to go out, but knowing they would not trust me alone. I desired to speak to Buckey. I talked to him about the danger of purchasing them; he said, I had better let them alone. I had not been there three minutes, but the officer and the constable went down the yard; I gave the constable charge of the prisoners.

               <p>Q. Was that window fast, when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Francis. I do not know. There had used to be a shutter to it; but then it had only a hasp to the casement. I cannot say, whether it was hasped or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any glass out of it, before you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Francis. I do not know there was any out. I missed some money out of my desk in the parlour; that I know was shut when I went to bed; I cannot say whether it was locked or not. I missed a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176212080023"/> silver milk pot and a silver punch ladle. There was a mark made with a knife in opening the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. How large is this window?</p>
               <p>Francis. It is about a foot wide and two feet high. I don't think a man could get into the window; but they might put their arm in and reach the desk. The watchman said, he had turned a young man out of the vault about an hour before; he described the person, so that I suspected the prisoner. He was an apprentice to a neighbour of mine; I went and found him about 8 o'clock in the afternoon. He confessed the taking the things. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>

            . When we found the prisoner, I desired him to tell the truth. He was charged with this fact; he delivered the milk pot and ladle here produced to me. Since the bill was found against him at Hicks's-hall, he has confest, that a woman, who is now in Newgate, asked him if he had any money? he said, he had not. She then shewed him where to get some; that she went with him and shewed him the window; that he took 4 panes of glass out, and she received them of him, and was concerned in the robbery with him; her name is

               <p>Q. Which of them spoke to you?</p>
               <p>Stirling. That I cannot tell. I said to them, no. I was not past them above 20 paces, but they both followed me; they came and tripped me down, and by the fall my bundle flew from under my arm. I was held down by this woman, while the other woman took and made off with my bundle. I cannot tell who tripped up my heels, because it was done behind my back; as soon as I could recover myself, I laid hold of the prisoner, and said, What do you mean? do you want to rob me? where is my bundle? O, said she, come along with me into the Old Bailey, or Fleet-lane, or some where thereabouts; I did not go, but I held her at the very spot where the thing was done; I carried her to the end of the Old Bailey, and told the watchman that I had got a prisoner, the watchman would not take her in charge; then I said to him, I would take her to the watch-house myself. I did, and never let my hold go, from the time it was done. She was secured in Wood-street-compter that night, and the next morning carried before the sitting Aldermen. I charged her there in the same manner I have given evidence here. I never got my goods again. I lost in that bundle twenty-five yards of linnen cloth, six yards of fine muslin,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176212080024"/> eighteen pair of worsted stockings, six pair of black figured ditto, nine of white ribb'd, and one of plain; that is thirty-four in the whole, eight silk handkerchiefs, four linnen ditto, and three black neckcloths.</p>

On the Thursday before the affair happened, she complained that disorder was worse than usual. The doctor ordered her a vomit, and on the Thursday after she complained she was worse, by the medicines that the doctor had ordered her, and said it burnt her inside up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day of the month?</p>
               <p>Gillis. I do not, it was that night she was delivered. I went down to the apothecary, and brought her up a bolus. I went to her bed about a quarter after 8 at night, and missed her out of bed; she had used to keep her bed on the account of her legs being so bad, she only got out to have her bed made; I asked where she was gone, they told me to the necessary house; I sent

             the nurse, to see whether she was ill, or had fainted away; she came back and said, she was very bad, and could not come; I bid her go back with somebody with her and bring her in, for she would get cold.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the necessary from the room where she lay?</p>
               <p>Gillis. It was about 3 or 4 yards from it. The nurse brought her back, and she went into bed. The nurse came to me and said, sister, there is something the matter, go and examine her. I went to her and asked, What was the matter with her? she answered, Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been at the necessary?</p>
               <p>Gillis. I cannot say. I said, I am sure there is something more than ordinary, I am sure Nanney you have had a child, or you have miscarried. She said she had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tax her with that?</p>
               <p>Gillis. Upon the nurse telling me what she saw in the necessary, I desired her to tell me the truth, and I would fetch a midwife, and have her examined; she still denied it, and I went and fetched Mrs. Smith the midwife, and was present when she examined her; the midwife brought the other part into the world, which was a plain proof there had been a child. I made her some caudle, and took proper care of her, and was up in the ward till after 2 in the morning; she said nothing while I was there, but after that she owned it. After the child was found, I saw it in the dead house, where bodies are put; it was a male child.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had children?</p>
               <p>Gillis. I have had 8.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be a full grown child?</p>
               <p>Gillis. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks of violence upon it?</p>
               <p>Gillis. No, I did not, it was as fine a child as could be seen. On the Tuesday night before, when she took the vomit, I challenged her with being big; as she sat in the chair she looked like a woman down lying. I said to her, if you was not a sober woman I should suspect you to be with child. She said, indeed, sister, it is nothing but my petticoats and stays.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she call herself a single or a married woman?</p>
               <p>Gillis. She called herself a single woman,</p>

               <p>Q. How long had she been there?</p>
               <p>M. Evans. I can't justly say how long; I said, sister desires you would come in, she is afraid you will get cold: she said she was in such extreme<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176212080025"/> pain she could not get up: at that time I observed a great deal of blood upon the floor; I said, Nanney, you are very bad indeed (I had a candle in my hand) you seem to be in a very bad condition; said she, Nurse, the stuff that I have taken has forced the blood from me backwards and forwards, so that I can't tell what to do: I went directly from her to tell the sister in what manner she was, then sister ordered me to go back for her directly to have her into bed, fearing she should get cold; when I came back to the vault again she was got up, and had put the flap of the vault down, and was turning round to come out of the vault; I went to support her, she was very weak and tottered; the cloak she had on fell back, and by seeing her hand gave me suspicion something was the matter more than should be; she was half-way up her arm in blood; I said to her, Nanney, Nanney, what have you been at? I am afraid you have been flinging away your life in a very odd manner: she said, No, nurse, there is nothing the matter, I shall be better presently: I led her directly to her bed; as soon as I put her in, with her bed-gown and under petticoat on, I went back to the vault and saw it in a very bad condition, all the seat of the vault, the floor, and the funnel down the vault were bloody: I acquainted the sister with what I had seen and she examined her and went for the midwife; when the sister was gone I said there has certainly been a child: she said it was no such thing, it was only the apothecary's stuff: the other part was brought away afterwards, I was present: she said nothing till towards morning, then one of the patients and I taxed her with it; then she said the child was by a journeyman shoemaker, and owned she had been with child.</p>

               <p>M. Tharp. I believe about 5 or 10 minutes, I can't say justly: when she was come from the vault the sister examined her, and said she believed there was something the matter; the prisoner said, No, nothing at all: then a midwife was sent for; she bid her turn on one side, and she brought away the other part: in the night I ask'd her if she knew where the child was; she said it slip'd from her as she sat on the vaults: I ask'd her if she knew the father of it; she said, he was a journeyman shoemaker that lived in a court by her master, and that she did not know she was so near her time; I never saw the child: there is but one bed betwixt mine and the vault; I was on my bed, I never heard a child cry, or a groan.</p>

            . I am one or the surgeons belonging to the Hospital, the woman was my patient there for a sore leg; she had another complaint, for which she was under the doctor's care, that was a complaint in her bowels: I had not the least suspicion of her being with child. I was directed to observe the body of the infant on the Tuesday, it appeared to be perfect and full grown, there did not appear to me any external marks of any injury having been done to the child: I opened the thorax, and took out the lungs, in order to make the experiment usually made in these cases, that is putting them into water; I did, the lungs did swim, but I was of opinion that that experiment cannot be conclusive in this case, because the body had laid 3 days in the bog house, and I think such a fermentation might have been brought off, that it might gather air.</p>
               <p>Q. to the midwife. Is it possible the prisoner could be delivered sitting on the vault involuntarily?</p>
               <p>Midwife. It is. I imagine from what I saw upon her hands, that might come in endeavouring to bring that part which I brought away.</p>

On the 15th of Nov. as soon as I got up in the morning, my wife said these words to me, She has thrown the child into the vault; my man was by, I said, Go and see if you can get the child out; he goes with a pair of tongs and a candle, (this was about 8 o'clock) he said he had got hold of it and it slipped away, and he could not come at it. I went and acquainted the nightman with it; he sent his men, one of them put his head down very low, and said he saw it; he directed one of the men to dig some mould away, and take away a plank, there lay the child; I saw it taken out; I saw a wound at the corner of the child's mouth, quite down towards the jaw, it seemed to go quite through, about an inch long; the man put it into a tub of water, and washed it, then it was laid on a table: it was a male child.</p>
               <p>Rose Hall. The prisoner was my servant. On Monday morning, about 7 o'clock, the 15th of Nov. I came out of my room, I was surprized seeing a great deal of blood upon the stairs a 2 pair of stairs that led to the prisoner's room, I went into the room, and said, Molly, how do you do? (she was then in bed, she had been not well over night, she said she believed she had got the cholick) she answered, Very bad, I believe I shall die. I said, I believe you are very bad indeed, I having seen blood from her room down into the yard. I looked round the room, and under the bed, and saw nothing: I said I believe I must go and fetch somebody: I went and fetched Mrs. Bickeridge, a midwife, she told the prisoner there had been a child born of the prisoner answered, There was a lump of something came from her; the midwife asked her what she had done with it; she said, she had put it down the vault. I lighted a candle, and looked down, and saw a child; then we bid a servant man, the man she lays it to, to go and get it out with a pair of tongs; it slipped away; after that it was taken out, and washed, and laid on a table, and Mr. Goodman and Mr. White came, I believe the forepart of that same day, and saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the woman, to know whether there had been a child born?</p>
               <p>Rose Hall. No; Dr. White did, he his here; the prisoner had been complaining she was very ill, we took a great deal of pity on her, she complained<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176212080027"/> of a dropsy; I hired people to do her business for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about a child being till after the child was found?</p>
               <p>Rose Hall. No, she did not: then she said it dead, and she knew nothing of it till it dropt down on the boards, as she was sitting by her bed side, and she perceived no life in it.</p>
               <p>Q. her cross examination, she said, the prisoner was a good servant, and behaved well; that she was a very clean body, and she did look upon her character as undeniable: that she took the prisoner's key, and looked in her box, and there found some things proper for a child. She produced a gown, caps, blankets, and several things. (Produced in Court.)</p>

            . I am a man-midwife. I was sent for to Mr. Hall's on the 15th of Nov. about 11 o'clock, to attend on a suspicion of murder. I was surprized, and sent for my friend Mr. Goodman, to go along with me We both went into the room to the child; I took a cursory view of the child, then being desired to go up to the poor creature, I found she had been newly delivered of a child, and I was obliged to do the requisites to the same. After which we went down stairs and examined the child; we found a wound on the right side of the jaw, and the jaw-bone broke on the same side.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a wound was it?</p>
               <p>White. It was a laceration, a tearing by force on the right side of the mouth, beginning at the mouth and extending almost to the ear.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child full grown?</p>
               <p>White. It was a perfect full grown child, at its full time, a male infant.</p>
               <p>Q. By the appearance of this wound can you account how it might come?</p>
               <p>White. The poor creature, I doubt not, was in a great deal of distress, when the child's head might be born, and to extricate herself in that misery, she might introduce her fingers into the child's mouth, she might make use of this means to pull the child from her, which might break the jaw and tear the part. This I mention from my own observation and experience. I believe the child was still-born.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your reason for that?</p>
               <p>White. From the difficulty of the birth, and the ceration of herself. It is plain to me, no person would give themselves pain, if they could help or ease it; every body will try to ease themselves; and as the navel-string was broke before, death trust ensue before the child could be delivered. The lungs may be filled with air, and the child not been alive. I was present when the child was opened, and an experiment made upon the lungs swam upon the surface.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that a circumstance to prove the child was born alive?</p>
               <p>White. It may be in some cases. but we have proof to the contrary. I was sent for, last Thursday was sennight, on the like occasion; there was another of the faculty that agreed with me in it. The lungs being inflated, and swimming, is not always a proof of a child's being born alive; that I have had a proof of within these ten days.</p>

            . I was along with Mr. White. There was a laceration on the cheek, and the jaw broke, as he has mentioned. The lungs may be inflated, and the child be born dead. I saw the experiment made on the lungs, and they swam. I apprehend, the child's head was born first, and it might be obstructed in the passage of the vagina, probably the woman put her fingers to the child's mouth, and her thumb on the outward part, and in endeavouring to separate the child from her, the jaw might give way, and without great force, so slender a subject as an infant is, that laceration might happen.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your opinion, the child was born dead or alive?</p>
               <p>Goodman. In consideration of the difficulty of the labour, I apprehend it was born dead.</p>

            . I am son-in-law to Mr. Hall. I do not usually lie there, but I happened accidentally to be there that night. All I know of the affair is this, There was only a small partition that intervened between my room and the prisoner's. That whole night I was exceeding restless through a disorder settled in my thigh; I heard her groan several times very distinctly, as a person in great distress. I was awake when the servant-man arose, about 4 o'clock, he went into her apartment, and according as the circumstance appeared afterwards, she was delivered a little after that time, so that if the child had been born alive, and had cryed, I don't question but I should have heard it.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said, It was a very thin partition, through which he could hear a person whisper, if such had been in her room; that he heard nothing but her groanings.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my shop yesterday was se'nnight in the evening between 9 and 10 o'clock, she said she was going out, and a washerwoman owed her about 15 s. she came home by 11, and said she had given her some things instead of money, she did not know what they were, she had a parcel with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention the washer-woman's name?</p>
               <p>Scott. No, she did not, ( she takes up a handkerchief) this is the handkerchief the things were tied up in.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my property, the same handkerchief my things were in.</p>
               <p>Scott. She went out between 9 and 10, and returned again and said she had pawned them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The pawnbroker's shop was shut up between 10 and 11 o'clock. I went into the prosecutor's house that night; the waiter was coming out of the parlour and said, my mistress has had her fortune told by a woman that tells the truest fortunes of any. He persuaded me to go in and have mine told. I went into the back parlour, and staid there about 10 or 14 minutes. The woman told me my fortune; it was not that I should come here to the Old-Bailey. I gave her 2 d. and came out at the back door. I had appointed to go to the washer-woman for money she owed me; she told me, she would pay me. I wanted something for supper; she went out and brought some buttock of beef. She lives in Princes's-street. I had lent her some child bed linnen two years ago. The woman told me, she had not received any money for her work, but she returned in about half an hour and said, I can't get any money, but I have got your things and others to them; but I must have them again, for my daughter is big with child. She bade me take care of the handkerchief they were in, and said, it was a gentleman's handkerchief that I wash for, and that he lives in Sheer-lane at a chandler's shop. I came home to this woman's house, she said, she had nothing to eat or drink; so I went out and pawned these things, and got something for supper.</p>
               <p>Q. to Weedler. Do you remember any woman having her fortune told her that night?</p>
               <p>Weedler. No, I do not.</p>
