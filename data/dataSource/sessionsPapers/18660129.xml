                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, of 64, City-road, just across the road at Tabernacle-row—Union-street is a little further down Tabernacle-row—Union-court is a turning out of Tabernacle-row—to get from my shop to Union-court you cross the road, and it is the first turning to the left—it is 120 or 130 yards from my ship to Union-court, which is not very wide—there is a dead wall on one side and eight houses on the other—there is no passage through—there is a lamp just when you turn up the court, and another near Tabernacle-row as you go in—on 18th December, at a quarter to 7, or a little after, I went into my shop, and saw the prisoner at the counter looking at some watches—MR. Riesle was serving him, and Mr. Kreutz stood more at the back of the shop, not behind the counter—I went round the counter, looked in the prisoner's face, and then told my friend, Mr. Kreutz, to come in-doors with me—we went into a back room—I remained there about a minute, when he said something which attracted my attention—I looked through the window between the back door and the shop, and walked out again, and came in front of the prisoner, who had a silver watch in his hand—before I spoke to him, he closed his hand and went to the door—I went round the counter and followed him, crying "Stop thief"—there was a good light in the shop, three, gas lights—they burn powerfully to enable me to examine things—he pulled the door open, and I ran after him across the road, down Tabernacle-row, and I saw him go into Union-place, quite by himself—I am sure that was the same person who</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186601290015"/>
               <p>went out of my shop—I was twelve or fifteen yards from aim, I cannot say exactly—there was plenty of light to enable me to see—I did not run after him directly, because the top of the court is rather dark, I stopped and told my young man, who was behind me, to stop at the bottom to watch, and I would see if I could find him—the door of No. 8, the last house, was open, and a boy, seventeen or eighteen years old, stood at the door with a candle—I asked him if somebody had gone in there—he said "Yes," and I went right through the passage to the water-closet, which is on the ground-floor, on a level with the yard, and found the prisoner sitting on the water-closet, with one hand under him—I caught hold of him and said, "That is him."—he said, "I am not the man who took the watch"—he said this before I said anything about the watch—a neighbour of mine followed me, but I went first into the closet—I got the prisoner up from his sitting position, and his clothes was not disarranged, but his right hand, which was under him, was covered with soil, and there was a little dirt on it as well—he said, "You can search me"—I said, "No, I will wait for a constable"—he gave no reason for being there.</p>

Cohen resides ten minutes' walk from me—I am a member of his congregation and so is the prisoner, who also occasionally takes a class in the Sunday school and he is in a bible class—he was going out later that evening to meet a friend—he is courting a young lady—in consequence of hearing about a watch robbery I got an order to go to the Cold Bath Fields Prison last week, after my son was taken—some persons were put together there and marshalled round the yard—I picked out one young man who resembled my son, and although he had had his hair cut short and was in the prison clothes, I identified him by the description as the man who had done this robbery; he was there for a watch robbery.</p>

I said, 'Grace, do not sing.' I never intended it, so help me God; it was done with a knife. I only <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it to protect myself.

If I have done a rash act, in a moment of passion, for God's sake help me; don't all desert me"—I asked him what he had done—he drew his hand a little on one side from the wound, and I saw what it was—he said, "For God's sake, Mr. Stephens, run for a doctor for your life; fetch a doctor at any price, I will pay"—I went and fetched Mr. Hammond—the prisoner appeared very agitated and distressed—I have known him for nine or twelve months—he lived on very friendly terms with his wife, but now and then she was the worse for drink—I never knew the prisoner the worse for drink; he is as steady and sober a man as you would find in London—I had seen them an hour and a half previously to this.</p>

I carry on business at the South Sea House in Threadneedle-street and am the proprietor of the"Floating Cargoes Morn<lb/>and Evening List"—I know the prisoner, I believe he is the proprietor of a similar publication to mine—it is called, "Fermi's List"—that purports to give the same sort of information as my "Morning List"—on Saturday morn<lb/>ing, 23d December, about half-past ten, I was passing through the passage of Gresham House on the way to my office—it was a very dark morning and the passage was very dark—when I arrived in the middle of the passage, which is the darkest part of it, I felt several blows on my back accompanied by a stinging sensation—they were given from behind and I could not see anyone—I turned round, staggered, and fell down, striking a heavy blow on my left temple and left shoulder—the passage is paved with stones—I can<lb/>not say how many blows I received before I fell—I felt a good many—after I had fallen the blows were continued over my chest and abdomen—at that time I did not know what the wounds were inflicted with—I felt several punctures, but could not imagine what it was—it was dark and I did not see anyone—I did not make any resistance nor attempt to grapple with my assailant, and at that time I did not think of danger—I did not lose my senses—I was lifted by some one and I then felt great pain in every part of my body, but mostly in my back—with the assistance of two persons I was taken into Mr. Sparkley's office on the ground floor—I was there undressed and then I found I had been stabbed—there was blood in several parts—I had on an overcoat, undercoat, waistcoat, shirt, undershirt, drawers, and trousers—in the lower front pocket of my undercoat I had this diary, and these are some of the papers I had in my breast pocket—there are three marks on the diary produced by the stabs; one is nearly through it—that diary covered my abdomen—that would, in a measure, protect the groin—the papers I had in my breast pocket were also pierced in several places—</p>

               <p>the police officer came into Mr. Sparkley's office and showed me two spears—I believe this is the one that came in contact with the pocket-book and was bent—I was taken to the police-station in a cab—I was asked there in the prisoner's presence whether I thought he meant to murder me—I said I thought not—at that time I did not know how many stabs I had received, nor had I seen my diary nor the other papers, and I did not like to throw out the worst imputation against him—when I said I did not think he intended to murder me, he said, "I did"—he then said I had assassinated his six children—I have never seen his children—I then had the services of my own medical attendant, Dr. Pettifer, and am under his care now—I had thirteen wounds in my body; three in the back, eight in the groin, one on the left hip, and one on the right arm—they are independent of the stabs I received in my pocket-book, in which there are three, and there are four to be seen in my papers—altogether there were twenty stabs—I have not spoken to the prisoner for the last five years, and I have been very careful to avoid giving him any provocation—my "Evening List"appeared in 1858, and the "Morning List" was transferred from another proprietor—it has been in existence seven years—it was commenced in 1854 and was transferred to me in 1861—I have now forty-two or forty-three subscribers, and at the time when it was transferred to me I had only twenty-two—I believe the prisoner's paper was established in 1852.</p>

I am a porter, employed by the Gresham House Company, Old Broad-street—between ten and eleven on the morning of 23d December, I saw the prisoner about midway in the passage of Gresham House—it was a very dark morning and it is a covered passage—it is a public thoroughfare from Broad-street to Bishopsgate-street—I saw him standing over Mr. Dornbusch, stabbing at his body—MR. Dornbusch was lying on the ground—I could not see what he was stabbing him with; it was something bright—he dropped something before I got to him—I caught hold of his hands—he said, "He has assassinated six of my children"—he said that three or four times—afterwards I went for a policeman.</p>

I am a coach-builder, of 184, Old-street, St. Luke's—on 6th January, the prisoner called on me at about ten minutes to 4 in the afternoon, and said he wanted to hire a cart—I showed him one—he said that was not good enough—I told him I had not got a better cart, but I had a waggonette—I showed it to him, and he said it would do, and he should want it for about two or three hours, or it might be a little more—the value of it is about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him the charge would be 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he paid it—he had brought a very nice horse to the door—I looked at it, and asked him where he got it from—he said that it belonged to his brother-in<lb/>law, a man named Thompson, whom I knew—I gave him no authority to part with the waggonette—I saw it again next day, Sunday.</p>

I am a provision merchant, of 1, Goswell-road—on the morning of 27th January, about 1 o'clock, I met Williams near the Angel, Islington—she said, "Good evening"—I went into the Bluecoat Boy public<lb/>house with her, and had something to drink—afterwards, we went a little higher up into another public-house—I had had a little drop, but I was sober—after leaving the second public-house, I wished her good night—she asked what time it was, and I took out my watch, a silver one, with a gold chain and seal attached to it—she snatched it away, and ran off across the road—I ran after her and overtook her, and had just got hold of her when somebody hit me on the back of the head, I do not know what with—I staggered, and somebody threw their arm round my neck and dragged me to the ground—I fell on my assailant's leg, or on some part of him—in falling, I managed to hold Williams by putting my legs round her legs—at that moment a policeman came up, and I became partly unconscious—my watch and chain were found directly afterwards—the police told me they had got it—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness—I remember the prosecutor coming to lodge with me on 1st January, and remaining two or three nights—on Thursday, 4th January, he was in the parlour asleep with John Cotton when I was about to close the house—I said, "We must get him up to bed"—Cotton said, "I recommended him here, and I can take him up to bed"—he then went up stairs with him, and I followed with a pint of beer—they both got into bed with their clothes on—I closed the house, and went to bed—in the course of the night, I heard John Cotton at my bedroom door—I asked what he wanted, and he said he wished me to get up and let him out, because he wanted to go home—I let him out at the front door, and fastened it after him.</p>

Hill and Co. the contractors, brought out altogether twelve planks besides the two which I had seen up stairs; some of them an inch and a half thick, and from five to six feet long, just like scaffold boards—I then charged the prisoner with having stolen them—he did not say a</p>

               <p>word, but trembled a good deal—I took him to the station, and locked him up—when the charge was read over to him he made no answer—after he had been locked up about an hour, the reserve man came to me, and said that Tyler would like to speak to me—I went to him, and he said, "Can you take bail for me?"—I said, "No; I can't; you are charged with felony"—he said, "I did not steal the wood; it was given to me by a man on the works"—I said, "By whom; was it the night watchman?

On 20th January, about a quarter past 6 in the evening, I was on duty in Sydenham, and saw the prisoners in front of me—they both looked back, and then stopped and put something through a hedge into a gentleman's garden—as I went past, Bryant said, "Oh, he is all right, he is nobody"—I was in plain clothes—they walked half-a-dozen yards, and then stopped—I crossed over to the other side, and saw them go back to the spot, and search about in the hedge, apparently looking for what they had put away—Bryant went to the Greyhound public-house, and I saw him have some beer, and get some lucifers, he then went back to Sullivan, struck the lucifers just inside the hedge, they searched for a quarter of an hour, and Bryant then pulled two hares out of the garden—they walked sharply up Laura-park—I followed them till I met two other constables—I then stopped the prisoners, and asked Bryant how he became possessed of the hares—he said, "I bought them"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "I shall not tell you"—on the way to the station he said that he had sold half-a-dozen hares, and had those two left—he produced 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the station, and the sergeant said that it was very little money if he had sold half-a-dozen hares—he said, "We are obliged to spend a great deal, and We want a little beer"—he then said that he had sold no hares, but half-a-dozen rabbits, and that he bought the hares in Billingsgate-market that morning, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of a Mr. Davies—I asked Sullivan when he saw Bryant—he said at 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I asked him if had the hares then—he said, "No,"—I found on Bryant two herrings, which the prosecutor said were bought at his shop.</p>

Shattell and Ward, boat-builders—I found the prisoner in Crossly's custody—the building is attached to a stable—there is a stable at one end, and a house at the other—it is about 150 yards from the river—the adjoining house was inhabited—I said, "What right have you here at this hour in the morning?"—he said, "I was just returning from the fire, and the premises where I stand belong to my uncle, Mr. Shattell; I saw smoke issuing from the shed, and came over the fence to put the fire out"—I said, "Are you and your uncle on friendly terms?"—he said, "I believe so"—I said, "Do not you and your uncle have some angry words some time since, and were you not discharged from his employment in consequence?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked him where he lived—he said, "In Adam-street, Rotherhithe"—I said, "This is not your way home, you might have gone home in a quarter of the time"—he said, "I sometimes go one way, and sometimes another"—it is very nearly 500 yards out of his way—there was a form about six feet from the side of the shed—the fire was half-way between the form and the wood—the form was immediately over the two fires—a gas-metre is attached to the brick wall, seven or eight feet from the form or more—I asked the prisoner if he had any matches—he produced one match from his pocket, and I found a pipe on him—he did not say that he had used it—I measured the distance between the two fires, it was six feet five inches—I examined the shed to see if there were any apertures, and there was no place through which sparks could have come.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boat-builder in partnership with William Shattell, at 1, Bedford-place, Tower-road, Rotherhithe—he is the prisoner's uncle—the shed is inclosed with pailing half round it, seven feet three inches high; it is our property—there are places where it would not be difficult for a person knowing them to get over—I was the last person in the shed on the Saturday morning at 9 o'clock—the 16th was the Tuesday following—there was nearly three days interval—I looked it up when I left it, and it was quite safe—from information I received, I went to the premises and found two places where there had been fires—it was then 1 o'clock in the day—the roof is tiled—if the wind was that way, it might move the tarpauling which is put against the door to keep the wind out, but if the tarpauling was there sparks from the other fire could not get beyond it—the prisoner worked in the establishment for three years—he was discharged by my brother George six months ago, and he has not worked there since—I have seen him twice since and have spoken to him, once when he came in to take his tools—it was on the Monday after he was discharged on the Satur-day—that is six months ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have you had anything done to the tiles since the late fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—that is nearly a twelvemonth ago—it had nothing to do with the fire which took place on 16th—no sparks could drop through the tiles to my knowledge—if the wind blows from the house, nothing can go through—I do not know whether on the former occasion sparks actually got into the shed—my brother is not here—I cannot say whether you told him that you had to throw the fire out as fast as it came through the tiles.</p>

               <p>known the prisoner nine months, and have known his landlady for years—I was in the prisoner's company on the Monday evening before the fire—at half-past 6 or 7 o'clock we met at his landlady's house—we both went to the door together—he asked me if I would have a glass of ale—I said, "I do not mind," and we crossed the road and had a pot of ale—I asked him the reason he was not working for his uncle—he said, "Did not you hear I had a month's imprisonment"—I said, "No, what for?"—he said, "I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> a mallet at one of my fellow workmen, and had a month for it"—he said that his uncle's place had been very nearly burnt to the ground, and he hoped that between then and Wednesday it would be burnt again—I said, "That is very shocking"—I bade him good night, and left him at a quarter to 8—I saw him no more till I was subpoened at Greenwich.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You wanted to swear that you were with me all night—did not you say, "Hold your tongue you b—y fool; if you like I will swear I was there all the time?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is false—I only told you that your young woman said she would get Counsel for you—you were remanded for a week that they might summons me—it is a case I don't like to be in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. On the night in question, about half-past five, I was leaving off work and the foreman asked me if I would mind turning out to take a barge out and bring another barge in. I had my tea, and me and my mate went to another mate's house, we sat there till a quarter-past eleven; the bridge was open, which delayed me a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. I went and did the work; I will not say whether it had gone two at the time I had done it. I saw the reflection of a fire at Lewis's place. After that, as it was close on five o'clock, I would not go to bed or I should not have been up at six. I thought I would take a gentle walk and get a cup of coffee. I saw smoke coming over the prosecutor's pailings, looked through a crack, and walked round to the gate to see if anybody was there. I got over and there was only one fire burning; I got a bit of stick to beat it out, and was doing so when this man came. I said, "Do not trouble me, it will be out presently, "or, "Do not make a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, I shall soon have it out. "I kept on raking the fire by rubbing it over with sawdust, and sent some to the other place, but I ran up and put it out; he said, "Look out, round the fence!" I said, "I do not want to escape. "They asked me what business I had there; I told them it was my uncle's premises. I jumped over to put the fire out; I had no bad intention. What that woman says is false, but it is true we had the ale together.</p>

Trollope—he said, "I want some money, and you must try and lend me your aid to get some"—there was some conversation afterwards, and the result was that that night I went down to Tudor Lodge—he said I was to go down to make some observations to see really where the plate was kept—I had been keeping company with the house-keeper at Mr. Martin's, and had told him so—I went down, and made observations about Tudor Lodge—I had seen the plate repeatedly about, but did not take particular notice of it—I looked to see how the window was fastened—I went down on 22d July, the day before the review at Wimbledon, with the prisoner, and pointed out the house to him—on the following Friday, the 6th, I met him again at the station at Putney—I met him at the railway station, and left him at a public-house, opposite, kept by Clipson—I went to Tudor Lodge, and went back and said I had much rather the burglary did not take place, because I was sure to be suspected, but he said that it must be done, and on that I parted with him at Putney Station, and agreed to meet him the night following, outside the music hall in the London-road—he left this bag, with some articles in it, at the station, I do not know with who, because I did not go to the office—I remained outside while he went in—I did not know what was in it then, but after it was opened, I saw a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, a file, some rope, and one or two other articles which I do not see here—on the next Saturday, I met him at the music hall, and he said that I should have to go down on the Monday following—I did so, and met him at the Putney railway<lb/>station—we went into a public-house opposite, and from there up Putney-lane, then into the Green Man public-house, where I left him until I went to Tudor Lodge—after I had been there, I returned to him at the Green Man at a little before 10—we then had some refreshment, and I went with him to Tudor Lodge—he had the leather bag with him—he had called for it at the railway<lb/>station and got it—I assisted him over the wall, and afterwards got over myself—we remained in the summer-house till about 12 o'clock, and then, finding that all persons had gone to bed, we went round to the pantry window—Morris placed this piece of rope round the bars, and twisted it with a stick—finding we could not force the bars away by means of the rope, some brown-paper was put across the window, with some treacle, the glass was cut out with a diamond, the catch was unfastened, and Morris got in—he remained inside two hours, and I remained outside—he took</p>

               <p>this bag in with him, and afterwards gave it to me with some property in it—there were some other articles besides those, which were wrapped up in a white cloth—we both went into the summer house, and waited there till about 4 o'clock in the morning—there was only one parcel of plate—there were two other parcels, one of which contained my coat—we waited till 4 o'clock—he got over first, over the gate on the wall, and I went back again, and put the plate in the bag in the shrubbery before we had got out of the grounds—the remaining articles of silver were wrapped up in a white cloth, and he took them—I carried two parcels, one under each arm, and he carried the two others—when we got near Clapham Junction, I was walking on first, and another man joined Morris—we met policeman, King, and I believe I said, "Good morning"—we both went to the station of the Chatham and Dover line, and took the railway train, I to Victoria and he to Ludgate-hill—he agreed to meet me that evening at the Elephant and Castle, but I never saw him afterwards till I was in custody—I have not the slightest doubt that this is the coat he wore that night—it was this colour, and he wore this cap, or one exactly like it—I saw him next on 17th November—I heard his voice in the van—there are small doors in the larger doors, and they being open, I looked through, and saw him in the opposite box, as you may term it, and I asked him what he was there for—he said, "For knocking some <hi rend="italic">Moll</hi> about": that she had taken some money, and he had paid her for it—I said, "I am in custody for the burglary;" and told him there was another charge against me in reference to Lowndes-square—he said, "I am safe to get discharged for this, and I will come and see you, old fellow," but I saw nothing of him—I was convicted on Wednesday, 20th, and the day after I thought the matter well over, and communicated next morning with the Rev. Mr. Jones. <hi rend="smallCaps">

                  </hi>. I at present reside at Bexley-heath—I was formerly a grocer—when I first became acquainted with the defendant I was residing at Clifton-place, something like fifteen or sixteen months ago—I considered I was entitled to a sum of money—I had a letter from the country, and showed it to Mr. Rattenbury when the prisoner was in his shop—he keeps the shop I used to keep—the prisoner saw the letter, and said, "If this suit is in money, I can get it"—he said he was a solicitor; he always told me so—then it was proposed by the prisoner that I, Mr. Rattenbury, and himself, should go to Chancery-lane, and find out the suit—he gave me this copy of reports (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is the prisoner's name at the bottom—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and something, for the stamp which it is on—up to the time of his speaking to me about Mr. Joyce, he got from me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the latter end of May he told me it would be necessary for me to make an affidavit—before that be had shown me these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>). (<hi rend="italic">read, endorsed</hi> F. Wenham and another, in Chancery, Freeman <hi rend="italic">v</hi> Parsley)—before we had the affidavit he read something out, which he told me was Mr. Joyce's opinion—he read it because, he said, barrister's writing was not to be read—I am not soholar</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186601290067"/>
               <p>enough to read it—he put the papers of Mr. Joyce in his pocket—he had the papers of the suit with him—he wished to have some certificate from the country, which he and I went and got from Gloucestershire—he told me that he had actually been to Mr. Joyce's house, that when he could not catch him at his office, he had been to the West end—we never knew that he lived at Blackheath till we found he was duping—he told me that Mr. Joyce's opinion was, that I was head and chief, and nobody was entitled, if I was not—he said, "Do not tell Mr. Rattenbury about it, because he married my sister's daughter"—then after that he said it would be necessary to get two certificates, which you see on the top of his report, Mr. and Mrs Harris's—on 28th March he said, "I should like to go into the country"—I proposed that Mr. Rattenbury should go—he said, "No, I must go; Mr. Rattenbury cannot do it," and that I could not—it was determined that the prisoner should go—Mr. Rattenbury gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that very same night, at a tea-meeting—he came to mo and said, "MR. Rattenbury has given me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I am going down to get the certificates—I thought everything was right—after he took me to Chancery-lane, he said, "The Courts are on at Westminster, and Mr. Joyce is not at his office; he is at Westminster"—we went to Westminster—he took me into two or three Courts—he left me in one, and said, "I will go in to Mr. Joyce"—he came back and said, "I have seen Mr. Joyce, and he tells me he will go on with the case—about seven or eight days after, he came to me and said, "Mr. Joyce wants 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he has presented a petition and the affidavit—I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because he said Mr. Joyce wanted it to carry on the case, and the case was to come off the very next term—I had no other reason for giving him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than a belief that what he wanted was right—I believed he was a solicitor, he always told me he was—he told me he had just taken out his certificate again, and that he had paid 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—that belief was the means of my parting with my money—Mr. Rattenbury found out that he was not a solicitor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Rattenbury wrote this letter by my instructions—(<hi rend="italic">This was from the witness to the prisoner, and requested him to hand to Mr. Rattenbury, on or before</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">o'clock, the following papers, a copy of Mr. Rattenbury's will, with a certificate of Little's and his sister's birth, and of Mr. Freeman's death, and a receipt of amounts paid, also that he would return to Mr. Rattenbury what he got from the witness by false pretences, to present a petition in his favour</hi>)—I only claim what he had for Mr. Joyce in this letter—the Magistrate would only allow us to claim for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if the law of false pretences is not so, it is wrong—he told me he had lodged the petition.</p>

               <p>an attorney, on my oath—he did not tell me more than three or four times that he had a certificate—the first time was in the summer—I had seen that Mr. Moss's name was on the brass plate at the prisoner's office—that was the reason I spoke to the prisoner about it—that was after he had had that money for me—I paid him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the latter end of May or the beginning of June—I had been to the prisoner's office perhaps a week before that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—I saw Mr. Moss there—I do not know whether at the time I called, Mr. Moss's name was on a brass plate—I cannot read—I do not know when it was put on—I will not swear that I did not see it when I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see it before I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell the day when I first saw it, I cannot say how long before I made the charge—he said he was an attorney—he has been at my house—you may take it that I was at his office thirty times during the year 1865, if you think proper—he married my niece—they have been married about four or five years—I did not apply to any one about this money before I saw the prisoner—I did not apply to a gentleman named Derozen, because the prisoner said he would do it—Derozen told me that he wanted 50 per cent, for getting it—I had a talk with the prisoner about the terms for obtaining this money—I did not say to him, "I do not want to employ an attorney till I can ascertain that there is a fund in Court"—I know Michael Denny—he lives in a cottage belonging to me—I did not recollect the prisoner saying in his presence, "I can get the lease prepared; of course you know I am not a solicitor, but I dare say I can get it done," it is wrong: not to my knowledge—it did not take place in my hearing—I did not tell the prisoner it did not matter whether he was a solicitor—I was with Denny when I signed it—Denny came to me and said the prisoner had been to him, and saw the agreement, and said, "This is no good to you, you must have a lease"—the prisoner attested the lease in my presence, when he had the money for it—I knew that at the time he signed his name as parish clerk, that he was an attorney—if Denny swears that the prisoner said, "I can get the lease prepared; I dare say you know I am not a solicitor, but I dare say I can do it," it will be untrue—I did not then say, "It does not matter to me whether you are a solicitor or not, but I want it all right—I signed the lease—I have seen him at church, opening the pews—he told me that he was going to be parish-clerk altogether, and that if he was not a solicitor, he could not do the parish business—he told me who Mr. Joyce was, and said that he had been frequently to see him, and had drunk wine and taken dinner with him, and that he lived at the West-end—the prisoner signed these two docu<lb/>ments, "F. Wenham, solicitor" after this letter requesting him to return the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he got from me by false pretences.</p>

She made no answer, and he went over by the fire, and sat down, and said, "I do not know what it can be, I do not know what I can get for it"—she said, "You know very well; it is where you kicked me last night"—he turned round and said, "And a b—good job"—I than went home—I returned about 2 o'clock, and he was still sitting by the fire—he asked me to go to the pawnbroker's for him, and I took a child's frock, and pawned it for him for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and brought it back to him with the ticket—I then stopped in while he went out and got something for his dinner—about 10, or half-past 10 in the evening, he was out of bed, rubbing the deceased's neck, and calling "Mother;" and he asked me if I would go down and tell his sister that Annie was dying—I did no, and when I came back she was dead.</p>

I am the wife of Josiah Bem, o 32, George-street—I do not know the prisoner and the deceased, but I knew they lived next door—on Tuesday night I heard a great noise in the next room, a kind of screaming of a female—it was the night this happened—I cannot tell you the time, for I was suddenly awoke—I heard a man's voice very loud, and a woman's voice screaming very loud—there was a wall between us—the</p>

I am the wife of William Elliott, of Paradise-place, George-street—I have known the deceased about four years—on Tuesday night, 9th January, I was in her room—she was in bed—she seemed in pretty good health—I went there on the Thursday, and saw the prisoner in the room, and several other people—some one, I cannot tell who, said, "It is a bad job that Annie is dead"—I said, "Yes, it is a bad job"—the prisoner, said, "I cannot help it"—I said, "May be, perhaps you can help it; you know, George, you beat her many a time"—he said, "I own to all that, but I did not do this"—I have frequently seen him beat her, but not within the last three months—I have interfered between them several times.</p>

I live opposite to 33, George-street—on Tuesday night, 9th January, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was awoke by a screaming which seemed to me to be opposite, across the street—it is a narrow street, but a horse and cart can pass by—the screams were in a woman's voice—I did not interfere because we used to hear it frequently, and she was very much given to drink.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 13, White-street, Borough—on Friday afternoon, between five and six o'clock, I think, but am not certain, I went to see the deceased—I found her dead and laid out—the clothes were taken from her body, and she was covered with a sheet—the eyes were very much blackened, and the belly very much distended, greatly swollen—there were other bruises about the face, one on the side of the face, and the right side of the jaw was bruised—a portion of the outside rim of the right ear was gone, that was recent, and also a small portion of the left ear—I am not certain that that was not inflicted after death; it had the appearance of having been gnawed by rats—I found the right shoulder very much dis<lb/>coloured by bruises, which appeared to be recent—the right elbow seemed greatly bruised and black, that was recent—the right hip was also greatly discoloured, the bruise extended from the hip round the right buttock—there were many small bruises and scratches on the hands, small lacerations, or very shallow scratches and bruises—I examined the legs and found the same small bruises and scratches on the front of the shin bones—there were a great many on various parts of the legs, and all over the body there were small bruises, I should think 100 if I had counted; there were a great number—there were many about the hands and wrists, more particularly the fingers—the bruises were not caused after death—there was nothing external to signify the cause of death unless it was the collective effect of such a large number of bruises, some of which were immense—I cannot state that that might not have caused so much disturbance as to cause death from the general shock—on the 16th I proceeded to open the body; it was particularly well nourished—I examined the cavity of the pleura and the lungs; they were, generally speaking, healthy, but there was a slight con<lb/>gestion of the top of the right lung, and what we call calcareous deposit, evidence of disease, but not of a very important character, nor was it recent—the heart was perfectly healthy, but peculiarly empty of blood—there was no outward bruise on the belly, but on raising the skin I found the muscle and flesh underneath greatly bruised and blackened on the right side at the lower part, and the faciae and integuments underneath were greatly dis<lb/>coloured—the faciae is the cellular tissue which lies immediately under the fat and integuments—I am alluding to a black patch—the discolouration might be continuous with the large bruise on the right hip, but it did not extend there on the outside; it was not visible outside—it is very likely that a blow might be given without making a bruise outside, but which would make one inside, many cases are well known; even a cart wheel has gone over the body of a living person and destroyed an organ inwardly, and yet left no outward mark—I divided the muscles and the wall of the belly—on opening the belly the first thing that I saw was that the intestines were much more red than they could be in health; also that they were matted together by lymph, which could be peeled off, the product of inflam<lb/>mation—I carefully lifted the intestines aside and saw a large quantity of feculent fluid in the cavity of the belly, and in doing that I found a hole in the small intestine through which feculent matter was oozing as I lifted it—on examining it further, I found a dark crimson discharged patch about two inches long, going about three parts round the circumference of the intes<lb/>tine; the hole was in the centre of the patch—the immediate cause of death was the perforation of the intestine allowing the escape of the contents of the intestine into the cavity. of the belly—the brain, uterus, and kidneys were healthy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What size was the hole? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was ragged and the edges</p>

               <p>broke down under the finger; it was about three quarters of an inch in diameter—it was at the side of the belly, on the under side of the loup of the intestine—I had to lift it up, and found the hole was at the back—it was the small intestine, the <hi rend="italic">illium</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRIFFITHS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What in your opinion would have caused that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> External violence in all probability—a knife would be likely to cause it—judging from the general appearance of the body, if she fell with great violence over a sharp corner it might have produced the injury to the intes<lb/>tine, but it could not have produced at the same time the external bruises on the right side—a sharp corner such as I describe would be likely to leave a mark outside, and a kick would be likely to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If the kick would have produced the external marks, so would similar marks arise from a corner of a box, would they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, probably—the absence of external appearances is consistent with it being either a kick or a fall, and so would the existence of external bruises be—I should expect them in both cases—some people exhibit external marks and others do not—I opened the stomach, but did not detect the smell of alcohol; the distance of time at which the examination was made might probably account for that—the cause of death was no doubt mischief inside the abdomen, the immediate cause of that being perforation—the perforation was in the posterior part of the fold of the <hi rend="italic">illium</hi> where the loup of the intestines lies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Posterior in reference to what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Anatomically we should call that the anterior part which is not attached; but I am speaking as I found the intestines when I opened the body—I do not say anterior and posterior with reference to the back and front of the body; it would be right and left—it would be on the left-side as the intestines lay in a loup—the <hi rend="italic">illium</hi> passes transversely through the <hi rend="italic">jejunum</hi> to join the other intestines in a number of loupes—it was only on one loup that the perform<lb/>tion was—that portion would be lying perpendicular in the normal state, not transversely—it would depend on whether the intestines were full or empty, whether the loupes lay in a sort of vermicular form—that is not the state in which they would be found in a dead body as contradistinguished from perpendicular—it might have been perpendicular or transverse, I am unable to say which; I only say what I found—this particular fold lay perpendicular—the perforation was towards the side of the abdomen on the same side as the liver; but the liver is up here—the portion of the <hi rend="italic">illium</hi> in which the perforation was beneath the hip bone in that cavity—perforation is sometimes the result of disease—I made a preparation of the intestine—I have not got it here, but I can send for it—the orifice is ragged and is the centre of what has the appearance of a bruise—the edges were bruised and torn with the surrounding part—that might be the result of external violence—the bruise could not be produced by disease, but by external causes—I believe cases are known of perforation of the intestines, where death is instantaneous, without any previous apparent causes, but they are excessively rare; I never saw a case—there was an appearance of incipient disease in the liver; you could hardly call it disease, it indicated that some time hence the woman would have liver disease—it was more in the condition of showing that disease was approaching—there was not such an appearance as to lead me to suppose her health was injured—I do not think the hundred scratches and bruises were of old standing, there might have been only eighty, I did not count them—I had no acquaintance with the deceased professionally, and do not know her habits.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About what age was the woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am told she was thirty-eight, but the face was so much discoloured I could not form an opinion—she might be from thirty to forty—perforation caused by disease would be instantly known to the patient, because it would produce agonizing pain—when I said external violence would cause it, I spoke of the hole and of the bruises—if a drunken woman was undressing herself and stumbled and fell against the corner of a sailor's chest, it might inflict that injury, but it would depend on the height she fell—I was told that she fell off the bed to the box—I say that a person would require to fall with very great force to inflict it—I believe that perforation would occasion pain which would gradually increase in severity as the matter came through it—the conclusion I arrive at that this should be imputed to violence depends a good deal on the other marks on the body, such as the blackening at the hip.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you not cry when information was given to the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was about baby, because people said he was dying—when he found the child was ill, he seemed sorry, and cried—I know Nancy Tooke, but I did not know she was an acquaintance of the prisoner's—I was not at all jealous of her—I did not see her sister at the doctor's—Nancy Tooke came up stairs that night, to ask about the child, and she seemed anxious about it—she asked me to say that the child fell off the chair—when he came home at 1 o'clock in the morning, he had been drinking—as a rule he is a very sober man—he has not done any work since the week be<lb/>fore Christmas—he was in the habit when at home to sit by the fire, but</p>

               <p>he does not go to sleep there—he was not nursing the child when I went out, it was on the bed—when I came back it was not on the same side that I had left it, it was on the other side—it was half asleep when I went out—it frequently happens with children when they are left half asleep, that they wake up suddenly and make a noise, and they have then to be quieted—it would be nothing extraordinary for the prisoner if the child cried, to take it up and nurse it—he has frequently nursed it, and seemed very fond of it.</p>

On Wednesday, 10th January, I went to 1, Hook's-lane, Peckham—I there saw the child, Stephen Pearce—about half-past 10 I went in search of the prisoner, and a little before I in the morning, I saw him leave the Crown public-house, and return home with the girl Ann Tooke—I followed them to the prisoner's house—they went in, and I went in a few minutes afterwards by the back door—I stayed in the passage, and heard Tooke say to Ellen Pearce, "Don't be hard with <hi rend="italic">Jim;</hi> say it fell off the chair"—shortly after, I went into the room—I told the prisoner I should take him in custody for assaulting the child, with intent to murder it—he made no answer—I was in uniform—he seemed very much agitated—Tooke told me she had taken a knife from him, and wished me to be careful—on the way to the station he said the child fell off his knee, while he was sitting by the fire.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 8, Peckham-rye, Peckham—on Wednesday, 10th January, Mrs. Pearce came to me with a child—I examined it, and found the head very much swollen, particularly on the right side—the child was very pallid, and greatly exhausted—I examined it more par<lb/>ticularly next day, and found a very bad fracture across the right side of the head, with the bone depressed in one part nearly an inch in diameter—the fracture was just above the right ear, extending backwards and upwards—both ears were bruised, and there was a bruise on the lower part of the back, to the right of the spine—it must have been a severe blow—the child is in great danger at the present time, and will be for some months hence—it has rallied a great deal, and improved very much—it is impossible to say to what extent it may suffer from that injury—my opinion is this fracture was caused by some violent blow—I am hardly in a position to say whether a fall off a chair would cause such an injury—I have an opinion that it would not—there were marks of violence on the left ear, and one on the right ear; the head was very much swollen and fractured, and one on the back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would all those symptoms have been caused by a fall? A. No, I think not; there must have been something extra besides the fall to have caused the bruises—the serious part of the mischief might possibly have been caused by a fall, but I do not think it is likely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the child was very much exhausted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was fainting almost—the injury would cause that pallidness.</p>

               <p>are not in a position to say that it was not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it likely that it was caused that way—it must have fallen some height to have pro<lb/>duced such an injury—the skull was not only fractured but there was a depression, and you could put your thumb in the hole—I should not like to say that a fall on the edge of a fender would not produce that, but the edge of a fender would have produced a long cut, this was oval—a fender must have a peculiar projection to have caused this depression—one with a ball projecting might have caused it—this child was four months old—the skull is entirely formed at that age—some children's heads are much earlier formed than others—I have not read "Holden's Manual of Human Osteology."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said that both ears were bruised, was that by violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; by some of the violence—both ears could not have been bruised by one fall—the blows on the head appeared to be quite fresh, and also that on the right of the spine—the blackness in the face, described by the wit<lb/>nesses, I can hardly connect with a fall—I think that must have been from some kind of stoppage in breathing.</p>
