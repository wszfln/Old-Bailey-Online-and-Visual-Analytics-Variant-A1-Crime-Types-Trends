               <p>Bays water Branch—at the beginning of this year the Cycle-cleaningand In<lb/>surance Company had an account there—the cheques were signed by two persons who always described themselves as directors—on May 11th this cheque was presented to me over the counter by the prisoner: "Pay Mr. J. Williams, or order, £35 10s. 6d. W. A. Gavin, Henry Fitzgerald"—I said that it must be signed officially, and he left—he came again next day about 3.30—the cheque was then signed, "W. A. Gavin, Managing Direc<lb/>tor," and "Henry Fitzgerald"—I refused to cash it, and sent for a police-man.</p>

I live at 8, Red Lion Square, and have been for a good many years an expert in handwriting, and act for the Treasury—I have examined this cheque, and also this letter, which purports to be written by the prisoner; they are written by the same person, but I leave out the signature to the cheque—the endorsement of the cheque, "J. Wil<lb/>liams," is the same writing as the body of it—the "p" in the cheque is the same as the "p" in "pounds," and is somewhat peculiar, and the "s" in "shillings" is the same as the "a" in the letter; that is not a very common form—there are many "s's" in the letter, and they are all the same curious ones—the letter "t" in the word director is large and pro<lb/>minent, much larger than in the other letters—the small "a's" are made much more like "o's"—the figure "9" in "1897" has a little hook at the bottom of it, which appears in both; that is a very uncommon thing—the word "Gavin" has been traced; there is pencil under it—I should say that the letter is his natural hand, and the body of the cheque slightly disguised.</p>

On April 20th I went with Ballard to Sharp's room, 2, Popham Road—I saw him get up from a chair, take up a can of milk which was on the table, and drop two rings into the milk; shortly afterwards he scratched his head and placed two gold rings down his neck—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, that won't do." and took the two rings from his neck—a number of rings and metal watches were found, and seven crucibles, one containing melted metal—I went back in the after-noon, took the crucibles to the station, and asked him if they were his property—he said, "Yes, I use them for melting down cases of watches."</p>

It is hop tea, quarter-pound packets, and usually sold at 6d.," and he pointed to the "6d." on the end of the packet. "What shall I say for this?"—no one made a bid—he said, "I'll start it myself at 1d.; who will say a penny?"—a man in the crowd said, "I will say a penny"—he could get no further advance, and the man took the packet at 1d.—he then picked up another, and said, "Who says another? It is good tea, called hop tea. I have had some to-night for my tea, and I can assure you it is good tea. It is said to be good for indigestion"—he sold a second packet at 1d.—he then introduced some jewellery—I saw some packets in the possession of Sergeant Crouch on April 6th which I have identified as similar.</p>

               <p>"I <hi rend="smallCaps">ALEXANDER CHARLES HILL-KENNEDY</hi> (formerly known as Alexander Charles Hill) of 19 Boliogbroke Road Kensington in the county of Middlesex retired Captain in Her Majesty's Army and now engaged as agent in England for the sale of African properties make oath and say as follows:—I am the plaintiff in this action. I have in the last eight years been four times out to South Africa prospecting and acting as the agent for purchase and sale of Gold Mining and other properties there and I am accordingly well-known in London amongst persons and companies who are in the habit of dealing in such properties. The defendant Henry Hess during the last twelve months has started a paper dealing with African business matters which he calls <hi rend="italic">The African Critic</hi> and he is the proprietor editor and publisher of the said paper which is printed for him by the defendants R. O. Hearson Limited and has as I am informed at the present time a circulation of 7,000 copies a week or there-abouts the circulation being principally in the City of London and in South Africa in both of which places I am well-known and in the habit of transacting business. The said defendant Henry Hess has recently been attacking me in articles which he has inserted and published in the said paper and in the issues thereof of the 11th and 18th inst. he has repeated these attacks in such a way that they have been brought by my business friends in London to my attention and in particular about three days ago my attention was specially drawn by some business friends of mine to some libellous articles concerning me published in the issue of the said paper of Saturday the 18th April inst. The libels contained in said issue of which I complain appear on pages 482 489 and 490 thereof and I have marked the same in red ink for the purpose of identification. The statements on the said pages of the said issue are either wholly untrue or grossly misleading. The companies mentioned in the commencement of the said article on page 482 and therein stated to be swindles were not swindles and I was connected with them mainly as a paid agent and in one or two cases as managing director in South Africa. I have had nothing whatever to do with Hutton's Bechuanaland Gold Reefs Development Company Ld. referred to on pages 482 and 489 of the said issue nor have I had anything whatever to do with the promotion and formation of the the said company. I am not now and never have been promoter director or shareholder of or otherwise interested in the said company. I only some seven months ago acted while in South Africa as agent for the purpose of acquiring for the gentleman for whom I was dealing certain property on a commission which property I now understand he has sold to the said Hutton's Bechuanaland Gold Reefs Development Company Limited but with which sale I had nothing whatever to do. The words on page 482 of the said issue refer to me this deponent. The statement on page 482 that I have employed Messrs. Coghlan &amp; Coghlan solicitors of Kimberley to commence proceedings on my behalf is absolutely untrue and the subsequent statements contained in the said paragraph are also absolutely untrue. The African Landed Estates Co. Ltd. also mentioned in the said paragraph was a respectably formed company and simply failed for want of capital the public not having subscribed to it. It was certainly in no sense whatever a swindle as mentioned in such article nor was I a prime mover although I certainly was a director. Referring to page 490 of the said issue the references therein to the Methuen Settlement are also untrue, a block of 8 farms was not granted to me by the Government but I and a Mr. Richardson jointly pur<lb/>chased and paid for such farms with our own money. They never were intended nor were they ever used for the said Methuen Settlement but were afterwards resold by my partner and myself and never formed part of the said Methuen Settlement. My position with the Methuen Settlement which was not a company but a philan<lb/>thropic convention of gentlemen was that of paid agent in South Africa. I received my first six months' salary and nothing more. The suggestion in such article that I sent fraudulent cable messages as to finding of gold on the Hutton Farm is abso<lb/>lutely false. I was not there as an expert not being a mining engineer but Mr. St. Stephens mentioned in such article examined the property and he it was who asserted he found the gold and on whose and other experts' authority any messages which I may have sent were sent and since that date the existence of gold on that property has been amply proved as I have ascertained from assays made in Kimber<lb/>ley</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189705240035"/>
               <p>by competent assayers of ore taken from the said property. I sent over no cables whatever except on the authority of Mr. St. Stephens mentioned in the said article and other experts. It is absolutely untrue to say that the ground was salted by me or so far as I know by any one else. I no doubt did say that there was gold upon the said property having myself seen it taken out from there by the said Mr. St. Stephens and I believe so still and I have within the last four months again seen it taken out from the said property. The British Bechuanaland Company never owned the property mentioned on page 490 of the said paper and it was not until they had failed to buy the property from me and had gone into liquidation that I mortgaged it and it was subsequently sold by the mortgagee but I do not know to whom. I say that the said article refers to me in several places as an adventurer a scoundrel a swindler who ought to be criminally tried at the Old Bailey for obtaining money under false pretences and I submit to this Honourable Court that such statements which I swear are wholly untrue are gross libels and ought to be restrained by the injunction of this Honourable Court. There are similar libellous statements concern<lb/>ing me in the issue of the said <hi rend="italic">African Critic</hi> of the 11th of April contained on pages 454 455 and 456 of which statements I also complain and the truth of which I wholly deny. The said issues of the 11th and 18th April inst. are now produced and shown to me marked respectively "A" and "B." The said libels are doing me serious injury with my business connections in South Africa and in fact are utterly paralys<lb/>ing my operations in matters of business in which I am seeking my livelihood. I therefore ask this Honourable Court to grant an injunction that the defendants Henry Hess and R. O. Hearson Limited be restrained from printing publishing cir<lb/>culating selling or exporting any copies of the said paper containing any repetitions of the libels above mentioned or any similar libels affecting me.</p>

C Hill-Kennedy in the same office—the document is an indenture made on January 30th between Mr. Kennedy and myself, he being called the owner, and I the assignee—I did not know Mr. Kennedy; as far as I knew I had never seen him—I had not before that acquired any property in South Africa, or employed anybody to acquire any—the document states that Kennedy is the holder of two licences, Nos. 119 and 116, consisting of two farms, and that the rights under those licences were as<lb/>signed to me—I did not know those farms, nor did I know of any service that I had rendered to Kennedy—I may have seen him, but I never knew who he was till the end of 1896—after I had executed the document I left the office—I had no reason for stopping; I left the licences there that day—this document, No. 28, is a memorandum of agreement between myself and Baxter; by this I sell the gold mining licences described in the schedule for £3,000 in cash and one-half of a company to be formed—I did not know Mr. Wright, Mr. Moore, or Mr. Ferguson—I executed the agreement—I heard later on that shares had been allotted to me; I could not say exactly when—I never got possession of them—I think I was to have 500 or 600 for signing this document—I see before me a transfer of</p>

               <p>17,000 shares from myself to William Robert Archer, of School House, St. George's—I executed that transfer on May 27th, 1896—I executed it in blank—I got no consideration for that—I did not know the person to whom I made that transfer; I never saw him till I was at the Police-court—I did not know I was the holder of 67,000 shares till afterwards—I did not know how many shares were allotted to me—I believe there were three or four transfers signed in blank; I signed them—they were transfers of shares in Button's Gold Development Company.</p>

Smith and Sons were not included in the notice; they had given an undertaking not to sell, the day before; they were written to in the first place; they were not served with the writ—Hearsons did not give any undertaking, and they were continued as defendants—after the injunction had been granted nothing took place until the trial of the action—on the 28th the summons was adjourned to May 5th; then application was made to continue the injunction till the hearing of the case—the same affidavit was used for every purpose; there was no fresh affidavit, and no further order—the second time the affidavit was used was on June 24th, when an order was made for Mr. Hess to pay the costs—I was not present at the hearing at Guildhall—on the action proceeding, an application was made by Mr. Hess to examine Mr. Ward on commission, but he happened to be then in this country, and he was examined—the prisoner was present at his examination; it was read over to him—I knew of the transfer of a large bulk of shares into the name of Archer, my fellow-clerk—I received a communication from the prisoner, brought by Mr. Ackerman—I subse<lb/>quently saw the prisoner with regard to it, and I asked him why he could want such a share, because he wanted a transfer from me, for I had never heard of it before—the letter asked for a transfer of 500 shares—the prisoner asked me to get it for him from Archer—at that time Archer had left Mr. Savidge's employment—I either went to him or wrote to him for that purpose, and I got from him a transfer for the 500 shares for Mr. Ackerman—I saw some transfers of shares in the possession of Mr. Savidge—some hundred shares were transferred to me—the prisoner wanted transfers of the remaining shares from Archer—I left Mr. Savidge on January 7th this year—this is the letter Ackerman brought me (46)—on this is Ackerman's receipt for the 500 shares—No. 47 is in Mr. Kennedy's writing, it is dated November 27th, from Poole's Hotel, Cape Town; and another, dated November 30th, also from Poole's Hotel, Cape Town, both commencing "My dear Fitz."</p>

I am a commission agent, of 30, Broad Street House; on April 24th, 1896, the prisoner came to my office; I think I met him outside—he asked me to get him some money—he mentioned £50 at first, then £25—he wanted it in an action against Mr. Hess for libel, statements which he said were untrue—there was one libel which I do not think did refer to him, and that was the one he was going particularly upon, but there was another he showed me in the <hi rend="italic">African Critic—</hi> he suggested that I was to get the money from Major Aylmer—I went and saw Major Ayluier—he said that he would lend me the £25; he did not want to know what it was for, I could lend it if I liked—I asked him beforehand what the security would be—he said he would charge his interest in the Bechuanaland Gold Reef De<lb/>velopment Company, and give me a charge on Messrs. Brown Brothers for it—the security was to be his first money and shares coming from Bechuanaland—I think it was to cover £100 altogether—he said it was coming to him in between three and six weeks—on that, Major Aylmer handed me a cheque for £25—on April 24th I</p>

               <p>formed in 1889, and not the company we were discussing this morning—the terms of taking possession of the farms by the company were by the first agreement in cash and shares; the second agreement modified the first by making the payment in shares only; that is my memory—Hill got from the company about £3,000—I cannot remember the payment of £5,000 in cash—we received money from the public, out of which £5,000 could have been paid—cash was paid to the vendors—we paid £5,000 for the land—Hill and Richardson were appointed joint managing directors in South Africa—money was sent to them for their expenses and other purposes—I cannot ear-mark it, but no money was ultimately payable except in shares—I can produce the agreement with my company to-morrow—I remember no conversation with Kennedy and Richardson as to the cancellation of the agreement by which they sold this pro<lb/>perty to the company—I heard that Bryden made an agreement by which the agreement between them and the company was cancelled for £150. (<hi rend="italic">Letter from Mr. Bryden of February</hi> 3rd, 1890, <hi rend="italic">produced, in which were the words</hi> "renouncing all claims to the £5,000 cash balance of the purchase-money hitherto unpaid.") My impression is that the £5,000 is not renounced; I have heard the words—speaking carefully from memory, I say it is wrong—Bryden was a director, but he was in Africa—Hill gave to Oppert an irrevocable power for value as to the £5,000 consideration—I will endeavour to produce the document—I have no idea of what Captain Hill wrote me on July 5th, 1889; but Sitlageli is not in my neighbourhood, but is a post town ten or fifteen miles away, and has farms round, but is not a-farm—our property has nothing to do with Sitlagoli—I never told him it was part of our property—I should not expect him to go on striking reefs on other people's property—of course, I addressed my letters to him there when he was at Sitlagoli—the Sitlagoli river may form one of the boundaries of the property, but I understood it was a town—I know the Maritsani is a river—I remember his letter of August 22nd, in which he says he will get the Transvaal Inspector of Mines over to report, after which it will be well to send a man well known in England—I have heard Mr. Fuller's name; I do not know what he was—I recollect someone was instructed by the Civil Commissioner in Mafe<lb/>king to take a sample of the conglomerate found—Hill told me that the bags taken to Johnson and Matthey were sealed by the Civil Com<lb/>missioner of Mafeking, and I think he told me some were taken by Mr. Fuller, but I cannot recollect—I do not know that in some of the samples taken by Mr. Fuller were found payable gold—I do not recollect the pri<lb/>soner showing me a letter from Mr. Fuller—I think our company went, into voluntary liquidation, not under the supervision of the Court, but I was not then acting for the company.

                  </hi>. I am a professional mining engineer, of many years' experience—in September, 1889, I was consulted by the directors of the British Bechuanaland Company with a view to going to South Africa and reporting upon their property—I was shown letters and cablegrams received from Hill, the managing director on the property—I read them all—I was to be paid in money, debentures and shares—I left on October 9th, and arrived at Kimberley on the 29th, and arrived on the property, after having been detained at Kimberley, on November 28th—Richard<lb/>son accompanied me from Setlagoli to Sitlagoli Junction—Sitlagoli is a post town, and consists of Lamb's Hotel and the Post-office—I spent several days on the property—there was not one gold reef on it—the prisoner arrived about December 6th or 7th—I spent five days riding about the property before I wrote to the Board, and inspected the property—I saw the conglomerate on Button's Farm—we panned 10 lbs. of stuff on December 4th at Sitlagoli Junction, in some Kaffir huts, where we lived, about ten miles from the farm—Richardson was present—the rough work was done by Hearson, the agent, and the fine work was done by myself—in panning you put so many pounds into a dish, place water in it, shaking round the different particles, which, according to their specific gravity, will float or go to the bottom—the gold will go to the bottom, and you pan off and pan off till you come to the sand, which is about 1 lb. weight, and which you put into a smaller dish, and pan on over and over again till, if there is any gold, it will be shown in just a streak at the, bottom—that process was carried out, with the result that there was a very fine show of very light float gold, charged consider<lb/>ably with copper—so small a portion would cover a great space—that was on December 4th, the day I was writing to the board—there were one or more pannings, with similar results—the prisoner was present on the second occasion, because he brought the stuff himself from Sitlagoli—he and the agent drove out together in a buggy—the gold struck me as curious, and was different from what I had seen before, though I sent it to London, as I had no instructions to assay, and I re<lb/>marked that it was very difficult to make a report as to its weight and value; that is to say, how many ounces to the Iton it would go—I searched the whole of the 70,000 acres as astutely as I possibly could, considering the sand and bush, and found that it was physically impossible that a lode could exist in it—I took portions of all the washings—the stuff was brought in by the niggers on their heads from ten miles away—Hill, Richardson or Hearson was always there—Hill was mostly away at Vy<lb/>berg or Kimberley, on the share business—I said I was pleased to see a showing of gold, and I asked Captain Hill to send the boys or niggers out to build two huts at this place, so that I might commence operations—Hill, who was friendly, then said I had better return to England, as they wanted to see to the business of the shares, which were being inquired for considerably, but I refused to do so, as I had not sufficiently</p>

               <p>tested the property, my engagement was for six months to open out the property, and I declined leaving the station until I had completed my work—I had a good deal of trouble to get my hut built; in fact, I went to open up the property on January 7th, and rode to and fro twenty miles for three or four days—Hill wrote me to say Captain Fuller was coming one day during the week, having been sent by the Commissioner to take samples—I replied that any day would suit me but the one I was going to Sitlagoli Post-office, about twenty miles' ride, to post my letters—I posted my own letters, because there was very great deception there—on my return I found Captain Fuller had been on that day, and Hill left a note to say how sorry he was, but Captain Fuller's time was so occupied—I have not the note—it was simply a piece of paper written in a hut—Mr. Bryden arrived on the farm on February 9th, with his friend Mr. Mackay—Hearson had left two days before that, and Richardson left with Hill on February 14th—I saw Hill on that day—I remained till March 30th, having written my report on the 29th, and having been on the property three months—during that time I had had the assistance of a very good miner whom I had brought from England—Mr. Mackay visited from February 11th to the end of March—I made an exhaustive examination of the property—I did not conduct the panning on many occasions because there was very little water; we had to send two miles, and buckets were brought in, but the washings were very few—I opened up works, sunk eight shafts, and got 5,000 or 6,000 tons of stuff—I took samples of the stuff—the rough work was done by Hearson, because I had broken a collar bone, and could not do the rough puddling, to begin with—I had sarnies taken from the same places where there had been a show of gold—on February 11th my sus<lb/>picions were aroused that treachery was being played me, and I took stuff from the whole of the shafts, especially where the banket was about 3 ft. thick, where we had on the previous occasions good washings, and I panned 110 pannings, and there was not one trace of gold in the whole lot—after the prisoner, Richardson, and Hearson had left the property, there was never a single trace of gold—I heard at Kimberley from Richardson that the prisoner had declared payable gold a week or a fort-night before I arrived at Kimberley, about October 18th or 19th—I had an interview with Dr. Hahn on my return to England in May—I kept samples, brought them to England, and put them under a microscope in slides, and was surprised to see the samples of gold all bore file markings—this was in about June, 1890—there was only one salting, the other was a test that we tried from a piece of broken pencil-case which we filed—the gold has a lot of copper in it; it is very highly coloured—a good deal of copper is used in French gold coins—it may have been from that or anything else containing a large amount of copper—I gave them to Dr. Foster, as a sample of saltings, in South Africa—thai is the reason they are produced here—I have no doubt the pannings had been salted on each occasion—I afterwards frequently saw Hill in England—I showed him the stuff, and gave him copies of my report—I spoke to him about my in<lb/>terview with Dr. Hahn—when I told him the pannings had been salted, he said he never did it; in fact, he was certain Richardson did not, and he did not thini Hearson did—I have a letter in which he exonerates me—I</p>

               <p>showed him Dr. Halm's letter, and jokingly said he ought to have been consistent, and used the same coin, so as not to have so much silver in one and copper in another—Dr. Hahn had said he had found silver in one and copper in the other sample—he called it extraneous matter—after that the prisoner brought an action against me for slander, which came on for trial on November 1st or 2nd, 1892, before the present Judge—the accusation was that I had said that Hill had salted the property, and that a warrant was out for his arrest—I had never said that—I gave evidence at the trial—Hill was in Court—I gave an account of what I had found, and that the pannings had, in fact, been salted—there was a verdict for me, with costs—Hill has not paid me the costs—he brought another action against me about the end of November or December, 1895—Mr. Palmer was the solicitor—the statement of claim was delivered on March 21st, 1895, and the allegation was that the plaintiff had suffered damage from inflammatory matters spoken by the defendant to Mr. Bryden, of the Bechuanaland Company, who was connected with the Methuen Settlement—the action was dismissed for want of prosecution, the costs to be taxed, and paid by the plaintiff to the defendant—the pri<lb/>soner has not yet paid them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBSON</hi>. I did not suggest that Hill had done the salting—I do not answer whether I suggest it now, for the prisoner's sake—he complained I had slandered him by saying he had salted the mine—I justified the statement—my remarks to him about his incon<lb/>sistency in the saltings were made jestingly—I had never seriously made any charge against him personally or impersonally—five persons were there, but I do not know that he did it—that I said he did it were the words the solicitor put in—the document was drawn by counsel—I found a banket reef on December 3rd—it was not merely the presence of copper, but the flatness of the gold, or the flaking in the gold, that caused me to send to London—my suspicions that the pannings were not genuine began on January 29th, when in the property that had shown four ounces to the ton I could not find a trace—the Sitlagoli Farm is just across the River Maritsani, and belonged to an Afrikander—I would have liked to have an interest with Richardson and Captain Hill in any undertaking outside the Mutton's Farm, and we had an arrangement to that effect, but the document was not signed; Hill was too clever—I have the original copy of the arrangement here, written on Sitlagoli paper—I gave a copy to Hill, to be submitted to his solicitor—the date is Decem<lb/>ber 16th, 1889—they did not refuse to enter into the arrangement—I refused to have anything more to do with it about the 21st, as a Mr. James Ford was to have the money to spend—the refusal was not after January, because I took out my own licence, independently of them—I met Hill as he was leaving on January 1st for Kimberley, and I took out a licence a day or two previously at Mafeking—I can produce it to-morrow—that I told Hill if they did not make an arrangement with me I would smash him or his company, is an infamous falsehood—we made two washings in January—one I was satisfied with, the other did not show so well—I wrote Hill letters, and I have my letter-book here (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)—I told them to proceed till the washings were more pro<lb/>nounced—I do not know whether I wrote to the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> of February 22nd, 1890—part of an outside broker's circular was sent to</p>

I am a director of the British Bechuana<lb/>land Company—I knew of the prisoner and Richardson going out to the property of the company in 1889—I went out afterwards—I have seen the telegrams and reports of the property—there was a panning by both the prisoner and Richardson, both being present at the same time—I went out in 1890, and in February I went up the country with Mr. Mackie, a friend of mine, and Captain Hill to Sillagoli, either that afternoon or next day, I forget which, and Richardson, the partner, came in from the pro<lb/>perty, and I undid a quantity of the supposed soil; the auriferous soil was brought in at the same time—some of the soil was opened by Richardson and Hill, in the presence of Hill, Mackie and myself, and one or two others—I forget how many pans were taken; at all events, one pan showed what would be called a show of gold; the prisoner took it up with a knife—Richardson and himself did that out of the panning; the result was very pleasant to a stranger like myself—Mr. Mackie is in Court—he was not in the least connected with the company; he went out to see the country—after this incident had taken place, Richardson and the prisoner only stayed on the property a very short time; I think they both went a day or two after—I know the place where Mr. St. Stephen was on the Hutton's Farm—I rode out there with him the next day—I remained with the property till the end of May; during all that time I never saw any further trace of gold—Hearson, who had been there, went back to Lamb's Hotel, and went behind the bar—the company afterwards went into liquidation—I am familiar with all the circumstances as to how it never became the property of the company; it is a long story—subsequently</p>

I am a bootmaker, and live at Fenge—I am father of the last witness—on April 3rd Frank Howard, my grandson, came to me and I went to 16, Lyndhurst Road—I heard screams for help coming from a woman—I went through the kitchen into the scullery—I burst open the scullery door, and I saw the prisoner with his hand grasping his wife's neck and holding it down—she was at the side of the bed, kneeling down, with her head on the bed and blood on her—I saw a wound in her neck bleeding—I did not see any other wound then, but I did afterwards, on the side of the neck and chin—I said, "Let the woman alone"—he said, "I shan't"—I said again, "Let the woman alone"—he said, "I will kill her"—I got hold of her shoulders, and pushed him away with my right hand, and she rushed under my arm into the other room—the policeman arrived just at that time.</p>

I am the wife of William Hall, of 68, Oakley Street, Lambeth, and let lodgings—on April 29th, about 10.30 a.m., the prisoners came there together, and Wheeler asked if I had a room to let—I said, "Yes,"and took them to the second-floor back, which was furnished—Wheeler told me that the other man was deaf—he asked the rent of the room—I said, "Six shillings,"when he looked up the chimney, and said, "Bill Jones, this will do"—that name had not been given to me before—Sullivan said, "I will go and get my things,"and asked if the room would be ready at four o'clock—I said, "Yes"—they said nothing more, but went down, and returned at a few minutes past four—when Wheeler was looking at the chimney he asked if there was an oven in the house, and said that his wife was coming in a day or two—they said that they came from Italy, and Sullivan said that they came from Dublin on the Monday previous—Sullivan only spoke by the motion of his mouth, but he was the spokesman—he gave me the six shillings, and I gave him the street-door key, but no other key—he told me not to be afraid, I should always get the rent—the other man said that his name was <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Jones—they remained in the room till 6.30, and then both went out together and returned about 11.30—they both slept there that night—on the 30th they went out at 9.30, and I did not see any more of them till Saturday night—after they left I went into their room; their bed was made when I went in; I examined it, and found six bad half-crowns and a florin wrapped in paper, and paper between them, between the bed and the palliasse; I put them back again—I was alone—I called my married daughter and my son's wife, and then looked further about the room, and found in the coal-cupboard these bottles, a box, a stone jar with some black stuff in it, some sand, a paper bag, like a sugar bag, with something in it to charge the batteries (I know that because I have an electric bell), some white powder, and a pudding basin—I searched the bed because it was made in such a peculiar manner—I next saw Sullivan on Saturday, May 1st, about 1.15 a.m.; Wheeler returned at neon; I saw him come in—he walked straight up to Sullivan's room—I saw Sullivan at 7.20, and they went out together at 1.30—when Wheeler came in he had two small cardboard boxes with him, and a brown-paper parcel when he went out—Sullivan had nothing then, but he came in alone at 7.20 p.m., with a parcel tied up in a white pocket-handkerchief under his arm—he went to his room, went out again, and returned at 12.30 a.m. on Sunday—about midday on Sunday my daughter told Wheeler that Sullivan was out; he came downstairs directly—I</p>
