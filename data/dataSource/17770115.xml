               <p>Did he say any thing? - I cannot recollect that he did; he had a stick or bludgeon in his hand, but did not do any thing with it: they ran back towards Canonbury-house; I followed them to Canonbury-house, thinking I should hear of them; I told several people afterwards of it and they were taken up, but my watch was never found; I had a full view of their faces; I am certain the prisoners are the men that robbed me.</p>

               <p>Did Mr. Hancock give the same account then he has given now? - Exactly; he is very ill now; he was very well then; he is about 80 years of age: Hall confessed that they shared the money, and he disposed of the watch.</p>

               <p>I am a silk garter weaver, and live in Moorfields: upon the 23d of December, about 10 in the morning, Fuller came to me booted and spurred, and said, Goswell wanted to speak to me immediately upon some capital business; I went with him to Goswell, who was at a public house in Blackman-street; I do not remember exactly the house; Fuller went for Goswell, Goswell came: and asked me how I did? he said, he had a bill of Exchange, and if I would discount it for him, he should be obliged to me; this is it (producing a Bill of Exchange for 325 l. 11 s. 7 d.) I said, what will you have for it? he said, if you will get me 150 l. for it, I will give you 10 guineas; I said, I had no money at present; he said, when shall I call for it? I told him, to-morrow; then said he, I will either call or send: I went to Baker's Coffee-house to search the newspaper, whether this bill, which I suspected to be stolen, was advertised, but did not make any discovery that day; upon Tuesday the 24th I examined again; Goswell neither came on the Tuesday or sent, but upon Christmas-day all three of the prisoners came together on horseback, about noon; Goswell leaned down to my cheek and whispered, Have you done the bill for me? I said, No, I have tried a gentleman, but I could not get the cash for it, if you will stay till Friday I will do it for you; he said, give it to me again, I will give you 10 guineas for your trouble; I said, I could not; it was in the hands of such a person, but if he would call on Friday he should have it; on the 26th I went again to search the papers about this bill, and then found that it was advertised as having been stolen upon the 21st of December; they said, they must go, for they had some particular business; I took great notice of all their horses; Goswell's was a sorrel horse with a bald face, Fuller's a dark coloured chesnut gelding, Life's a chesnut mare, about the same colour as Fuller's; having made this discovery, I went to Sir

               <p>He did it so openly, it was impossible to escape detection? - He could not escape; I had two other officers along with me; I seized hold of him, and took the spoons out of his hands, and took him into the shop to Mr. Edwards: I had him in custody on suspicion of house-breaking; he was cleared of that.</p>

               <p>Was the playhouse very full the night you was there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The king and queen were there that night? - They were that night at the play-house; they were not come in.</p>
               <p>The theatre was very full? - It was.</p>
               <p>What part of the pit did you fit in? - Near the door.</p>
               <p>You was very much crowded? - Yes, very much by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you detect the prisoner with your purse in his hand, or did you detect his hand in your pocket? - I felt his hand come out of my pocket; I seized him by the arm with my purse in his hand.</p>
               <p>On what side did the prisoner stand? - First on my right, then on my left hand.</p>
               <p>In the immensity of that crowd, how can you take upon you to assert, that the hand you felt in your pocket was the prisoner's hand? - By his crowding me very much: I am positive it was his hand; I had hold of his hand, and took the purse out of it.</p>
               <p>Can you be peremptory in swearing it was the prisoner's hand, under all the circumstances of the great crowd that must be there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your purse dropped? - No, I took it out of his hand, and secured him directly.</p>
               <p>By what means was he secured? - By a constable, I believe.</p>
               <p>When you called out did you point the prisoner out to the persons to whom you called for assistance? - I did.</p>
               <p>- MARSHALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in the pit of the play-house: there was only Mr. Barrington between me and this Lady; she said Mr. Barrington had taken her purse; I charged him with it; he said he was a gentleman of fortune, and lived in Pallmall, and we were taking a gentleman's character from him; he was secured.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did she ever express any doubt about his being the man? - No; at the instant she said she had lost her purse, she held it up; I saw it in her hand, when she said she had lost her purse I saw him draw his hand away across his breast.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was not the theatre much crouded that night? - It was.</p>
               <p>On what side of the lady did the prisoner sit? - On the left hand, and on my right.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the first falling to the ground of the purse? - It did not fall; I saw it in Miss Dudman's hand; she took it from him, as she said; I did not see her take it from him, but I saw his hand come athwart his own breast; and at that instant she declared that the man had picked her pocket of her purse, and she charged him with it, and so did I.</p>
               <p>Was no different relation given before the magistrate to what is now given before the court? - Only that he crowded Miss Dudman before that she complained to me; I desired him to be civil; he said, civility was not to be expected at that place.</p>
               <p>Did you accompany the lady to the magistrate? - I did.</p>
               <p>She was as peremptory to the prisoner then as she is now? - She was.</p>

               <p>My lord and gentlemen of the jury,</p>
               <p>The evidence which has come before your lordship and these gentlemen, I hope you will not think sufficient to convict a man of the crime of felony; I shall relate the transaction as briefly as possible: I was in the play-house in that part of the pit which is called the standing part, and it was so very crowded that the doors were obliged to be screwed up, in order to push the people in; the seats were all taken, and those that were in the standing part were endeavouring, as far as they could, to procure seats; the crowd was so great that they hurt each other; this lady was before me, making towards a seat; I, as every person then present, was doing the same, and she cried out that some person had their hand in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177701150012"/> her pocket, and that she had taken her purse out of their hand; she looked round immediately and fixed upon me, at the same time that she was surrounded by many people, that it was a minute at least before she could turn round; I immediately professed my innocence, and called upon the company to declare, whether it was possible for such a transaction to happen without some person being privy to it, and seeing it, in such a place where so many people were assembled together; and every gentleman, who was present, was of the same opinion, and were unanimous in saying they were certain I was innocent. My lord and gentlemen, upwards of 5 minutes had passed in this altercation, and the noise in some measure had subsided; but some gentlemen, who had lost their property at the play-house that night, hearing a rumour, came immediately and declared, if there was a suspected person there, it was necessary he should give satisfaction and clear himself; that he should retire to some place and be searched; to this I assented, and was retiring at the time with several people who were there, when we were met by the constable, who told me I must go before Sir

            ; when we were there I was searched, my property was taken from me and detained for 8 days, and then returned, because no person could claim a single article; if the evidence this lady has given is sufficient to convict me of the crime, it is in the power of any one to take away the life or liberty of any person whatsoever; such a crime as this could never happen in such a place without some person being witness to it; the lady might have found a hand in her pocket, and her fear might make her believe the man had her purse in his hand and she had taken it out, but the crowd was so exceeding great that it was impossible to turn; the people were crying out they were so excessively squeezed, and I hope it will have weight with the gentlemen of the jury; I mentioned just now that it was so exceedingly crowded, that, if such a transaction had happened, it was almost impossible to fix upon the person; the lady, I don't mean to reflect upon her, but I am obliged to take hold of every circumstance, in order to extricate myself, the lady is blind of one eye; this I conceive adds to the impossibility of fixing upon the identity of a person; and I would beg leave to ask the lady if she is acquainted with a Mr. Groves?</p>

               <p>PRISONER. My lord, I admit that letter came from me: a gentleman came to Tothill-fields Bridewell, to see one of the prisoners in the gaol, natural curiosity prompted him to ask who I was, he was told; he said he was perfectly well acquainted with my prosecutrix, and had often heard her express her regret for the manner in which she had treated me; and he told me if I would address her with a few lines, as he said it was a disagreeable thing to appear in court, that the bill would be thrown out, and I should have no more trouble; this induced me to do it.</p>
               <p>COURT. You may look at the letter.</p>

               <p>Did he keep good hours while he lived at your house? - Yes; he appeared to be a carpenter, and came to his meals and kept regular hours.</p>

I believe the prisoner is the man that stopped us; I saw him three different times: though he had a crape upon his face that hung down to the tip of his nose, I could distinguish the lower part of his face; and I had several opportunities to observe, being stopped three times; the first time the lamps were not lighted; I rather think I was stopped the second time by mistake, not knowing that it was the same carriage he had stopped before; it was the last time that he searched the carriage.</p>

               <p>I was stopped upon the 6th of December, the first time between Langley Broome and Colnbrook; I lost some gold and some silver; the prisoner on this side the Magpie stopped me a second time, but then I let down the window and said to him, why you have been with me before, upon which he bid us drive on; the lamps were then lighted; they were not lighted when first he robbed me; a little on this side Cranford-Bridge he stopped us again; he said, you have somebody else in the carriage; but found we had not; he ordered me to get out, which I did; I was going to get out at the door that he was at, but he ordered me to get out on the other side; the prisoner himself opened the door next to him, and then took out the cushion; the seat was locked; he ordered the coachman to give me the key, and I opened it; then he ordered the coachman to take one of the candles out of the lamp to light him; and he asked me what there was there? I said, I don't know; here is some game; then he asked the coachman why he locked the seat? the coachman said to preserve the parcels from being lost: I handed up a parcel to the prisoner; he looked at it by the light; I told him I thought it was like a pair of shoes; he took out two or three other parcels, and I read the directions of some by the candle which the coachman held; he held it in at the front window; I read a direction on one of the baskets; the prisoner asked me what it was; I said I thought it was game; he took three other parcels that were like letters; he then went away and bid us drive on; but we did not immediately drive on; upon which he called to us again and bid us drive away; it was very dark at the time; he had a crape half way on his face; I had an opportunity of seeing his face tolerably plain.</p>
               <p>Whether you believe the prisoner to be the man? - Yes, he is.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt whether he is the man? - I have no doubt at all of his being the man; I have seen him several times since at Sir

               <p>Was the robber armed? - No; I saw none, but I apprehended there might be some accomplices near; he had a great coat on; it was not buttoned up, so as to hinder my seeing his face; I took particular notice of his voice too, and that is another reason that induces me to think the prisoner is the man; the lower part of his face is very remarkable as it is not equal; there is a difference between one side and the other of his face; I saw him afterwards at Sir

I gave him 20 guineas and 10 s. in change; but as I had not then all the goods that he wanted, he said he would come again in the afternoon; he came again at half past 2 o'clock and dined with me; he had been at my shop twice before; I had procured the other things against he came; after dinner he laid out all the rest of the money he received in change, which was 20 guineas, except 16 s. Between the time of his coming to my shop and his returning in the afternoon I went to Messrs. Brown and Collinson with the bill for acceptance; I left it there; on Monday I went for the bill, and then I was told they had received information that this bill had been stolen, and they told me I must give the best account I could of the person from whom I received it; having received this information I then recollected that some time before, for he had dealt with me for some silver tea-spoons and some salt-spoons or some such matters; I recollected where these were to be sent before, and upon this I sent my brother to go along with Sir

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon to then Middlesex Hospital.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing of this Weaver being brought in there? - He was brought in on the night of Christmas-day; he had received two wounds, one in the thigh, the other on the right-side; I examined them both particularly that night and the following day, but I could not perceive that the wound had penetrated into the cavity of the chest, and the wound of the thigh was very insignificant; I examined the wound of the side most particularly, but could not by any means perceive that it had penetrated into the cavity of the chest.</p>
               <p>The man died in the hospital, he was there eleven days? - Thirteen days.</p>
               <p>What was the cause of his death? - I imagine from the sever he took after he came into the hospital.</p>
               <p>Did you sever proceed from the wound? - I don't believe it did.</p>
               <p>Then you don't conceive that the wound was the cause of his death? - I don't.</p>
               <p>Did you attend to open the body before the coroner? - Yes; he was three days in the hospital in a very good way, on the fourth day he was seized with a fever, from which time he was under the care of a physician; I found he had such a disease upon him as would have killed him soon if he had not come into the hospital.</p>
               <p>What disease was that? - A disease in his lungs; the lungs had a great adhesion and a vast quantity of matter in them; I opened him the next day after he died.</p>
               <p>What do you believe was the cause of his death? - A sever, and an inflammation of his lungs.</p>
               <p>The matter in the lungs collected there you think was the cause of the sever? - I do.</p>
               <p>COURT. The sever is called the hospital sever, is it not? - No, I don't take it to be the hospital sever; but that sever would have come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177701150034"/> on without that; his liver was very much diseased too.</p>
               <p>Then in your judgment upon your oath, neither of the wounds were the cause of his death? - No.</p>
               <p>From the Jury. Was there any other surgeon that examined the body besides you? - Two other gentlemen were present.</p>
               <p>Were they of the same opinion? - Exactly.</p>

               <p>COURT. Give an account of what happened there, and the manner in which the deceased got the wound of which he died. - About half past 12 at night on the 28th of last month, as I was sitting up waiting for a gentleman who lodged at my house, there came some people to my door who demanded admission, which I refused, desiring to know who they were; I did not choose to open my door to any but those I knew something of; they refused to give any other account than that he was a gentleman and an officer, but no name was given; I still repeated, I would not open the door to any body I did not know; the deceased immediately, with great violence, forced it open from its then fastening; he burst the door open about 18 inches; I got it shut with great difficulty, and put up the iron bar; when he found the door was made fast again he called out, D - n your blood, you are only a rascally waiter, and I will be revenged of your master to-morrow, and with great violence kicked at the door and stove the bottom pannel; I could no longer bear to have my door broke to pieces: I took up this stick (a very large one) and opened the door with the stick in my hand; the first thing that I saw was the deceased with his drawn sword; he made a lunge at my body; I warded off that, and many chops and thrusts, the marks of which are to be seen upon this stick; this created a very great noise; Mr. Storer was then gone up stairs to go to bed; he called out, White, what is the matter? I don't know that I made him any answer, if I did, I know not what it was, but very soon Mr. Storer came down with a pistol in his hand, and his servant attended him; Mr. Storer was in his night-gown and night-cap without his stockings; he came forward and demanded of the person who I was then engaged with, who he was, and what he wanted; the deceased immediately left me and made a thrust at Mr. Storer.</p>
               <p>Where was Mr. Storer standing at that time? - In the middle of the passage; he retreated on seeing the sword pushed at him, and told the deceased, if he did not desist he should be obliged to shoot him; the deceased said, shoot and be d - d, and continued pushing; Mr. Storer repeated those words twice or three times, that he should be obliged to shoot him if he did not desist.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was Mr. Storer retired to when he fired? - Very near the bannisters; I cannot be certain whether he touched them or not.</p>
               <p>He could not have gone farther back? - I apprehend not.</p>
               <p>Where did he wound him? - On the right side of the belly; the deceased said he was wounded, and dropped the sword out of his hand; he asked to have his sword again,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177701150035"/> which was given him I believe by Mr. Storer's servant, and he walked away: at the corner of my house I saw he was joined by two women in red cloaks.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You had never seen the deceased before, he was an entire stranger to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is your custom I believe, though you keep an inn and a tavern, to shut up your house at a much earlier time than this? - I always fasten my doors with a temporary fastening, and never let any body in except a lodger or a person I am acquainted with.</p>
               <p>And you never saw the deceased before? - No; I have seen his picture to-day, but I never saw him before that night.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Storer: I followed my master when he came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Had you heard any noise or uproar in the house before you came down? - I heard a violent noise, as if somebody was breaking into the house; my master asked me what was the matter; I told him, I did not know; my matter listened a while and found the noise more violent than before; he said, I believe somebody is breaking into the house, give me one of your pistols, I will go down and see what is the matter; I gave him one of my pistols and took the other myself, and followed my master down stairs; when we came to the bottom of the stairs I saw the door open, and a man with a sword drawn lunging at Mr. White in a very cruel manner; Mr. White was defending himself with a stick; my master asked Mr. White what was the matter; Mr. White told my matter, That there was a man had broke open his door, and chose to come in without giving any account of himself; my master advanced towards the door and asked the man what he wanted, and told him, he had no right to come in there; his answer was, By G - d, he would come in; he them turned from Mr. White and made a thrust at my master; my master retreated towards the stairs; then he made another lunge at my master, who retreated as before; my master, finding he could not retreat from him any farther because of the bannisters of the stairs, he told the deceased, if, he did not go back he would oblige him to fire upon him; the deceased said, Fire away and be d - d, and made another lunge at my master, who then fired at him, upon which he dropped his sword and said, I am wounded; he turned about and walked out at the door; when on the outside of the door he said, You will give me my sword; I took his sword up and gave it to him; he then went off without giving any account of himself: had not my master fired at the time he did, he must have been run through the body, as the sword was near his belly.</p>

Keith, as the woman told me his name, for I did not know him, he was so much altered; he set on the step with his back to the door groaning exceedingly; when he came into the parlour I asked him, what is the matter, Capt. Keith? raising himself up a little he said, I am shot through the body, I am a dead man, lead me to bed; the women led him up stairs to his bed; I undressed him and put him to bed; he fell into a dose, and one of the women went with me for a surgeon; the other staid with him in the room; I went to Palace-yard and fetched Dr. Justamond; he came and took some blood from him; I asked the women, where they found the Captain in that said condition; they said, Between Pedler's-acre and the Swan.</p>
               <p>Did he himself give any account how he came by this wound? - I asked him several times; he was in liquor when he came home; I went to the bedside after I sent the woman away, and asked Capt. Keith how he was; he made answer, O my side, my side, my side, could that pain be taken away in my side, it affects my breath; I asked him, when he was sober, if he could remember the person, or could he see the person that shot him; he said, I was so much in liquor I cannot positively say; I asked him in the morning, if he should know the person that shot him, or if he could tell me where it was; he said, Now I am sober, to the best of my knowledge, Mrs. Smith, it was done in the Swan.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177701150036"/>He never told you any other way in which it happened? - No other than what I mentioned.</p>
               <p>Did you never say that he told you it happened in any other way? - No; being in liquor he said it was between Pedler's-acre and the Swan; that was before he was sober.</p>
               <p>Who did he say it was done by? - He did not say the person.</p>
               <p>Did he say it was done by robbers? - No further; I said, Was it done by foot-pads? he spoke so low I could not distinguish what he said.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You were examined before a Justice of Peace about this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And a second time before the Coroner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe you forgot in both of those times to mention this circumstance, his saying it was done at the Swan? - I did not recollect it.</p>
               <p>You was so much frightened both times? - I did not recollect it in my fright.</p>

               <p>Have you found any of those things again? - I have found most part of the things in the prisoner's lodging and at a pawnbroker's; I found some in the lodgings where the prisoner was a-bed in St. Ann's parish; I believe the name of the person that keeps the house is Ray; I found these shoe-buckles in his shoes.</p>

               <p>Had you any conversation with Jericho about it? - Yes; the day the prisoner was taken; he came about three o'clock; he said he was very fond of the prisoner, but he wanted to leave his service a great many times; he said he had made him many presents; that he gave him a suit of cloaths and some linen.</p>
               <p>Did you hear that he ever accused him of stealing any things? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the things being found in the room? - The constable went up; I had nothing to do with his room; Jericho said the prisoner had stole many things and pawned them; the prisoner said they were all what his master had given him.</p>
               <p>What day was Jericho with you? - The 3d of January; on the 29th of December he sent an officer of the Marshalsea-court to make up the affair, and said he knew he owed him 12 guineas.</p>

               <p>Was not you stronger than her? - I did not try for that; then she said the watchman was coming and would take me up; I charged the watch with her; the constable examined her and found one half crown in her pocket and the other tucked in her hair.</p>

               <p>I had but one half crown about me; I had a half crown in my hand; I was lifting up my hat; I had been hard at work; for I have three small children to maintain; the person I lived with some years is gone to America; he said if I would give him one half crown piece I might keep the other; I had no more than my own money; the beadle behaved very indecent to me.</p>
