             sworn. - The prisoner had bought a coat of me; he had not money enough by three shillings, and he came to me again with these things about six or seven weeks ago to sell them, and pay me the three shillings; there were two cotton waistcoats and another waistcoat, and a pair of plush breeches, seated with velveteen, very old; I had them about a month when Mrs. Pierson called and claimed them; they had laid all the time in the window; it was the week before last I believe she claimed them, and I delivered them to the officer; I gave him eighteen shillings for them; I valued the three waistcoats at fifteen shillings; the breeches were not worth above four shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing of selling these things to that gentleman at all.(

               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Pierson). Are you positive that the waistcoats you saw at Hart's were your's? - A. Yes; I know one of them by my own work, and the other I had washed myself several times; and the breeches I know to be mine; they are very remarkable; I know them by a piece that I put in them.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hart). Where did you find the prisoner? - A. The officer found him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pierson. He was taken the day after I found the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have got nothing at all to say, but I lodged in the next room to Mrs. Pierson; she said, she had lost some things; she suspected an old man that lived at the top of the house, and I asked her why she did not go to seek after him; and she went to seek for him, and could not find him; I teach dancing; I know nothing about the things; I always paid her my rent very regular.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Pierson). Did he pay his rent? - A. Not always; I was obliged to seize his goods for rent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mrs. Pierson). Q. Upon your oath, did you not charge somebody else with committing this robbery? - A. I thought of an old gentleman that was coming up stairs one time, but that I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this old gentleman? - A. A person that came after one of my lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said before now that you suspected that person of having robbed you? - A. I did think at one time that it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that gentleman an Irishman? - A. I am not sure that he was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not said at any time you supposed yourself to be robbed by an Irishman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But with respect to this old man, you had some thoughts you had been robbed by him? - A. I had; but unless I had sure proof that he had taken them, it was wrong to say any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lost the things five weeks before you had any tidings of them again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, how many hands they might have gone through in that time, you cannot tell? A. No.</p>

               <p>(The indictment was opened by Mr. Abbott.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury. The prosecution which you are now called upon, as Jurymen, to decide, appears to me, from the facts which I shall shortly communicate to you, to be one of the highest importance that can possibly come for consideration in the shape of a misdemeanor. It has been thought by those entrusted with some of the highest departments of the administration, to be their duty to submit to your protection a class of persons who can in no other way be protected, who are unable to protect themselves, and who appear to have been the objects of the most abandoned and profligate plunder that I think I have ever seen stated in any Court of Justice. You have collected from my learned friend who has opened the indictment to you, that the charge against the prisoner (and probably you will agree with me in thinking, if I prove the facts to you, and which can only subject him to the punishment of a misdemeanor, I own, for one, I wish it was a higher offence, the charge against him) is, that he has obtained, at three several times, a sum of money, amounting in the whole to six guineas, by pretending that he had interest with the very respectable persons named in this indictment, to procure a pardon for an unhappy person who had been attainted of felony. You will find, Gentlemen, that a man of the name of Saunders, who was confined in Newgate under a conviction for felony, had a mother naturally extremely anxious to relieve him from the consequences of his conviction; she was introduced to the prisoner, who, without the least difficulty, stated, that if the pardon she wished was all she desired, a remission of the capital sentence and to enter into the navy, he had such interest with his Grace the Duke of Portland, with Mr. Baldwin, and a very respectable Magistrate, in my eye, Sir 
               <persName id="t17970111-4-person69">

            , that that was a thing to be obtained without the least difficulty, and he thought she might expect a free pardon very soon. Such was his interest with those respectable persons, but it was not to be done without money, and if the money could be procured, the pardon would follow of course. You may easily believe if a mother could obtain four, five, or six guineas, for such a purpose, she would strain every nerve to do it; at first she could only raise three guineas, part of this, to the knowledge of the man at the bar, she borrowed for the purpose of advancing; he then gave her encouragement that it would very soon be done, but he must have more money; she was to come next day with more money, she had none, but he was so importunate, and above all, gave her such hopes that the pardon would arrive, that she, by borrowing, got two guineas more; she saw no more of him for a month. From that time, in suspense, dreading every day the execution of the law upon her son, and anxiously expecting the effect of this man's interest, upon a subsequent application, he obtained another guinea, and he had now got all the poor creature was able to raise by any means; she hoped the pardon would now soon arrive, indeed, he told her then, it was actually accomplished, and only waited for some forms; but those forms must likewise be attended with a further advance of money, and he put it to her how much more she would give if he compleated the contract; she said, she would endeavour to make the six ten guineas, she would give him other four guineas, but she had it not, she would give a note for it: Oh, no, he said, that would not do at all, how should he get paid when the son was discharged? - The poor woman had it not, and therefore she could not advance it; this man, with a ferocity and brutality that degrades him beneath the character of man, immediately replied, d-n her blood, he would do no more for her then; nothing could satisfy him, and though she had advanced all this money he would, leave her, after having raised her hopes, he would leave her in that state of despair and despondency. In this situation the poor woman had an opportunity of representing the matter to the persons who have sent me here. The pretence is, that he had great influence with his Grace the Duke of Portland. You know, Gentlemen, that that Nobleman is at the head of the Administration; you know too, that it is the province of his Majesty alone to dispense pardons; and that this unhappy woman's son could only obtain it from that fource; and it is the most important, and, I believe, I may take the liberty of adding, the most pleasant prerogative of his Majesty; and I am sure I ought to say, that none are treated with greater mercy than through the medium of the noble personages whom I have stated, it is extended, in all proper cases, without influence or interest; and it is not to be bartered for money, there is no interest, no influence that can obtain it; I shall be under the necessity of troubling his Grace to state, merely for form's sake, whether he had any such influence as he pretended, in order to prove the allegations in this indictment; I shall put the same question to the other persons, and I am sure, when the charge is proved, you will be happy to protect those unhappy persons who are too often the prey of men in his situation.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first become personally acquainted with the prisoner? - A. The first was he came to me I think the second of July; he had directions where to find me from sells; either the first or second of July, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what day of the week it was? - A.

Yes, the groom of his bed-chamber; he mentioned him a great many times; I told him I had but three guineas by me then, but the next day I would give him the remaining two; the next day he came for the remaining two; he had three on Sunday and two on Monday; he said, he did not doubt but he could do it and very soon, and if his free pardon came down I must not be surprized; I did not see him again for about a fortnight; he said Sir

               <p>Q. Did he accept it? - A. No, he said that would not do, it was not enough.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not in a condition to raise any more money? - A. No; and I was sure then he was a defraud, because he was so very fluent with the names of so many great people.</p>
               <p>Q. What use did he say he should make of that five guineas? - A. He said, it went through so many different channels, that he should not have a halfpenny left for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. And how was he to deal it out? - A. Through different channels.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not all to go in one channel, then? - A. No, in different channels.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how much was to go in one channel, and how much in another? - A. No, but that it was to go in different channels.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, I take it for granted, this broke off your treaty? - A. I did not see him any more for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. About how long might it be before you saw him again? - A. I cannot say how long a time it was, but it was before the sentence passed for transportation; I believe it to be about a week or ten days before; he wrote to me after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you that letter? - A. I gave it to Mr. Raven.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after you had received that letter? - A. No, not till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the first to the conclusion of the treaty? - A. It was when sentence was passed for transportation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You stated just now, that it was in consequence of a recommendation from Mrs. Sells that the prisoner was first introduced to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was first introduced to you in consequence of his having been the means of some smugglers having been liberated from Newgate upon a charge against government? - A. Yes; that he could clear a criminal better than a smuggler.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts is that? - A. No. 6, Buckler's-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar? - A. That is the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to the house of Mrs. Keys on the 2d of July? - A. I cannot say, but it was on a Saturday in the month of July.</p>
               <p>Q. About what hour of the day? - A. I cannot be positive, it was in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come there for? - A. He asked for Mrs. Keys; I told him she was not at home, she was out at work; and he asked me if Mrs. Keys had not at that time a son in trouble, and I informed him that she had; he told me his wife -</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the wife of Saunders? - A. Yes; that Saunders's wife had made application to him for relief; I told him she would be at home tomorrow; he said it would be attended with a great deal of expence; he seemed to be dubious that Mrs. Keys, being a poor woman, she could not pay it, as I had informed him she was out at work.</p>
               <p>Q. What more did he say then? - A. He told me he would call on the morrow, and that was all that passed at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Keys came home, you had a conversation with her? - A. Yes; on the morrow he came, and I was not there; I saw him on the Monday there; Mrs. Keys called me down to see the money paid; I saw two guineas paid; I did not see the three guineas paid, that was paid before, when I was not there; Mrs. Keys said, that made five guineas she had then paid him; he gave her his hand and word that he would fulfil the promise he had made her; she said, get my son on board of a ship, and he assured her it should be so; he told her she must not be surprised, if in a very short time she heard that he had a free pardon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Keys mention her situation in life to him? - A. Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner after that time? - A. I have met him coming out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Stubbings was likewise there, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. We will save your Lordship the trouble of hearing her evidence; it is only to confirm the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Mr. Knowles said, it was in consequence of Mrs. Saunders desiring him to come to Mrs. Keys, that he had done so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>His Grace the Duke of PORTLAND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. I would just ask your Grace, whether the prisoner had any influence with your Grace to procure pardons? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. BALDWIN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Had the prisoner any such influence with you, as the evidence has represented? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the office which you hold in the Duke of Portland's office? - A. It is a confidential one; matters that are referred to his Grace go through my hands, with such observations as occur to me upon them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. In the course of your situation with his Grace, which you have stated is a confidential one, have you seen Knowles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110008"/>with you at the office? - A. I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it upon the subject of obtaining pardons, or soliciting for a pardon? - A. I don't know whether it was for the purpose of soliciting, but I think he was the man that brought a petition to me for Gee and Richards, and I think he said he brought it from Sir

               <p>Q. Gee and Richards, I believe, afterwards received his Majesty's mercy? - A. They were imorisened some time, but being represented as good seamen, they were sent to sea; soon after, this man, I think, brought another petition; whether it was for Saunders or not, I don't know; but the moment he brought that second petition, I asked him how he came to have any thing to do with such things; I then began to suspect that he was improperly employed in that business, and I then told him that any petition that he should bring after that, would not be attended to, because I had great reason to suppose that he was acting improperly; I forbad him coming to the office upon any such business; notwithstanding this, I believe a day or two afterwards, I met him coming from Burlington-house; I then asked him how he could have the assurance to come upon any such business there, after what had passed between him and me; and I can venture to affirm, that he never had any influence or chance of succeeding with me after that time.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will now ask you, as we find from my learned friend's examination that this man had seen something of the way in which pardons are obtained, could he state truly, that in order to obtain a pardon, money should go from one channel to another? - A. It is very fit the Court should know, and it is very fit the public should know, that there is not one farthing expence attending it, and whenever a pardon is granted, it is without one farthing expence.</p>

               <p>Q. Has he a post of any kind with you? - A. He was recommended to me as a serjeant in the London militia, and I told him he appeared to be too old for that service, but afterwards I mentioned that I would make him a temporary serjeant, and that was the way in which I came to have a knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any further knowledge of him, or he of you, than that? - A. None antecedent to that time; subsequent to that time he was in the regimental employ.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any influence with you, so as to have carried any influence that you might have had in any other channel, with respect to procuring a pardon? - A. Not the least, on the contrary, he desired me to give a letter to the Duke of Portland or Mr. Baldwin, and I positively refused; I told him that I never did write to the Secretary of State for favour of any prisoner, unless it was upon a petition signed by respectable people, certifying as to the conduct of the man antecedent to the offence committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. May it please your Lordship. Gentlemen of the Jury. In the course of the little experience which I have had in this Court, a case of more importance to the interests of the public, and of much importance to the prisoner at the bar, I have never yet had the honour of defending. Unfortunately for the prisoner at the bar, it has fell to my lot to defend him upon this occasion, opposed to one at least, or two of my learned friends, who, in this Court, for many, many years, have practised with honour to themselves and advantage to the public; men who have conducted prosecutions, and conducted defences too with equal honour to themselves and to the public, and have had more experience considerably than the person who now has the honour of addressing you; but satisfied I am, that not with standing I have powerful opponents, not with standing my learned friend has been able to excite your attention, and to raise your passions against the prisoner at the bar, you will, as honest citizens, not give a verdict against the prisoner, from any eloquence that may have belonged to my learned friend to state, nor any observations he may have made unless they are warranted by the evidence which afterwards comes out.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, after making an apology to you for the inexperience with which I am possessed in conducting defences of this fort, I hope I shall not be considered as trespassing upon your time in making some observations, and those observations at some length, in favour of the prisoner at the bar. Gentlemen, first of all my learned friend has stated to you, that this prosecution is of importance to the public, certainly it is of importance to the public, that the poor wretches in Newgate, and who are soliciting pardon by any means, should not have their money taken out of their pockets by fraud, or any thing like what is charged in this indictment. Gentlemen, at the same time give me leave to make an observation upon the statement of my learned friend, although it is of the importance which I have been just stating to you, there is no labourer but what is worthy of his hire; and if he is employed, it follows, as a necessary result of that employ, that he should be paid for it. My learned friend has stated this to you to be a most abominable plunder; a most abominable plunder indeed it is, it that plunder has been made by the defendant at the bar from persons in the situation of the prosecutrix, without procurement or employment of theirs, without any solicitation on their behalf to those persons who had the power to interfere with his Majesty as well as they could by representations to his Majesty to obtain mercy of the King, certainly it follows, that if he made that solicitation to those who were in the consisience of his Majesty, then I say he would be entitled to something for the labour he had been at, and then he would not be liable to the observations my learned friend<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110009"/>has made upon that part of the case. My learned friend says what I was very much surprized to hear him state, as prosecutor for the public, that he should wish the penalty in this case to be other or higherthan it is; why he should wish it to be other-</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I mean to say, I wish it was such a case that he could be hanged for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Gentlemen, I wish to impress that upon your minds; my learned friend has now stated it broadly, and for which I am obliged to him. Gentlemen, the question upon this record is, first of all, whether this person pretended that he had any influence with the three personages whom he represents to have had influence with? Now, unless the prosecutor is able to make that out, I apprehend, subject to the correction of his Lordship, you will not be able to find a verdict of guilty against the prisoner; for the indictment first of all states, that he was acquainted with the Duke of Portland; that he had influence with the Duke of Portland; that he had influence with Mr. Baldwin; and, I think, that he had influence with Sir Watkin Lewes. Now, from their own state of the case, how is that made out? Is it not clear that he must have had some fort of connection sufficiently to use his endeavours to solicit that which was the object of the person who employed him? The Duke of Portland, nobody could doubt it if he had not been here, I would have admitted it, the Duke of Portland could not be supposed to hold any sort of conversation with a man of the description of the defendant. But, Gentlemen, does it follow from thence, that because the Duke of Portland himself has had no conversation with this man upon the subject of pardons, does it follow from thence that the statement of the defendant at the bar, that he had influence with the Duke of Portland, was itself a false representation if the prisoner at the bar (and I put it in this way), had been at the Secretary of State's office for the purpose of soliciting pardons, the Duke of Portland being Secretary of State for the Home Department, and the business of pardons coming within his jurisdiction, and subject to his controul in that officer; then I fairly ask you this question, whether it might not be perhaps wrong in terms to express it, that he had influence with the Duke of Portland? But I put it to you fairly, whether a man having solicited pardons at that very office, and succeeded, might not have some reason to suppose that he had some sort of influence which he might exert for the purpose of obtaining that for which he was employed? If that observation, made as it is by me, has the good fortune to be attended to by you, look then at the next subject matter in the indictment, and see whether it applies to a very honourable friend of mine who was at the bar, but has lately seceded from it; that gentleman has stated himself to be in a confidential situation in this office under the Duke of Portland. Has the man stated that to be a falsity which is stated upon the record to be a falsity? Had he no influence with Mr. Baldwin? Mr. Baldwin says upon bath he had not; but what one man may consider to be an influence, having been successful in making the application, and what another may suppose is a widely different thing, Mr. Baldwin is a person to whom applications of this sort are regularly made; why then Mr. Baldwin is applied to; it is not a story made up by this man, and no solicitation used upon the occasion, but Mr. Baldwin applied to by the prisoner at the bar, for what? He is applied to by the prisoner, upon a petition presented at the instance of two persons who were in Newgate at that time, charged with an offence against the revenue laws of the country, and that petition was attended to at this presentment, at his solicitation. Why then, Gentlemen, really, when once you have got so far as that, is it not fair to make this observation, that he had a reasonable ground to hope and expect that an application of a similar nature, not exactly similar, because one was a criminal offence, and the other an offence against the smuggling laws, had he not reasonable ground to expect a similar petition would be in a similar manner successful. Then is not that a negative of the second statement upon the record, or might not he reasonably suppose, that an application of a similar nature would be attended with equal success, whether he was right in that supposition or not, is not the question; but if he uses endeavours to do so, I should argue, and I hope you will be of the same opinion, that he had ground to believe that he should succeed; he makes application to Mr. Baldwin, who would represent it to the Duke of Portland; why then we have got as far into the record as his Grace the Duke of Portland, and with respect to Mr. Baldwin.</p>
               <p>Now it was asked by the learned gentleman who conducts this prosecution, and was pressed upon Mr. Baldwin in consequence of a question put by me; my learned friend is counsel for the prosecutor, and I am counsel for the defendant; sorry, I am, that I put questions that the prosecutor takes advantage of; but, gentlemen, that is an assertion that cannot be made against me in the present instance; I asked Mr. Baldwin that which it was my duty to ask him, in order to know whether this man had made any other application than that that I have now stated to you, the smuggling one. Mr. Baldwin states, that he did make another application, but in answer to my learned friend, he says, he forbad him to make any more; and it is meant to be inferred, that this man afterwards must know that any application of that sort must sail, and that therefore he had taken the money, knowing it must fail.</p>
               <p>Now, is that a fair argument to be used against a prisoner standing in the perilous situation in which he stands; there was an application, Mr. Baldwin thinks, in behalf of a man of the name of Hill; certainly it was so, and Mrs. Hill has indicted the defendant for a similar offence, and I suppose that will by and by come before you. Well there, Mr. Baldwin, said he, forbad him to come any more, but when Saunders was in Newgate, does it follow, that because he said he forbad him to come any more, that through any other channel, he might not succeed in getting himself introduced to persons in confidence with his Majesty, who might, with his ministers, consider whether it was a fit case for mercy or not; therefore, I hope that last observation of my learned friend will not have the effect it is intended to have.</p>
               <p>Now, gentlemen, it has been pressed upon you, that this poor person in Newgate, or at least the representative of the poor person in Newgate, has been cheated and defrauded of money by the false representations<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110010"/>that the defendant has made use of upon this occasion. Gentlemen, subject to the correction of the Court hereafter, I will state to you, as far as I have been able to collect from the Crown Lawyers upon the subject, what I apprehend to be the offence that must be made out agreeable to the statement of the offence in this indictment. I will state it from an extremely well-known case to all my learned friends, the case of the King and Young, in Mr. Leech's cases 406, and also in the third Term Reports 98; I will cite it to you from Mr. Leach's cases, which I believe is a pretty faithful report of what is to be found in the Term Reports. Gentlemen, that was a case upon the very statute upon which this indictment is framed, and there, gentlemen, it is stated, that this statute had for its object to further the ends of justice, by making that which was not the subject of a common law offence, an offence within the meaning of the statute, for, previous to the passing of this statute, it was not an offence at common law, there was another statute indeed upon the same subject, made by one of the Henty's, against false tokens, but as this was insufficient, another statute passed upon the subject, and Lord Kenyon, I don't mean to say, that that case was similar to the present, upon the facts of the case, but I cite it more to state to you what was the opinion of the Judges sitting upon cases of fraud. Lord Kenyon says, it seems difficult to draw the line, and say, to what particular cases this statute shall extend; and, therefore, we must see whether each particular case, as it arises, comes within it; therefore, according to this learned Judge's authority, it seems difficult to construe the meaning of this Act of Parliament as applied generally, but you must apply it to each particular case, as each particular case shall arise. Mr. Justice Buller, in giving his judgment upon the same case, says thus: Barely asking another for a sum of money is not sufficient, but some pretence must be used, and that pretence must be false, for the intent is necessary to constitute the crime. Then, Gentlemen, you must find out, as well as you can, upon the statement of this case, what was the intent of the party at the time he was so employed; - You must find out likewise, whether that intent was by false representation, to get into his hands, and possession, by that false representation, the money of the prosecutor; it is essential that it must be false. Is it false, with respect to the observation I made before, that he had influence, some how or other, with the Duke of Portland, that he had influence with Mr. Baldwin, that he had influence with Sir Watkin Lewes? all these things have been proved on the part of the prosecutor: first, that this is the office to which he was to apply; secondly, that Mr. Baldwin is one of the channels to Whom he was to apply; thirdly, is it false with respect to Sir Watkin Lewes? he tells you that he put him into the City of London Militia, in the place of a serjeant, and if he had not had a good opinion of such a man he would not have placed him in that situation; he found that he was too old, and therefore he put him merely as a temporary serjeant. Then there is evidence before you, that Sir Watkin Lewes had some good opinion of this man, or he would not have put him in that situation; but Sir

             it may be said has nothing to do with the government of the Country, or granting of pardons. I expected Sir Watkin Lewes, when my learned friend put that question to him, would answer it as he did, that he has no power nor influence over the granting of pardons; but does it follow, that because Sir Watkin Lewes had no influence or authority, that a man, placed in a confidential situation with a person known and notorious for every thing that we must admire in Sir Watkin Lewes to the public, might not by some application that he might make on the occasion, might he not reasonably suppose that Sir Watkin Lewes would be induced to do that for him, when he had been inclined to do so favourably for him in his regimental capacity; then, if I have made myself understood, he cannot be said to have induced them to part with their money under a false pretence; for if you find that he has made applications where pardons might come through different channels down to the delinquent, if he has done that, there is an end to the intention charged in this indictment; then, Gentlemen, the case will rest upon the other circumstances which have been stated to you by my learned friend.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, Does the defendant come voluntarily into this business? Does he offer himself to the person he is said to have defrauded? On the contrary, you have it in evidence from two of the witnesses for the prosecution (from the character the man had, and from the influence he was supposed to have, and which he indeed had, for he succeeded in it in one instance - he was applied to, because he had succeeded in it, at the desire of the wife of Saunders), Saunders sending to him, and be going in consequence of that solicitation; why then it is not like this case which I might put-if a man, meaning to defraud another of his goods or money, was to come to me and say he could get an official situation for me, because he had an opportunity of getting it, and that he knew he could get it. and he offered to do it voluntarily, and comes to me in the first instance, when in fact he knew at the same time he could not get it. But here, Gentlemen, I wish to impress it upon your minds; it is by the desire of a third person, by the solicitation of the persons themselves; and when he comes to ask for a compensation, they throw in his teeth that he has not succeeded; and that, perhaps, is the gift of this business, that when gentlemen high in office find that pardons may be had by the representations of any body; for that man certainly has made such a representation, as has been stated, to Mr. Baldwin; that Mr. Baldwin believed him, because, with respect to the smugglers, it certainly did succeed. Where then is the intent on the part of this man originally, without solicitation, to do the things alledged to him; by this record it appears that he was employed by the persons who had a right to employ him, and to conside in him because he had succeeded before.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, what I have just been stating to you, seemed to catch the ear and the attention of my learned friend who sits next me; and if he supposes that, for one moment, I, as an advocate for any defendant, in any Court of Justice, can mean by any argument or any observation I could state to a Jury, to cast the least shade of any thing like reflexion upon the honourable Gentlemen that I have seen upon the bench to-day, I hope they will give me credit for saying, I mean no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110011"/>such thing; but no pardon can be obtained but by petition; therefore that they could have it no otherwise than by a petition, which must be drawn by somebody, and which was in this instance drawn by the gentleman at the bar. Gentlemen, it does seem, as I stated in the outset, that this is not only a case of very great importance to the public, otherwise the great and distinguished characters whom we find in this Court now, and the very eloquent and powerful opponent which I have upon the present occasion, would not have been brought down here to address you upon the subject; but it is also of the last importance to the defendant, what verdict you shall hereafter give; for, by the statute upon which this indctment is framed, you will learn that the prisoner at the bar is liable to be transported for the term of seven years. Therefore, gentlemen, bearing that in your minds you will weigh these circumstances, and weight them with great caution before you proceed to give that verdict, which in the end if you believe the witnesses on the part of the prosecution, and that the intent of the prisoner was to defraud, will certainly be the occasion of his being banished from the friends that he has in this country, and from society. Gentlemen, if I have the good fortune to make myself understood, I think that the whole of the offence attributable to the prisoner stands; upon these few observations; and when I have made those few observations, I shall leave him to that justice, and also to that mercy that he will be entitled to at your hands.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I charge, as I said just now, no one person with any abuse of office; but all offices, from the highest to the lowest, at all times, have had abuses creep into them; and perhaps the inferior avenues to that office may be open to the solicitations of persons in the situation of the prisoner. Gentlemen, the prisoner instructs me to say to you, that in the Secretary of State's office there were persons in inferior situations, very inferior indeed, who might make false representations to the prisoner. I think there was a person of the name of Noble; who he is I know not; I think I have read in the papers of a Mr. Noble having been examined; but I believe the situation of Noble was something like that of an inferior servant or groom in the Duke of Portland's family. That person be he whom he might, the prisoner was acquainted with, and also another servant of the Duke of Portland's; what influence they may have I certainly cannot state; but it will be sufficient for me, that the prisoner supposed that, by the influence of the servants of a great man, he would probably meet with success in the application which he fought for. Now it seems from this statement to me, that he made application to Noble; what Noble did upon it I cannot state to you, because he is not here to be examined; but Noble certainly might have been found to be examined upon the subject, and the other person also at the Duke of Portland's house, to have stated what passed upon the subject; but it is quite sufficient for me, if he supposed, from knowing the inferior parts of that great man's family, that he could have such influence by such means, if he did suppose that, he could not have the criminality intended to be attached to him by this indictment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if that observation makes any impression upon your mind, it will be a strong thing in favour of the defendant; because, added to his application to those persons who were likely to be of use to him in his solicitation, his statement of a knowledge of those persons, of one of whom, Mr. Baldwin, he certainly had a complete knowledge; couple them together, and then see, if you can, where is the criminal intent on the part of the defendant, and you must be satisfied, that that criminal intent is to be found, first of all stated upon the record, and afterwards proved as it is stated. Gentlemen, my learned Friend has stated to you, that when he represented that he could get a pardon he must know he could not get it, why we all know it; if you or I were to apply at the Secretary of State's office neither of us could get the pardon; but the question I put to you is this: Could I, by presenting a petition, put it in a situation in which it might be presented to his Majesty? - Has that been done? - It was done in one case, as was stated by Mr. Baldwin. Then was not that a reason why the defendant should hope it might be done in another? - If it was, then the man has used his endeavours to do that which he set out with; and it is not because the pardon was not had that he is guilty of the offence; it is quite sufficient for me that he has used his endeavours to solicit that pardon where it was to be had, and the only way to do that, was by applying to my friend Mr. Baldwin, and then by his representation to the Duke of Portland, and then by his Grace the Duke of Portland to the fountain of mercy in this country. Why then, if that be so, is it not a strong point in favour of the prisoner? Is that any thing like a man coming with the prosessed design to cheat and defraud? Or is it not at the solicitation of somebody else that somebody else connected with the dearest interests of the person he applies for, and then couple it with the means he takes to obtain it, and see where is the false representation stated in this record.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall concluded the observations I have been endeavouring to press upon you as well as I was able. Feeble, I am afraid, my efforts have been; but my wishes for my client have been strong; I hope, therefore, you will not think it necessary for me to apologize for taking up such a portion of your valuable time, when you consider the weakness of the advocate on the one side, and the powerful eloquence of my opponent on the other, with all the ability that the Crown could procure upon the occasion. Gentlemen, I have had disadvantages to struggle with upon this subject; till this morning never did I see the indictment: not that I wish to be understood by any means to cast a shadow of blame upon the prosecutors, whose liberality has furnished me with a copy of it since I came into Court. But my attention was directed to another indictment against the prisoner, and upon which probably hereafter you will have to find your verdict one way or the other. I was really induced to believe that indictment might have come on first; however, I have now seen the indictment that is before you. I have made my observations as well as the time would permit me upon the record. I have stated the law as laid down by the first Judges in this land, I have stated the observations<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110012"/> which I think are forcibly applied in behalf of my client; and having done that, I must submit with cheerfulness, though with considerable confidence, that your verdict will be such as not to intrench upon the valuable interests of the public, but at the same time I hope that if you find it will not intrench upon the dear and valuable rights of the public, it will be such a verdict as will give the defendant his liberty again, and prevent his being banished this country for the term of seven years. Gentlemen. I shall sit down perfectly content with the observations I have made, and perfectly satisfied with the wisdom and the justice of the Jury.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. (To Mr. Baldwin). Q. Are applications of the kind that are said to be made, when presented by individual persons in the family or office of the Duke of Portland, likely to meet with success earlier or later than if they came from another quarter? - A. I never recollect one being presented by any body in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then persons in the family of his Grace have no reason to suppose that petitions coming through their hands will be attended to more speedily? - A. I rather think that petitions coming in that way would not meet with so good a reception as coming from any other person.</p>

I mentioned that I had gone with Mr. Kirby on board the Tender with the smugglers; they had entered into a bond, and Mr. Baldwin took their recognizances, as Mr. Baldwin had expressed that some tricks sometimes are played by those people who have a pardon, by getting themselves arrested, and prevent their going on board of ship. My Lord, I have solicited for three different persons to go to sea; his Majesty's service I had at heart when I was in my younger years, and now I am in my older years. Mr. Kirby happened to be in view, and I said to Mr. Baldwin, there is Mr. Kirby himself; when Mr. Kirby came up, I saluted him; we walked on as far as Mr. Drummond's banking house door; it rained, and I begged the honour to hold the umbrella over Mr. Baldwin's head; he said, Knowles, I wish you would step down to the Treasury-gate, and desire my carriage to come up; I went down to the Treasury-gate, I saw no carriage, I returned, and met Mr. Kirby with the umbrella, when he told me Mr. Baldwin had seen his carriage, and desired him to meet me; we walked to the Adelphi, and I parted with Mr. Kirby.

             sworn. - My Lord, what he has said is a fact, that Mr. Baldwin and I met, and he came up, Mr. Baldwin came up and asked me who he was, and I told him that he had procured a pardon for the smugglers, and who was to have some money from them, and he reprobated his conduct.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. I dare say it is exactly as Mr. Kirby has stated, and that brings to my recollection, that that circumstance was the cause of my suspecting him.</p>
               <p>Summing up.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. The prisoner at the bar stands indicted for a fraud, and the indictment charges in the first place, that a person of the name of 
               <persName id="t17970111-4-person83">
                  John

             was a prisoner under judgment pronounced against him for a felony whereof before that time he had been convicted. Next, that the prisoner represented himself to Ann Keys to have great interest with certain persons, namely, the Duke of Portland, Sir Watkin Lewes, and Mr. Baldwin, and that he could and would procure his Majesty's most gracious pardon to be granted to John Saunders; and that in order to procure that pardon, he must have a certain sum of money entrusted to him, to be paid away by him, one guinea into one channel, and another guinea into another channel, and that no part of it was to go to himself; that she gave to him three guineas at one time, two at another, and one at another.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, the necessary ingredients to constitute a crime of this nature, namely, the obtaining of money under false pretences, under the act of the 30th of his late Majesty, are, that the party shall represent himself in some situation that he is not, or, as it happens in most cases, shall represent that something has happened which has not happened, or is to happen, which he has no reason to expect will happen. The next ingredient is, that he shall have money; and, the third is, that it shall be with an intent to defraud.</p>
               <p>Now I caution you, in the outset in this stage of the business, to refresh your minds; keep them cool, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110013"/>keep out of sight for the present the detestable nature of the offence, if it should be committed; for it is most undoubtedly of the utmost consequence that the avenues to the Royal mercy should be neither obstructed nor corrupted, and by such means to torture the feelings of persons, who suffer much by reason of their relations lives being in jeopardy; and the most valuable and sacred thing of all is, that the public opinion should be perfectly confirmed in the persuasion that the matter of showing Royal mercy is a matter that flows in an easy and in a pure channel; because, otherwise, see what a situation we shall be in: the price that we pay in this country for fixed rules of criminal law, is this, that cases must necessarily arise that one would wish did not fall within the exact and precise rule. If, therefore, we are perpetually to go by an exact and precise rule, many of those cases must be attended with circumstances that one's good sense must regret. What is the remedy? Place the avenues to mercy in such a channel that it becomes easy of access, and the moment there is that easy access which I will describe to you, then all is right; we may afford to have a precise system of criminal law, and yet that inconvenience will not happen, which is the case with every steady and fixed rule, unless there be an obvious and easy remedy. What then is the case here? You know that every subject has a right to petition; it is not a matter of favour, it a matter of right; those petitions go into the office which is appointed for that purpose; there they are fisted, and a sort of primary judgment formed upon them, to make the access more easy, for the Secretary of State himself to represent it to his Majesty; that is the regular, the ordinary, and the common course of the thing. Now, Gentlemen, stripping your minds entirely at present of every other consideration, except the great importance to the public on the one hand, and on the other, the great importance also, that a man should not be improperly convicted, you will attend to the evidence deliberately, reviewing this evidence without any view to consequences; ask yourselves the question, whether these allegations in this indictment are or not proved entirely to your satisfaction? (Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence to the Jury).</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, it has been stated, that this man, having succeeded in the business of the smugglers, might lead him to suppose that he had some influence. You have heard from Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Kirby what passed, and Mr. Baldwin tells you, that was the cause of his suspecting him. The question therefore will be, whether the sort of influence that he spoke of was that kind of influence which merely arises from having handed petitions to the office, or being acquainted with some person who might be ministerial; or whether he was to be the virtual party who was to carry forward the petition, or stop it if he thought proper.</p>
               <p>With respect to the defraud, five guineas were first stated as the necessary expence; three are received; two more are given; afterwards one more is extorted; and, after all, there was to be something left to her own generosity, which answers the observation, that a servant is worthy of his hire; for he represented, that no part of it was to go into his own pocket, and the rest was to be left to her generosity.</p>
               <p>Now, in answer to this charge, you have two witnesses called to you, who tell you they have known him, one of them twenty years, the other twenty-four, and who give him a good character.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you will take the whole into your consideration, and consider those three points that I stated in the outset, whether he represented himself to be in a situation by which he had influence to carry  forward a petition, or to stop it at his pleasure. Secondly, whether the intent was that of defraud; and, Thirdly, whether he did, in fact, receive the money he is so stated to have received. You will likewise take into your consideration the inuendos in the indictment; of the Duke of Portland there can be no doubt that he is the person intended; of Mr. Baldwin, I think there can be but little doubt; and of Sir 
               <persName id="t17970111-4-person84">
                  Watkin

                  </persName>
            , there can be no doubt at all about his being the person intended. If you are of opinion that all these points have been proved, you will find the prisoner guilty; if, however, for any reasons that occur to yourselves, or any that I have stated, you entertain any doubt upon those points, it will be your duty to acquit him.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, the circumstances in which the deceased, met his death are very short. The prisoner, who keeps a house in Greenfield-street, Whitechapel, had a lodger, a young woman of very good character, though moving in a very humble station in life; this young woman was taken much notice of by the deceased, a young man of twenty years of age; he seemed to have a very great attachment to her, and which was likely to have been attended with a marriage, upon his return from a voyage upon which he was about to set out. The deceased frequently met at the house of the prisoner, and having engaged to set off on a voyage the next day, he came to take his leave; and, with a sort of anxiety, which was very natural upon such an occasion; after he had taken his leave he again returned to the house, and, I believe, a third time, finding it irk some to leave a house to which he seemed so much attached; however, about half past ten he came back, in the interim she had gone to bed; he knocked at the window, which was the usual signal for being let in, with the knowledge of the prisoner, he was told that he could not be let in that night<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110014"/>they being gone to bed; but he, perhaps, having been drinking, and a little warm with liquor, continued rapping at the window; finding he could not get in, he went to a public-house in the neighbourhood and ordered some beer to the house, in hopes, by that means, to gain admittance; after some persuasion the beer was let in, but they told him they would not get up to let him in, it being an improper hour; the last time of rapping at the window he broke it; he then went to the door and knocked at that, this knocking at the door was heard by the prisoner, who came down with a poker in his hand, a weapon, one would have supposed, sufficient for any correction he might think proper to give him; however, the prisoner went out to fetch a watchman, or some other assistance, I cannot say what; however, it will appear, that he went to the house of a patrol, who was not at home, and there met with a woman of the name of Godfrey, and, instead of asking for the man, he asked her to lend him a pistol, and to induce her to do it he told her there was a person at his house that was troublesome, and, says he, I want to frighten him; the woman, apprehending no mischief, was prevailed upon to lend him a pistol belonging to one of the officers of the Police; when he got possession of the pistol, he loaded it with powder and ball, and he then returned to his house, he did not find the deceased in his house, but in the highway; he told him, if he did not go about his business, he would blow his brains out; he, with that sort of levity which was very natural to a young man in a state of intoxication, or perhaps not believing him to be in earnest, replied, blow away, and bed - d; without more ado, he took him at his word, raised his hand, fired the pistol, and the deceased fell, he died, I believe, in a few minutes, but what is very extraordinary, the prisoner, instead of affording any assistance, retired into his own house, and shut himself up till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I shall abstain from all observations upon the law of this case, because it will come much better from an authority, which will be much more satisfactory, and much better applied to the facts than any statement of mine. Gentlemen, it is in fairness upon this occasion where the investigation of truth is the only object to be obtained, that all those who have already given any information should be called, that those whose duty it is to defend the prisoner (and here he will be very ably defended) may have an opportunity of examining them; I shall therefore call them, but you will find, in the course of their testimony, first, that this man was in no doubt who the person was that he so fired at, that he was not only sufficiently acquainted with him to permit him to come to the house, but seeing him so much attached to this young woman, and he being a man in the habits of life, in which he was not perhaps accustomed to the indulgences of life as we on shore are, frequently obtained permission of him to remain in the house all night, that when he went out, instead of evincing any intention of getting assistance, he went to this house, where he procured the pistol, and afterwards himself, coolly and deliberately loaded that pistol. Gentlemen, there is another circumstance which seems to me to bespeak a least at want of feeling that is beyond all pardon, that, when he had shot this young man, after the only provocation that I have stated to you, he left him in a dying state, without offering him the least assistance. Gentlemen, I shall abstain from any further observations; the humanity of the learned Judge will point out to you every thing that may arise in behalf of the prisoner, and you will have the law laid down if any thing shall arise distinguishable in this case, to enable you to pass a verdict properly, according to your oaths, and, at the same time, with mercy to the prisoner.</p>

             the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he? - A. He was a young man that used to visit me; he was at our house about half after six o'clock that night, he staid about ten minutes or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cunningham see him? - A. Yes; he stood at the window at that time with a child in his arms, he returned again about nine o'clock, he did not come in then; he tapped at the window, and I went up stairs to him; he said, Nancy, I want to speak very particularly to you; I said, what do you want, we are going to bed; said he, you must come over with me to the Prince of Orange, and have something to drink, and I said it was rather too late, and I would not go, but he laid hold of my hand, and he would make me go; he called for a pint of two-penny, we had it at the door, we staid about ten minutes, and then I returned; there was another young fellow came by, and said, Henry, are you there, how do you do? and I told him I must go home to bed, and I left him directly with that young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or hear any thing afterwards of him? - A. He sent the boy from the White-hart with a pot of beer to the window, that was about twenty minutes afterwards, I was in bed then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body sleep with you? - A. Yes, Mrs. Evans and Mrs. Cooper, they were both in bed at the same time; when the beer came, the boy called, are you in bed? I said, yes, he said, here is a pot of beer that the young man has sent for you; I told him, we were all in bed, and would not take it in; the boy carried it back, and then they both came back together, the deceased and the boy; Mrs. Evans then got out of bed and spoke to the deceased; says Wood, Mrs. Evans, take the beer for I cannot drink it myself, and I have paid for it, it is a pity it should be wasted; Mrs. Evans went up stairs and took the beer in, he said, he wanted to speak to Nancy very particularly, I heard him say this; Mrs. Evans said, Nancy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110015"/>is in bed, she cannot come up at this time of night, and then he tapped at the window, and Mrs. Evans answered him, to go about his business; she said, it was rather too late to disturb the persons in the house; he tapped at the window again, with a stick that he had in his hand, which he put through the iron rails, and broke one of the panes of glass of the window; Cunningham got out of bed, and spoke to him through the window, telling him to go about his business; he returned again, in a few minutes, and began to tap at the window, and Cunningham went out to the door with a poker in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed or undressed? - A. I did not see him, but suppose he was undressed; I heard his wife say something about a poker, and he went to the door, and told him to go along about his business, or he would charge the watch with him, and then Cunningham returned in again, and he dressed himself, and he went out again to the door, and I heard him say to the deceased, I am going to charge the watch, or something of that kind; and the deceased called three or four times, as he was going along, he says, Cunningham, Cunningham, I say, come here, Cunningham, come here, but he would not answer; and Cunningham returned in the course of ten minutes, as far as I can guess, and the first word he said, was, stand away, or I will blow your brains out, I heard him say that out in the street, and the deceased made him an answer, blow away, and I heard the report of the pistol immediately; Mrs. Cooper and I went up stairs immediately, and I met Cunningham in the passage, he had then returned into the house and shut the door; I said, Mr. Cunningham, did you kill him, says I; say he, I don't know, and if I did, it is his own fault.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This certainly was a very unseasonable time, when the deceased came to the house, you were accustomed to go to bed early? - A. Yes; about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was told repeatedly that he could not see you, that you were in bed? - A. He was told so by Mrs. Evans.</p>
               <p>Q. He kept continually tapping at the window, and made a great noise? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not he knock at the door? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know - recollect - did not he make a great noise at the door? - A. I did not hear any knocking at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't suffer any feelings that you may have for the young man that is gone, to prevent your telling the whole truth? - A. No; I did not hear him knock at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Cunningham told him through the window, if he did not go away, he must charge the watch with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he still continued making this noise? - A. Yes; he told him he would charge him with the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. And afterwards, this man continuing to make a noise, he got up and went out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned, I wish you to be correct, because there were other persons in the house who heard it, did not you hear him repeatedly call, stand off, stand off, before he fired, repeatedly? - A. No, he did not; says he, stand off, or I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he repeatedly say, stand off, stand off? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Cooper and Mrs. Evans were equally within hearing with yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a Mr. and Mrs Ramsay lived in the house? - A. Yes, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When the man came in, did not he call out,"Come down, Mr. Ramsay, for I am afraid I have killed the man?" - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as ever he came in, he made up to Mr. Ramsay's apartments, and said, come down, Mr. Ramsay, for I am afraid I have killed the man? - A. Yes; he said, Mr. Ramsay, come down, for I believe I have killed the man; I met him coming down from Mr. Ramsay's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear at any former meetings any enmity between this man and the deceased? - A. Not that I perceived.</p>
               <p>Q. There could be no cause of quarrel between them till he chided him for making a noise? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you hear any knocking at the door at all? - A. After Cunningham went out he knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. In an ordinary way? - A. No; he knocked at the door once or twice after Cunningham went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he gave one or two strokes at the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect exactly what the words were before the report of the pistol? - A. The words were, stand off, or I will blow your brains out.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I live right opposite the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the 12th of December, any thing happening at his house, or near it? - A. I was at the front window opposite the house about twenty minutes before eleven; I heard a noise, and I went to the window to see what was the matter; I saw the deceased knocking at the prisoner's door; he wanted very much to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he knocking very outrageously? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Merely as a person desiring to be admitted? - A. Yes; he was very much in liquor; he had a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110016"/>violent fall; he recovered his fall, and the prisoner then came out in his shirt, and told him to go away, for it was a late hour, and he should not let him in; the prisoner went in and shut the door, and the deceased continued standing outside the door, and wanted very much to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the situation of the window that the last witness has been speaking of? - A. Yes; the window is close to the door; the prisoner then came out dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he in the mean time, before the prisoner came out again, done any thing, or made any considerable noise? - A. No, he had not; he had only stood at the door; the prisoner came out dressed, and passed the deceased; he said something to him, but I did not hear what he said; he was gone about the space of ten minutes, as nigh as I can recollect; he came back with something in his right hand, held up in this manner (describing it); I thought he had got something of a club stick in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. At that instant, how was the deceased employed? - A. He was standing right up at his door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he doing any thing? - A. Nothing at all, only standing in the street close to his door; the prisoner came round the corner from the house into the middle of the street, and pointed something, I did not know what it was, and said something to the deceased, but I did not hear what it was; the deceased crossed over from the prisoner's door, and made up to him, not knowing, as I suppose, the danger he was in; the deceased went up to the prisoner, and the prisoner rather backed and pointed something at him; the deceased was then in the middle of the road, as near as I can recollect, opposite my window; I never went from the window; the prisoner then fired the pistol at the deceased, and he dropped instantly in the middle of the road, opposite my window; the prisoner crossed over and knocked at his own door a double knock.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was he from his own door when he fired this pistol? - A. Some yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What distance was he from the deceased when he fired this pistol? - A. A yard and an half as nigh as I can guess; the door was opened, and he was let in instantly, and the door shut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You live directly opposite to this house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your attention was directed to this business, in consequence of the repeated enquiries this man was making, and the noise he was making at the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe no watchman was by at that time? - A. No watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a watchman belonging to that beat? - A. Yes; but no watchman was by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear from within the house the prisoner Cunningham make use of any such expression as this, desiring him to be gone from the door? - A. Yes; in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that expression accompanied with this further expression, namely, that he would go for a watchman? - A. No; I did not hear any thing of that kind pass.</p>
               <p>Q. You supposed he was gone for a watchman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where he went you don't know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came back, he was at a considerable distance from the deceased when he turned the corner? - A. Yes; he kept the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was by the deceased making up to him that he got nearer to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me the prisoner was quite on the other side of the road, the deceased was at his door? - A. The prisoner was rather on my side, about the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the distance from where the prisoner stood to his own door? - A. About four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was by the deceased's own act that he got so near to the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time when he was making up to the prisoner, as you state it, did not you hear this expression, stand off, stand off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that repeated? - A. Yes; it was the prisoner was making back, and he repeatedly said, stand off, stand off, and then he fired.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner went into the house, and the conversation that passed in the house you know nothing about? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the prisoner's general character in the neighbourhood? - A. I always looked upon him to be a very sober, decent man; I do not know a great deal of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. If I understand your account rightly, it is, that the prisoner at the time was at a distance from the deceased, and the deceased made up to him; could you distinctly see the manner in which the deceased made up to him? - A. Yes; he was so much in liquor that I was afraid he would fall down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he use any gesture, or any threatening expression? - A. No; I did not hear any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing threatening or terrifying in the posture or gesture of the deceased? - A. Nothing at all of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. He was very much in liquor? - A. Yes, so much so, that I was afraid he would fall as he made up to him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am servant to the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the room with your mistress on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110017"/>the 12th of December last? - A. Yes; I was looking through the window; the window was down, and the Venetian blinds were down.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinctly see all that passed? - A. Yes; my mistress gave the first alarm; upon hearing the noise of a man very much in liquor, I looked out, and saw the deceased knocking at the door; soon after that the prisoner came out in his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him at the time? - A. No, I did not see any thing that he had; the prisoner said something to the deceased which I did not hear; when the prisoner found that the deceased would not go away, he went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shut the door after him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the deceased then? - A. He still kept at the door, and knocked several times, and tried at the latch, and the prisoner came out afterwards, dressed, and said something to the deceased that I cannot tell; he went across the way round the corner, as we thought, to get a watchman; the deceased still kept outside of the door of the prisoner's house; in four or five minutes he returned; he came along the road; he had something in his hand, I could not tell what it was; he came along the side of the way opposite his house; the deceased was then still standing at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he doing any thing? - A. No; and when the deceased saw the prisoner come, he made up to him.</p>
               <p>A. In what way did he make up to him? - A. He walked up to him; as the prisoner was in the road, he told the deceased to keep off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you hear all that was said? - A. No; I cannot tell all that was said.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the same room with Mrs. Daniel? - A. Yes; then, as the deceased was going up to him, he let the pistol off.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did he hold it? - A. He held it very exact to the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. But, before that, how did he hold it? - A. He held it down in his hand till then.</p>

               <p>Q. When he fired it off, what became of the deceased, and what became of the prisoner? - A. The deceased fell down immediately, first upon his bottom, and then he rolled round on his face; the prisoner knocked two or three times at his own door, and he was let in, and the door was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how far they stood from one another when the pistol went off? - A. A couple of yards, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so far off that one could not have reached the other with his hand? - A. Not cleverly, I think, so far as I could judge.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a moon-light night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he at any time been nearer to him than when he shot him, after he returned with the pistol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he went to his own house; do you mean that he went immediately, or that he turned round and spoke to him? - A. No, he went immediately home; he was at that time nearer to our side of the way than his own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I think you say, that before the prisoner came out of his own house, this man had been knocking at the door, and lifting up the latch, before the prisoner came down dressed? - A. He had been knocking at the door, but not lifting up the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the pistol went off as the deceased was coming nearer the prisoner? - A. Yes, he was backing.</p>
               <p>Q. When a man has a pistol in his hand, and is going back, it is the most likely time for a pistol to go off by accident, as he is going backwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear what passed in his house afterwards? - A. No, I did not go into his house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you saw the deceased making up to the prisoner, did you see him very distinctly? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then describe the manner of his coming up to him? - A. He was very tipsy, and he reeled.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Cunningham? - A. Yes; I never saw him but three times in my life before he came that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come to you? - A. About ten minutes before ten; he knocked at the door; I was very ill in bed, and a little child opened the door, and he asked for Mr. Coombes; I called to the child, and said, what is Mr. Cunningham's business? and then he came up to my room door, and said, he had been running up and down the street a great while to find a patrol or a watchman, but there was none to be had; he said, he was afraid he had got some thieves breaking into his house, and had had for these three nights, and he was so disturbed, that he could not sleep in his bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure of what you say that you recollect it? - A. Yes, perfectly sure; and he was afraid, when he got home, whether he should not find his wife and children killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was what he said? - A. Yes; and his lodgers were very much disturbed; then he asked me if I would lend him one of Mr. Coombes's pistols, which hung over the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110018"/>Q. Did he know that the pistols hung over the mantle-piece? - A. Yes; he had been mending a bedstead just before, and had seen them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bedstead he had been mending in the same room? - A. Yes; the bedstead that I was then upon; I rather hesitated, but, however, he took it down, and he asked me if it was loaded; I told him, no; he said, had not I got a little powder in the house; I said, I did not know whether Mr. Coombes had got any; Mr. Coombes said afterwards, that there was powder and two balls in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he got them from your own knowledge? - A. No; he said that would do to frighten them, if there was no powder.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been very ill, I understand; recollect yourself again as to the account he gave you why he wanted the pistols? - A. He gave me the account I have told you.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. I live at the prisoner's house; the deceased came on the 12th of December a little after ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him, did not you? - A. I have seen him, he was a tall, stout man; a little after ten o'clock, I heard him knock over the grating, and call Nance, once or twice, some of them answered, and he went away, and then a boy came over with a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know all this yourself? - A. I heard it all; they told him, the beer was not for them, for they were all in bed; and then the deceased and the boy returned together, the deceased told them the beer was paid for, and if they would take it in, he would go away about his business; Mrs. Evans went up and took the beer in, and told him to go along; he swore he would not go away, but would come into the house, and she shut the door and came in, and then he jumped upon the grating, and swore he would come in, with very bitter oaths to the girl to make her come up, and she said, she was in bed, he stamped and swore a great while, and then I heard Mr. Cunningham's shutter open, I cannot tell who opened it, but I heard Mr. Cunningham say something to the deceased, and Wood swore at him very much; I heard the sash shut down again; I did not hear any more, till I heard the glass rattle, and the windows broke, but I could not tell how many till next day, and then Mr. Cunningham came to the door, and asked him if he wanted to rob the house, if he did not go away about his business, he would charge the watch with him; upon which the deceased swore very much at him, and told him, if he would come out, he would lick him like a dog, and then I heard a scuffle between them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sort of a scuffle? - A. I heard the door bang very much against the wall, both of them against it, upon which my wife wanted me to go down stairs; I told her, no, if Mr. Cunningham would harbour such lodgers, he might undergo the trouble of them, and I would not go down; then I heard Mr. Cunningham shut the door, and immediately that the door was shut, the deceased knocked more violently than he did before, and by and by I heard Mr. Cunningham dressing himself, as I thought, I heard him moving about, he went out and shut the door after him, he said something to the deceased as he passed by him, but I cannot tell what it was; the deceased said something about a shilling, but I could not hear what it was; as soon as Mr. Cunningham was gone, the deceased tried very much to force the door open to get in, and shook the whole house for about ten minutes in trying to force his way; when Mr. Cunningham returned, I heard the deceased trying to force the door open; I heard Mr. Cunningham say, by God, if you do enter my house, I will blow your brains out, to which the deceased made answer, blow away and be d-d; upon which Mr. Cunningham told him, he certainly would, if he did not keep off; the deceased still kept swearing at him, and telling him to blow away and be d-d; the prisoner still kept telling him to keep off, a great many times, and every time the deceased answered him in the same way, and I was just then gone to bed, and I heard him say again, keep off, keep off, very sharp.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were they at this time? - A. I did not get out of bed till just as the pistol went off, and then the deceased was lying in the middle of the road, raising himself up.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw that very distinctly? - A. Yes; and I saw Cunningham, as I thought it was him, there was nobody else about, come from the other side, where the deceased was, over to his own door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who let Mr. Cunningham in? - A. I cannot tell, he came up to me immediately as he was let in, and I opened the door; he said, for God's sake, Ramsay, come down, for I am afraid I have killed him, and threw the pistol down in the chair; when I got down to the door, I heard the people say he was a dead man, but they said they did not know the cause of his death, any more than they heard the report of the pistol, but they could see no blood.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner came back, some time must have elapsed after he had returned with the pistol, and before he fired it, for all this conversation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110020"/> to have passed? - A. Yes, four or five minutes at least.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore that, of course, must have been heard by any body who was attending at the time? - A. Yes; it was loud enough for any body to have heard it; it was loud enough for a watchman at the end of the street to have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. All this you heard yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And what Mr. Cunningham said to him when he went out you did not hear? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The knocking then, that you describe after Mr. Cunningham went out, was so violent that all the neighbourhood must have heard it? - A. Yes; the hammering was so violent that it shook the whole house, and my wife was afraid he had forced the spring lock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You have lived some time with this man? - A. Two years next April.</p>
               <p>Q. From the observation you have made upon his character, did he appear to be a good natured, easy man, or otherwise? - A. Always; I never saw any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do they usually go to bed? - A. Between nine and ten; they themselves used to go to bed between eight and nine sometimes; we were very often very much disturbed by this man coming after the girl.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I was frequently called up in the night by the lodgers, of thieves breaking into the house; I fetched the pistol to desend my life, and my property, little thinking that the deceased would rush upon me blaspheming in the manner that he did, which was the cause of the pistol going off unknown to me.</p>

The first time I saw him was about half past six o'clock, I was going towards Whitechapel, he was coming towards our house; he said he was going to see Nance, and I told him she was there alone; I was not gone above a quarter of an hour, and when I came back he was gone; about nine o'clock in the evening he came again, and tapped at the window, we were eating our suppers, and Nancy Hughes went up to speak to him, she staid with him about a quarter of an hour, and when she came back we asked the reason of her coming back so soon, and she said, she did not like to stay longer with him, she was afraid of him, and then we eat our suppers and went to bed; then, about ten o'clock, we heard a boy come to the window, and cry, holloa, there was some beer for us; I asked him who sent the beer; and he said, the young man over the way; I told him to take it back again, that we did not want it, for we were all in bed; then I went to bed again; in a few minutes after, the deceased, and the lad with the beer, came back again, and I went to the window and told him we were all in bed; and he said, we might as well have the beer, for it was all paid for, and it was a pity to throw it away, and if I would take it in, he would go away directly; I then put my things on, and went up stairs and opened the door, he put the beer into my hand, and pushed against the door, and wanted to come in; then I told him he should not come in, it was too late; and I told him, you know what a piece of work we have had on account of your disorderly hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he then before come at disorderly hours? - A. Yes, at very disorderly hours; and was very troublesome indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your refusing him to come in what passed? - A. He said he had no place to go to, he must come in; I said, no place to go to, why where is your lodgings; and he said nothing; I told him he should not come in, and I pushed the door against him, and shut it; he said he wanted to see Nance; I told him Nancy was just come from him, and he should not see Nancy at this time of night; then I went down stairs and went to bed; and then he came directly to the window making a great noise, cursing and swearing, and blasting; and he said, Nance had as much right to let any person into the house as I had, for she paid for it, and if she could not he would; he was there thumping and stamping at our window with his foot upon the grating.</p>
               <p>Q. You live in the kitchen below? - A. Yes; and I went to him again, and said, how can you be so, why don't you go home; and he cursed and swore, and used very improper language for me to tell here; and I told him, if he would not go I would charge the watchman with him; we were all afraid of him, making such a noise; there were

               <p>Q. Did he speak to him then civilly? - A. Yes; then Mr. Cunningham came in and dressed himself, I suppose, I did not see him, and went out again in a few minutes; and while he was gone, he continued making the same noise all the time, stamping upon our windows, and making a noise; when Mr. Cunningham went out he said nothing to him, but the deceased holloaed after him pay me the shilling you owe me.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I lived with Mrs. Evans at the time of the accident, in the house of Mr. Cunningham.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the deceased? - A. Yes; I knew something of him, very little.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to the house on the 12th of December? - A. Yes; I and Mrs. Evans met him first, in Fieldgate-street, about half past six; he asked us where we were going, and we said, we were going to market; he then asked where Nance was, that was the young woman, Aun Hughes, we told him she was at home; he then went towards our house, and we returned home again in less than a quarter of an hour, the deceased was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him after? - A. I did not see him again till about nine o'clock, he came and knocked over the grating with his foot, the young woman then went up stairs to him, she stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110022"/> with him about a quarter of an hour, and returned back again; Mrs. Evans then asked why she returned so soon; and she said she was afraid to stay any longer with the young man, the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any reason why she was afraid? - A. She thought he was very much intoxicated; we then eat our suppers and all three of us went to bed; after we had been in bed some time, a boy came and tapped at the grating over the kitchen window, the boy called out, is nobody here; and Mrs. Evans, or me, I don't know which, said, who is there; and he said, there was a pot of beer; we asked him who sent him; he said, the young man; we told him we were all in bed, and did not want any beer; he went away, and returned again in a few minutes with him; the deceased then called very loud, he said, holloa, are you all in bed, come up and take the beer; Mrs. Evans then got up, and went to the window, and told him we were all in bed, and did not want beer at that time of night; and he told Mrs. Evans, if she would come up and take in the beer he would go quietly, for it was paid for, and it was a pity to waste it, he still kept repeating and calling Nance; Mrs. Evans then went up to the street-door and took the beer in; when she came down, she said he wanted very much to come in; he then went to the grating of the kitchen window, and made a great noise, calling Ann Hughes to come up.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a noise did he make? - A. With his feet upon the grating; then Mrs. Evans got up again, and told him, if he did not go along she would charge the watch with him; I then heard something at the parlour shutters; Mr. Cunningham lives in the parlour; I then, about a minute after, heard Mr. Cunningham speaking to him; he desired him to go home quietly, for it was a very late hour of the night to come there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do that in a temperate manner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was mildly said? - A. Yes; he told him he would not go home, and told him to come out and he would fight him like a dog as he was; then Mr. Cunningham went in and shut the window; he still kept making this noise over the grating, and Mr. Cunningham came to the door and told him, that if he did not go along quietly, he certainly would charge the watch with him; he then took hold of the knocker at the door, and rapped several times very violently; then Mr. Cunningdam got up and dressed himself, as I have been told.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular that you heard at the window? - A. It was as if it was the bolt of Cunningham's window; then Mr. Cunningham went out at the street-door; the deceased was then stamping at the grating, and knocking at the door by turns; Cunningham, when he went out, told him again that he would charge the watch with him; then he went, as I suppose, for a watchman, and returned between ten minutes and a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that Cunningham was gone, what was the deceased doing? - A. He shoved his back against it, as if he was trying to force the door open; he abused the house very much, and told the girl to come out, if she could not pay the rent he would; when Mr. Cunningham returned, I heard him say, stand off, if you attempt to break into my house, I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that Cunningham made use of that expression, what was he doing? - A. There was a scuffle; I thought the watchman was dragging him away; it was like two men trying to get away one from the other; Mr. Cunningham told him if he did not stand off he would blow his brains out; the deceased told him to blow away and be d-d; then Cunningham said, I will, by God, and then I heard the pistol go off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come into the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have lived some little time at this house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner, during the time you lived there, a peaceable, quiet man? - A. A very quiet, inoffensive man, as ever I heard of.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was the house usually shut up? - A. It was always shut up at ten o'clock at night; he used to go to rest between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the prisoner? - A. He is a carpenter and cabinet-maker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Did you hear all this perfectly? - A. Yes, perfectly; I got out of bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you heard all that Mrs. Evans heard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The conversation you have stated, did that take place close to the door? - A. Yes; I think it did, by what I could hear, I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Even the last word, just at the instant that the pistol went off, when he said, stand off, was close by the door? - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. They were so situated, that you must have known it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Wherever this took place, there the pistol went off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not examined before the Justice or the Coroner? - A. I attended two days.</p>
               <p>Q. This poor young fellow was very much intoxicated? - A. Yes; he tumbled down two or three times outside the door while he was walking backwards and forwards; when first he began to make the noise, when I saw him first in the evening, he was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110023"/>Court. Q. Was the fall upon the flag stones by the door? - A. Yes, between the kennel and the grating of the window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Mrs. Evans threatened to charge him with the watch, and Mr. Cunningham too? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was loud enough for any body to hear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Though you were not examined before the Justice or the Coroner, you attended in order to be examined, if they thought proper to examine you? - A. Yes.</p>

The deceased came a little after ten o'clock, the first time that I noticed it, and he knocked very much at the kitchen window and the door; we lodge in the front room up one pair of stairs; Mr. Cunningham got up and desired him to go, and he would not go.</p>

               <p>Q. She is here, is not she? - A. No; I came down and found the door that goes into the garden open, and that the till was forced open with some irons that had been taken from the fire; then I looked about the house and missed a tea caddie, with a pound of 8s. green tea, that had been put in the same morning; after that, I went into the back room, and looked in the beaufet, and found five china bowls gone, they had left the matches burning underneath, in the bottom of the cupboard; I then went into the front room, and missed some glass tumblers, I cannot tell how many, I suppose there were five or six gone off the side-board; I then immediately went into the garden to see if I could find the till, supposing it might might be thrown away; I did not find the till, but I found the lock of it, which I have in my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it to be the lock of the till? - A. I locked it up myself every night; one of the witnesses went down a field adjoining the garden, and found five china bowls, and four rummers, and then I received a note from Mr. Patrick, that there was a suspicious man in his house, selling good half-pence, fourteen-pence for a shilling, and I got a warrant, and went to Mr. Patrick's, and had him apprehended, Mr. Patrick keeps the White-hart public-house, in the same parish; the prisoner asked the officer's name, his name is Tatham, and said, he wished to speak with him in another room; we then went into the room with him, and he put his hand in his pocket, and said, I am the person that robbed you, and this is your property; he produced 8s. 11 1/2d. in copper, and a bad shilling and sixpence; in going to the Magistrate's, I asked him what he had done with the till, and the tea caddie, he said, he had concealed it in a ditch, at the back of Mr. Scales's sand-house, some persons then went and found it there; I then asked him, if he had any confederates, and he said he had one, that he let in at half past eleven o'clock, whose name and person he knew very well, but would not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe how he let him in, or where? - A. At the back door in the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen this back door last? - A. I saw it bolted at eleven o'clock, when I went up to bed; there were two strong bolts and no lock to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that these bolts were shut? - A. I bolted them myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of those china bowls? - A. Thirty shillings, the large one cost me 17s. and the small ones I don't know what they cost, they were in the house when I came to the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you talk about what you were going to do before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not ask him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to Milton and Green? - A. Not that I heard; he cut the window, and broke the glass, and took the things out of the window: two shawls, and two pieces of lace, a white piece and a black piece, some ribbon, some black shoe-strings, and a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you and your companions do while he was so employed? - A. We stood over the way; and young Green brought me some pieces of ribbon which he had taken from the same shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Milton do? - A. I did not see him do any thing, he was standing the other side of the way, and walking backwards and forward; Waring told him to watch, and if any body was coming by, to whistle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Milton go to the place where he was told, and walk backwards and forwards? - A. Yes; and some persons went by, and Milton whistled, and then he came away from the window; a man saw the window, I believe, and then he ran away. Waring and the sweep ran over to me, and told me to take the things home to Waring's mother; I took the shawls from the window from Waring, I carried them to Waring's mother, while they went down Brick-lane; they told me to come and meet them, and I did, I left them at Mrs. Waring's; I put them upon a bit of a counter that is there, and Mrs. Waring saw me; I told her Jem took them out of a window; she looked at them, and put them upon a little shelf, and covered them with a little bit of cloth, and then we all went to the mother's, and she cut the ribbon in pieces, I had two yards and a half, Milton had two yards and a half, and Waring had two yards and a half, and the shoe-strings were given to the mother, and Green had the same, two yards and a half; the shawls the mother bought of us, the gave eighteen-pence for the dark shawl, and nine-pence-halfpenny for the other; we all had the money divided among us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Honesty, you know that by giving evidence here, you are come to save yourself from being tried? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in a Court of Justice before? - A. I have never been in confinement before in my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110028"/>Q. When did you tell this story for the first time; was it before the 
Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. You never told the story till after you were taken up for the felony? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Peach). Q. Did I understand you right, when I supposed you to say, that when, after you had been at Mrs. Waring's, and found the shawl, you did not take her into custody? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. And then she herself came to the office, and then she was taken up? - A. Yes; she came to her son, and then she was detained.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Ivy. There is no mark upon these shawls, but they answer the pattern exactly; the white lace and the shoe bows answer the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand you to say, there is not one article but what you know, merely by bearing a similitude to what you lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But you don't mean to swear to their being your's, but from the pattern? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The shawls are a very common pattern? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other things are common patterns? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep a shop there? - A. I did then, a milliner's and haberdasher's; when I returned I went into the shop, and put my cloak off, and threw it carelessly in the window; I had altered the cloak two or three days before; it was made of black silk; there were two buttons and loops behind, with a small hood, and a piece of blue ribbon tacked behind to tie it; I threw it down carelessly, and went into a room beyond the shop to tea; the room don't join to the shop; it is a good way behind the shop; about half an hour after, I came into the shop to serve a customer; I found my cloak and every thing safe; then I went and finished my tea; I came in again a little after six, or between six and seven, meaning to fold my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110029"/>cloak up and put it away; I found the cloak gone and the window broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the manner of breaking the window? - A. It was the bottom pane, and it was at the corner of the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the size of the hole? - A. A very small part was broke; I don't believe there was room for a person to put his arm through; I missed a piece of muslin that lay by the glass, and a child's cap, that was all I missed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see them again? - A. That was on Monday the 5th of December; the officer of the Police-office, Worship-street, came to me the Wednesday week after, that was nine or ten days, and I saw the cloak, but the muslin I cannot swear to.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrol of St. George's, Hanover-square: On the 8th of December, my partner and I were on duty, a little after six o'clock in the morning; coming up Berkley-square, we heard some glass rattle, we took it to be a lamp broke; the prisoner met us in the middle of the horse-road; the prisoner met us in the middle of the horse-road; we asked him if he saw any thing of a lamp broke, he said, no; we asked him if he heard any alarm of glass, he said, it was an empty bottle he threw out of his pocket, with that he passed us, and we took no farther notice; when he got a little way from us, we heard the same found of glass, we imagined it could not be all empty bottles, we followed him, and took hold of him, and this bottle was concealed under his great coat, it had some gin in it at that time, in the struggle the gin was all spilt; he said, he was going on guard that morning, he struggled to get from us, we took him to the watch-house, we found a bottle of gin and a bottle of rum upon him, and a bottle of brandy was picked up by a watchman, and brought to the watch-house; there was a quart pewter pot, with the prosecutor's name on it, and a piece of old canvas found upon him; my partner had the bottle of rum and gin in his possession, I had the quart pot and brandy.</p>

               <p>Q. All you mean to say is, you have not been told he was a thief lately? - A. I never heard any thing that was an impeachment of his honesty.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Pring; I saw captain Waring's saddle on the Saturday that it was taken out on the Sunday, it was upon the wooden horse in the stable, it had stirrups, stirrup leathers, and girths to it, and a saddle-cloth, that was Saturday the 17th of December, I missed it on the Sunday, the next day; I was coming home promiscuously to dinner, between one and two o'clock, and met this man with a saddle upon his back; I called to him, and asked him where he was going with that saddle; he replied, to captain Waring's; I asked him what business he had with that saddle, he being rather confused said, he was going to get two shillings upon it, to pay a person that he owed seven shillings to, and he had but five shillings, and he wanted to make two shillings of this saddle to make it up; upon which I requested the saddle back again, and he readily delivered it into my hands, begging that I would not say any thing to my master concerning it; I replied, I could not forbear telling my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this man before? - A. He lived fellow-servant with me eight months in the same yard, and was discharged that morning; I act as head ostler.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear positively to this saddle? - A. Yes; I am sure it was captain Waring's, I had it always under my care; it was there between three and four months, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any particular marks about it? - A. No further than in the common way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his name upon it? - A. No; there is the sadler's name upon it; and I will swear that to be his saddle.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the value of this saddle; do you think it is worth thirty-nine shillings? - A. To the best of my knowledge it is.</p>
               <p>Q. The leathers are valued at two shillings, the stirrups at two shillings, and the girths at two shillings; do you think they all worth six shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your master liable to make good the saddles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110034"/>left by gentlemen? - A. Yes; he has suffered a great deal upon the same occasion before.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Pring.) Do you make yourself liable for saddles and their furniture? - A. Yes; I have been liable for a great many, and for this.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Holland.) What did you do with the saddle? - A. I have it here; it has been in my care ever since. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Sunday morning I was discharged, and I went up to pay one of the men four shillings that I owed him, and I met a gentleman that rode the horse several times while it was at Mr. Pring's, and he asked me if captain Waring's horse was sold; I told him that it was; he asked if the saddle and bridle were there, and I said, yes; and he asked if any man would take the saddle to Bartholomew-close for him, and he would give him half-a-crown; I said I would; and I met the ostler, and he desired me to take it back.</p>

On the 15th of December last, I was coming down Chiswell-street, a very small distance from my yard, I saw the prisoner with a mahogany board; I asked him where he was going with it; he told me he was going to the round-house, a public-house in the City-road, I suspected him, and stopped him; I told him he must go back with me, the property was mine; he told me he was employed to take it by some person, he could not tell who; he said that person was to meet him at the round-house; I went with him to the round-house, and waited half-an-hour, but no person came; we then came back, and I shewed him that the property was mine, because I have more of the same boards cut out of the same log.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you so sure, from that circumstance, that you can venture to swear positively to it? - A. I can; as he could give me no account of the person that he said ordered him to take it, I apprehended him.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been drinking at all before you went to the Opera? - A. Hardly any thing; my friend and I had drank a bottle of wine after dinner, and no more; that was a long while before the Opera.</p>

             sworn. - I am a foreigner; I came from Flanders; I dined with Mabbely, and we drank a bottle of wine, and went to the Opera-house after we spent the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the beginning of the Opera? - A. Yes; when we came out, we met with the prisoner and another woman in the same dress, and they asked us to go home with them to Mrs. Brown's in Whitcomb-street; we did not mean to stop with them, but only drink a little together, and talk with them; my friend fancied this woman, and they were talking together, and the other woman attempted to rob me; my friend told me he was robbed in French, and then I saw this woman wanted to run away; she went out about half a minute, and I said, stop, come in; she came in, and directly my friend said, you have robbed me of three guineas and a half; she began to swear she had not, and she pulled off her shoes and shook her cloaths, and I saw it in her mouth, and directly as I said so, she tried to swallow up the money, and she became directly very black, and I put my hand to her throat to stop it, and she spit out a guinea, and then she would not own it; then we could not get the other guineas, because they were gone, and then we called the watchman; as we came down stairs, we were in the room below waiting for a watchman, she dropped down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110036"/>a sixpence, and my friend picked it up; I saw it was a French sixpence, with a hole bored in it; and as we were going to the watch-house, she offered to go back to her lodgings, and she would make it up; he said, if she would send for the money he would; next Monday, at Bow-street, she said, she would make it up, and would send a woman to pawn her cloaths to get it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never saw the money; the sixpence came from the pawnbroker's; it fell from my bosom; he told me he would not prosecute me, if I gave him a guinea and a half; I asked him if he knew the consequence of an oath, and to take an innocent person's life away; he said, he had lost a guinea by not going down by the coach, and he was determined to have it; he acknowledged himself on the Sunday to be in liquor, and wished he had not given charge of me, and on the Monday he said, will you give me a guinea and a half of the money; I said; I could not make it out; I am very innocent of it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a silversmith.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being present at the Bull public-house, in Gray's-inn-lane? - A. Yes; it was the day that Mr. Kirton took the prisoner into custody, I saw him take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at that time, and what time of day was it? - A. I had been to see the landlord, Mr. Spencer, he is an intimate acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you heard relative to this transaction; was Kirton there? - A. Yes, and some other person, I don't know who; I observed Mr. Kirton ask Notley if he did not know him; and he said he did not; he asked him if he did not recollect felling him a bay little cropt horse; and he denied it, and said he did not know him, and had never sold but one horse in his life, and that belonged to his master, Mr. Catlin, and he sold that in Smithfield, for. I won't be certain which, twenty-five or twenty-four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe that horse that he sold for Mr. Catlin? - A. I don't know that, I heard him describe it; Kirton went on further, as I thought, to convince himself whether he was the man; he asked him if he did not, when he sold the horse, promise to treat him with sixpennyworth of liquor; and he said, no, he never did any such thing; by the method of his conversation I thought Kirton did not know the man; I then, hearing him so serious in discourse, asked Kirton it he was joking with him; and he said, no, he was not; I asked him if he was an officer; he said, no, he was not; he said, any body could take a thief, and I will take him; then, says I, I have nothing more to say, it is no business of mine; but I thought you were romancing with the man. Notley then got up, and said, he would go any where, just where he pleased; and appeared no way concerned at all.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did any body else interfere besides Kirton? - A. There was a person with Kirton, but I did not know who he was.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I keep the Bull public-house, and the Bullyard-Inn, Gray's-inn-lane. I know the prisoner, I know Mr. Kirton, and I know Mr. Murdy; I remember their being in my house on Friday the 9th of December, the night that Notley was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a person of the name of Summers there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any conversation taking place between Kirton and Notley? - A. Yes, I remember some part of it; in the first place, Mr. Kirton came into my house and called for a pot of ale, after sitting there about ten minutes, an acquaintance of his came in and helped him to drink that ale.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you find out who that acquaintance was? - A. Yes, Mr. Burley; and then the prisoner came in, and sat the other side of the table, there were three table, in the room; after sitting about ten minutes. Kirton accused him with selling him a bay cropt horse, and told him he was a treat in his debt, and wished to have it then; Notley told him he was no treat in his debt, that he never had a horse in his life, nor ever saw him before in his life; then Kirton told him he certainly sold him a horse at such a place, in Hart-street, at such a time, and he was to take it the next morning to his house; and that when he went the next morning with it Mr. Kirton was in bed, and his mother was up, and paid two guineas for it, after that, he told him he would take him up for stealing that horse; and the prisoner told him he would go with him any where, whenever he chose, without any constable, or any thing else; that is all I know, except going in the coach with him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the examination at Bow-street? - A. Yes; when we went to Bow-street, we were set down at the Brown-bear, Burley and the prisoner, and Kirton, were in the coach, and one other gentleman that I don't know, a Mr. Dunn; the prisoner was examined at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the witness Summers there? - A. Not at the first examination; Kirton was examined first, and Mr. Burley was called up next.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that examination, Kirton swore that the prisoner had sold him a horse; and he was committed for further examination? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Summers was not present at the first examination? - A. I did not hear the second examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever have any other conversation with any body upon the subject? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a stable-keeper, in Theobald's-road; the prisoner was employed by me to drive a coach, and now and then to go out with a post-chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his being taken up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went into the Justices did you go into the Brown-bear? - A. Yes; I sat behind the door waiting for the prisoner, and Summers came and placed himself down by the side of me.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were formerly servant to Mr. Long, the surgeon? - A. Yes; Summers sat down by the side of me, and asked me if I was the horse-dealer; and I said, why? Because, says he, it you are, if you will give me a guinea and an half, or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110040"/>if it is your friend, I will not swear to him, if not. says he, I will swear his life away, and then I shall have a share of forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this fellow before? - A. I never saw him before in my life; I and a coachman were sitting together.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his name? - A. Mr. Blunt; he spoke very low to me these words, and got up and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you did not give him a farthing? - A. No; for I believed the prisoner was thoroughly innocent, for I had known him two years and upwards; he was at work for Mr. Catlin, a stable-keeper, in Gray's-inn-lane, who is now in trouble, and in the King's-Bench prison; and then he came to live with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Summers again? - A. I never saw him till the third examination, when he went over to the bar, he then swore to the man; I was at the first examination, and the Justice told him to look round, and see if he could see the prisoner, there was no other person at the bar; Mr. Kinnard ordered him to look round, he looked round some time, and he scratched his head, and said, no, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he turn round so that he could see the prisoner? - A. I suppose he looked round five moments, quite long enough to have seen him if he had known him; and at the second examination he swore to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who did you say you originally lived with as servant? - A. Mr. Long, thirteen years; what I saved there, and a lady that I lived with died and left me what she had, I went into business for myself; I said, poor fellow, I would go and say that he had worked for me, and that I had never heard any harm of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You took notice of the tone and voice of Summers, that it was rather low? - A. Yes; he slipped himself close down by me, rather more similiar than I liked, and said, hark'e, I want to speak to you; he appeared to be very drunk afterwards when he came to the Justice, and Mr. Kinnard was very angry with him, and told him to be sure and come very sober next time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When was this conversation that you have been descrbing-at the first examination? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I understood you to say, that this conversation took place in the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that previous to the second examination? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the second examination? - A. This was at the first examination, and then we all went over at the second examination, he swore to him without hesitation.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober then? - A. I did not see much difference in him, he seemed to speak better, and without hesitation before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present when he did swear to him? - A. I was not present all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Kirton's mother being there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her saying any thing, or doing any thing? - A. Yes; that was at the first examination, he was ordered to look round, the Justice was very angry with him for coming so; he came down, and she tapped him on the elbow, and then he said, that is the man, d-n my eyes, that is the man, and he was instantly ordered to be turned out of the room, he made such a noise.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Mr. Garner marked this money? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it such a kind of mark as you could swear to? - A. Yes; I think I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You left four sixpences in the till? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And found seven shillings and sixpence only? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you suppose five of six shillings? - A. There was one shilling laid out by a person we saw come out.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. I asked Mrs. Tilt; there might be more laid out.</p>
               <p>Q. You think you missed five or six shillings? - A. There were thirteen, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You found in his pocket half-a-crown and three shillings? - A. Yes, of marked money, out of fifty-three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for the shopman to give change in the shop? - A. It is not usual; he has sometimes done it.</p>
               <p>Q. He has lent money to the till, and taken money from it? - A. I don't remember more than half-a dozen times in the three years he was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. He takes money when you are out? - A. I am generally at home, except when I am on a journey.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever occasion to apply to you to advance money for him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever left money in you hands? - A. Yes, his wages; if he had been with me to the end of the year, I should have owed him twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get this man when he came to you? - A. He had been a bankrupt, and was very strongly recommended to me, he had been a jeweller, I wondered how he could live on my service as he did; I asked him if he had any other resources; he said he did not know that he had; he spent, I suppose, an hundred pounds a year more than I allowed him, that led me to suspect him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When he took change from the till, did he ask your leave? - A. He had no business with the till.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You found no gold in the till in lieu of the silver? - A. None.</p>

               <p>Q. Amongst that were there any pieces of money that Mr. Tilt claimed? - A. There were three shillings and three half-crowns, which were marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got them? - A. Yes, and five guineas in gold besides; he said, that none of the money that he laid on the table was Mr. Tilt's.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it? - A. About nine in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q. How much money did you mark for him? - A. Two half-crowns, some shillings, and some sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Look over that money, and see if you can find any pieces of money that you marked for him at that time? - A. Here are three shillings, and half-a-crown, that I marked for Mr. Tilt on the 7th of January, about six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What mark is it? - A. A sort of a half circle, marked with a punch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr. Tilt.) Q. Look at this, and tell us if this is the money Mr. Garner marked for you? - A. They are all the same.</p>

               <p>Q. With respect to the marks that were put on, they were put on by a common tool? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is hardly a question one can ask you, whether it is a common thing to have a piece of coin so marked? - A. I never saw any so marked; this is a punch of my own making, and I don't think there is another like it.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the use of that particular punch? - A. It is used in watch work, and part of it is broke off.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there nobody else in that line of business that used such a punch? - A. I don't know that they ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not likely that other persons may have used the same sort of tool? - A. They may certainly. (Produces the punch).</p>

             is my man; in the night, between the 12th and 13th of December, I had my slaughter-house broke open, and three sides of beef, the thick and thin flanks and briskets cut off, and the kidney suet and the kidneys, and the fat off the buttocks.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you left the slaughter-house at night? - A. Locked up safe; I locked it myself, I was the last person that came out of it; all the thin fat, and the rough fat was gone out of five sheep, and three shoulders of mutton; my man alarmed me about half after six in the morning, I went to the slaughter-house, the door was not broke open, they got in at the top lost, which was left open for the air, we could see by the print of their feet that they got in there, and there was a ladder set, in Howland-street, opposite to my house; the prisoner Northcote told me he was one of the persons.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to tell you that? - A. I don't know; I asked him, and he denied it at first, but afterwards, at Marlborough-street, he said that he was one of the persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise, or use any threats to induce him to say that? - A. No; I asked if he helped to cut the meat to pieces; he said, he cut none at all; he said, Tomkins cut the meat, for he could come at the flanks of the bullock better than he could, because he was taller; he said, I was satisfied with the first load, but Tomkins was not he would go back for the second.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he was when the other cut it? - A. He said, he was in the slaughter-house with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he himself came back for a second load? - A. He said, they both came back again; he said, they were in the slaughter-house when the watchman came down two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the business of Northcote and Tomkins? - A. I know no more than I was informed, that one was a <rs id="t17970111-29-deflabel182" type="occupation">tripe-man</rs>

             sworn. - I was a watchman in the parish; about a quarter after two, my fellow-watchman told me there were two men going along with something in a bag; I followed them; this was in the New-road; I came up with the short man, Northcote, and asked him what was in the bag; he told me it was turnips; I laid my hand on the bag, and felt it, and he threw the bag down and made off; I made after him and sprung my rattle; the other man made off at the same time; I followed Northcote, and never lost sight of him till he was taken by the patrol, and we took him to the watch-house; there was some beef, and a cleaver in the bag he threw down; I gave them to the night constable, Mr. Chinnery.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any turnips in the bag? - A. No; I then pursued the other man till I lost sight of him; the bags were found near each other; the other man threw the other bag in the road when he ran off; they were not moved till I came up again; in the other bag there were some shoulders of mutton, and some suet.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say which of the bags was thrown down by Northcote, and which by the other man? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110048"/>Q. Who threw down the bag with the clever in it? - A. The other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish the other man's face, so as to know him? - A. Not very particularly; I could not.</p>

             sworn. - I was with Fludd on Monday night; I saw two men go by, each with a bag upon his head, at the end of Mr. Mortimer's market, in the New-road; it is called the Terrace, Tottenham-court-road; I had no suspicion of them then at all; about a quarter past two I saw two men coming by again; I took them to be the same men; that gave me a suspicion that they had something they should not have; they had each of them a bag; I went over the way to Fludd, and told him my suspicions; he went up on the left hand side of the way, and I on the right hand side, just as they turned the corner of Tottenham-court-road; Fludd asked one of them what he had got; one of them said, turnips, which I cannot say; the other man, who was before Northcote, threw down the bag; Northcote turned and looked me full in the face, and then ran away; I went to catch at him; he threw the bag down; with that I sprung a rattle; this watchman made towards him, and struck at him with a stick; he missed him; he ran across the fields through the turnpike, and one Underwood, here, pursued him; there was nobody followed Northcote but Underwood; nobody followed Tomkins that I saw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You don't mean to say that Tomkins was that other man? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Northcote's defence. There was not a soul concerned with me, I was hired into the business; this man said, if I would say John, Will, or Tom, was concerned with me, he would be favourable to me; and he put my hands into bolts in a cruel manner, and he said, I should say to somebody; and then I said to this man, Tomkins; and they said, that was the least punishment I should have, for one month; I was obligated to blame somebody, I might as well have named you as this man; I was hired into the job; a man asked me if I was willing to earn five shillings; I said it was very acceptable these hard times, and he brought a bag out of an empty house, and put it upon my head, I did not know what it was any more than a post; he told me if any body asked me what it was, to say it was turnips.</p>
               <p>Tomkins was not put upon his defence.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you hear whereabouts he was? - A. In Ireland; when they were before the Magistrate, Rowe said, that she had requested him to go to Ireland with her.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you hear of this at the time of the first marriage? - A. No; not till two or three months after.</p>
               <p>Q. After that was heard of, did the prisoner and and Kitty Wilcox live together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. They might, for ought I know, a twelvemonth; but I have known very little of them since they were married. The circumstance I was going to mention was this, that some time ago, she wanted Mr. Rowe to go with her to Ireland, to live there, but not to pass for her husband; it was a strong presumptive proof, to the Magistrates, that she had a husband living, and that she wished to conceal her present marriage.</p>

               <p>Dobson. I was summoned to Worship-street, and there I heard that he was married to the woman, he was obliged to marry; he told them the suspicion that his first wife was married, and they gave it as their opinion, at the Commons, that he might marry again, and he, being an ignorant man, was married.</p>
               <p>Court. You see, Gentlemen, the Hampstead officers make this man marry Susannah Redwood, and it is reported that the first husband of the other woman is alive. It appears to me to be a prosecution by the parish, merely to decide a settlement.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these the only marks by which you ascertain them to be your master's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the same business before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you could ascertain your former master's property by the same kind of mark? - A. Yes; the razors that I had given him I left at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. There are no other marks than you have described? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Whose marks are they? - A. Some are my marking, and some my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. You know his hand-writing? - A. Yes; these other two razors I believe to be his, but I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is there any other person in the shop besides yourself? - A. Myself, and my master, and my master's son.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you missed these articles? - A. We had a suspicion of him a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to say that you have not told these very articles in your shop? - A. I don't believe I ever did, but I cannot tell; he confessed before the Justice that he took them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Did you ever sell any to him? - A. No.</p>

             sworn - On Tuesday, the 27th of December, about twelve o'clock at night, there were a great quantity of staves, to the number of about fifty, stole out of a lighter alongside the ship; they were put into the ship's boat and taken away, boat and staves altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they taken to? - A. That we have not found out yet; they were lying in <placeName id="t17970111-35-crimeloc219">Ratcliffe-cross tier</placeName>

               <p>Q.What were these staves for? - A. Casks; I know that stave that was left in the boat was one that was taken from the lighter, by a mark J.R. and a cross at the end of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did they belong to? - A. Isaac Soley and sons.</p>

               <p>Q. How many sons? - A. Two, and the father.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody else is in business with them? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't mean to swear that is in the county of Middlesex? - A. It is nearest the Middlesex side; the ships lay within their own length of the shore.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the staves secured on board the lighter? - A. They were in an open lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the staves before they were lost? - A. Not two hours; I came over them at ten o'clock at night on board.</p>
               <p>Q. They lay publicly in this barge for any body to help themselves as they went up and down? - A. Yes; but they might as well have taken our ship away as them.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. Before the mast: On Tuesday night, the 27th of December, I went to bed, and there was one of the Custom-house officers on board, and had been for some time; he called me up, and said, there was somebody upon deck; I came upon deck, but could not see any body upon deck, but I found a man in the lighter that was lying alongside the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him enough to know him again? - A. Yes; that was the man at the bar; he is a ballast-heaver.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before, so as to know his person? - A. Yes; he was taking the staves from the lighter, and putting them into the ship's boat; he cut the ship's painter, and got into the boat, and he offered to give me five shillings to say nothing, and he drove up the river, and a man in a lighterman's boat took him into row.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that? - A. Yes; and then they went up the river.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be doing all this? - A. When I came upon deck, he took the last stave out, and cut the painter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other staves in the boat? - A. Yes; the boat was almost full of them; there were about fifty or sixty, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light about the ship? - A. No; it was a moon-light night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding he had a hat on, are you perfectly sure he is the man? - A. Yes; I went down into the lighter, and saw his face; I was him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try to stop him, or give any alarm? - A. No, I did not try to stop him.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did not you? - A. There was nobody up but myself; the officer was in bed, and the mate and master too.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the reason why you did not attempt to stop him? - A. Yes; I called them as soon as I could, but the boat was gone too far to find him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The officer called to you first? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the officer knew of this before you did? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew if you had called out to the officer, and told him the man was on board, he would have come to your assistance? - A. He was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you know your master would have given you a very good flogging, if you had not fixed upon somebody? - A. I called to the mate of the other ship, and he would not come.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the mate on board your own ship would not come, though he called to you first? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not attempt to stop him? - A. It was of no use to get myself killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know you come now to swear to him, to save yourself a good flogging for letting him go? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had seen this man before? - A. In Captain Harrison's vessel, heaving ballast.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a very dark night? - A. No, it was a light night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give this account of it when you were first questioned about it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the Magistrates? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You saw it by the light, such as it was; you had no other light about you? - A. No.</p>

I live at the prisoner's house when I am out of place; I came to his house about six o'clock a boxing night, the 26th of December, and Pindar and his wife and I all laid in the bed together that night; we went to the Black-house and had some beer, and he went home at nine o'clock and went to bed, and I left him in bed when I went away at nine o'clock the next morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What night in the week was it? - A. Monday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you slept in the same room, or in the same bed? - A. In the same bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I dare say he declared to his wife that he did not make free with you? - A. It<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110053"/>was not the first night by a great many; I have lived in the house above a twelve month.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sleep there in any other way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you not to sleep in the house as you had done before? - A. Because the bed had been washed that I used to sleep in.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he an honest man? - A. To the best of my knowledge, I never saw any thing but honesty by him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you here upon this occasion? - A. His wife came after me the day before yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear nothing of this business till the day before yesterday? - A. No; I was in place when she came after me.</p>
               <p>Q. What place? - A. At the back of St. Paul's; where they have got three children; I believe it is Great Carter-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What number? - A. I cannot tell; it is the first house; one Murphy keeps the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear of his being taken before? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure he never went out of the house that night? - A. I am perfectly sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not sleep at all that night? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he might have gone out without your knowledge for two or three hours, and come back again? - A. He might, for ought I know; but I went to bed with him, and left him in bed in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prisoner live? - A. No. 8, Golding's-hill, Ratcliffe-highway.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Islington; I was going to Colbrook-row at the time I was robbed, which was a very few minutes before nine in the evening of the 15th of December; I was within fifty or sixty yards of <placeName id="t17970111-36-crimeloc226">Colbrook-row, in the foot-path, by the side of the New-River</placeName>

               <p>Q. To whom did you address youself? - A. Always to the prisoner at the bar, as he was the person that spoke to me first; his reply was, give the gentleman his papers, which the third person did, the man that rifled me, and he left one upon the ground, which he afterwards gave me, saying, sir, here is another, they then all left me.</p>
               <p>Q. You have named the prisoner at the bar, had you any opportunity of observing him in particular? - A. Yes; it was a remarkable clear, moon-light night, it was the night after the full-moon.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt whatever, that he was one of the three men that robbed you? - A. I have no doubt at all; he is not dressed now as he was when he robbed me; when I saw him at Bow-street, he was in the same dress that he was in when he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time that you saw the prisoner after the robbery? - A. Last Saturday, about twenty-three days after the robbery; I immediately pointed him out as the man that robbed me; I have never recovered any of my property; a particular friend of mine, Mr. Oldham of Edmonton, asked me to go to Bow-street with him, and there I saw five men at the bar, one of whom I pointed out to Mr. Oldham, namely, the prisoner, as being the man that first laid hold of me; I went, the morning after the robbery, to Worship-street to give information, and have the property advertised; I described the men as being dressed, particularly the prisoner, in a drab great coat, with his hair loose in his neck, and from their appearance, I thought they were soldiers; I described the articles in the indictment, but I heard nothing from the office whatever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. There is no doubt at all that you were robbed? - A. I believe not, sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110054"/>Q. Whoever committed the robbery, behaved extremely civil to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner at the bar again, till you saw him at Bow-street? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. That was at the distance of three weeks afterwards? - A. Rather more, twenty-three days.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did see him again, you saw him together with other persons put to the bar, at Bow-street? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not intermixed with other persons, but put at the bar with other persons, to be examined for robberies? - A. Had he been standing indiscriminately among the crowd, I should have had no hesitation in saying he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not put at the bar as a person to be examined for a robbery? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go there, with a knowledge in your mind, that you should find the person that had committed a robbery upon you? - A. Certainly, from hearing that five men were apprehended for footpad robberies, but from nothing else, I thought from that I might have a chance of seeing one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you given to understand that the person who had committed the robbery upon you, was a person to be examined at Bow-street? - A No; I merely knew that five men, who had been examined the on Wednesday, were to be examined again on the Saturday, and I told my friend, Mr. Oldham, I would attend.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not given to understand, that you should meet a person answering the description you had given of the person who had robbed you? - A. No; when I went into the room, I did not know who they were, till I saw the prisoner's back.</p>

               <p>Q. How long do you think this robbery might occupy? - A. It could not exceed three minutes; I assure you they did their business quickly.</p>
               <p>Q. Three persons attacked you? - A. Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. You did not know the prisoner's person before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In so short a space of time, can you take upon yourself to swear, positively, that the prisoner is the man? - A. I have not the least hesitation in saying the prisoner was the first man that attacked me; I have some recollection that I have seen him before, I am not certain, I think he was one of those bruising gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not certain he was a bruiser? - A. No</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you take upon yourself to swear he was the man who robbed you? - A. That I certainly do.</p>

No, I had not; I had the silver in my waistcoat pocket, and the gold in my breeches pocket; I had in my waistcoat pocket a piece of a button, that was found upon her afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take you cloaths off when you laid down? - A. Only my coat; I had pulled out the silver at this house, to pay for some purl.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no occasion to resort to the pocket that the gold was in? - A. No; she asked me, if I had been robbed, and I felt in my pocket, and found that I had, there was only a halfpenny and two farthings left in my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the house besides the girl? There was another woman in the next room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the same room with you at all? I cannot say; when I awaked, a man went after her, and brought her back, she was taken from there by the watchman, to the watch-house; I went with her, she was examined, and there was a guinea found in her mouth, that she endeavoured to swallow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any attempt in her to swallow it? - A. Yes, and there was found half-a-guinea and ten shillings in silver in her pocket, and a part of the button; she said, a gentleman had just given her fifteen shillings in the street, and she had five shillings in her pocket of her own.</p>

             sworn. - I am watch-house keeper of St. Giles's; the watchman brought the prisoner and the prosecutor to the watch-house, on the 23d of December, about three o'clock in the morning, I searched her, and found half-a-guinea in her pocket, and a part of a plated button, (produces it); I saw the motion of her mouth, and I judged the had got something in her mouth; I asked her if she had got any thing there, and she said, no; says I, come out with it, and held her by the cheeks, and I saw her strain, as if she was going to swallow it; I saw Fidler, the beadle, put his finger into her mouth, and out tumbled a guinea; I put the guinea, the half-guinea, ten shillings, and the top of the button on the table; the prosecutor says, there is a button belonging to me, I know it, I think he said it was filed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know this to be mine, it was taken by my fellow-servant for a halfpenny, it had been filed before I had it.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot swear to the money of course? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I picked up that good man, he said, he had but a shilling, and he gave me that, and some halfpence to get something to drink, that button was among them, and then he gave me the guinea to change, to get something for supper, because he was to stop with me all night, the silver I had before.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are a letter-carrier in the district of Lombard-street? - A. No; I only deliver them for another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you, on the 21st of November, the deliverer of letters in Lombard street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there on the 21st of November? A. I go there every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there that day? - A. I don't doubt but I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You delivered all the letters that you received from the office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are sure that you delivered all you received? - A. Yes; I received them from Mr. Harrison, in the Post-Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no opportunity of taking them from you? - A. They are not in my hands four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You receive them from where the other clerks are? - A. No; it is the place where the letter-carriers are.</p>
               <p>Q. What time is it you receive the letters at Lombard-street? - A. As soon as ever the gates are declared open, there is no set time; according to the time of the mail coming in; sometimes they are not marked when I come.</p>
               <p>Q. Then strangers are not permitted to enter where you are? - A. No; but sometimes they will get in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. That persons will press in that have no business there, is certainly true? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. That I apprehend was on a Wednesday? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner on that day? A. I was going out to dinner with a friend, and he called upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what subject, and what did he communicate to you? - A. He asked me if I would go in the city with him to cash some notes, and I asked him what notes they were, and he said they were Bank-notes, and very good notes; accordingly I turned round to the lady I was going out with, and said, I would wait upon her on Friday, and I sent my servant for a coach; Mr. Nathan went in the coach with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You went together in the coach? - A. Yes; I would not wish to walk in a dirty day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he go in with you? - A. No; he was not dressed well enough to go with me that day.</p>
               <p>Q. He staid in the coach then? - A. No; he got out and paid the coach.</p>

               <p>Q. You were to call for him after you had got the notes cashed? - A. I got the notes cashed, and then I called for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave the prisoner; with what appointment? - A. I told him if he stopped at the Bank, I would call for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you present your bills at Esdaile's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get cash? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get value for them? - A. I got a ten pound Bank of England note, five guineas and an half in gold, and I returned them sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. From Esdaile's, where did you go to? - A. To Downe's.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you go alone to Downe's? - A. He was just by Downe's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Did you go to Downe's alone, or did you see him first? - A. I saw him as I went along, just opposite Downe's, by the side of the Bank, in Bartholomew-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get value for your note there? - A. Yes, five guineas, immediately; and then when I came out, I saw Mr. Nathan, and I said, you are not dressed as well as me; you have no powder in your hair, nor nothing, and I wish to get a coach and go home as soon as possible, and we got a coach in Cateaton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any more business? - A. No; merely for the ride, he went to my house and took coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay him the value you had got for your bills? - A. I tendered him down the money, and he wished to have cash.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you these notes at your house, before you went? - A. Yes; and I did not examine them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you offer him, when you got got home, the ten-pound note? - A. Yes; and he said, he would rather have cash; and I sent my servant to my banker's to get cash, and I gave him twenty guineas in gold.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. And pray who may be your banker, Madam? - A. Mr. Pybus.</p>
               <p>Q. This was upon the 23d; after your servant brought you cash from your banker's, did you pay that to Mr. Nathan? - A. Yes, immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole of it? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. After coffee was over, you parted, I take it for granted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110058"/>Q. When did you see Mr. Nathan next? - A. On the Saturday following; I was going into the city upon some business to my executor's.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you parted upon that day, did Mr. Nathan make you any acknowledgement-I don't mean in the shape of money, you know? - A. I had no notion of it; he owes me a great deal of money; stoppage is no payment, you know; he owes me at this moment about eighty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether, at that time, he made you, in any shape, any little present for the trouble you had taken? - A. No; I should not have thought of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him next? - A. The Saturday following, at my own house; I was just going to my executor's, Mr. Green, and he said, as it was his sabbath, he wished I would change a bill for 19l. 13s. 6d. upon Smith and Company; he gave me two other notes, which he did not desire me to change, but said, they would be due upon the Monday; I went to Mr. Smith's, and Mr. Smith called me into the parlour, and they stopped me, and I gave them my address; I had several notes upon snow and others of my own in my pocket; I was very much surprized, and they did not chuse to tell me what it was; I thought it might be a forgery; I immediately went to Mr. Green, and shewed him those other two notes; they were to be due on Monday; I asked Mr. Green if they were good notes, and he sent his servant to change them, and they were stopped likewise.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who is Mr. Green?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The executor to her late husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Then an examination took place, and you stated this? - A. Yes, undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know upon whom the other notes were drawn? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Had you any adventure in the lottery, or any share of any ticket at the time you went to Mr. Green's? - A. Yes; I received a sixteenth in the Irish lottery from Mr. Nathan, about eight or nine shillings value; I had given him one about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive that sixteenth from him? - A. Upon my word I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you receive it? - A. At my own house, before my own servants; you don't suppose it was for my going into the city, I hope.</p>
               <p>Q. No; I would not insult you so much? - A. I hope not.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the sixteenth if you were to see it again? - A. No, I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other sixteenth in your house, at the time the officers went there? - A. I had no other from nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that? - A. Yes; it was locked up in my bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure you had no other sixteenth but that you had received of Mr. Nathan at the time the officers were at your house? - A. I had no other.</p>
               <p>Q. From any other person, or upon any other account whatever? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You yourself found the misfortune of having all these bills traced to your possession, and that you were under the necessity of accounting for them, did not you? - A. I did not find it any misfortune.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find it any misfortune? - A. I knew very well I was innocent of them.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you at once told the plain truth of whom you had them, and every thing relating to it? - A. Yes; I thought it was a forgery, and therefore I was intimated.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, of course, you found it the best way to toll the truth? - A. Mr. Conant begged of me to do so, and I did tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, then, who did you say you had them from? - A. Mr. Nathan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The very first time you were asked about it? - A. The very first time I was upon my oath at Mr. Conant's, I told him the same that I have told this gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether the first time you were questioned by Mr. Conant about it, you told him the truth? - A. I told that gentleman I was intimidated, and therefore perhaps the former part of my story has varied from the last.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you sure it did? - A. The last part of my story I was upon my oath.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, when you were questioned about it by Mr. Conant, and had to account for them, did you not say you had all these from a Mrs. Smith? - A. I was intimidated.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you or did you not say so? - A. I did first, that was before I was sworn; and Mr. Conant told me, that if I told the truth, the first part of the story should be void.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you describe that Mrs. Smith to be? - A. A lady that came to my house upon business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Conant whereabouts it was likely to find this lady, to bring her to justice? - A. I certainly varied in my story; for I thought, as I was a lone woman, and every thing, and thinking there was something of a forgery about it, I was very much intimidated, and did not know what to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110059"/>Q. What account did you give of Mrs. Smith? - A. You certainly know, or else you would not ask me.</p>
               <p>Q. If you don't give me an answer, I will apply to my Lord to commit you? - A. Mr. Conant told me, all that I said first should be void.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you tell Mr. Conant where she was to be found? - A. Somewhere in Charlotte-street, I told him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was this acquaintance of your's then to be a lady of easy virtue? - A. I was so intimidated I did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe her as a lady of easy virtue, likely to be met with at the theatres, the park, and public places, yes, or no? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire that an officer should go with you to those several places, to enable you to find out this person, and bring her to justice? - A. I wish to come to the right of the affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire that an officer might attend you to go to the theatres, and the park, and places of public resort, to find this Mrs. Smith? - A. You know, Sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I know nothing of it, or the Jury; you must tell us, that we may know? - A. Mr. Conant said, that all that should be void; he said it should never be repeated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did an officer attend you, now, in consequence of this description of your's, to the park, and the theatres, and from place to place, to endeavour to find this Mrs. Smith? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. That officer was Lawrence, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you keep Lawrence upon this pretty game of hide and seek, was he not a week with you, now, trying to find out this Mrs. Smith? - A. He came on Sunday afternoon, and he came on Monday, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him to any places to endeavour to find out this lady? - A. I went into the theatre myself, he stopped at the door while I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay to look and find out this Mrs. Smith? - A. May-be half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You employed yourself in looking about to see if she was there, I suppose? - A. I was intimidated, knowing I was a woman, and nobody to protect me; I thought it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or not, search for this Mrs. Smith at the play-house? - A. If that Gentleman wishes me to tell you, I will.</p>
               <p>Court. To be sure you must, yes or no.</p>
               <p>A. Certainly, I looked in at the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you or not, search about for this Mrs. Smith at the play-house while you were there? - </p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why don't you answer the question? - A. I told him I could not find Mrs. Smith.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you search for this Mrs. Smith? - A I knew there could be no Mrs. Smith in existence, I went from box to box; I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you taken up? - A. On Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was on Monday; was not your fright over? - A. No; it has lasted ever since; I would not have had it happen for a thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You are apprehensive that if you don't clear yourself of this charge you will come to some harm by it? - A. I have spoke the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you apprehend you shall be prosecutod if you don't clear yourself by your evidence? - A. I clear myself as far as possible.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do attend to the question, and if you understand it, answer it directly; do you not conceive, that unless you clear yourself, by the evidence you now give, you will be prosecuted? - A. No; I will clear myself, and I don't think of being prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I will be content with that answer, and will not press it any further. - This, I dare say, is the first time you were ever in trouble, and therefore you were taken suddenly; you never were in trouble before? - A. Every body is in trouble by times.</p>
               <p>Q. You know what I mean, and you will not come to it. Supposing, for instance, a person should be taken up and carried to goal? - A. I was taken up for buying a gown that was stole, and I had you for my Counsellor, you know, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. All the world may have that. - Whether, before this happened, you had been taken up on any criminal charge? - A. I was never in custody before the gown, and then I was honourably acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. You are no dealer in wax, are you? - A. Yes, Sir, you know that.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were called upon to account for some wax of Mr. Barrett's, that got into your possession? - A. You know every thing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you not called upon to account for some wax of Mr. Barrett's, that got into your possession? - A. It was not in my possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you mean to say, that Mr. Barrett's wax was not in your possession? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you fell it? - A. No; I had some wax from his servants; you know how the affair was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not charged with having wax of Mr. Barrett's; were you not forgiven by Mr. Barrett upon condition of revealing all you knew about the wax you had of his servants? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110060"/>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I mean to say this: that Mr. Barrett desired me to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which condition he forbore to prosecute you? - A. No such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. My husband desired me to tell Mr. Barrett the whole truth of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not twice before the Magistrates at Union-hall as an accomplice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were afterwards tried for receiving a gown, knowing it to have been stolen? - A. Yes; and honourably acquitted before Mr. Maiwaring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Give me leave to ask you a few questions. - It is not from any credit you have done yourself, you have made a very pretty figure to be sure; I collect from this Gentleman's examination, that you had stated, that a Mrs. Smith had delivered you the bills. Were you, at that time, upon oath? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever at any time, upon oath, give any other account than you have given in answer to my questions to night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true, that you received them from Nathan, and not from a person of the name of Smith? - A. It is the whole truth, I received them from Nathan, and nobody else.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Russell. Q. Did you, in November last, keep a lottery-office, in Cornhill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at your office, fell shares in the Irish-lottery? - A. Yes; on the 23d of November, I sold a quarter and a sixteenth, in the Irish-lottery to Nathan, the number of one was 37,979.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the sixteenth, or the quarter? - A. They were both of the same ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the prisoner pay you for that quarter and sixteenth? - A. With a Bank-note of 10l. (the note shown to him.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the Bank-note which he paid you? - A. Yes, and there is my memorandum upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your Lordship recollects this was proved by the Banker's clerk, at Stokesley, to be contained in this letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arnull. I was apprehensive it might be a lost note from the appearance of it, and I sent a person to the Bank about it; he staid till he came back; and I am positive he is the person, the tickets are registered in Mr. Nathan's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make that register in consequence of directions given you by the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the register? - A. Mr. Nathan, No. 106, Swallow-street, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you any reason upon earth to doubt that that was his true description, and residence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore this man comes openly to your shop with a ten pound Bank-note, parchases a part of commodities you deal in, and desires you expressly to put down his name and abode, whenever you chuse to send after him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, probably. you would not have known where to find him, if he had not so done? - A. Very likely not.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent from your house to the Bank, supposing it to be a lost note-did he stay like an honest man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A ten pound Bank-note may go all round London in two days? - A. Very likely.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold a quarter and a sixteenth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The sixteenth has no particular number about it, to denote one sixteenth of the same ticket from another? - A. Of that individual ticket, there were twelve sixteenths.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark by which you can ascertain the very individual sixteenth that you sold to him? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. The object of your register is, to give notice to the fortunate holders, if it is drawn a prize? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you speaking of the prisoner now? - A. No, another man; he asked me if I would take a letter down in the country for him; I told him I would; he said he was in London upon a piece of business for a woman of the name of Kingswood; he said he was left executor; he asked me when I was going home; I told him I was going home that night; he asked me where I was going to then; I told him I was going to Friday-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110062"/>street; he said he was going but a little further, and he would get this letter for me to carry in the country; I went to the top of Cheapside, next Newgate-street, and went into a public-house and had sixpenny-worth of rum and water, and the man with me; I asked him how much I should pay towards it, and he said he should pay it all; he said, if he could get his business done there, he would give me a letter at that house; from thence we went to another house towards Goswell-street, that was about half past twelvelve in the day; we went from thence to <placeName id="t17970111-39-crimeloc245">the Cart and Horse, in Goswell-street</placeName>

               <p>Jury. Q. You betted the wager with the prisoner? - A. Yes, and he won it; and when he had won it, he took up my 20l. bill; the other man, at the same time, laid five guineas with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me how that last bet was laid exactly? - A. The other man laid five guineas, and I laid five guineas; the prisoner did not put any thing down that I recollect; he was to pay ten guineas if he lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay down your five guineas? - A. I laid down my 20l. bill; the prisoner did not lay down any thing that I recollect; the other man laid down some paper, but what it was I don't know; when the prisoner won, he took up my 20l. bill; and the other man, as soon as ever he took it up, went out directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You won a guinea; did the prisoner pay you the guinea? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken up that guinea? - A. Yes; and then I went out after the other man directly, and I asked him what he went away for; I told him I had only lost five guineas out of my 20l. bill, and I told him the prisoner had got my 20l. bill; he said, his was two 10l. bills, and he had his the same; the other man told me he had no more money nor bills; he said, coming down that street, he had two or three hundred pounds from some house in that street, and he did tell me the particular place, but I have forgot it; he ordered me to go in and mind that the prisoner did not get away; he said, he would be back again in two or three minutes the outside, and then he said he would win it back again of him; I returned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110063"/>into the public-house directly as quick as possible, and the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any more of your money? - A. No; I never got any of it again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - A. Last Friday, at Bow-street; this was the last day of November that I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other people in the room at Bow-street? - A. Yes; I suppose one hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you with him altogether? - A. I suppose it was about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him so, that you can fasely swear to him? - A. Yes; if I had not seen him again these twelve months, I should have known him.</p>
               <p>Q. All this happened at the Cart and Horse, the last day of November, about half after twelve? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. So all this happened on the 30th of November, did it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till that day month that you saw the prisoner at the bar? - A. It was more than a month.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sent for to Bow-street, were you not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were told you would see the man that you supposed had robbed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the people that told you so go into the office with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they told you there he was? - A. No, they did not tell me he was there; when I went in, they told me he was in custody, but I did not know he was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think the Justice was sitting for, but to hear the matter between you? - A. The Justice called me in.</p>
               <p>Q. I see you like other people's money very well, don't you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You won the man's guinea, did not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And I dare say you had no objection to have kept it? - A. I did not want any concern with it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you would have won his 20l. if you could? - A. I did not think of such a thing; the man promised me I should not lose any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not you, if you had won his 20l. have taken it if you could? - A. I suppose I should, if they would have let me, but they would not have let me.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not you, if you had won his 20l. have taken it if you could? - A. I dare say I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You played with intent to win, did you not? - A. I had no thought of losing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not play with an intent to win, if you could? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, when you went away, did you tell this man that you were going? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You deposited the 20l. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The man who was with you, and seemed to be on your side, deposited 20l. as far as you believe? - A. No; I did not believe it was, but I don't know what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you so, and you believed it at the time? - A. To be sure I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not believe it to be so at the time he said so? - A. Yes, I did believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that man at all dispute that he had betted 20l. and lost it? - A. He had only won five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did that man dispute that he had lost all that he had put down? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You now say, you only intended to play for five guineas, and not for 20l.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask this man, when you went out, for change out of the 20l. note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And the other never disputed that he had lost the 20l.? - A. No; he went out directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all give this man to understand that you meant to return? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He had actually won five guineas, even upon your own account? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the landlord of the house here? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you taken any pains to bring him here? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever desired any person from the house to attend and give an account of this? - A. I asked the landlord if he had ever seen these men before, and he said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. I should like to know if you were ever in possession of 20l. in your life; how did you get it; what business are you? - A. A cloth-dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you this 20l.? - A. I had a check upon No 20, Basinghall-street; I had received it about two days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever applied to any body in Basinghall-street, to prove that you were ever in possession of such a bill? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all we have to trust to is the account of such an idle fellow as you? - A. I could get them in a few minutes; I have the number of the bill in my pocket now.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110067"/>Q. Did you know them before, or were they strangers? - A. They were entire strangers to me; they asked me where I lived, I said, I lived in the City, but I should stop there till the people got up where I lodged; there was a short man in company with him, not the prisoner, he took the watch out of my sob, and put in his waistcoat-pocket; I turned round, and said, don't play any tricks with the watch, it is a watch I set a great value upon; he went towards a little archway, that goes into the market; I went into the house again, and told them that I had lost my watch; Mr. Lynch a constable ran after him, and Mr. Butler the landlord sent his boy to fetch Bird back, and he overtook him about Russell-street, and the watchman brought him back to the house; I said, he was one of the men, the other man never was taken, I have never got the watch again; the prisoner, Bird, said, he would do his utmost to restore the watch if they would let any person go with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these men talk together when they came out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, he asked if you were better, and how far you were going, which of them was that? - A. Bird, I think, asked how I found myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You went out to supper-where might you sup? - A. In Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you leave your friend's house where you supped? - A. I believe it to be between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A I cannot say I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you very much intoxicated? - A. Not very much.</p>
               <p>Q. To sober yourself, you went to a public-house in Covent-garden? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you drank some purl, and it had the effect of making you sick? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner and another were sitting in the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were more people in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it strike you as a very uncommon, and a very inhuman thing to come out to see after you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Bird asked you how you found yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they happened to be the only two persons in the house who took compassion on your situation? - A. They came out to the door to me.</p>

               <p>Q. And therefore you infer they were in company, you never saw them before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw them sit next each other before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have no other reason for saying they were in company, than that they were standing next each other in the public-house? - A. They stood together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody else standing near them at the time? - A. I did not observe any body.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body else had come out with them, you would have said they were in their company too? - A. Perhaps so; I sat in a box by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Bird asked you how you found yourself; he might very naturally ask you that question with a kind intention? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The other man took your watch out of your pocket, and you thought it was a joke? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Bird came with you into the public-house? - A. No; I did not see him till after he was brought in by the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing towards taking the watch? - A. He was only with the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he was any otherwise with the man, than enquiring at the same time how you were? - A. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation pass between Bird and the other man, which could shew that they had seen each other before? - A. No; I heard no conversation between Bird and the other man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did not you before say they were talking together at the further corner, when they came to the door? - A. I will not be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what you told me just now could not be true, that you did not hear any conversation; I will now ask you a third time, and see what answer you will give - Did you hear any conversation between Bird and the other man? - A. I believe they were speaking together when they came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not hear any conversation between them? - A. I cannot exactly say; I was very sick at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that the other man gave the watch to Bird? - A. I am partly sure that Bird had not got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, being partly sure, are you not quite sure? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After Bird came back to the house, you sent a person of the name of Lynch after the other man; is he here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Bird told you he would do all in his power to restore the watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When Bird went off, did he go off in the same direction with the other man? - A. No; they went in contrary directions.(

Yes, they were; then they went out together; after they had been gone about ten minutes, Mr. Butler went out, and I followed him; I heard the prosecutor talking to the man about his watch; I asked him what was the matter; he said, that short man had taken his watch; I told him if he had got the young man's watch, he had better return it to him; he said, I have not; I then turned round to go into the house, and instead of his coming in, he ran away; he ran across Covent-garden, and I followed him, but being a very dark morning I lost sight of him; I then returned back again, and waited a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes in the house; some person came to the window of the public-house, and holloaed out, O! at the window; I said, I dare say that is the man that has got the watch; I went out, and saw a watchman at the door; I said did you see any body call; he told me, yes, that he was run across towards the Piazzas; I went up to him and collared him; I said, my friend, come back, and have this business of the watch settled; upon that a scuffle ensued, and there were blows between us; at Carpenter's coffee-house, I had like to have been through the windows; I let go my hold, and he got off, I left Bird in the house.</p>

I said, I dare say that is the person that has taken the watch, and we went in pursuit of him, but he was not taken; the prisoner was afterwards brought back by a watchman of the name of Murphy, who is not here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When you opened your house, these persons came in? - A. Yes; I open always at three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they standing, waiting for admission? - A. No; they came shortly after I had opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before? - A. I never saw either of them before, nor the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. While the prosecutor and the other man were disputing about the watch he made no charge upon this man? - A. No, he did not; he said, that he was in company with him, that was all.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did either of these men pay for the other? - A. No; they paid separately.</p>


               <p>Q. Did they drink together? - A. Yes; one sat on one side the table, and the other on the other, talking together; they appeared to be very sociable and amicable together.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the use of the tent-room? - A. There are tents, and all sorts of stores, kept there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Wilson? - A. Yes; he lived in Leman-row, Leman-street, Goodman's-fields; he was clerk to Messrs. Hodgson and Hayter, packers in the tent-room. I remember Lucas, the carman, taking away a load of goods in the month of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there? - A. Yes; there were about twelve or thirteen casks of stockings, or coverlids, or something of that sort; they were part of the King's stores; the prisoner and I put them into the casks, and they were taken away to be sold, for the advantage of the prisoner and Wilson, and me; the prisoner had received his share of the money for former things, but not for this; I paid him somewhere about eight pounds the very day that Wilson was taken; I was to have had mine at night, but Wilson being taken I never had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who craned these goods down into the cart? - A. Some men that were on the works; the prisoner was there, and turned them out in the crane, to let them down where Wilson received them; Wilson went with the cart, and I went in the evening and unpacked them; Wilson took them up stairs into his room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what they were? - A. They might be coverlids, I cannot say what they were.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Q. I believe you did not confine yourselves to any one particular thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe you steal, by wholesale, all that you can say your hands upon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the character of the man that is now giving evidence? - A. I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much have you got, now, by robbing government? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. For any thing you know it might be one of the Artillery-men, as well as this man; we have only your veracity for that? - A. He was concerned in packing them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether Spencer was really the man, or any other person, we must take from you as far as we can believe you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this man continued in his employ to the very time of his being taken up? - A. Yes; he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to swear, that the goods which you stole (no matter who accompanied you in it) on the 20th of October, and that Lucas carried away, were stockings or blankets? - A. I don't know that they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know on what day Wilson was taken? - A. On a Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. That was generally known? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Spencer came to work on the Monday following, did not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you recollect whether there were blankets or not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How are stockings made up, are they in paper bundles? - A. Yes, a dozen in a bundle; the ends of some are covered, and some are not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or not, see any stockings when you packed or unpacked them? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. There are no articles in the tent-room that have the same appearance with bundles of stockings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you unpack the whole thirteen casks yourself? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long were you a grocer? - A. A great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever a coal-merchant? - A. Never; I believe I once took a room of coals, and sent a chaldron of them to my mother-in-law, and they were measured out of my room, and therefore they put me down, seller,

               <p>Q. Now Mr. Grocer, or Coal-merchant. or Printer and Bookseller? - A. I am no coal-merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then grocer let it be - You heard that there was a claim made by men employed by printers, to certain copies? - A. There are a great many printers here to prove that they have no such right.</p>
               <p>Q. But we will hear that rather from persons who were bred to the business, than from a grocer; did you ever hear that there was such a claim made? - A. I have heard that there was, and I have heard a great many things that are not true, but I told them I would not permit it; I have heard both that there was such a claim, and that there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think that the proper way of settling a disputed claim, was to indict that lad for felony? - A. He did not pretend to claim any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he or not set up a claim to a copy of that book? - A. No; he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor of any book in which he was concerned as a compositor? - A. No; he never did to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether he did or not? - A. I say he never did to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He never stated that claim? - A. Never to me, nor in my hearing; I believe he said, after I had taken him up, that he understood he had a claim, but that that was very foreign to the answer he gave me when I detected him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you detected him, as you call it, he was folding some sheets, which, he said, were damaged sheets? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he was at least as likely to know whether they were damaged sheets as a grocer? - A. It was a perfect book, all but one sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the business? - A. Better than a year.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been employed by you? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you continued to employ him from the time you left the trade of a grocer, till you came into that of a bookseller and printer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say, that after you detected him, as you call it, he did set up this claim? - A. He did not set it up; he said, he understood there was such a claim; he said, he understood it, but he never made such a claim; he begged my pardon, and said, if I would excuse him he would never do so any more.</p>
               <p>Q. You had threatened him with Botany Bay, I believe? - A. I had threatened to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the Mr. Cawthorne, I believe, who got into Bell's shop? - A. Yes; very unluckily for me.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very unlucky that you should both be dissatisfied - What became of those sheets you found the boy folding? - A. They are here.</p>

             sworn. - I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and searched them; I found here the plays stated in the indictment; they are in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did you find them? - A. At the top of a small book-case, or desk, that stood very near the door upon entering the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are overseer in this shop of Mr. Cawthorne's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in this trade of printing? - A. Upwards of twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell us a little more than Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110072"/>Cawthorne could about a custom in the trade, which is claimed by workmen, of having a copy of each book they print? - A. I have frequently heard of the custom, but I know of no printing office, but the King's printing-office, where it is allowed.</p>
               <p>Q. In the King's printing-office, are they allowed a copy, or are they paid money in lieu of a copy? - A. They are paid money in lieu of a copy.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you worked in various printing-offices? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. In those printing-offices, have you not known that the pressmen and compositors have both set up the claim of a copy of the work which they print? - A. I have heard of it frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not an understood claim? - A. I believe they contend it to be a right; I have heard them say there is an act of Elizabeth, which gives them that right.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the question was tried between the journeymen and the masters, by Mr. Lane of Leadenhall-street? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. This young man was Mr. Cawthorne's journeyman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to his lodgings, there was no search-warrant? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. He went with you very willingly to shew you his lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it you found? - A Some plays.</p>
               <p>Q. Not in a place of concealment, as if he was conscious of stolen property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Cowthorne.) Had you given notice to these journeymen, that you would not allow this before these plays were worked off? - A. Yes. I had; I told them, if they had a claim to shew me by what authority, and it they had a right to them, I would give them with my own hands.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why did not you bring an action against him? - A. I was advised to indict him for felony.</p>
               <p>Court. If there is a pretence of right, that is all that we have to enquire into; to be sure, we are not to try a civil right by a criminal prosecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Cawthorne.) Q. When had you first issued these orders to the journeymen, that you would not allow the copy? - A. I suppose, nine or ten months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Two months after you commenced printer and bookseller, you must, by that time, have been perfectly acquainted with the customs of the trade? - A. I don't think I am now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Nor I neither.</p>

             sworn. - Q. I will not ask you, whether journeymen have a right to a copy, but did they ever claim a right? - A. I never had any such claim made in my house, nor I never heard of any, further than this, there was, some time ago, a case which Mr. Lane brought before my Lord-Mayor where some of his men did make a similar claim to this; but to prove that they were conscious that they had no such claim, when my Lord Mayor desired a meeting of masters and journeymen to decide the claim, they would not meet, and it has always been understood, that they had no such claim.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. You are a master, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS sworn. - Q. Did you ever hear of this claim? - A. Yes; I have certainly heard of such a claim, and I think I am bound to say, that numbers of the men think they have such a claim; in a civil court, I should explain the matter, but, here, I presume, I am only to answer questions; they have certainly some crude notion, which is totally unfounded; if every man was allowed to save a sheet, it would take away the whole of the printer's profit; it would amount to twenty pounds a week in my house; but there certainly is such a claim.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I think, Gentlemen of the Jury, there can be no occasion to go any further; at the same time, the acquittal of this man must not be understood to decide the right.</p>

             had told him to go for a pot of beer, and he would come to him, that was at a public-house in Golden-lane; we called for a pot of beer, and Bates thought it was the wrong house, and went out, and while he was gone, Goddard came, and I told him Bates was gone after him, and presently Bates came in, and told me he had got the money; he gave me a guinea into my hand, and paid for a pot of beer and a quartern of rum that he had at the bar; he said, he treated Goddard with a glass of rum, and that was a shilling; when I got out, he gave me two shillings and sixpence, and said, would that do? says I, you told me you had got fifty shillings, and you have only shared forty-nine shillings; and then he gave me another shilling, and said, d-n your eyes will that do? then we went straight away to Mrs. Robinson's, and had a pot of beer, and I paid Mrs. Robinson four shillings and seven-pence for beer that I had had in the week, and changed the guinea there.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Robinson.) Did the last witness change a guinea with you when he returned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was it he paid you? - A. Four shillings and seven-pence for beer that he had had in the week.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the business of Everitt? - A. I believe he is a lighterman and waterman by business, but he has worked with Bates for some time, as an iron chest maker.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer; on Monday the 28th of November, the prosecutor came to our office in Worship-street, and told me he had been robbed, and that he suspected the people that robbed him, and I and three other officers went to Ratcliff-lair, pretty near the public-house door, and there we saw the prisoner and Everitt together, we apprehended them, and took them to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Everitt.) How light was it in the court, at the time that you and Bates opened the door? - A. I cannot rightly say how it was in the court, I did not notice, but it was so dark in the room that we could not see any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see a man's face in the court? - A. Yes; I dare say I could.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the Friday night that this robbery was committed on the Saturday, I went, with Everitt to take home an iron book-case of fourteen hundred weight; Everitt was sent back, and when I came back to work I did not find him at work, but I went to Mrs. Robinson's, the public-house, and, as usual, he was there playing at shove-halfpenny, and I could not get him to work. The next morning I tried to get him to work, but could not. I told Mrs. Robinson to beg of him to come to work, that he would lose his place if he did not, and my young master came to call him; he knew very well that I could not go on with my work without him. In the afternoon, I was sitting with my father, and some man came in, and Everitt knocked the man's money out of his hands, and the man and he went to fighting; and I asked him again to go to work; and he said he had sprained his thumb, and could not; and then he went out a considerable time before me, we did not go out together; it is true he changed a guinea with Mrs. Robinson that he had received for his wages. I went out for a little while, and came back again to the public-house; I told Mrs. Robinson that I could not pay her, because I should not receive my money till Sunday. On Monday morning he called me to work, and I thought it was very strange, as I had always had to call him, for I never could get him to work; and he told me, that every body that was in Mrs. Robinson's tap-room on Saturday were going to be taken before a Justice; and I went to Mrs. Robinson's to ask her about it; when Mr. Harper apprehended me, they searched me, and found two shillings upon me, and very near a guinea upon him; I was taken before the Justice, and the Justice did not think I was the man that did it, and I was committed till the next day, and the next day I came down again to the Justices; I know nothing of the property; I had not even money to pay for the beer that I had had of Mrs. Robinson.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Robinson.) After Hewitt was gone from your house, did you see the prisoner and Everitt go out together? - A. I cannot say I saw them go, I missed them both; neither do I know whether they came back together, but Everitt brought me the guinea to change, and then I heard Bates's voice in the tap room; Mr. Hewitt had been gone about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, when I missed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110075"/>Q. Had they been at your house in the morning? - A. Yes; and their young master came to call them to go to work; they came about eight or nine o'clock, and went away about ten; they returned again about two, and staid till after Mr. Hewitt had left his key.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner applied to you to tell Everitt to go to his work, and not be so idle? - A. He certainly did, on the Friday evening.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- PARNELL sworn. - I am a clock-maker, and keep a house, No. 8, Taylor's-row, in the Pipe-field. The prisoner lodges in my house, he came to lodge with me about this time last year; I have only to say, that I have ever considered him as a hard-working honest man.</p>
               <p>Mrs. STEVENSON sworn. - I am a smith: The prisoner has worked with me about seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his character during, that time? - A. He never wronged me to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character? - A. I don't know any harm of him; he is a very hard working industrious man, losing a day now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character? - A. I never knew any thing ill of him till this happened.</p>

             sworn. - I live in the house in which the robbery was done, I know nothing of the robbery, I had heard a very indifferent account of the house before. On the day of the robbery, I heard the door burst open; I went down, and saw the skirt of a blue coat go in, I supposed it was Mr. Hewitt, I spoke to him but he made no answer; I sat down in my room, and, in ten or fifteen minutes, I heard the latch go, I ran to the top of the steps, and saw a man, in a blue coat, going by my window, with a bundle; and then Mr. Hewitt's daughter came in, and said, my father is gone out and left his door open; says I, he is in the room, for I saw him go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see more men than one? - A. No; he was rather a tallish man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see the colour of his coat? - A. Yes; he had a blue coat on. On the Monday afternoon, I came home, and saw a great mob; and when I came in, I saw two women big with child in my room, one of them was a woman that Everitt lives with.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not tell us what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Robinson.) How were they dressed when they were at your house? - A. They both had jackets on; Everitt's was a blue one, I cannot recollect what colour Bates's was.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Stevenson.) Had you paid them any wages on Saturday night? - A. No; I never saw them that night.</p>

Yes; on the 6th of December, Mr. Larkin came out of the country, and stopped at No. 5, Fenchurch-street, the coach was ordered to Mr. Bonnett's coach-maker, Prince's-street, Soho; Mr. Larkin desired me to go with the carriage, and gave me a note to Mr. Bonnett.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be with the carriage? - A. I was not his servant then, I was out of place; I had been in the country on my own business, and returning, I got behind the carriage; I had not been long behind, before Mr. Larkin stopped the carriage, and asked who I was, he knew my friends very well. they live at the place he came from; I was, at that time, a total stranger to him, when we came to Fenchurch-street, he desired me to go with the carriage, the trunk was strapped behind; being very tired, having walked thirty miles that day, I got into the carriage, I kept a sharp look out behind, through the glass, in the back of the coach, we came through Cheapside and <placeName id="t17970111-51-crimeloc305">St. Paul's-church-yard</placeName>

             immediately released the trunk from behind the carriage, and Pryer took hold of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this? - A. In St. Paul's-church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he release it? - A. It was strapped on with two leather straps, the straps were cut; they took hold of it, one on one side, and the other on the other side, and ran away with it; I stopped the coachman and opened the carriage door, and jumped out in pursuit of them, they made up Cheapside, towards the Mansion-house; when I came to Cheapside, I enquired of a man, if he had seen any body with a trunk, and he told me two men were gone along Cheapside with one, I then saw them, and immediately ran after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the same two men you had seen behind the carriage? - A. Yes; I catched

             fast by the coat, and asked him where he was going with the trunk, he replied, what was that to me; I told him it was to me, it was my property, at least it was in my care.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the trunk? - A. Both of them, they were together, going towards the Mansion-house, near Bread-street; they said, they would not deliver the trunk to me, they had picked it up; I told them, if they did not deliver the trunk, I would charge the watch with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. Nearly six o'clock, I called the watch, but there was no watch set, they asked me if I had the key of the trunk, or could tell the contents; I told them I could not, but had sufficient in my pocket to shew it was in my care, I had the note then in my pocket, they said they would not deliver the trunk up, I was a swindling fellow, and wanted to cheat them out of the property which they had found; we had a bit of a scuffle, they were going on, a gentleman advised me to take them to the Mansion-house; I begged of them to go with me to the Mansion-house, they said, they would go with me; I went on to the Mansion house, and rang the bell, a constable attended, and I told him there were two men who had taken a trunk from behind a carriage, and I produced the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the constable here? - A. Yes, I don't know his name; he advised me to give charge of the two men, which I immediately did, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110077"/>prisoners gave charge of me; they asked me, if I could swear that they were the two men that cut the trunk from behind the carriage; I told them, I was not going to tell them exactly what I was going to do; the two men were taken into custody, and I was taken into custody, till they sent for Mr. Larkin and Mr. Bonnett; I was rather flurried at the time, I might drop a few words that I don't recollect now, I might say, I could not swear to the men, I was quite confused, as the trunk was left in my care, I waited till ten o'clock, and Mr. Larkin came and released me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a wooden trunk? - A. Yes; covered with leather.</p>
               <p>Q. That trunk was Mr. Larkin's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you heavy, as if it was full? - A. Yes, quite full; it appeared very heavy by their carrying it; one man could not well carry it alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. - Q. Mr. Wisdom, I must have a few words with you; for these men have both friends and character - As soon as the gentleman was out of the carriage, you took the hint and took his place? - A. I was not desired to ride inside or out; I had walked from Malden that day, and from town the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Larkin desired you to take particular care of that trunk, to see it safe to the place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had condescended to go on the outside, the trunk could not have been taken away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You did not deliver that note to Mr. Bonnett? - A. No; I delivered it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You neglected the safer way, and got within side? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Through the back of the carriage, you saw all that passed? - A. Yes; I put back the pad, and saw through the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you look through? - A. All the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the faces of the men that ran after the carriage? - A. No; I took particular notice of their garments; one had a light drab coat, the other a blue or a black coat.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not light enough to discover the colour, was it? - A. It was lamp-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a rainy night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That gave you a better opportunity of seeing colours? - A. I think it did; the lamps gave a light, that the stones shone from the water.</p>
               <p>Q. This gave you a better opportunity of observing? - A. Not better, full as good.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not an opportunity of seeing their faces? - No, only the garments.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear, the two persons you saw in Cheapside, were the persons that took she trunk off in St. Paul's Church-yard? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. I will give you a caution; I have four witnesses to call, who will prove that you said the contrary - Did you not say to the Mansion-house constable, you could not swear that these were the men that you saw in St. Paul's Church-yard? - A. I did not tell him I could swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell him they were the two persons? - A. He did not ask me; it was the prisoner asked me if I could swear to them; I might say a few words; I was confused, having the trunk in my care, if it was lost, what might be the consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell my Lord, these were the two men that took the trunk? - A. Yes, I said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say so to the constable? - A. No; I did not say so to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you say so? - A. I told it to the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you tell the constable so or not? - A. I told the constable, when he opened the gate, here were two men who had taken a trunk from a carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the constable these were the two men that took the trunk - How came you to say you were so flurried, you could not swear they were the men - Was not Church, the constable, there? - A. I don't know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there another constable there of the name of Newsom? - A. I don't know either of their names.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at Church; is that the constable? - A. That is the man I delivered the note to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not that man ask you if you were certain these men were the persons that took the trunk; and whether you did not say they were the persons that had it in their custody, but you could not swear they took it? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said they were not the persons that took the trunk away? - A. I told him they were the persons that took the trunk from behind the carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was this? - A. Nearly six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up with these men, they asked you whether you could produce the key, or were the owner of the trunk, did they not? - A. They asked if I could produce the key, or knew the contents.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether they did not propose going to the Mansion-house? - A. No, they did not; they were not the first proposers of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they make any objection to taking the trunk to the Mansion-house? - A. No; they did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110078"/>Q. Did they ever attempt to leave the trunk, or run away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give charge of them to any body? A. No; the watch was not set.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask any body to assist you? - A. Yes; they made me out to be a swindler, and they would not take any notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. They might have let the trunk down and ran away? - A. No; they went to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the constable take you to the Compter? - A. They said, if the constable took charge of them, they must take charge of me; and if Mr. Larkin was a gentleman, they found the trunk, and supposed he would make them some recompence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you say at the Poultry Compter, that you could not say that these were the men that took the trunk away in St. Paul's Church-yard? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. At what pace was the carriage travelling, when you saw those men coming after it? - A. It was going on a jog trot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You know that man, Bamford; did you say before him, that you could not say these were the men that took the trunk from the carriage? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were particularly desired to take care of this trunk, and left the best care of it and got within side, you expected a great deal of anger if you did not find the persons that took it? - A. Certainly I did.</p>
               <p>Q. If you did not six upon somebody? - A. Mr. Larkin did not want me to six upon any person, if I did not save the property.(The trunk was produced by Henry Church.)</p>

             sworn. - I am gate porter at the Mansion-house, and a constable: On the 6th of December, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoners at the bar came to the Mansion-house, accompanied by Mr. Wisdom; he gave charge of them for cutting the trunk from behind the carriage; I asked him how it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in the hearing of the prisoners? - A. Yes; he said, going along St. Paul's Churchyard, he heard a noise behind the carriage; he looked through the glass, and saw some person or persons attempting to cut the trunk from behind the carriage; that he called to the driver to stop as soon as he could, and he could not make him stop till he broke one of the glasses in the front of the carriage; when he got out of the carriage the trunk was missing; that he went towards Cheapside full run in pursuit of them; that coming out of St. Paul's Church-yard, he met a gentleman; that the gentleman asked him what he was running for; that he told him he had lost a trunk from behind a carriage; that the gentleman told him he met two men in Cheapside with one, one hold of each handle; that somewhere about Bread-street he overtook them; he demanded the trunk; they refused to deliver it without he could produce the key, which he could not, and they came very quietly with him to the Mansion-house; I asked Mr. Wisdom if he could swear they were the men that cut the trunk from behind the carriage; he said, he could not, but they were the men he found it upon, therefore he gave charge of them; they went very quietly to the Compter; I asked Mr. Wisdom at the Compter, where the gentleman lived that belonged to the trunk; he could not tell me the name of the street; he told me he was a servant out of place, and he was sent to take care of this trunk; as he could not give a proper account of himself, the prisoners gave charge of him, and I took him into custody; I found out where Mr. Larkin was in town by the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wisdom give you the note? - A. Yes; I found him at Mr. Hankey's, in Fenchurch-street; the note was only a direction to the coach-maker for the coach to be repaired; Mr. Larkin came to the Lord-Mayor's, and released Wisdom out of the Compter that night.</p>

               <p>Cross-Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are in trust at the Mansion-house, and can have no interest in this business? - A. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Q. You are sure you asked him if he could swear they were the men that cut the trunk from behind the carriage, and he said he could not, but that he found it in their possession? - A. Yes; he said that two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the Compter when Bamford came there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Wisdom say in the presence of Bamford? - A. He said he could not swear to the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110079"/>Q. What did Wisdom say, respecting whether they were or were not the men that cut the trunk from the carriage? - A. He said, it was cut from the carriage by some body, he could not swear that they were the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you state the very words what he said relative to their being the men or not, that cut the trunk from the carriage? - A. He said, he could not swear they were the men, that he found the trunk upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Newsom by at the time this passed? - A. Yes; all of them.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners supoenaed you on their part as well as the prosecutor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Shepherd's defence. I was at work very hard all day; I can appeal to God for my innocence, and I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>Pryer's defence. I am innocent, but I wish to leave it to my Counsel.</p>

                        targets="t17970111-52-off308 t17970111-52-crimeloc311"/>, I was hustled by four or five persons, between five and six o'clock in the evening; and, in turning about to get away from them, I found the prisoner's hand in my right hand breeches pocket; I put my hand down, and caught hold of his wrist; I said to him, young man, your hand has no business in my pocket, and upon clapping my left hand to my right hand breeches pocket, I missed my money; and when I missed the money, I charged him with the theft, I seized his hand, but he immediately snatched his hand away, and gave me a blow in the face with the other; one of the party immediately took me by the throat, and shook me several times, and then the prisoner gave me another blow in the face again; directly he caught hold of one corner of my handkerchief, and one of his companions behind took hold of the other, and drew it across my throat; I cried out, murder, and that I was robbed; when I cried out murder, the person who before had hold of me, took me by the handkerchief, and shook me several times again, I cried out, murder, and the prisoner made use of these words, b-st your eyes, you b-r, if you were out, we would murder you; upon my crying out murder first, some persons came round, and desired us to come out of the crowd, and if he had robbed me, to settle it, and I got out of the crowd with him, and took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110081"/>Q. Had you ever lost sight of him? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose? - A. Two half-crowns and two shillings; when he was taken into custody, he said he had no more than one shilling, and upon searching his pocket we found two shillings and three halfpence, but the money I had lost was not found upon him; and if it had I could not have sworn to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I caution you first, that that young man has as good a character as you can have. - You saw that lad in the entrance to the Play-house; was that the first time that you saw him? - A. No; I saw him in Fleet-street, a little above Shoe-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you force yourself, and endeavour to obtrude yourself, into his company? - A. I did not; in crossing Fleet-street, one of them came up, and said, where are you going; I said, what is it to you.</p>
               <p>Q. There are two other persons here, who were present? - A. I know there are, I have seen them; and I can swear to one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober enough to observe all that passed? - A. I had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not very drunk? - A. I don't know the meaning of the word very drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That you will swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you will swear it twenty times? - A. Yes; because when a person understands what he is about, he cannot be very drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you were very drunk? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not so drunk as to insult many people in the course of your going along? - A. I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. I will give you one instance of it; did not you run away with several play-bills from the poor women, throwing up a halfpenny, and then getting hold of the bill, and running away without paying them? - A. No; one girl, against Fetter-lane, came up to me, and I gave her a halfpenny; and another, and I gave her a halfpenny; and another play bill was offered me and I gave nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not do that in more instances than one? - A. No; it was through Temple-bar that the last bill was offered.</p>
               <p>Q. Near the Theatre, did not you? - A. No; the girl said, a bill of the play; and I took hold of it, and I walked away. - But if I did, that is no reason that I should be robbed and ill-treated afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that this matter happened? - A. In the passage leading to the Theatre.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it when you had got considerably forward in the passage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not, at that time, a very great, and a very close crowd? - A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not such a crowd, that several people were forced to hold up their hats, and could not get down their hands, on account of the pressure of the crowd? - A. There were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a word at Bow-street about your being hustled? - A. I did mention the person's hand being in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell us now, that going into the Playhouse you were hustled by about four or five people; I ask you whether, in your examination at Bow-street, you said a word about being hustled? - A. I think I did; I ought to have done it whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went immediately before the Magistrates at Bow-street, did you say a word about being hustled? - A. I believe I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. They committed him then, not for a highway robbery, as you have charged it, but merely for stealing from you so much money? - A. I have not charged it as a highway robbery, but the clerk of the indictments.</p>
               <p>Q. What difference does that make, do you know; I have heard of such a thing as a reward of forty pounds? - A. I have not the least doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Q. And had not you, upon your oath, heard of a reward? - A. I have heard of such a reward, but not so perfectly as to think of getting it.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost two half-crowns and two shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all the money you set out with in the morning? - A. No; I let out with three halfcrowns, and three shillings, in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you set out in the morning? - A. I set out, at first, at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been skaiting? - A. No, I had not, although I had the skaits in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. I will put you in mind of a remark some persons made as you were going in: do you recollect that your skaits in your pocket incommoded some people, and they complained of it? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they ask you what had you to do with skaits, you are not steady enough to skait? - A. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody told you you had no business with skaits, you were too drunk to skait? - A. I heard no such thing; people there might hear more than I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the people there tell you you were too drunk to have any thing to do with skaits? - A. I will be upon my oath that I did not hear any such thing; there was a person there said my skaits hurt them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not any body tell you you were too drunk to skait? - A. I can swear that I did not; hear any such thing, I might be listening to other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you another thing; upon your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110082"/>oath, don't you know that boy was so incommoded by the crowd as to be obliged to hold up his hat above the crowd, and was unable to put down his hands? - A. Not to my knowledge; I know that his hands were not so pressed but that, at the time they were down, they slipped into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When this young man was searched, what was found upon him? - A. There was one shilling he pulled out, that he said his master gave him to go to the play; but upon searching him, they found two shillings and sixpence upon him besides, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no half-crown at all found upon him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not half so stout as you? - A. No; but there were four or five in company.</p>
               <p>Q. You had hold of his wrist? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you really were not at all drunk at that time? - A. I had been drinking; but I cannot answer that question unless you will be so good as explain the word.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public-houses had you been in? - A. Only one.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been there? - A. Four hours.</p>
               <p>Q. In company? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of your companions there? - A. No companions, but using the house; the landlord, in the morning, asked me to partake of some beef, which is customary the day after Christmas-day; after that was done, they said we must have some drink.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might that be? - A. Between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Till what time? - A. Till about twenty minutes past four.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say you had been drinking till twenty minutes past four? - A. I cannot say so much; I know what I paid; I gave the landlord half-a-crown, and he took for four pints of beer, and two three pences, towards the liquor that had been drank; then I paid him, after that, I think it was nine-pence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink as your own share? - A. I drank in my turn, I cannot say how much.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there? - Q. Different people came in at different times, that used the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You sat it the whole time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And were your sober? - A. Yes; I was so sober as to know what I was about; and I went along without molesting any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Which play house was it? - A. Covent-Garden, against the passage from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Under cover, was not it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that this lad's hand was actually in your pocket? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sober enough to know that? - A. Yes, I was, perfectly.</p>

               <p>Q. You are sure it was beyond Temple-bar? - A. Yes; then we went in at the play-house door, out of Bow-street, and there was a terrible crowd, and he took hold of my hand, and said, let us keep all together, for I love good company as I love my life; I had a bottle of ale in my pocket, and Richard Thompson's boy had another, and I told him, he should be welcome to have a part of that; we were going into the one shilling gallery, and just as the door was opening, Palmer said, his pocket was picked of half a-crown; a gentleman asked, who was it, and he said, it was that young man, the prisoner, and he said, he could swear to the money; a gentleman that was standing by, said, young fellow, it is a hard thing to swear to money, you might swear to the person that has robbed you, and then he said, he lost half-a crown and 2s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at all, at that time, pretend that he had caught that young lad's hand in his pocket? - A. No, he did not; he took hold of him, and collared him, and told him he should go along with him; he did not lay a word about his having his hand in his pocket; the prisoner said, as you have deprived me of my night's giverssion, I will go along with you, and see myself righted, and then they took hold of one another's collars; then Palmer ooted the prisoner, but he would not loose Palmer, me would go with him to see himself righted; then the mob shoved us I on further, till we had go to a place on the right-hand side, where the soldiers.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110084"/>were, and then they got hold of one another's collars again, and Palmer made his complaint to the serjeant, and the prisoner made his complaint; the serjeant said he would have nothing at all to do with it, says he, go and sight it out, and lick him well, if he has charged you falsely; then his brother said, as he is so obstinate, let us go up, or else we shall not get a seat, and we left them to go and sight it out by themselves, we had no idea that any thing more would come of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your master here? - A. No; he would have been here, but he is a constable, and is obliged to attend the sessions at Horsemonger-lane, in the Borough; when we were in the crowd, Palmer had a pair of skaits in his pocket, and the people cried out that they hurt them, and stuck into their sides.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any particular expression made use of by any of the mob, about his skaits? - A. Yes; they d-n him, and swore about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing further about it? - A. Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner, as you were going in, was before, or behind, or at the side of you? - A. He was behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all turn round to see what situation he was in? - A. Yes; he was holding his hat up, and I did the same, because they should not be squeezed or rumpled.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you were at the play-house, and the prisoner was charged with robbing this young man, did he strike him? - A. No; but Palmer struck the prisoner's brother, and made his nose bleed; every body then spoke on the prisoner's side, and not a soul spoke for this young fellow.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Palmer.) Q. Do you know the young man? - A. I can hardly say; he seems differently dressed now.</p>
               <p>Drake. I was dressed exactly as I am now; I have not other cloaths to put on; they are what I work in.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Palmer.) Q. You joined company with four of them in Fleet-street? - A. Yes; I heard them speaking about

To my knowledge he is a very honest lad; he has been in my house several weeks; this circumstance happened on the Monday, and the reason that he was not bailed till Thursday was, that the Magistrate who committed him was not upon the bench again till the Thursday, and therefore he could not be bailed before; the are both very hones lads; they are twins.</p>
