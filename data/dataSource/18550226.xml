                  </hi>. I live at No. 15, Patriot-row, Cambridge-road, Bethnal-green. I am foreman to Messrs. Rock, wholesale manufac<lb/>turing stationers in Walbrook—Mr. Henry Rock is one of the partners, the prisoners were in their employ—Hyland was an apprentice, in the leather<lb/>case making branch—Withers, I should term a labourer; it was his duty to work at a cutting machine, and other odd work—on Friday night, 26th Jan., two sample books containing valentines were given into my possession by Mr. Henry Rock; I took them into the shop on the top floor at half past 7 o'clock, and laid them on a bench at which Hyland was at work—there were about thirty or forty specimens in each book—on the Saturday morning at half past 11 o'clock, I gave those books to Mr. Gordon, the managing man down stairs in the warehouse; he instantly missed five of the valentines, and pointed it out to me; I was with him at the time, they</p>

               <p>were worth at a rough guess, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they were a superior kind of valentine—I made some inquiries and spoke to Mr. Rock, who came into the shop, and called all hands together employed on the top floor; the two prisoners were among them—Mr. Rock then addressed the whole of us; holding the books in his hand, he stated that five valentines were stolen from these books, that they had been removed since the previous evening; he then said there was a thief among us, and would we assist him in finding it out—we all answered him, "Yes"—he then asked us to allow ourselves to be searched, which we agreed to—there were about thirty of us, some were boys—Mr. Rock directed me to examine the clothes of the boys, and while I was doing so, the witness Caroline Cray accused Hyland of having taken the valentines—I heard Mr. Rock say, "Come, Miss Cray, if you know who it is that has taken the valentines out of the books, tell me;" that was said in the prisoner's presence—she then came forward and said, "Hyland, took them out, Sir"—Mr. Rock turned round to Hyland, who was standing close by his side, and said, "Hyland, I thought you always an honest youth"—Hyland said, "Yes, Sir; I have taken one of them; I took it home last evening, this is the only time I have taken anything"—Mr. Rock then desired me and Hyland to follow him down stairs, into the counting-house—Hyland then said, "Withers has taken them out, as well as me"—Withers was not present then, he was sent for directly afterwards, and came to the counting-house—Mr. Rock said to him, "I hear, Withers, that you are concerned also in stealing these valentines"—Withers replied, "I was looking at the books and accidentally tore one of them, not with the intention of removing it to steal it, and I throw the parts of it in a waste shavings bin"—that is where the shavings are put from the cutting machine, where Withers was at work—an officer arrived that Mr. Rock had sent for, and the prisoners were both given into custody—after they were taken to the station, I accompanied Wardle the officer, to No. 5, Mape-street, Bethnal-green, the address given by Hyland at the station house; and the mother of Hyland gave us three valentines, those were three of the five that had been removed from the books—the address that Withers gave was No. 14, Griffin-street, York-road, Lambeth—I found that he had left there a fortnight—we ascertained his right address from the lady keeping that house, and went to No. 3, Boss-court, Thames-street—the key of a bed-room door was taken from Withers by the officer—that key opened a bed-room on the second floor of the house, No. 3, Boss-court, which was shown to us by the landlady as Withers' room—we there found a number of prints, I think about 100—I did not find any valentines.</p>

On Friday, 26th Jan., I was in the top shop—I saw the two Valentine books there—I saw Withers tear a valentine from one of the books, and throw it into a shaving bin behind him—it was done so quickly that I could not see the whole of it—he was working near the book—Hyland was standing at his side at the time—he could see what he did; he was near enough to see—Withers was working near the book; so was I—at the same time I saw Hyland cut a valentine from the book with the scissors—he did not leave the shop after cutting it out; he remained there—I do not know what he did with the valentine—I mentioned it to Miss Cray.</p>

I told them both to leave my shop—they went outside together—I said I would follow them—I shut my shop door and went out at my side entrance—the prisoners were standing together at the public house at the corner—I watched them, and they went from there to Mr. Bourne's, an oilman's—Watson stood outside, and Willis went in—I went into the shop, and went through the shop into the parlour—I saw that Willis had a bottle of pickles in his hand—I went out at the side entrance, and saw Willis leave the shop, and he joined Watson—they went up the street in conversation till they got to Mr. Britnell's, the butcher's; Willis went in there, and Watson stood outside—I did not go in; I went for a policeman, and both the prisoners were given into custody.</p>

"—I said, "I wish you could prove your words"—he said, "I don't call yours a butcher's cart, I call it a dog cart"—I do not recollect anything else—I asked him about the Derby, certainly, that was at an after part, after we had spoken about the other; I had asked him to come on purpose—I began to speak to him about it immediately, not the first thing, in the course of conversation—I asked him which he thought was the horse likely to win the Derby; he said, at the present time he had no particular favourite, and he asked me what I thought—I told him that I thought the—was a very good horse, and very likely to win it—I do not recollect any further conversation about the Derby—the infor<lb/>mation he gave me was not very extensive—I have told you pretty well all that occurred—there was other conversation, no doubt, but I do not remem<lb/>ber the particulars of it.</p>

               <p>I considered it only a joke, that was the very reason I took him up, to ascertain what he meant by it—I did not know whether it was a joke or not—it was impossible for me to tell how he meant it—I did not want then to ascertain about the Derby, it was to ascertain about those words—I took him up into my cart to learn that—it was a mere accident my seeing him afterwards coming out of the Angel—I did not say anything to him the first time in the cart about the words—I thought if it was said in anything more than a joke of course he would have mentioned it to me—I did not ask him—I spoke to him again when he came out of the Angel—I pulled up, he walked towards the cart, and I asked him if he was going that way—he said, "Yes," and he got up and rode—I offered him the ride, as I said before, to ascertain the particulars of what he had said—I asked him of course, if he had been to the Angel—I knew he had been to the Angel—I asked him what his business was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What had those mysterious words to do with his going to the Angel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think they had all to do with it—I asked him what his business was at the Angel—he said he wanted to see Mr. Busk, on particular busi<lb/>ness—I do not know what business it was of mine to ask him—of course it was to find out the meaning, if there was any, in the words, "You will hear from me legally to-morrow"—I should say the Angel had something to do with those words—he said he had been to see Mr. Busk—he did not say that till I asked him—I asked him what his business was at the Angel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the brother of William Stanley, and live with my father and brother at Edmonton. On Saturday, 30th Dec, I was in my cart, and met the prisoner in the lane—I did not know him before; he stopped me, and asked if I had seen his father—I asked who his father was—he said, "Risley"—I told him yes, I had seen his father—at that time my brother was lying at home ill in bed, and had been since the Thursday, when he was brought home from London in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; he had had a fit—he asked me if his father had said anything to me—I said he had—he asked me if my brother was at home—I said, yes, he was at home, and ill in bed—he said, "Yes, and so he ought to be"—I said, "Why make such a remark as that?"—he then told me that my brother had tried to commit a capital offence upon him; he said his reputation and feelings were very much hurt; he had been to Mr. Busk, and Mr. Busk was not at home—I said, "What charge have you against my brother? you had better come down"—he said, "No; unless I have compensation before Monday, I shall go to Mr. Busk again"—I saw the prisoner's father on the following Wednesday—I made an arrangement with him on the Tuesday, to meet me by the Angel on Wednesday evening, at 7 o'clock—I went there on Wednesday, at 7 o'clock, and there met the prisoner and his father; I said to them, "Well, this is an affair we cannot talk about in the street, we had better go down to my brother's office"—the prisoner said, "No, I have had one trap laid there for me, I don't have a second"—we then walked up the street, and I met my uncle; in fact, I had sent for him, and he joined us—I then said to the prisoner, "Well, young man, what is this you charge my brother with?" (this was in Silver-street, in presence of my uncle and the prisoner's father)—he said, "I make no charge against him"—I then asked him if he was in London with my brother on the previous Thursday—he said, "No"—I asked him a second time, and he said accidentally he went up by the same omnibus—I then asked him what he charged my brother with, opposite Mr. Bax's—he said, "This is not a legal place to discuss such matters as these;" he said his father had given him a liberal and good education; and he said, "Your family is lineally descended from the noble family of the Earl of Derby, of the highest respectability, and a rich family; what is 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to you, or your family, to settle a matter like this? I have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket, as well as you have"—he then said, "Come along, father;" and as he left, he said, "You will hear from me legally by the 8th of next month"—I turned round to any uncle, and said, "Did you ever hear such a villain?"—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Record and Writ Office in the Court of Chancery. I know the prisoner by sight—on 1st Feb., I received this paper from him at the Record and Writ office—it purports to be an affidavit in the suit of Drew and Drew—according to the practice of the office, if a person wants an office copy of an affidavit, he brings a copy of the affidavit, which is left with me for the purpose of being compared with the original, which is filed and left in our office—this was left for that purpose; and after it has been examined and found to be a correct copy, there is a mark put on it to certify that it is correct—it is done by a seal stamp—when a copy is brought in the way the prisoner brought this, there are fees payable; 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for every seventy-two words—these fourpences are received by adhesive stamps on the papers—these stamps are not always affixed when the affidavit is brought—sometimes they bring them without the stamps—they can get them in the office close by, but they must be affixed before the affidavit can be examined—here are eighteen stamps on this copy of the affidavit—it was in the same state when the prisoner gave it me, with these stamps on it—he brought it a short time before the office closed, between half past 3 and 4 o'clock—it was getting towards dark—immediately on receiving it I looked out the original, and gave both the original and the copy to our stationer in the office, Mr. Warwick, to compare them—on the following morning he brought it to me, and drew my attention to the stamps—I then noticed that two of them had got an impression of an obliterator on them—several of the others appear to have passed the obliterator, but I could not swear that it was my obliterator—we obliterate these stamps before we give the copy out—the two that I can recognise my obliterator on, are the fifth and the sixth—some of the others appear to have been obliterated, but I could not swear it was by my obliterator—some of them have not been obliterated at all—there are about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of good ones, and about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of obliterated ones—I am certain they have been obliterated, but I cannot swear it was by my own instrument.</p>

I have been engaged as solicitor for all the defendants in the suit of Drew against Drew—the prisoner was one of those defendants—I did not prepare this affidavit in Feb. 1854—I did not know of the filing of this affidavit till a short time ago—it was not filed in the ordinary course of business—it was premature—I have never given directions for obtaining an office copy—I did not know of the defendant going to obtain an office copy—I wrote him a letter a few days before, stating that I should require a copy, if he had not already obtained one—I said, as he was the person who had filed the affidavit, he was the most proper person to get the office copy of it—I had nothing what<lb/>ever to do with preparing this affidavit—1 never saw the prisoner write—I have had many letters from him, which I have no doubt were his writing—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260045"/>
               <p>I have seen him on the subject of those letters—I believe this affidavit to be his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were the solicitor for all the defendants in Drew and Drew? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it is a family dispute—I think there were six defendants—it was filed in Feb., 1854—there is a good deal of ill feeling between the plaintiff and his brothers and sisters—this defendant, being a solicitor's clerk, I did not allow him to take most of the steps in the cause himself; decidedly not—I think I was correct in saying that he, having filed the affidavit, was the most proper person to get an office copy of it—I am not aware that the defendant advanced any money.</p>

I was at home on Sunday, 14th Jan.—my mother, my husband, my daughter, and my little children, were in the house—there were two lodgers, but they went out in the course of the morning, about 10 o'clock, or half-past—I was up stairs most of the time, between 10 and 1 o'clock—we dined about half-past 1 o'clock—I came down several times, once while my husband was standing, with the door in his hand, to let the policeman out—I asked what was the matter, and he said that the policeman had just gone into the taproom—Morgan was in the cellar, doing something to the pipes—no beer was drawn after 10 o'clock that morning—twenty-three people could not have been in the house without my knowing it—during the whole morning I saw nobody but my own family and the policeman—we had no servant there; she left on the Tuesday before—I let nobody in or out.</p>

               <p>Church-street, Bethnal Green, just opposite the Royal Oak beer shop—I was in Mr. Knight's service up to 16th Jan., as servant of all work—on Sunday, 14th Jan., after 10 o'clock, I was standing at the side door (the front door faces the top of Turville-street)—it is a corner house—I was standing there to let people in and out, and I did so—I remained standing there till about 11 o'clock—I cannot exactly tell how many people I let in, but about twenty—they were strangers; customers—I let some out—at 11 o'clock I was sent with Mr. Knight's child to its aunt's, a few doors off—while I left, the daughter, Lucy Knight, took charge of the side door—I was going back, and saw the policeman on the other side of the way; they call him Mr. Hall—he was in uniform—I did not go back, because the door was shut when the policeman was in the street—I knew that that was to be so—before I went out with the child, I had seen the policeman through the crack of the front door, for, as near as I can guess, above five minutes, and he moved away from the corner, and went round Nicholl-street, which would take him into Charlotte-court—he could still see the side door there—when I came back, after leaving the child, he was still against Charlotte-court—he had a view of the side door—I went up to my mother's, but before that I saw the daughter go in and shut the door—I looked through my mother's window, and saw the policeman knocking at the side door—I still kept looking, and Mr. Knight came up to the door, knocked at the door, and they let him in, and the policeman went in at the same time—I had seen Mr. Knight before that, he was in the street—he went into the street to watch for the police—he always used to go out on Sunday mornings to watch for the police—he had told me that morning to mind the door, to watch and see that I did not let any police in—I am certain that I saw Mr. Knight go up to the door, and that he was let in; it was not Mr. Knight who let the policeman in—I had seen the beer engine before I went out with the child; it was all right, as far as I know, and not taken to pieces—I know Morgan by sight as a customer—I did not see him there that morning, nor in the cellar; there could not be any one there; it was all in darkness—there is gas in the cellar, but it was not lighted that morning—the entrance is just by the side door, and I must have moved away, to let anybody go down by the flaps into the cellar—I could see from there if the gas was alight, because it would shine through the boards—at the time I went out to take the child, there were about twenty people in the house, as far as I could tell—they had been drinking there—I did not let any of them out before I went—I do not know where they put them to, when the policeman went up to the door—supposing people are put into the cellar, they can get through the cellar to the next door—I have seen that done—there was once a mode of getting through from the attic also—I mean it was done once—it is not true, that I was dismissed for stealing from my master: if he has said so, it is not true; nor was it for dishonesty—he made no charge of any kind against me, at the time I left—I went there at a moment's notice, and left at a few hours' notice—I went to my mother's, and went to work for Mr. Barrington four weeks afterwards—Mr. Knight knew I was there—he asked me last night if I was coming up here, he said, "Ann, are you going up to-morrow?"—I said, "Going up to-morrow, Mr. Knight? no"—he said that he had heard I was, and if I could not agree with the daughter, what did I want to injure him and Mrs. Knight for—I had not quarrelled with the daughter, but she did not seem to like me while I was there—he said, "If you do go up, it will be the worse for</p>

I recollect Sunday, 14th Jan., quite well—I remember looking out at my window, about 11 o'clock, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner right opposite, in uniform, very attentively watching the beer shop—he remained there I dare say twenty minutes, as near as I can tell—he then went round Nicholl-street, and round to the back out of Charlotte-court—he could see the side door from there—while he was there, about twenty people came out of the side door of the public house—I did not count them—they came out one at a time, as if somebody was standing at the door passing them; and then there would be a pause, and then three or four more would come, and sometimes five or six at a time—I saw the con<lb/>stable at that time looking down from the court, and I said, "The constable can see them"—my attention was afterwards drawn to a paragraph in a newspaper by one of my workmen, and I thought of the day in question directly, because I thought I would notice whether the policeman sum<lb/>moned the man for it; I went to the Leman-street station to make it known, because I knew that the policeman was innocent—I was taken to an attorney's clerk, who took down my statement—I do not suppose I have spoken half a dozen words to Mr. Knight in my life—I have seen people go out of the attics—I saw them on the tiles, getting from one roof to another, when I came out of the water closet one day—I have seen people going from his house to the next house—I have no interest in this matter; I went up voluntarily—I never had a quarrel with Mr. Knight.</p>

                  </hi>. Esq. I have an estate at Clay-hill, in the pariah of Enfield—the chapel in question is in that parish, and on those grounds—it is my property; it is used as a chapel, and in my occupation—I believe it was originally an outhouse, attached to a former residence, which has since been pulled down—it stands upon the land, in grounds attached to my own house, about 200 yards from my dwelling house—there is a path leading direct to it from my dwelling house—it has been used for the pur<lb/>poses of divine worship for the last four or five years, up to the Sunday before the fire, according to the rites of the Established Church, the Vicar Minding his curate to perform the service every Sunday down to the Sunday before the fire—on the day of the Census the congregation consisted of 110 persons; the average attendance is from 70 to 80—the parish church is two miles off—I fitted up the chapel with open seats, a pulpit, and reading desk—there is no communion table; the communion is not administered there—the building is not consecrated, or licensed; it was put to the Bishop whether it was necessary, and he considered it was not—the arrangement has the sanction of the Bishop of London—the Vicar has officiated there—it is open to anybody; there is no payment for sittings; the doors are open during the whole time of divine worship (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAM</hi>. <hi rend="italic">expressed tome doubt whether a chapel of this description, neither licensed nor consecrated, came within the statute; and if it became necessary would consult the Judges on the subject</hi>)—there was a charcoal stove, it stood in the centre of the chapel—it had no chimney to it; we burnt prepared charcoal, therefore there was no effluvia from it; it stood upon stone—it was always lighted on the Sun<lb/>day morning—the fire happened on a Friday; there had been no use made of the chapel since the previous Sunday—I know the prisoner; he was in my service for about three year; he left last Sept.; I discharged him—there had been a fire on my farm buildings a week before I discharged him—he had been taken into custody, and was discharged by the Magistrate—on Friday, 26th Jan., about 10 minutes to 7 o'clock in the evening, I was about to leave my house, when an alarm of fire was given—I immediately proceeded to the chapel, which I heard was on fire—(<hi rend="italic">referring to a plan</hi>) I went by this path, which leads direct to the chapel; it goes by the side of the orchard, and comes up to the back of the chapel—the flames were coming out of the windows; the whole building was in flames—I observed footmarks in the snow—I think I was then immediately in front of the chapel—the letter E upon the plan does not represent where I was; I stood a little further forward, towards the road—a pathway had been swept, and I stood in the swept part of the path—there was snow on each side the path. about three inches deep—the footmarks that I saw were leading directly up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260064"/>
               <p>towards the door of the chapel—the pathway was swept between the chapel and where I was standing; the footmarks ended where the snow ended—they were in a direction from the wall towards the chapel door; they were the footmarks of one person—I traced them as close as the snow permitted; the toes of the footmarks were towards the chapel, and also turned the other way, as going back again; there were two lines; the width of the swept path in front of the chapel was about two feet, I should say—the footmarks did not come within two feet of the chapel; the walk is about eight feet wide in front of the chapel; they came up to the end, and there was a line of footmarks returning in the opposite direction—they were the same foot. marks—there is a shrubbery in front of the chapel, extending down to this gate, on the plan—on seeing the footmarks, I walked by the side of them as far as I could on the path, and then I walked also on the snow towards the wall, until I could see over the wall, and saw some persons standing on the other side of the wall—I did not go quite so far as the wall; it is ten feet high from the road; it is not so high on the inside as the ground is raised—I traced the footmarks into the shrubbery; I went partly into the shrub<lb/>bery; the wall I speak of is in front of the chapel, next to the road, including that part of the shrubbery—I did not at that time pursue the marks further that way—I did not notice whether there was snow in the shrubbery until a few days afterwards—I was about five minutes in going from my house to the fire after the alarm was given me—I did not see any person there—I desired a person named Blendall to see that nobody trod upon the foot<lb/>marks, so that they should not be interfered with—I gave directions for the prisoner to be taken into custody—a policeman came, and I desired him to ascertain where he was, and to bring him there if possible—he was brought there in about ten minutes; it might have been more; his boots were taken off by the policeman by my direction, and in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a pair of boots produced by Davis, the policeman</hi>) these are the boots—at this time several persons had assembled on the spot; Mr. Heath, the vicar, was not there at that moment, he came up afterwards—Mr. Esdell was there very early—I saw the policeman compare the prisoner's boots with the footmarks—he took the boots and pressed them into the snow, by the side of three of the footmarks, and they appeared to correspond exactly—there were about a dozen footmarks I should say, but he made new impressions by the side of three of them—the boots are rights and lefts, and so were the footmarks—upon observing that they agreed, I desired the policeman to drop the boots into the three prints; he dropped them lightly in, and they were found to fit; that was only into three, and after the impressions had been made by the side, he left the other impressions untouched—I then observed, "Do not let it rest on my testimony, or on the testimony of the police;" and I asked the Vicar and Mr. Esdell to judge—on Saturday last, I set some workmen to clear out the chapel, and they discovered a hassock, or the remains of one—I was not there at the time—they placed it in the position where they found it, under the staircase, leading up to a gallery; it had been burnt, and was very nearly destroyed—that was not where hassocks are ordinarily kept—Walker is the person who showed me the hassock—the windows of the chapel are within three feet of the ground—the pri<lb/>soner had the care of the chapel for the last year he was in my service, up to the time of his discharge; it was his duty to sweep it out, and light the candles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What time was it when you first heard of the fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten minutes before 7 o'clock, I think; I was going out to dinner,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260065"/>
               <p>and my carriage was at the door—I had ordered it to be at the door at a quarter to 7 o'clock—I was in my drawing-room, preparing to step into my carriage, when I was told of the fire—Alsop told me of it; he rushed into the room, and said the chapel was on fire—I went into my room and put on a pair of India-rubber shoes, put on my cloak, put Mrs. Bosanquet into the carriage; she was going out to dine; and then I immediately walked to the fire—I think it could not have been above five minutes; it may possibly have been more—I went up the long walk by the stables, through the rose walk, and then to the front of the chapel; I rather think I walked round the chapel—when I got there, the flames were coming out of the top windows—I did not go very near the building, because it was dangerous to do so; I went within about three or four yards of it—I then went in front of the building, and seeing the footmarks, I traced them towards the wall—I went on the footpath as far as it would lead me, and then I went on the snow towards the wall—I fancy there were about twelve footmarks in the snow when I saw them, between the chapel and the shrubbery, as far as I traced them—I did not trace them up to the wall; I should think I traced them for about twenty yards, or not so much; fifteen' I should say—I had not been up that way when I came from London—I think I might have been there five minutes before anybody came; I cannot be quite sure as to the time—I walked round, and I walked up and down the swept walk; how long that consumed I do not know—it appears that I met Blendall in the rose walk—I fancied that he had come across the park, and come close up to the chapel; I do not recollect exactly where I first saw him—the rose walk is part of the walk leading from my house to the chapel—when I first saw Blendall, I said to him, "Blendall, there are foot-marks leading towards the chapel, watch them, and see that nobody goes across them"—I cannot say when I came away whether anybody –did interfere with them or not—when I returned to the spot, a gentleman had got over a low fence at the side, and was coming across the footmarks; he was coming towards the footpath, and I called out to him to keep off—he did not come over the wall—I think I was able to stop him from coming across the foot marks—I desired him to go back immediately—he seemed so bent upon coming on the place where the marks were, that I am afraid I was rather rude to him, in desiring him to retire—I did not tell him not to touch the fire; I said nothing about the fire that I am aware of—I do not know the boots produced; I am not aware that I ever saw them, except upon your feet—they are the same sort of boots that I wear, but whether I ever wore them, I really cannot say—no; I think I can say certainly not, from the nails—they are precisely the same sort of boots that I wear, except the nails—I will not say that they may not be an old pair of mine—I never had such nails in my boots—something must have been done to them since I left them off—I could not observe any impression of the nails in the snow—as far as I could see, both before and after the boots were put into the impressions, there was no impression of nails at all; the snow would not take the impression—I am sure that before the boot was put into the footmark, an impression was first made by the side of three of the footmarks—some of the footmarks were more distinct than others—the three that were the most distinct, were the three that were first compared—I think Mr. Esdell had seen them before the boots were put in, and the policeman must have seen them, because he had the boots in his hand—I did not take them myself—they were dropped in very cautiously—I cannot say whether the nails would mark; I can only say that I did not observe</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260066"/>
               <p>any marks of nails in the snow—I am quite sure that I saw no marks of nails either before or after the boots were fitted—I went away from the fire before the policeman came to me—I went away to search for somebody, and left Blendall to watch—the policeman came up after Blendall and I were standing in front of the chapel—I first went away from the chapel, met Blendall, and we returned together to the chapel, and the policeman then came up to us—I was very careful in standing on the part of the path that was swept; I never left that; I walked backwards and forwards towards my house several times, but was very careful not to go on the snow, except on the first occasion, when I traced the footmarks towards the wall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Then it seems to me, that when you first went to the fire you made your way round the chapel, and went across the snow to the road to see if you could Bee anybody, and then came back and could not tell your own footsteps. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I cannot agree to that—I am quite sure that I had not been on the place where these marks were—I should doubt whether my toe would go in the footmark—I have got on now the identical slippers that I put on over my dress shoes, and this is the boot I had on at the time (<hi rend="italic">the witness handed them to the Jury, who compared them with the prisoner' shots</hi>)—I am not aware that you were dishonest while in my service—I never found you intoxicated on my grounds, but I have found you intoxicated off them—I was quite satisfied with you as long as you were in my service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The first thing you did, as I gather, was to go along the rose walk, and to go round the chapel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Whether I went on the walk in front first, or round the chapel, I cannot say, but I did go round the chapel—in doing so I kept on the path—the path was not swept ail round—I think I went all round—the part not swept was totally distinct and separate from the place where the footmarks were—I have no doubt whatever that I did not go on the part were the three steps were, but when I got near the shrubbery I was obliged to go on to the snow, because it was not swept there—I could hardly have been gone three minutes before I returned with Blendall—I told him to watch the footmarks, and then I think I went away again for two or three minutes in search of a policeman—I then returned, and waited till the policeman came up—the footmarks were exactly in the same state as when I first saw them, and so they were when the prisoners boots were taken off to compare with them—the first thing that was done was to make an impression with the boot alongside of one of the impressions—I could not see any mark of the nails in the impression then made by the prisoner's boot, merely the outline—I do not think I was more than five minutes after receiving the alarm before I got to the fire—the nature of the communication would hasten me a little.</p>

               <p>D on the plan, would be able to get to where I saw the footmarks, by coming through the shrubbery, and along the side of the fence—some time afterwards I found a footmark there, but I am not positive to its being the same footmark, it looked like it—there was no snow for about twelve or thirteen yards, from the chapel up to the gate—I traced the footmarks nearly as for as the snow went, but a great many persons got over the wall afterwards and obliterated them—when Mr. Bosanquet first pointed the footmarks out to me, I traced them within about eighteen inches of the wall; I went no further than that, at that time—there were two tracks of footsteps, one track leading from the wall and fence up to the chapel, and one going back again—Mr. Bosanquet desired me to take the prisoner into custody; I went towards his house, which is next to the Rose and Crown, and met him coming up towards the fire—I told him, I wanted him to go with me—he said, "What for?"—I said, Mr. Bosanquet wished to speak to him—he said, "Oh, very well, I will go, then"—a few minutes after he said, "Mind, this is not the first time you served me this way, not you, but others; but this will not pass off so easily"—I had said nothing to him before he said that, beyond telling him that Mr. Bosanquet wanted him; I bad not told him for what Mr. Bosanquet wanted to speak to him—we walked together up to the fire—when we got to the stable gate, marked F on the plan, the prisoner stopped suddenly and said, "I have been ordered not to go on to these premises"—I told him he could go with me, and the other constable; I then continued my walk up to the chapel, with him; we went through the stable gate, and through Mr. Bosanquet's grounds, through the shrubberies, down the footpath, and up to the back of the chapel, the chapel was burning at that time—I found Mr. Bosan<lb/>quet there, Mr. Esdell and Blendall—the Rev. Mr. Heath, the Vicar, came up soon after—I proceeded to take off the prisoner's boots—we were under a tree, fifteen or eighteen yards from the chapel at the side of it—neither I nor the prisoner had gone upon the part, where I saw the footmarks—it appeared to me that the footmarks were then in the same state, as when I had seen them before; just the one line to and fro—I first tried the left boot in one of the footmarks, and found it was exactly the same shape and length—I then tried the right boot with another mark, and I then made four or five impressions close by those, with the boots; I made those impres<lb/>sions about five, six, or seven inches away from the others; so as to be away from the line—I made those impressions opposite to the marks that I had not tried, as well as opposite to the marks that I had tried, they appeared to me to correspond in all respects—Mr. Esdell had an oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing them as I made them, and so had the Vicar after he came up—I went there again three or four hours afterwards, and again in the morning about a quarter or half past 8 o'clock—a good many persons had been there by that time, but I did not notice any fresh marks along that line of footmarks with which I compared the prisoner's boots—I then com<lb/>pared them again carefully by daylight, and they exactly corresponded—I did not examine them with the boots then—the outer part of the heel of the boot is worn away more than the inner part, and the inner part made a deeper impression; and the upper leather bulges and leaves a mark—I noticed that in the footmarks where the snow was deepish, it just left the exact impression as those that I made with the boots—that was the case with the heel of both boots—I did not notice that at the time I made the impressions, but next morning—that was the case with the whole of the impressions, those that I had not interfered with as well as the others</p>

I reside in a cottage at Enfield, about sixty yards down the road from Mr. Bosanquet's chapel, and on the other side of the way; it is nearly opposite a gate and entrance leading into Mr. Bosanquet's premises. I remember the night of the fire—the boy Walsh came to my cottage and asked me for a lucifer fur a gentleman—I had not got any in the house—he then left—I told my daughter to screw a bit of paper up and take a light outside—she did so, and went outside, but could not see any one—she came back again with the paper in her hand—about two minutes afterwards the prisoner came in, and asked me if I would let him light his pipe; I did so—he lighted his pipe—I asked him where he was going to—he said he was going up to Mrs. Ramsay's—she lives up the road, on the same side of the way as my cottage—he was only at my cottage just while he lighted his pipe, he then left—after he was gone, I told my daughter to go out and see which way he had gone—she returned, and said something to me, in consequence of which I afterwards went to the door and looked out—I looked both up and down the road, but did not sec any one—I looked up towards Mrs. Ramsay's—I did not see any one there—I could see as far</p>

I am a labouring man, and live at Clay-hill, Enfield On the evening of the fire, I met the prisoner as I was going home—he was going towards his own home—he had a barrow with three boxes on it—it wanted about 20 minutes to 7 o'clock—I stopped and spoke to him—I was asking him what the young woman was leaving her situation for, and he said, "Listen at the fireworks," and I saw the sparks from the fire up above the trees, and heard the crackling of the fire—I passed him, and went on towards the chapel, and saw it on fire—he was about 150 yards past the chapel when I met him—I had not stood with him above two or three minutes when he said this—he was stopping to rest himself with the barrow—this was about 100 yards from his house—I saw him start on towards his own home with the barrow and boxes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, living at Enfield. I saw the prisoner on the evening of the fire, about thirty yards this side the Rose and Crown, near his own house—he had a barrow with him—I could see the fire—I asked him where the fire was—he said he did not know—I said, "You must know"—he made no answer—I said, "It must be Mr. Short's house"—he said, "I know it is not; the fire is twenty miles off."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What time was it when you met me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half past 6 o'clock—you said nothing to me: I spoke—when I said, "It must be Mr. Short's house," you did not say, "No; if it was we should see it more plainly"—you said it was twenty miles off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> On Friday, 26th Jan. last, about the hour of 3 in the afternoon, I went into the Fallow Buck with Mr. Page, Mr. Bosanquet's carpenter; I saw Mr. Mann, and said to him, "You have not had your geranium plants which I promised you, but you shall have them this after<lb/>noon if you will go down with me;" he did not go with me; I went down alone, and got them ready; I went up again, and found he had left; I lighted my pipe there, and went home again; on my way my pipe went out; I shortly afterwards met a little boy, by Mr. Walker's house, who was walking from school; I said to him, "Have you such a thing as a lucifer?" he replied, "No;" I asked him would he be so kind as to go to the house and beg one for me; he then went in, and said, "Who shall I say it is for?" I said, "Oh, tell them a gentleman wants it to light his pipe;" he knocked at the door, and went in, but could not get one; he then came back, and said he was going by the Fallow Buck; I, not giving it a thought, said, "Will you get me one there?" we were walking together towards the Fallow Buck a few yards; I then left him, and went into Mr. Walker's, and asked him to let me light my pipe, and oblige me with a piece of stick or wire to clean my pipe out; I lighted my pipe, and walked out; he asked me where I was going; I said, "To Mrs. Ramsay's," but I did not tell him when; when I came out I went in the direction of Mrs. Ramsay's house, and down the narrow road into a field, to ease nature; from there I went into Mr. Short's field, and came out by the side of his new house, and straight home; when there I looked at the clock, and saw it was half past 5 o'clock; I sat down then till nearly 6 o'clock, when I got up, and took a wheelbarrow, and proceeded to Mrs. Ramsay's; on my way I saw Walker at his gate, who bade me good night; I replied in the same way, and went to Mrs. Ramsay's; as I got into the coach yard, I passed the coachman; I rang the bell, and Miss Branderd came to me accompanied by Thrussell; they gave me three boxes, which the latter assisted me in loading, and placing in the barrow; he then took hold of the barrow, and said, "It is very heavy, you will have enough to do to get down the hill with it;" before starting I received orders from Miss Branderd to take the boxes to her sister-in-law; it was then 25 minutes past 6 o'clock; I met Mrs. Blendall between Mr. Bosanquet's gate and the chapel; I bid her good night; she bid me good night, and she said, "Oh, it is you, George! I did not know you;" I said, "My load is heavy, and the road is very slippery;" proceeding about 100 yards, I met Henry Watson coming home from work, I suppose; I said to him, "Well, Henry, how are you getting on?" he replied, "I don't know; a few more words passed, when I said, "Listen at the fireworks, the squibs and crackers are being let off;" as there had been some let off the night before, in the way the chapel was; a few more words passed, and we parted; I then went to Mrs. Branderd's; in my way I met a man named Taylor, who said to me, "It is Mr. Short's house on fire;" I said, "No, if it was, we could see it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260074"/>
               <p>more plainly;" I then said again, "If it is a fire, it is twenty miles off;" I unloaded the boxes from the barrow at Mrs. Branderd's, where I went directly after leaving Taylor, and left them with her; after a few words, I took the barrow and went home; when I got home, my father told me it was Mr. Bosanquet's chapel on fire; after setting up the barrow, I went out to see the fire, and on my way I met two policemen; one said, "Oh, here you are! where have you been the last two hours?" I answered, "At home, to be sure;" one said, "You must come with us to Mr. Bosanquet's;" I said, "What for?" he said, "He wants to speak to you;" I replied, "Very well, I will go, then;" I also said, "This is the second time you have served me like this; not you, but others, and it shall not be passed over as the first;" the reason I made chose remarks was, that a sheep shed, by some means, had been on fire before, when, for certain circumstances, I was led to think that Mr. Bosanquet suspected myself and the coachman of knowing something about it; when we got up to the gate, I refused to go further, as Mr. Bosanquet had desired me not to come any more upon his premises; the policeman said, "He will not say anything, because you come with me;" I then went on my way to the chapel; I met Mr. Bosanquet on the walk leading to the chapel; Mr. Bosanquet asked, "Who have you got here?" the policeman said, "George North;" Mr. Bosanquet turned back, and we all proceeded towards the chapel; when there I was asked to pull off one of my boots, and I did so; he told me to go and sit on the seat, which I did, which was under a chesnut tree; they took the boot, and compared it with the footmarks; they after<lb/>wards came back, and gave it to the second policeman, who was left with me; then my other shoe was taken, and compared with the footmarks in the snow, and whilst doing it, the latter policeman said to me, "These nails are very remarkable;" Mr. Bosanquet and the others afterwards came back, and I was told by Mr. Bosanquet's charge that I was taken into custody on suspi<lb/>cion of setting fire to his chapel; I put on my boots, and walked back with them to the station house, and they locked me up.</p>

I went away from my home, at No. 8, St. James's-place, Wapping, about 4 o'clock, or a few minutes after—about half past 9 o'clock that night I was at Mr. Braggart's, the India Arms, in Trinity-street, Rotherhithe—I left that public house a few minutes before 10 o'clock, when it was time for the man to close his door—I never was on the Middlesex side of the water after ten minutes past 4 o'clock that day—I went through the Thames-tunnel at ten minutes past 4—I never crossed the water at all that day—I never saw this prisoner in my life till he came to the police court at Green<lb/>wich—he appeared as a witness against me—they called the man that took the persons over the water, and he came in—I had never seen him before—I did not go over in his boat that night—I never went over from those stairs in my life, nor yet <hi rend="italic">no</hi> other, only against the Tunnel and in the Tunnel.</p>

On Sunday, 14th Jan., I was the waterman ferrying from Limehouse-stairs across to the Surrey side, till a few minutes after 10 o'clock, when I came to the other shore and gave up my place to Campion—I waited there, I suppose, half an hour—these persons, that were supposed to go over the water, were on the stair head when I gave it up—they were all together—I saw a man and a woman go over—I could not swear to that man and woman—they were two of that party—when the boat was pushed off I was standing on the top of the stairs, leaning against the iron bar—I could distinctly see who went over—it was only a few steps—there were two and the waterman in the boat—I do not know Robinson—the persons appeared by their talk to be in liquor—nothing was said to me by any of them, because I was not against the boat—I did not see any one tumble into the water—I saw a man that had been overboard walk up the stairs—I persuaded him to take his clothes off, and to get home—I thought he had had enough to drink—I saw Ashdown—he took the gentleman over that came up the stairs, the gentleman that had been in the water—he went down to go in my boat, but he would not go with them—he stepped over Campion's boat into another.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, residing at Greenford. On Thurs-day, 1st Feb., I was at the White Star public house there, to pay the taxes—I saw the prisoner there in the early part of the evening, the latest time I saw him was about 6 o'clock—it is about half a mile from where I live—I left as near 9 o'clock as possible; I went straight home; I had got to my gate, and the prisoner or some other party sprang out on me in the snow, put his hand at the back part of my neck, and the other round my wais—he found he could not throw me in that way, and he tripped me up and I fell—he then put one hand over my mouth, and the other in the pocket where my purse was, but I think he tried the other one first—I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a canvas bag when I left the public house, he got that away—the prisoner is like him, but he had a sort of handkerchief over the lower part of his face up to his eyes, and he would not speak a word—I have known the prisoner, and heard him speak frequently—I think I should have known his voice, if I had heard it—the handkerchief over his face prevents my swearing to him positively—I had my hands engaged in keep<lb/>ing my pockets; his finger accidentally came into my mouth, and I bit it; severely I thought—he went through the gate, and turned in the direction of his own home across the field.</p>

               <p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260093"/>
               <p>—the man did not go along any public path, he went through a gate which was standing open, into the field—that gate is ten or twelve yards from mine—he went towards Cawson's-lane—I mean to represent that that is in a direction from my house to his—it is not the other way—his father's house is on one side of the road, and Wilson's farm on the other—he went towards Wilson's farm, and his own house too.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the rector of Greenford. I received information of this robbery on Thursday, 1st Feb., as near as I can guess, about half past 9 o'clock—I immediately went out with my gun to the gate leading into the prosecutor's premises, and traced footsteps from there towards Cawson's-lane, for about three quarters of a mile, across the fields—there were no other footsteps about—they went into Cawson's-lane, and from there I traced them to a footpath, and could trace them no further—that footpath leads into the village, almost direct to Hunt's house—they led to several fences, which had been got over, and I traced them up to this lane—I did not trace them up to a wall—I informed a policeman of where I had lost the track—that was less than a quarter of a mile from the prisoner's house—there was a place at Mr. Woodman's gate where the snow had been trampled down, about twice the size of this table, as if there had been a scuffle; and a little beyond that the snow was trampled down, as if a man had been standing behind, the hedge—the footmarks in the snow were quite recent, and not at the ordinary distance, but very long steps, as of a man running—Mr. Wilson's is just opposite the prisoner's house.</p>

On the night in question, about half past 9 o'clock, I was near the Rectory gates, and heard a person cry, "Murder!" several times—the sound proceeded from down the road leading towards Harrow, in the direction in which the prosecutor iives—his gate is about 200 yards down the lane—I went down, and, just before I got to the gate, Mr. Woodman came up, and said that he had been robbed—I went to his gate, and had some conversation with him—he said that the person went over Bennett's field gate—I traced footsteps in Bennett's field—they went through the field for some distance, and then through a hedge, and towards Cow-lane—I traced them up to Cawson's-lane, and afterwards informed Mr. Middleton.</p>

               <p>from the prosecutor's gate to Cawson's-lane, and round to our house, would be about a mile altogether—there was no footpath in the direction in which the prisoner was coming—he was going fast—he got out of the field by breaking down a fence and getting over the hedge into the paddock—there is no footpath there—he had no business there—I said, "You are trespas<lb/>sing," and he crouched down, and went in a stooping position to the wall—I then went to another window, and saw him near the wall on the same side—I did not see him get over the wall, but there was only an interval of a second between my seeing him on each side of it—he could not go round the wall; there was no way but by getting over—I afterwards saw him go to his father's house, which is opposite ours—the field where I saw him is at the back of our house—a person could come from Cawson's-lane by crossing that field—that would be the shortest way—I saw no other person about that night—I could not see as far as Cawson's-lane; it was a very light night, but the distance prevented me—the moon was very nearly full.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Patrick Mahoney; we live at No. 1, Gilbert's-alley, Stratford. The prisoner is my husband's brother's son—on 10th Sept. I left home at a quarter before 1 o'clock—I locked up the house when I went out—I returned about a quarter before 5 o'clock; I then found that our two doors had been broken in by force—the front door first, and when I went up stairs, I found my own room door broken open—that had been locked—I went into my son's room first—his name is James; he is over 19—I missed his suit of clothes—I looked into my own room—the door was smashed, and everything taken away—a pair of new boots, and a silk handkerchief of mine, and all my husband's clothes were taken away, and I picked up this handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), belonging to the prisoner, close to my bed—I know it to be the prisoner's handkerchief—I had seen it in his hand several times—he did not live in our house, but he was in the habit of coming in—I have never washed or hemmed it for him—I saw the clothes that I had missed, at Stratford, to-morrow fortnight—I received some dupli<lb/>cates by post after the house was broken open—I do not know the prisoner's writing, but I received four duplicates three weeks or a month after the robbery; I gave them to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of Robert-street, Plumstead. On Saturday, 4th Feb., I applied to the last witness for a bed—I took out some half crowns, showed them to her, and put them into this pocket—she refused to give me a bed, because of the state I was in—I had had a slip down, and was not quite sober—the prisoner Welch came up while I was speaking to her, and said, "I will take you to a bed," and I went with him—he wanted me to give him my watch, but I would not—he took me to a house, and I saw the female prisoner there—she went up stairs first with a light, and Welch went next, taking hold of me, and then he shut the door—no con<lb/>versation took place between me and the female prisoner—I was not asked a question—they knocked me down across the bed, with my legs hanging down, and my body on the bed—I was stunned; and as near as I can guess a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw Richards go down stairs—she came back in about three minutes—they then both came and stood together, and I got up, missed my watch and money, and asked them both for my watch and chain—they both said that they had not got them—I went to the door, saw a policeman, and made a charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUGHSTOCK</hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Lewisham. I was called to attend Lawrence on Sunday, 14th Jan., between 1 and 2 o'clock—he was wounded in the right arm and right thigh, with small shot—in the arm the shots were scattered to a wide extent, from the middle of the arm to the shoulder—there were about half a dozen or eight shots in the back of the thigh—the wounds were likely to be dangerous secondarily, as erysipelas might come on; but not primarily—he went on well till the 20th, then symptoms of inflammation and erysipelas came on; but he is now out of danger—I saw Adams about two days after—he was wounded, but the shots were more scattered—they must have been wounded from behind, and I should think the gun had been higher than the men—the shots in Lawrence's thigh were evidently caused by his being kneeling—the wounds were from the feet to the head—Lawrence's shots extended to the bone in the arm—they were so deep that I could not extract one of them—Adams's wounds were very superficial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and appraiser, and live at No. 68, Beresford-street, Walworth—I was introduced to the prisoner for the first time in the middle of Aug., for the purpose of selling some property belonging to him at Kingsland—I put up the whole of the property for sale in Oct.; the property was less than the mortgage on it by about two-thirds—it was bought in—the Minerva Life Office was one of the mortgagees—I after wards received instructions from the Minerva office to sell it for the best price I could get, by private contract—I proceeded to do so by public advertisements in the best manner I could—the largest offer I got was 2550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the mean time the prisoner left the neighbourhood, and was not to be found or heard of—I made many inquiries for him—I think he left about a month before Christmas; the sale was effected in Dec. after he left—the Minerva, office sent me a letter that they would accept of this offer, and the sale was completed in Dec.—I did not see any more of the prisoner till the 19th of Feb., when he came into my kitchen—about half-past 10 o'clock in the morning of that day, he presented himself in my kitchen—I said, "Good morning, Mr. Cleary; I am glad to see you; walk in; take a seat and sit down"—he walked in in front of my table, where I had home papers—I had asked him in, and shut the door, and we were alone together—he walked up to the table where I was sitting—he said, "I have come to ask you a few questions relative to the property you have sold"—I said, "If you will take a neat, and not talk too fast, I will give you an answer to any question you ask me"—he said, "Why did not you make 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. More of that property?" I told him I could not—he said, "You might have done so if you had liked"—I said, "You have done me a great deal of injustice to represent to Mr. Watson that I could have made 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more of this property"—(Mr. Watson is one of the directors who had lent him the money, and he is the solicitor for the Minerva company)—I made an observation that I had acted very straightforward in every matter in submitting to him the proposala of my clients, and I was about to say, "The longest day of my life I will never serve you again," and he put his right hand to the left breast pocket of his coat, and from that pocket he took a pistol; he presented the pistol towards my chest—I should think he was not more than three feet from me; within three feet, across the table—I stood up, and threw my arms up as high as I could hold them—I shifted to the front of a recess s—there is a broad shelf in the place, between the fireplace and the wall next the window—I shifted myself towards the square corner of the room next the window—he shifted his aim of the pistol towards me, and I heard the report of the pistol—immediately the first pistol was fired, I turned to run to go to the door to go out, but before I could hardly turn round, he immediately drew a second pistol from the same pocket, presented the pisto at me, and made the observation, "I have got another one ready for you; I will do for you"—I sprang round, and threw the door open, and ran up the front entrance; the kitchen opens into the front entrance which</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Coppin, a wood chopper, and reside at No. 8, Seven-step-alley, Rotherhithe. On Saturday night, 16th Dec., between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was in the Admiral Hawke public house, which is kept by the prisoner—the deceased, Le Compt, came in after I was there—my husband was there, and two or three other persons—the deceased was not drunk—I do not believe he was quite sober, for he had been drink<lb/>ing—he did not use any indecent or improper language—he was not offen<lb/>sive—he did not insult any one in my hearing—he was making a sort of noise, going, "<hi rend="italic">we we, die away, chirrup, chirrup</hi>"—with the exception of that foolish sort of noise he was not saying anything rude—the landlady and her daughter were behind the bar—I saw the prisoner come out from behind the bar into the bar—the deceased was winking his eye, and Mr. Wilton said, if he kept winking his eye at him, he would knock his two eyes into one, that he should not see for a month—the deceased made no reply—he kept winking his eye, and Mr. Wilton told him to go out—Mrs. Wilton had told him that she would not have her customers insulted—I had not heard him insult any one—he told her to go to heaven, and if she did not like that she was to go to Hackney—when Mr. Wilton told him to go out he came round directly, took the glass out of the deceased's hand that he was drinking out of, and gave it to another person who was standing at the bar; took him by the two shoulders, and shoved him backwards, till he got within a little space of the door, which was partly open, and then he shoved him backward through the doorway, down the steps—it was the doorway leading into Salisbury-street—there are three steps to that doorway, and a large flagstone, which rises higher than the other pavement—one of the steps is stone, the two top ones are of wood—the prisoner seemed to shove the de<lb/>ceased down the steps with all the strength that he had—I went and lifted</p>

               <p>the deceased's head up—he was bleeding very much indeed—he was inset<lb/>sible; he was lying on his back, with his head on the pavement, and his feet inside the door—I saw the prisoner kick his feet twice before he could kick them off the step—it seemed to me as if that was done to shove his feet of the top step, so as he could shut the door—he did close the door afterwards—I told him it was a very brutal thing, and if it came to any justice I would appear against him—he directly told me if I did not go out, he would serve me in the same way, and I went out—I heard nothing said by the deceased about fighting—I went and fetched his daughter, and she came and sent for her mother.</p>

Wilton, you have almost killed the man"—he turned round or his heels, and said, "Let him die, I will not have my wife insulted."</p>

I was called in to see the deceased on Saturday, 16th Dec., about five minutes past 10 o'clock at night, at his residence, No. 4, Wells-street, Bermondsey, which leads out of Salisbury-street—I found him suffering from a lacerated contused wound on the right side of the head, between the temple and the occipital bone, occupying the lower portion of the parietal bone—it was about two inches long—there had been considerable hemorrhage, but that was arrested by a coagulum, or clot of blood, forming a natural stoppage—I did not take any remedial means at that time—I advised him to be removed to Guy's Hospital, and I believe he was admitted there at 2 o'clock in the morning—I saw him next on 18th Jan.—he was then in bed at his own house—it was about 11 o'clock in the morning—the contusion had then taken an unfavourable turn; it had suppurated, and gangrene and mortification had ensued—he died from an abscess of the brain, connected with that mortified wound on the right side of the head—I have no doubt whatever of the cause of death; he died from the effects of the wound produced by the fall—I took down a declaration which he made on the Monday preceding his death, which was on Friday, 26th Jan.—he was then in great danger—he was aware that he was not going to recover, he told me so—he began to make a statement respecting the transaction, and the manner in which it occurred, and I asked him if he wished to say anything that I should take down—he said, "Yes," and he</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's daughter. I knew the deceased by sight—I never saw him at our house but twice or three times—on the night in question I was in the bar, serving with my mother—the deceased came in between 9 and 10 o'clock, with two men—he was not sober when he came in—I think his companions were—I do not know whether he or his companions called for something to drink, but Le Compt paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—</p>

               <p>they had a pot of stout—he began to annoy the customers, and was leaning on the bar, and my mother said to him, "Mister," (she did not know his name,) "I cannot have you annoy my customers"—he was pressing his con<lb/>versation upon them—my mother asked him to lean off the bar—he was leaning over the bar, and gnashing his teeth in her face; and he said, "Who are you? What business has a d——thing like you in the bar? Go to hell; that is the best place for you. I will put you in the Queen's Bench;" and he gnashed his teeth in a most spiteful manner in her face—my father then came into the bar through the private parlour, and said, "My good fellow, I can't have my wife insulted; you must leave the house"—he said, "I shan't go till I like"—my father said, "Do not be silly, take my advice and go"—he said, "No, I will not go"—my father then went round to the door, and opened it, to look for a policeman—not seeing one, he came back again and said, "My good fellow, do as I wish you, go"—he said, "No, I shall not go till I like"—my father again asked him several times to go; he said, "No," he would not—my father then took the glass out of his hand—I cannot say whether he put it on the bar, or whether another party took it from him and set it on the bar—the deceased then put his hand on my father's shoulder, and said, "Then, if I go, by Christ you shall go with me;" and he seized my father by the handkerchief, and dragged him to the door—the door was partly open, and my father put his right hand up to the side of the door—his left arm was lame, from a broken collar bone—he only had that hand at liberty then, heaving the other one to save him from falling over the man—my father's left hand was on the door and his right hand on the door post, and I saw no more until my father turned round, and his waistcoat was unbuttoned, (he wore a waistcoat buttoned to the throat,) and his Watch was hanging out of his pocket—I did not see the accident—my father had not the use of his left arm.</p>

The prisoner and his wife live in the same house—on 11th Feb. the prisoner was a little the worse for liquor—I heard him fighting his wife in the morning, about ten minutes after 10 o'clock—in the afternoon, about 2 or 3 o'clock, I saw her going up stairs, away from her husband, towards Davies's room—the prisoner was following her, threatening her—I went behind him, and saw a knife in his hand—he was holding it towards her, and said that he would hare her life—I saw Davies get between them—he told the prisoner to be quiet, and sit down and have a drop of tea—afterwards Davies was sitting on a chair, smoking a pipe by the fire<lb/>place—the prisoner asked him for a pipe of tobacco—Davies said that he had not got one—a scuffle ensued—he struck Davies on the eye—Davies took his jacket off, turned his sleeves up, gave him a push, and shoved his back through the window; then Evans threw Davies on the bed, and Davies got him by the collar, and then I saw a knife in his hand—he took it from the bread basket, which was on the foot of the bed where Davies was lying, and stuck it into Davies's arm three times—when I saw the blood run I sent for a policeman—the prisoner knew what he was about perfectly When this happened—I was with the prisoner and his wife from 10 o'clock till the end of it—they were quarrelling all the time—he wanted a razor in the morning, and asked his wife for it—she told him she did not know where it was, and then he found it—it was about a quarter of an hour before the prisoner asked Davies for the tobacco that Davies gave the knife to the prisoner's wife—he did not stab Davies while Davies was defending the prisoner's wife.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 85). I was called, and found Davis bleeding from the right arm—Evans was given into my custody—I found him up stairs, the worse for liquor, but he perfectly knew what he was about—on the way to the station he said that he did not do it, it was done through his falling through the window—I received this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Davies.</p>
