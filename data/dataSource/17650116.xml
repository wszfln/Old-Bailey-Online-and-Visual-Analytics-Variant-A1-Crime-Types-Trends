I went to him, and asked him if that horse was to be sold? he said, yes. I took hold of the bridle, and led him into the George-yard; I asked the price; he told me eight guineas, or eight pounds; Mr. Austin said to him, Get down, friend: I took him by the sleeve, brought him into the inn, and sent for a constable: I said it was my horse, and asked him, how he could do so? he said he had not stole him, but bought him in the Borough, that morning.</p>

            . Mr. Allwin came to me the morning the gelding was missing, and desired I would go with him to London: we came to Smithfield together; we saw the prisoner on his gelding; he asked the price of him; the prisoner said eight guineas. When we asked him how he came by the gelding, he said he had swapped a little poney for him, in the Borough, that morning: we asked him at what house; he said it was in the street: we asked him where he lived; he said somewhere in Essex, and that he had lived at Queenhithe; and at this time, he said, he lived in London, sometimes in one place and sometimes in another: I knew the horse, from the foal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I came out of the country a little time before, and put my horse up in the Borough: I seeing a man with this horse, and another man talking to him about the horse, I said I would swap with him; his horse and mine were both put up at the George there, near St. Margaret's-hill; I observed, by his tail being tied up, that he was to be sold; I changed mine for the gelding: I had lain at the Saracen's-head, on Snow-hill, the night before, and my horse was there also. The man that I changed with told me he lived at Epsom: I brought him to Smithfield, intending to sell him in the afternoon, and this gentleman told me it was his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witnesses to this?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have the ostler at the Saracen's-head sent for?</p>

            . My husband is named Christopher, he and I had a few words about two months ago, and I went to a neighbour's house, name Mrs. White; the prisoner lodged there: I staid all night: she persuaded me to come to bed to her, rather than sit up in a chair all night; so I went to bed to her: I had my ring on my finger when I went to bed, and in the morning it was gone: the prisoner was taken up, and before Justice Welch she owned she had taken it, and pawned it to Mr. Humphreys; it was sent for to the justice's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphreys. The prisoner at the bar brought this ring to me on the 9th of November, to pawn; she said it was her own ring: I lent her three shillings upon it, (produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I picked up the ring on the stair-head: the prosecutrix came in very drunk, and went out again for a dram; and when she came back she had lost her cloak from off her shoulders.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. She took the ring from my finger.</p>

I agreed to give him 5 s. and a pair of red shag breeches; but said he must bring me some body of credit, to prove what he had said, or I would go with him to his brother; he then began to hesitate, and wanted to have the things again: I could not leave my shop, but sent my brother with him, who returned, and gave me room to suspect they were stole.

I staid there till almost one o'clock: when I was coming away, I said I was going into the city; the prisoner and the other offered their service to go along with me: one said, he lived in the city, by Fenchurch street; and the other said he lived in Filpot-lane, and had an uncle there: we walked down Bunhill-row, talking about this knack of the pewter dish, and other things, till we came to Chiswell-street: when we came to the end which opens into <placeName id="t17650116-12-crimeloc64">Moorfields</placeName>

We walked talking in the fields, till we came about the middle of the walk; when, all on a sudden, with a most violent motion, I was knocked down, and one of them lay upon me, while the other drew my watch (a metal watch) out of my pocket, and my hat from my head: I can't pretend to say which lay on me, or which took my watch and hat; but I am sure no creature was near me, but them two.</p>

               <p>Williams. I never saw him before that night, to my knowledge. I went the next morning to that alehouse, but the landlord was not up; so I went away, and came there again, about twelve o'clock. I enquired of the landlord, if he knew them two men that went out with me last night; he told me he had seen them but a few times in his house, but he said he knew a man that knew them very well, and directed me to him. By that man, I found the prisoner lived by Old-street-square, and the other likewise: I went and found the prisoner at the sign of the Angler, just by Old-street-square: I got a constable, and charged him with the prisoner; I sent for a coach to the house, in order to carry him to New Prison, for the constable's security, till I could be heard before a magistrate.

               <p>Q. Had you shut the shop door when you went into the parlour?</p>
               <p>Theircher. It was shut: the prisoner was just turning round the counter as I came in, from towards the till, which is behind the counter, I went behind the counter, and found the till drawer pulled quite open. I looked, and saw I had lost two half guineas and a guinea; I went to the street door, and desired a neighbour to follow the boy, saying he had robbed my till.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person you saw in your shop?</p>
               <p>Theircher. I am very sure he is: he had a blue coat on, and a handkerchief about his neck; he was taken immediately, and brought back to my shop. I charged him with robbing me: he said he had never robbed any body. I said he had robbed me: he had half a guinea in his mouth, another half guinea in one pocket, and a guinea in another pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise to let him go, if he would give up the money?</p>
               <p>Theircher. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the money before?</p>
               <p>Theircher. I had seen it but a very few minutes before in the till.</p>

               <p>Q. to A. Manlove. Did you smell at the prisoner's hands?</p>
               <p>A. Manlove. I did; they did not smell of salmon; but I saw him drop the salmon, and I picked it up, and carried it back afterwards; he had it in his left hand.</p>

A little after that the prisoner and I went into the coffee-room, to drink a little rum and water together; I then said to him, suppose this is not accepted at Liverpool: he said it was a good bill, and would be accepted; upon which, I imagined it would, and proposed giving it to Mr. Hanford, as before. Then Mr. Wright came into the room, an utter stranger to me: I was told he came from Hull; I asked him if he was brother to the Wrights of Nottingham; he said he was; they are gentlemen I well know. The prisoner went out of the coffee-room; he clap'd his hand on his head, and appeared to be sick, and said he would go and take the fresh air: I went to Mr. Wright, and asked him how he did; upon his saying he knew the prisoner not to be so good as he should be; saying, he had forged several bills; upon which I shewed him this bill: he looked on it, and told me it was a forged bill; then I did not think proper to send it to Liverpool: since that I gave it to Mr. Wright, to present to the drawers.</p>

The intrinsic value of them was not above 3 s. more than he gave for them: they were very coarse sappy stuff.</p>

               <p>Q. What day did he abscond?</p>
               <p>S. Burford. He absconded the 7th of December, and gave no notice when he went away: my husband found him, the day after he broke the door open, in Little Queen-street, and brought him home. The prisoner then said he had pawned the two sauce-pans, one sheet, and the flat irons, at one pawnbroker's, in Belton-street; and the woman that he lived with, had pawned another in Denmark-street: the things were found accordingly.</p>

            . On a Friday, five weeks ago, tomorrow, I met the prisoner between the hours of twelve and one in the day, (this was two days after the house was broke open) in Norton-falgate, he had a brass kettle, covered over with a flag basket; I saw only the rim of it; it was the size and shape of her kettle; I had lived with the prosecutrix fifteen years, and she had told me of the robbery the day before; I know her kettle very well. I asked the prisoner if he had got his mistress's kettle, saying she had lost her kettle: said he, I live with a coppersmith, in Bishopsgate-street: he asked me when I should be at the Coach and Horses? he said he should be there in half an hour; and that he often carried kettles and things, 200 weight. He came to the Coach and Horses to me; we had some beer: he said, he could not get a coachman's place, on account of his character; so he got to be a porter, and had 15 l. a year, at this copper-smith's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice, when he was examined?</p>
               <p>West. I was. There he was asked whether he lived with a copper-smith? his answer was, he lived here and there, and every where; sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another. On his second examination, the day before Christmas-day, I was there: then he said, he did not keep an almanack in his head. He was asked how he came by that kettle that I saw him with? then he said he bought it on the main road: he was asked what he did with it? he said, he sold it to a Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Have you found any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix, No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. He was <rs id="t17650116-23-deflabel128" type="occupation">servant</rs>

Turner used to come to our house, at times; we suspected her; she was taken up, and she confessed she had taken them, and in what manner she had sold them; this was last Monday: she said the other prisoner took the things of her, as she gave them to her out at the window.</p>

            . I live in Golden-lane; the prisoner, Turner, sold this tub to me: she brought flocks, at three several times, and linnen and woolen rags: I buy old rags, old iron, and old cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not bring you sheets?</p>
               <p>E. Mason. Upon my oath she did not: she brought nothing but rags.</p>

               <p>E. Mason. There was; they came as rags, and went as rags.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for the tub?</p>
               <p>E. Mason. I gave a groat for it.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Heath. These things are not what I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mason. What do you mean by bringing that parcal here?</p>
               <p>E. Mason. These are the same things that the prisoner brought to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring a flock bed to you?</p>
               <p>E. Mason. She brought a tick, with some flocks in it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Heath. She has brought 40 lb. of flocks, and mine weighed but twenty; these are not mine: mine were as white as snow; these are dirty things.</p>

After that, I was taken upon Saltpetre-bank, and committed to prison: I could not find my own things, and there were these, so I took them instead of my own: they are not half the value of mine.</p>

               <p>West. There is a sash of glass runs down at the end of the window; I keep the shop open generally till eleven at night.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>West. I am a hosier and haberdasher: these were part of the handkerchiefs found upon Gammon, (nine in number produced). I can swear to all of them, but particularly one of them.</p>

               <p>William Hill. I am a butcher, and live in Chiswell-street. I know Davis very well; he came to my house, and asked my wife, if she would drink a draught of purl? I was at home; he asked me to drink also: then he asked Imer and Gammon to come up into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Hill. This was Christmas-eve, about 7 o'clock. I sat with my back to them, and never got up; they had some handkerchiefs, but I did not look at them, so as to take much notice of them. I heard them say they had thirty-three.</p>
               <p>Q. Which said that?</p>
               <p>Hill. I cannot tell which said it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they know your business?</p>
               <p>Gammon. They did: they asked me if I would go up to Islington with them: I said, I could not, because I had no money: they said, never mind that, that does not signify: so I went along with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Gammon. This was about one o'clock in the day; we went together to the Coach and Horses there, and had two pots of beer, and bread and cheese, and gin; when we came back it was dark: they said, they knew of a place where they could get some handkerchiefs, and asked me to go along with them: I said, I would; we went down St. John's-street, and up the city, to the back of the Royal Exchange: then they shewed me the prosecutor's shop, and bid me push the window in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the shop?</p>
               <p>Gammon. There were people backwards, in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you push the window in?</p>
               <p>Gammon. I did; then Davis took out a piece of handkerchiefs, and gave it to Imer; he went with it, and stood just by, till we got the rest out.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity did you take?</p>
               <p>Gammon. There were twenty-five silk and cotton ones, and eight silk ones: Imer stood at the corner of a gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the last parcel out?</p>
               <p>Gammon. Davis did, and gave them to me; I carried them to Imer.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it dark, or light?</p>
               <p>Gammon. It was dark, at that time, about five.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do, when you had got them out?</p>
               <p>Gammon. Then we went over Moor-fields, till we came to the corner of Bunhill-row; there was a woman stood with fruit: Davis went and spoke to her; what he said to her I know not: then we went up a turning, and Davis went up a pair of stairs, into a room; and called us up after him: there was this butcher that has given evidence, and a little girl: he sent the girl down for that woman that was selling fruit. She came, and brought up a pot of purl: there we opened the handkerchiefs, and counted them, to see how many there were.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the butcher employed?</p>
               <p>Gammon. He was sitting by the fire: he saw us come in, and must see the handkerchiefs on the table, but he did not get up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>Gammon. About ten minutes: we wrapped the handkerchiefs up in an old one, and Imer said, he would go and sell them. He went to a place down Field-lane, while Davis and I stood up a turning; then he came back, and told us he could not sell them: then he said, he would go and leave them in Bleeding-hart-yard: we all three went there: he asked somebody for the key of Bett Field's room, and got it. Imer went up, and stood at the door: he said he would leave them there, and he knew of a place to get some more. We left them there, and went down as far as the end of Fleet-lane: then we said, as we had not sold them, it did not signify to get any more: so we went back, and bought a candle, and went all three into the room, where we divided them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many had you a-piece?</p>
               <p>Gammon. We had eleven each. As we were counting them on the table, she came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of any being drop'd?</p>
               <p>Gammon. No, I did not: I had all my eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. from Imer. Did you ever see me carry any handkerchiefs up into that house?</p>
               <p>Gammon. No: it was Davis that carried them up.</p>
               <p>Q. from Imer. Had I the key, to unlock the door?</p>
               <p>Gammon. No: Davis had the key, but you was with him.</p>

               <p>Going along the lower end of Bread-street, I met this lad, Gammon, with a bundle: he said, So, where are you going? I said, to my mother's: he said, I found a bundle going a cross Moorfields; he laid them on the table: there were a parcel of handkerchiefs: he asked me to go and tell them; I said, I would have no concern with them; this was at Mr. Hill's daughter's house; he lives in Chiswell-street: we were going home, and he was going that way; the woman named Haines, lives below; Gammon was not acquainted at that house: I have seen Gammon two or three times at my grandfather's, but was not acquainted with him. The handkerchiefs he had were all dirty.</p>
               <p>Imer's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went on the other side of the water with Davis, to see his wife in the hospital: coming back, we met this lad; he said, he had found some handkerchiefs; we went to Mr. Hill's with them; t he bundle was put upon the table, and he opened them, to the best of my knowledge; he counted either eleven or thirteen: he wanted me to go and help to sell them: I said, I would have no concern with them.</p>

            ; he gave his affirmation he bought them of two women; he would not swear, so can be of no service here; but here is an evidence in court that saw him buy them: and, by Foy's information, we found Mrs. Perry, who had bought seven; she lives in the same lane: and at Mr. Burton's, in the same lane, we found three more. On the Monday following, a person came to me, and said, he believed his son was concerned in the robbery, and desired I would get him admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Parker. His name is Fish; the lad is in court. I took him to Justice Fielding's; there he gave his evidence, and was admitted an evidence to come here. There was another boy taken up, upon his evidence, whose name was Gammon, but nothing was found upon him. M'Donald was taken up, and the rest of the prisoners, but they denied knowing any thing of the robbery. (The eighteen handkerchiefs found at the Fountain, seven at Mrs. Perry's, and three at Mr. Burton's, produced and deposed to). M'Donald and Farrel both said, they knew nothing of the evidence Fish, but said, he was set on by the thieftakers.</p>

               <p>Fish. At the Hog in Armour. We walked towards St. James's: when we got to St. James's, I heard them talking about this robbery: and as we came along, back again, we saw a glass was broke; they shov'd it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Fish. This was in the Strand, by Charing-cross.</p>

               <p>Fish. After the glass was shov'd in, we took out some white cambrick spotted handkerchiefs; then we went to Mr. Parker's window, and took out an hundred and six handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nobody in the shop?</p>
               <p>Fish. Mr. Parker's young man was in the shop, while we were taking them; he was packing up some linen. Then we went to Kitt M'Donald's room, in Black-boy alley, and counted them.

               <p>Q. Where did you set out from, when you did this robbery?</p>
               <p>Gammon. We were at Kitt M'Donald's, in the morning, and we went out to take a walk; we walked about the Park, till it began to be dusk: then we went a little way down the Strand, on this side Charing-cross; there we robbed a shop of thirteen handkerchiefs; it is the shop of Mr. Dent; they were red and white ones; then we went on towards home; we saw a pane of glass was cracked in Mr. Parker's shop-window; we pushed the glass in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that?</p>
               <p>Gammon. I can't say who did it; we were all four together: we took out the handkerchiefs: Kitt M'Donnald stood a little way off; we gave him some of them; then he went a little farther off, and after that he crossed the way to Somerset-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many handkerchiefs did you take?</p>
               <p>Gammon. There were about 105 or 106 handkerchiefs and neckcloths; there were five neckcloths; these are part of them, (pointing to them produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you count them?</p>

            . (He takes the cup in his hand.) I bought this cup of the prisoner at the bar, on Tuesday, the 18th of December: he came in the morning, about six or seven o'clock, and brought a silver tumbler, this silver cup, six chocolate plates, three table spoons, six tea spoons, three rings to put upon chocolate plates, three saucepans, a large one, a middling one, and a little one, all silver. I gave him 4 s. an ounce for them. I gave him 8 l. directly, and sent the other by my little boy, in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Abraham. There was a 27 s. piece, 4 s. 6 d. in silver, and the rest in guineas and half guineas, and the prisoner gave me a shilling. When he used to come to our house, my father sent me away.</p>

               <p>This boy was brought by thief-catchers, that came after me; he learns of his father: as his father swears, he swears; the thief-catchers all hang together, and when a man has been once under a cloud, they fix a thing upon him, and so swear his life away. They get their bread by helping people to stolen goods: I have been taken up three or four times, and they have brought people to look at my face, yet nothing was found upon me, to the value of a pin's point. The Jews will swear to clear a man, or cast him, for a trifle: the thief-takers might put the dark lanthorn there; it did not belong to me.</p>

On the Monday night, we were told they were both seen to go out three times with things on their shoulders from their lodgings: Rouson was taken, and on the Tuesday morning, carried before Justice Keeling. Going along, he was asked how he got in? he said, he pulled the lock, and it came off very easy; he confessed nothing before the justice; he said he would speak to Mrs. Bennet and the constable by themselves: we went down to Clark's house, in the Butcher-row, and found some things under the bed, and some upon it; we put them all in a tub: by that time, my mother came; I asked him whether there were any stays? he said, he knew nothing about stays.

Mrs. Clarkson and I took Rouson, when he came home; he said, if I would come into the room with Mrs. Bennet, he would tell us something. Then he said he had robbed Mrs. Bennet's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him, to induce him to confess?</p>
               <p>Adgett. I said he had better confess, least some body should say something against him, and do him harm. Then he said he had robbed Mrs. Bennet's shop, between three and five o'clock; and that the things were by the Maypole, East-Smithfield; that he had received a guinea earnest: he said, there was a woman with him in the robbery: then Clark was taken up, as she was coming home to her house, with a child in her arms; as we were coming back, he said, we shall find Robinson at Barbican, with his girl: we went there, and found him. I said to him, my friend, I believe you will be hanged; he said, for what? I said, for housebreaking: he made me no answer at all.</p>

               <p>Robinson's Defence.</p>
               <p>When Rouson gave me the leather into my hands, I carried it home; and when I was at home, he went to Mrs. Bennet's, and opened the door, and came and told me he had opened it; said he, will you go and see if there is any thing? I said, I did not care if I did; I went down, and he gave me hold of a bag of linen first; we carried that home, and went back again; then he gave me another bag of linen, and we carried that home.</p>

Bell said, I am a married woman, and if you call me whore again, I'll split your skull. She got up, and threw some purl in her face; then the deceased got up, and called her whore again: then Bell struck her with the pint pot a very violent blow, and the deceased in endeavouring to get up, fell down on her face, and remained senseless some time, continuing in a sit; I then went on my knees, and took the deceased's head into my bosom: Bell still kept the pot in her hand, till I took it out, and said, you have killed the woman I believe: Bell said, d - n her heretic blood; then some words passed between my mother and she: Bell went out at the door, and when she was gone, I washed the deceased's face, and put a handkerchief on her wound, and another round her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wound?</p>
               <p>Fawcett. No, I did not: she had very thick hair, and I bled terribly: by that time she was pretty well recovered. My mother asked her if she had any friends belonging to her? she said, she had some, but she had been a very bad girl, and thought they would not look on her. My mother desired her to go and fetch a warrant for the prisoner: she went out, in order so to do, and appeared better than I expected: I saw her after that, on Monday, in the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this?</p>
               <p>Fawcett. This was on a Friday; she then appeared in very good spirits, and said she should do well again.</p>
               <p>Jane Hall. I am mother to the last witness. I was not up when the prisoner and deceased first came in, but was soon after. I was at breakfast, and saw the deceased loll her head on the prisoner's shoulder; she pushed the deceased with her elbow, and said, d - n you, why do you loll your head on me, you whore. Said the other, if I am a whore, you are a whore as well as me. The prisoner said, I am not: you know I am a married woman, and if you call me whore again, I'll split your skull: the deceased then said, Moll, you are a whore: the prisoner then tossed the purl in her face; the deceased made an offer to get up to resent it, and the prisoner struck her with the pot, and she fell down in a fit. After my daughter had put some sugar into the wound, and bound up her head, I sent for Mr. Webb, the constable, to secure the prisoner: he told me he could not take charge of her without a warrant. When the prisoner came to herself, I persuaded her to go to Hicks's-hall for a warrant; she seemed then pretty well, and went away, and I never saw her afterwards.</p>

I went and saw the deceased sitting on a bench, with her head bound up: I went home again, and a little before twelve o'clock, the constable from Clerkenwell came into Swan-alley; and seeing the deceased in her blood, he came and desired me to go with him; I went to the sister and brother-in-law of the prisoner; there was the prisoner: she said, what is the matter? I said, I believe you are the woman that has killed a woman. Said she, if I have killed her, I must be hanged for her. I had much ado to get her out of the house, fearing an Irish clan of them: I got two people to guard and help her along: she behaved quite turbulent, and was very loath to go, so that I had a great deal of trouble. I took her to Hicks's-hall, before a magistrate; she was committed to New Prison. When the mob followed her, she said to me, give me your stick, and I'll clear my way of them all.</p>

             did it, and where it was done: then she was brought out, and put into a wooden chair, and carried to the hospital; I went with her there; I covered her with my cloak, and staid there till her head was dressed. The next day being Saturday, I went again, and went four times in all: the last time, I found her dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lucas. I am dresser to Mr. Crane, the surgeon to St. Bartholomew's hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain what you mean by dresser.</p>
               <p>Lucas. There are walking pupils and dressing pupils. I was called upon to attend on the deceased on the 7th of December: she was taken into the hospital, for the cure of a wound upon her forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine that wound?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I did; and found it about an inch and a half in length, and the bone partly bare, but no fracture: I did not imagine it would prove mortal: she had no bad symptoms, but recovered very fast. It continued well about ten days; at which time she was seized with a fever, for which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176501160034"/> Mr. Crane ordered her to be put under the physicians care.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that fever proceeded from the blow?</p>
               <p>Lucas. It is not in my power to tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been there any time?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I have dressed partly under Mr. Crane, and partly under Mr. Potts: I was an apprentice in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her dead?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she live after she was seized with the fever?</p>
               <p>Lucas. She died in a few days after, under the physicians care.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she live regular?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I don't suppose she followed very closely to what was directed.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner do you mean?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I believe she got up before she was ordered to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion and judgment, and the reason of your belief?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I have seen instances, where a fever has come on, after a blow on the head; but there was a fever stirring in the hospital at that time, but whether this was from that, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the same species of fever, as others in the hospital?</p>
               <p>Lucas. That should be had from the physicians.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the best account you can give?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I think it impossible to determine, except the head had been examined after she was dead, which it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the wound caused the fever?</p>
               <p>Lucas. I believe the wound would rather have prevented a fever, than have caused it: there is a a material difference between the blow and the wound. If this blow was the cause of her death, I suppose it must have been from some disorder on the brain.</p>

               <p>Fenner. She was my servant. After she had been down about twenty minutes, a neighbour knocked very hard at my door, and said, the room backwards was on fire: I ran up as hard as I could, and when the door was open, I saw the furniture of the bed on fire; the maid ran up after me: I turned to her, and desired she would go and bring me some water, for the curtains were on fire. Soon after that, the prisoner came down, out of the garret: he was ordered to go for water, but no water came up; that I did not know the meaning of. I burnt my hands on the occasion very much.</p>
               <p>Q. What was burnt?</p>
               <p>Fenner. The furniture of the bed; the bed, and the waistcoat of the room was damaged by the flames, which is to be seen now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wainscot on fire?</p>

               <p>Fenner. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What family had you in the house?</p>
               <p>Fenner. There was nobody but my wife and I, two lodgers up two pair of stairs, the prisoner and the maid, at this time: nobody was up stairs, but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What are your lodgers names?</p>
               <p>Fenner. They are a widow-woman, named Bolt, and her daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Fenner. The alarm was given between nine and ten at night. It was with some difficulty put out. On the 11th of December last, there was another alarm of fire, in the morning, about ten minutes after seven o'clock: I dressed myself, in order to go to Chelsea, in the room where the fire was after I was gone. I believe I was gone about four hours; the apprentice was at work when I went out: I left him and the maid in the house by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Fenner. I am a taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and your apprentice the prisoner, any difference?</p>
               <p>Fenner. We had, the night before, about a trifling affair; it was about a piece of work.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you come home from Chelsea?</p>
               <p>Fenner. I came home between ten and eleven; then I found my house had been set on fire in two places: the wainscot and bed in the room where I lie, were burnt; this was my own bed: the first was a lodger's bed. My bed was on the ground floor, in a black room; all the furniture and bedcloaths were burnt almost to ashes, and the wainscot damaged very much. It may be seen now,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176501160035"/> so that in one place you may push your thumb through it.</p>

               <p>Fenner. That is up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your wife?</p>
               <p>Fenner. She was with me in the room.</p>

            . I was servant with Mr. Fenner, in Salisbury-court on the 14th of September last; there were two women lodged over the room where the fire was, and a gentleman lodged in the room where the fire was; his name is Pickard, but he was not at home at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was at home at the time of the fire?</p>
               <p>Harald. There were my master, mistress, myself, and the prisoner. I then went up to Mr. Pickard's room, to shut the shutters, and draw the curtains, and turn the bed down; this was, I believe, a little after nine o'clock: the prisoner was with me, and held the candle. After I had done, I went down stairs, into the back parlour, to my master and mistress: then he told me he would take the candle, and go to bed with it, but instead of that, he went down into the cellar, to clean some shoes; and I take it to be about half an hour after, I heard him go by the parlour door, to go up stairs; it must be him, for there was nobody to go up but him, we being all in the back parlour. About five minutes after I heard him go up, I heard somebody knock at the door, and say the house was on fire, up one pair of stairs backwards: my master and I went up stairs together, and a little after I came down for water, I saw the prisoner come down behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the room where the fire was?</p>
               <p>Harald. No, I did not. He came down from above the room where the fire was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any candle with him?</p>
               <p>Harald. I did not see a candle. I went through a stone-yard, into the kitchen: there was a water in a tub.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner help you to carry water?</p>
               <p>Harald. I can't say he did. I thought he rather hindered me.</p>
               <p>Q. How hindered you?</p>
               <p>Harald. Through confusion: the spiggot was lost some how; I don't know how.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry up any water?</p>
               <p>Harald. I don't know that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pails had you?</p>
               <p>Harald. There was but one of ours; but there were a great many of other people's, in a very little time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing on fire?</p>
               <p>Harald. When I was up stairs, I saw the curtains of the bed on fire.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the gentlewomen that lived over the room where the fire was?</p>

               <p>Harald. They were both out.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had shut the window, and put the bed to rights, what became of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Harald. He and I came down stairs together.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner you heard go up, after you was below?</p>
               <p>Harald. I am pretty sure it was, because nobody else could: there was nobody there besides him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner appear frighted?</p>
               <p>Harald. He did not appear much frighted.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Salisbury-court. I was coming from the Lyon in the Wood, about half an hour after nine o'clock: I live about ten doors below where the fire was; as I was turning the corner, a person came and said, I have been knocking at the door, just at the corner of the square; there has been a fire: said I, there has been a fire there three times, within these three or four months; they must do it on purpose. I went in, and ran up stairs, and saw the bed curtains all in a flame, and the room in a smother.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Boddington. This was on the 14th of September: there were two lads went in with me. We got to tearing all the valence down, and I had my right hand much burnt: I took and threw the bed up, and brought down the posts of the bed together. We called for water, but there was no pail to be found: when we got the bed down, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176501160036"/> corner of the room was on fire. I went down, and found the spiggot out of the tub, and the water running about: I called out, for God's sake, where are the pails? there were none to be found: after that, the cork-cutter's boy came with one full of water: I ran up with that pail, thinking the engines were coming, and quenched the curtains; then more pails came, which we threw about the wainscot; the engine came and played in at the window, and got it down. After that, it seemed to smoke very much behind the wainscot, and we pulled out a pannel, and saw that all was safe: the cornice of the room and the bed were very much burnt.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner come up into the room, to assist in putting it out?</p>
               <p>Boddington. No, he did not, as I know of. I saw him below, where the water-tub was, but no where else.</p>

            . On the 11th of December, I lived with Mr. Fenner: that morning I came down, and lighted my fire in the back parlour. I turned the bed up, and by and by, there came a great smoke: I wondered what was the matter; my master was gone to Chelsea; I said, where can this smoak come from Jemmy I went to the entry, and there was such a smoke, I could not see the door. I went into the other room, and coming back again, I heard something crack: I went down into the kitchen, and under the stairs, was a fire on some chips, which we had to light the fire: the prisoner helped to put it out.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Crab. This might be betwixt eight and nine o'clock: then we came both up into the back-parlour again. There three times he said to me, why don't you go down, and see if the fire is safe below: I went down, and felt all round, and found it all cold: I was below I believe three minutes: I came up again, and came into the parlour, and my master's bed that I had just turned up, was all on fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner when you went down?</p>
               <p>Crab. He was standing just at the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. Could there be any connection with the fire on the chips, and the bed?</p>
               <p>Crab. No, there could not: it did not get hold of the posts. When I saw the bed on fire, I called out, Jem, Jem, Jem, come, the bed is all on fire; he came down, and we put it out: the curtains were burnt all to pieces; the bedding, blankets, pillows, and bolsters, were burnt; the bedstead was burnt, the bed was half burnt, and the flame had just catched the wainscot: there was one pannel damaged, just behind the middle of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lived in that house?</p>
               <p>Crab. I came in the room of the other servant, the evidence, when she was turned away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mistress at the home at the time of the fire?</p>
               <p>Crab. No, she was not. (The bolster produced in court, very much burnt).</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form any judgment, how it came?</p>
               <p>Crab. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any dog, or cat, or animal in the room?</p>
               <p>Crab. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner, after you had put the fire out?</p>
               <p>Crab. He went up stairs, and after that, Mr. Dutton came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a cat in the house?</p>
               <p>Crab. We have a cat in the house, but I did not see her there, when the bed was on fire.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gets up first in the morning, the prisoner, or you?</p>
               <p>Crab. The prisoner is up before me.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you light the fire with that morning?</p>
               <p>Crab. I lighted it with some of the chips out of that hole where I saw some on fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry the candle in your hand, when you went for them?</p>
               <p>Crab. I did; but I set the candle on the outside of the hole: I always am fearful of fire.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Fenner. On the 11th of December, I came to work in the morning, about a quarter before nine, and was let in by Mrs. Crab. I had not gone above half the length of the passage, before I saw a large quantity of dirty water and feathers, floating upon the floor. I said to her, pray what has been the matter? she said in a sorrowful manner, a fire had happened: I said, I hoped not a fire again? she said, yes indeed there has. I said, pray how did it happen? she declared she did not know; that she had been down stairs but a few minutes, and when she returned, she saw the bed all on fire. I went to the parlour door, to see what damage was done: the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176501160037"/> prisoner opened the door: I said, do you know how this happened? he said, no. I asked him where his master was? he said, he was gone to Chelsea; that he went between six and seven. I said, had you any engines? he said no, Mrs. Crab and he put it out: but he was surprized how they did it, there being so much of it. I then directed my discourse to Mrs. Crab. I went up into the garret, and found one of the casements open, and wondered what could be the cause of it: I went down again, to assist in putting the things to rights: I found a quantity of chips among the things in the bed: I could not help observing the behaviour of the prisoner, who seemed to behave more by way of diversion rather than otherwise: I took these chips up; some were burnt to cinders, and some half burnt: I began to suspect something wrong. When we had taken up all the pieces of bed furniture, and cleared away the water out of the room, I began to observe the wainscot, and found one part of it exceedingly burnt, more than the rest; I believe it was three parts through; I think I could have pushed my thumb through it: the door was pretty much burnt: Mrs. Crab said the middle of the bedstead turned up against that part that was much burnt, I said it was very odd which way fire could come between the bedstead and the wainscot; I am afraid fire has been put there, on some bad design. The prisoner immediately answered in a very surly manner, No, the middle was not in that place. Observing him so surly, I said no more, but thought to take another opportunity to talk to him, when working by ourselves. Then the next day, I said there was a great deal of mischief done below, it is very odd to me a great deal of smoke did not come up stairs: said he, there was a great deal, and I was obliged to open the casement, to let it out. I said, it is very odd you did not go down stairs: no, said he, I did not; but soon after Mrs. Crab called me down. I said, I would have gone down to have seen what was the matter; for you knew very well, that chimney never used to smoke, and there was but one fire, from whence you must conclude the smoke must come; and you must open the window and stay till you are called: said he, what do you think I would sit here to be stifled with smoke, and not open the window to let it out? there is a person below, able to take care of the house, and I thought I had no business with it. The next day I said, was you down stairs, James, when the fire was, before you was called? he said, yes, I was. What did you go down for? I went down to desire Mrs. Crab to save me a bason of tea, for he knew his master would not be back soon. What, said I, was this silly old woman, Mrs. Crab doing, when you went down stairs? he said, blowing the fire. I said, in what position was the bed? he said, turned up, as usual. How long did you stay below? he said, about four or five minutes, and he left her blowing the fire. How long might it be before you was called down, after that? he said, about twenty minutes. Was there a great deal of smoke came up? yes, a great deal; and the first thing he did when he went down, he said, was, he pulled the bedstead from the wainscot, and got a knife, and cut some of the bed-cords. and pulled the bed on the floor; then he got a pail of water, and threw into the middle of the bed. I asked him some time after, which way he supposed this could happen? his reply was, you are to understand, Mrs. Crab is blind on one eye, and I imagine she had gone too near the bed with a candle, and set the curtain on fire. Then I pressed the matter pretty hard upon him: he at first denied it very strongly, and resented it very much. At last he began to be very silent: then I was so too. On the afternoon, on the Saturday, I began again, in the mildest and softest terms, relative to the heinousness of the crime, and the punishment I thought due to such a person that could be guilty of doing such a thing; and that his master had told me he would have him before a magistrate: he seemed very much concerned, and tears came. I told him there was but one way to escape the danger, and that was to confess the fact, and beg pardon for it; and if he could not speak to his master himself, I would solicit for him. I pressed him with such like arguments, but to no purpose, till about 8 or 9 o'clock: he said, you know we have a strange cat in the house; said I, I know it: said he, that morning, I chanced to go into the back parlour, and there was nobody there: I saw this strange cat sitting under the stove, and I frighted her away, or pulled her away, and she ran into the bed: there was a red hot poker in the fire; I took that, and threw into the bed after her, and that was the way that it happened; and he left the poker there. I asked him the reason for leaving it, and he said he forgot it, and that was the way it happened. But James, said I, this red hot poker could not set the house in such a flame, in such a time; because when you saw the cat run away, you would naturally take the poker out again: he said, no; I did not take it out again. I said, what, and did you leave it there? he said, yes, I did. I said, what could be your reason for that? he said, I don't know; I forgot it. Said I, I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176501160038"/> afraid you have not told me the right of it: he said, yes, I have; and if you don't chuse to believe it, you may let it alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen a strange cat there?</p>
               <p>Dutton. I have; a sort of a tabby cat, a strange cat: she was a very familiar one.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard him say this cat had stole his victuals?</p>
               <p>Dutton. No, I never have heard him say such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner, as to his capacity?</p>
               <p>Dutton. He is a lad of a common capacity, considering he has had no education.</p>
               <p>Q. How old do you take him to be?</p>
               <p>Dutton. He is about 16 years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never perceive he was a weak lad?</p>
               <p>Dutton. I never perceived any uncommon weakness in him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Crab. Did you leave a poker in the fire that morning?</p>
               <p>Crab. If I did, I do not recollect it.</p>
