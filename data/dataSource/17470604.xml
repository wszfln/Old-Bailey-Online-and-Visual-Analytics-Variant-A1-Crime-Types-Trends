They stript my Cap off my Head , and my Gown and Petticoat, and my Handkerchief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174706040003"/> from off my Neck, and my Stays, and my Shift from my back. I met the Prisoners in Smithfield the first Day of May, and I ask'd them my Way to Queen-Street.</p>

               <p>Holloway . Yes, my Lord, I cry'd out Murder. They beat me to such a Degree that I was not able to stir.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do?</p>
               <p>Holloway . Please your Lordship, I crept into a waste House that was there in the Place. I was ashamed to be seen by any body.</p>
               <p>Q. How do know that these Prisoners at the Bar were the Persons that stripp'd you?</p>
               <p>Holloway . My Lord, I knew them when I saw them again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to be taken? How came you to find out these Persons?</p>
               <p>Holloway . There were some People came about me the next Day to see me, and they asked me, if I could tell the People that stripp'd me? I said, I could give a Description of the Woman in particular , and of the Gown upon her Back.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell the Colour of her Gown?</p>
               <p>Holloway . Yes, she had that Gown on she has now. And I described the Man. I can't say particularly I could discern the Colour of his Coat, but I thought it was dark; and I describ'd him for that same Person he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how they came to be taken up?</p>
               <p>Holloway . The People are here that took them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of the Cloaths you were stripp'd of here?</p>
               <p>Holloway . Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoners. Will either of you ask Mrs Holloway any Questions?</p>
               <p>Dennis the Prisoner. Ask her, if she did not say to the Constable, that she could not swear positively to me, for she was very much in Liquor, for there were four or five of them?</p>
               <p>Holloway . After they struck me in the Eyes I thought there was more, for I saw double; but I believe it was owing to my Eyes.</p>
               <p>Court. The Prisoner asks, whether you was not in Liquor?</p>
               <p>Holloway . No, please your Lordship.</p>

               <p>Smith. I am the Constable's Beadle; upon the 2d of May, between one and two o'Clock (in the Night) the two Prisoners at the Bar came into the Watch house, and the Woman had a bundle in her Apron, and they call'd for a Tankard of Beer, (our Watch-house is kept in a publick House in Golden lane) and the Woman of the House draw'd them a Tankard of Beer; and while they were drinking the Beer, she heard

             say to Ryley , I am glad you are clear'd from the Old Bailey. And Ryley said, he was clear'd that Afternoon, which was on Friday the first of May. So the Woman of the House call'd to me, and said, I have heard these Persons talking together, I don't like them. While they drink the Tankard of Beer I said, keep the Door fast, don't let them go out. So I said to them, I must examine you before you go; so she broke the Windows, and struck the Watchman; and in the Struggle, having but one Watchman, Ryley made his Escape from us. In about a Quarter of an Hour Ryley came a second time, and we let him go again, and was glad he was gone, for fear he should get Hands and rescue the Woman. Having but one Watchman I detain'd the Woman till between three and four o'Clock, then I carried her down to New Prison; and desir'd the Man, if any Body came to inquire for the Prisoner to let me know, and I would pay him for his Trouble: This was on Saturday Morning, and I think, on Tuesday Morning Ryley was brought by an Officer out of Shoreditch ; I went down to New Prison, and stay'd till the Officer came and brought him there, and went with him to Justice Poulson's ; he own'd the Fact before the Justice, but where to find the Prosecutrix I could not tell . When he came to Justice Poulson's he wanted to make himself an Evidence. Mr Poulson said, what do you want to make yourself an Evidence for? He own'd that he was in Company when the Woman ask'd the Way, and that he beat her. Says Mr Poulson , as the Prosecutrix is not here I can't commit you for this Fact, but I'll send you to Bridewell. In a Day or two's time I inquir'd after the Prosecutrix, and I found her in Queenstreet , at her Mistress's; when she saw the Prisoner Ryley she said, he was the Man that robbed her.</p>
               <p>Q. What Day of the Month was you before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Smith. The 2d of May; and Ryley was taken a Day or two afterwards, and the Prosecutrix pick'd him out among the rest that were in Prison. She was naked from between eleven and twelve o'Clock at Night till the next Day ten o'Clock, then the Neighbours lent her some one thing, and some another; she came to Hicks's Hall about two or three o'Clock in the Afternoon: When she came, says the People, Here's the Woman that was robb'd last Night. I had not a Hearing before the Justice till then.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she robb'd, did she say?</p>

               <p>Smith. In Chick-lane; one End of the Place comes into Chick-lane, and the other into Cow-cross. She said she was robb'd at such a Place of all her Apparel, and abused to a gross Degree; she could scarce see with one Eye, and was very much bruised.</p>

             . What do you know of the Prisoners?</p>
               <p>Benbow . On the 2d of May the two Prisoners came into the Watch-house, and they ask'd for a Pot of Beer. The Woman seem'd to have a large Bundle in her Apron. When I draw'd the Pot of Beer I call'd the Beadle to me, and told him, I believ'd they were not very good People, and desired the Beadle to see what she had got in her Apron . He said he would presently;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174706040005"/> and he sat down in the Box, the other side of them; and I heard the Woman say, that she was very glad he (Ryley) was cleared at the Old Bailey. He made Answer, and said, he had been an Hour upon his Trial. He had been try'd for two Gallon Pots*. The Beadle ask'd to see what she had in her Apron; she obstinately refused; but he did take them, and I saw they had been torn off somebody's Back: The Petticoat was fresh torn in two Places. These were the Goods taken out of her Apron. (The Goods were all produced in Court.) I said, I was afraid there was a Robbery committed, if not a Murder, for the Things did not look as if they belong'd to her. The Prisoner said she would not give any Account of herself.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you at the Alehouse? Had she the Shift on there?</p>
               <p>Holloway . Yes, she had it there, but it was taken off in the Justice's Garden.</p>

             . You saw the Goods open'd?</p>
               <p>Benbow . Yes, and I insisted upon the Beadle's taking her into Custody. She would not let him have the Things for some time; she struggled and broke the Windows. She was carried to Prison about three o'Clock. I am certain she is the Woman; she was in my House from a Quarter after one to a Quarter after three. Ryley was there, and he said, she was his Wife , and he had given her 6 s. the Night before. Ryley and the Woman came together.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say with respect to Ryley ?</p>
               <p>Benbow . He said, she was his Wife, and he gave her 6 s. the Night before. He seem'd to be frighten'd and in a hurry, and went out under a Pretence to call somebody to give an Account of the Things. He went out and came in again, and went out again. The Woman behaved in such a Manner that she frighten'd us out of our Wits.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing further?</p>
               <p>Benbow . I heard Ryley say before Justice Poulson, he was willing to make himself an Evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the Name of that Man that took him up?</p>
               <p>Benbow . He lives at the Gun in Kingstand Road . When I said there was some Mischief done; Ryley said, What had any Body to do if he tore all his Wife's Cloaths off her Back.</p>

               <p>Austin. I am a Watchman in Golden-lane; on the 2 d of May last, after I had been beating my Rounds, I came into the Watch-house and I saw the two Prisoners at the Bar; the Woman was very turbulent, she was fighting, and broke the Windows, and I found it was about the Beadle's examining her Bundle that she had. She was very unruly, and the young Fellow slipt out, but we kept her there till the Watch was broke up, and then we carried her to New-Prison, and in the Morning, about nine o'Clock, we went to fetch her out of Prison to carry her before a Magistrate, and being Sessions time we had her to Hicks's Hall, but we could not have a Hearing before the Afternoon; and there came a Woman and ask'd, if a young Woman was not there taken up for a Robbery in Chick-lane? When the Woman saw the Prisoner, she said to her, You Jade, how could you abuse the Woman so? She is at my House almost murdered. She is in Bed and was almost naked. I said to the Woman, she must be fetch'd, and they brought Mrs Holloway the Prosecutrix, and she was in a deportable Condition; she had two black Eyes, and her Forehead bruised, and when she saw the Woman Prisoner, she swore to her as the Woman that had robb'd her; and she burst out a crying, and said, that is my Shift you have upon your Back. Then we went to Justice Poulson and had a Hearing there, and she swore to the Things there as also to the Woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing of this Ryley?</p>
               <p>Austin . He was taken the 5th of May in Shoreditch ; and when he was taken he was carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174706040006"/> before Justice Poulson , and he wanted to make himself an Evidence; says the Justice, I have Evidence enough already; but let us hear what you have to say, Please ye, my Lord, says he, (to tell you the Truth) on Friday in the Afternoon I was acquitted at the Old Bailey, and I went to the Twopenny House in Chick-lane, and got myself a little in Liquor, and I and the other Prisoner met the Prosecutrix, and she ask'd us the Way, and we directed her up that Alley .</p>

               <p>White. On Wednesday the 6th of May, between twelve and one o'Clock at Noon; as we were going into the Seven Fields the Prisoner at the Bar sat under a Hay-cock in the first Field; he sat with a Stick a-cross his Lap: When we had got half-way into the Field he followed us, and we made believe we had somebody behind us, for we were afraid of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you make believe you had somebody behind you?</p>
               <p>White. We ask'd why they stay'd; he turn'd round to see if any body was coming; then he said, young Women, I will stop you, to see whether any body comes to you.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say more to you?</p>
               <p>White. He said, young Women, I will stop you till I see whether any body comes; he put his Hand in his Pocket, and said, if we made any Resistance he would do for us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any thing from you?</p>
               <p>White. Yes, Three Half-pence; I took it out of my Pocket and put it into his Hand, and I made him a Courtesy and thank'd him, and went away. This was near a House; it was the Field, facing Mount Pleasant .</p>
               <p>Q. What did he take from the other?</p>
               <p>White. One Shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you two been?</p>
               <p>White. She was going to see her Aunt; and my Mother gave me leave to go with her.</p>

               <p>White. No, he was just as he is now; we gave Notice of it at Crouch-end , and this Man pursued after him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken?</p>
               <p>White. The 6th of May, about two Hours after the Robbery was committed; we told the Witness

             that we were robb'd, and describ'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had given Notice did you go home?</p>
               <p>White. No, we went to this young Woman's Aunt; and we told the Witness we were going to Hornsey, to one Mrs Seers .</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear of this Man's being taken?</p>
               <p>White. About three Hours afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>White. He was carried before Justice Cook at Newington; then Justice Cook sent him down to the Justice at Islington , because it was done in Islington Parish.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Justice's Name he was carried to?</p>
               <p>White. To Justice Hole.</p>
               <p>To the Prisoner. Would you ask this Witness any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was carried before Justice Cook at Newington. I was there the better Part of an Hour and an half. When I was in Justice Cook's Yard then the two young Women were brought in; I was talking with the Coachman, and that young Woman in the brown Gown, I can't now repeat her Name, she came in first, and there was a Man standing at the Stable Door in a blue Waistcoat, and she goes up to that Man, and says, This is the Man that robbed me.</p>

               <p>White. They hurried her along so, that she did say, this is the Man . I said, No, Mary, that is not the Man ; and I pointed to the Prisoner, and they pulled him in directly and shut the Stable Door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What the young Woman now speaks is impossible, Justice Cook's Coachman is witness, and another Man, and I suppose is subpoena'd here; I did not see that young Woman, neither did she me. When I was before Justice Cook, in his House, the Woman swore, that I took Six-pence in Silver; that she gave me six Pennyworth of Halfpence; she swore some were Half-pence and some were Farthings. I had but Three-pence about me. They swore I had it; I was search'd, but I had it not.</p>
               <p>Court to White. You must answer him; he says he was search'd, and there was no Silver found about him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the Man in the Stable when she said so?</p>
               <p>Simms . No, for the Door was shut; but immediately, when he came out of the Stable, then I knew him.</p>

            . What do you know of this Matter?</p>
               <p>White. I know so far as this; that I was Constable, and that I took him into my Custody before Justice Cook. When my Daughter told me that she was robbed I went with him to Justice Cook's; and he own'd the Fact to me, and he would have given me two Guineas to make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your Daughter know him immediately?</p>
               <p>White. Yes, Sir, when he look'd out of the Stable, my Daughter said, that is the Man.</p>

               <p>White. The Man that had robbed her.</p>

               <p>White. As we were going along, he begged of me that I would make it up with my Daughter, and that he would give me two Guineas for myself, in Case I would let him go.</p>

               <p>White. Yes, when I search'd him, he owned he had Sixpence in Silver, but he could not tell what became of it; he had about five Pence or five Pence halfpenny to the best of my Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Will you ask this Witness any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What he says in the Affair of my confessing the Fact to him is false. As we were going along he said, he had known me, and I bore a very good Character, and my Master had entrusted me. I said, I had rather give him two Guineas than I should be exposed to my Master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he insist upon it, that he was a Person of good Character, and that you knew him?</p>
               <p>White. We did not know any thing of his Character, or where he came from.</p>

            . I was at Work by the Road side on Stamford-hill , in the Parish of Hackney, and I heard a Person cry out, Stop Thief. I saw no body. I was surprized to hear a Cry of Stop Thief; so he (the Prisoner) immediately jumpt over the Hedge and Ditch almost upon me. He said to me, I am the Lad that have robb'd two Women of Nine-pence; and I said, then he must go to the Gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Taylor. At Tottenham High-Cross ; I am a Day-labouring Man.</p>

               <p>Taylor. Yes. I went with him before Justice Cook, but he did not care to be concern'd in it; then we went to Islington .</p>
               <p>- Battey. I live at the Fan and Bull-head on Stroud-Green . When I heard of the Robbery, I said, we shall have our Trade spoil'd; what, Robberies already at Noon-day? As I was talking with my Wife the Prisoner stood opposite to my Door, about twenty Yards from my House. I said, according to the Description of the Man, that this Man must be the Person. I would not give him any Suspicion. I thought to have took him before he ran away; accordingly, as I approach'd nigh to him, instead of going through the Gate he jump'd, and run a-cross the Green to Samford-hill before he was taken.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Pleydell. What have you to alledge against the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Pleydell . What I have to alledge against the Prisoner is, the picking of my Pocket on the 12th of May last in the Strand, between the Hours of five and six in the Afternoon. When he had pick'd my Pocket I saw him cross the Street in a suspicious Manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was it?</p>
               <p>Pleydell . It was opposite <placeName id="t17470604-3-crimeloc15">St Clement's Churchyard</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17470604-3-crimeloc15" type="placeName" value="St Clement's Churchyard"/>

                        targets="t17470604-3-off12 t17470604-3-crimeloc15"/> . I felt a kind of Weight at my Pocket, and I found my Handkerchief lost.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not see him take it?</p>
               <p>Pleydell . I did not see him take it; Upon finding it gone, a Gentleman, one Mr Travers , and I, immediately followed him; he walk'd pretty slow ; when he perceiv'd we were near him he began to run; he run towards the Church.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr Travers do then?</p>
               <p>Pleydell . We took him by the Church.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Handkerchief is your's?</p>
               <p>Pleydell . Yes, Sir, it is mark'd with J. P.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you took the Handkerchief upon him?</p>
               <p>Pleydell . He begg'd our Pardon; and said, it was the first Fault that he committed.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. The Gentleman swears you took the Handkerchief out of his Pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he saw me.</p>
               <p>Court. He says, he did not see you take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They knock'd me down with their Sticks.</p>
               <p>Pleydell . He made his Escape, and we were running a-cross the Church-yard the second Time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you knock him down the first Time?</p>
               <p>Pleydell . The second Time we knock'd him down.</p>
               <p>- Travers. I was present with Mr Pleydell when this thing happen'd.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Travers . On the 12th of May. We had been at Dinner at the Crown and Anchor, and was going from thence to the Coffee-house. Mr Pleydell informed me, that he believed the Prisoner pick'd his Pocket of his Handkerchief. I saw the Man cross the Way; he was walking softly down the Church-yard, with that Mr Pleydell and I cross'd the Way, and went to the Church-yard and seiz'd him, and asked him, What he had done with the Handkerchief? I took him by the Collar, and I believe I struck him with my Stick: I did not strike him down, but he fell upon his Knees and begged that we would forgive him, for it was the first Crime he had ever been guilty of, of that kind; then I saw Mr Pleydell take that very Handkerchief from under his right Arm. Then he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he go?</p>
               <p>Travers . He ran up the Church-yard, and went to the Back-side of St Clement's. There was a Gentleman in our Company that is not here, he is in the Country; so we put the Prisoner into a Coach, and carried him before Justice Burdus .</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Have you any thing to say; or any Witnesses?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Witnesses did not expect my Trial to have come on.</p>

            . What have you to say of Williamson?</p>
               <p>Sims. He is an idle Sort of a Person, and never kept his Services.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether he was by at the Wedding or no? Or do you know whether the Prisoner Holmes lived with Williamson at any Time as his Wife?</p>
               <p>Simms. Some small Time, my Lord, but how long I can't say; and she made a great Report up and down the Town, that he was not capable of performing Family-Duty as he ought to do.</p>

            . On the 8th Day of May last I was robbed by Persons unknown, they got in at the Window, as near as I can guess, between nine and ten at Night.</p>

            . On the Monday 18th of May, between one and two, I saw two Gentlemen come along very brisk in Discourse; this little Man, the Prisoner at the Bar was following these two Gentlemen, he took hold of the Gentleman's Flap of his Coat, and put his Hand to his Pocket; by and by he followed the Gentleman again, and pick'd out the Gentleman's Silk Handkerchief. Then they went over the Bank into the Widow Bentley's Yard, and I went up the Field to see if they came that way, to take a Look at them; and they went the other Way into her Yard, and between one and two this young Man at the Bar, with this Bag, came out of the Py'd Bull Yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he carry them?</p>
               <p>Brown. He had the Bags in an Apron.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know these are the Bags?</p>
               <p>Brown. I know them, my Lord. Grace the Prisoner had these Bags, and these Things were in them. I ran back to the Widow Bentley, and told her, that I believed two Men had robb'd her of some Bags. When we told them of it they miss'd them. We got some of Mrs Bentley's People and pursued them. When we came to them, the tall one pull'd out a Knife and said, he would cut their Eyes out; with that he ran away, and the Prisoner Grace ran after him. When they saw they were surrounded they both laid upon the Bags. When Butler had said he would cut their E yes out, and they both ran away, I ran the length of a Field or two; then I bethought myself to take the Bags, so I went and took them, and threw them over my Shoulders, and run over the Fields and Ditches, crying, Stop Thief. Grace stripp'd, and said, he had nothing about him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did they run together?</p>
               <p>Brown. About nine Fields, my Lord. Grace stripp'd, and we took hold of him; and the other threw down his Knife, and we took hold of him, and we brought them to the Py'd Bull-Inn, and we charg'd White the Constable with them, and took them before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Grace, will you ask him any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to know, whether he can swear that I stole the Bags?</p>
               <p>Court. He does not pretend to do it; but he said he saw you had those Things in a Leather Apron, and he took them for a Saddle.</p>
               <p>Q. to Brown. Did he lie down upon the Dunghill upon the Things?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes, my Lord, both of them; we did not see them till they rose up; but the tall one rose up, and said, he would cut our Eyes out.</p>
               <p>Court to Grace the Prisoner. Have you any Witnesses?</p>
               <p>Grace. No body to appear for me.</p>

            . What have you to alledge against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Forster . Last Friday was 7-Night she pick'd me up in the Street, and pull'd me into a House, whether I would or no.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the Night was this?</p>
               <p>Forster. It was about 9 o'Clock in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What Street was this in?</p>

               <p>Court. You seem to be a Country-man. What brought you there?</p>
               <p>Forster. She would pull me there, whether I would or no. I was going into Bishopsgate-Street, to pay this Money.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Forster. No; but she met me in Holborn, and had me down to Newtoner's-Lane . She spoke to me first: Ah Country-man, give us a Dram.</p>
               <p>Court. So upon that you went along with her?</p>
               <p>Forster. Yes, Sir; she made me go, whether I would or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober then?</p>
               <p>Forster. I had had a Glass or two. I was not quite sober; nor I was not quite drunk neither.</p>
               <p>Court. So you went along with her?</p>
               <p>Forster. She made me go, whether I would or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go with her?</p>
               <p>Forster . By Newtoner's-Lane . I was not willing to go in, but she pull'd me in by force.</p>
               <p>Court. So you could not help it, she haul'd you in, or did she shove you in before her?</p>
               <p>Forster. She pull'd me in, and shoved me in to.</p>
               <p>Court. When you got in what then?</p>
               <p>Forster. Then she pull'd me up Stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up Stairs, what then?</p>
               <p>Forster. Then she pull'd up her Coats against me, and took my Money from me. There was a Thirty-six Shilling Piece, a Guinea, and fifteen Shillings in Silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was all this Money.</p>
               <p>Forster . In my Pocket, in a Purse, and the Note with it, where I was to fetch the Goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take Purse and all?</p>
               <p>Forster. Purse, Money, Note, and all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Person with her in the Room?</p>
               <p>Forster . There was a Woman upon the Bed; but there was no body touch'd me but this Woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie down upon the Bed?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174706040017"/>Forster. No, Sir; nor sit upon the Bed neither .</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you there?</p>
               <p>Forster. Not above half a quarter of an Hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink nothing while you was there.</p>
               <p>Forster. Not a Drop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this Room a dark Room, or had you a Candle?</p>
               <p>Forster. It was a light Room, as light as it is here.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your Money?</p>
               <p>Forster. As she threw her Coats up, so I miss'd my Money directly; I saw the Purse in her Hand; I followed her as last as I could, but she was too quick for me.</p>
               <p>Court. So when she had got your Money and Purse from you, she ran down Stairs.</p>
               <p>Forster . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see this Woman before?</p>
               <p>Forster. Never in my Life.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see this Woman again?</p>
               <p>Forster. About two Hours after.</p>
               <p>Court. There was a Woman in the Room; did you make no Complaint to her?</p>
               <p>Forster. I said, I am undone! my Pocket is pick'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Woman awake or asleep?</p>
               <p>Forster . She never stirr'd; she never troubled herself with me, nor I with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see her two or three Hours afterwards?</p>
               <p>Forster. I described her to some People about St Giles's , and they said they see her pull me along.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been in the Morning before, to get fudell'd?</p>
               <p>Forster. I went along with the Hempsted Waggon as far as Paddington.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it that you did not go on with it?</p>
               <p>Forster. I am a Porter to the Waggon; I am not the Waggoner. We had been drinking at Paddington . We had a Pot or two of Beer between four of us ; and when I came to St Giles's I had a Dram of Brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Forster. Then, Sir, I was going to pay my Money in Bishopsgate-Street; and I lights with her, and she has me down to Newtoner's-Lane .</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with again?</p>
               <p>Forster. At an Ale-House, the back side of St Giles's.</p>
               <p>Court. What then?</p>
               <p>Forster. Then I took her up, and carried her before a Justice at St Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she search'd; had she any Money about her?</p>
               <p>Forster. They found half a Guinea about her, and about two-pence half-penny, or thereabouts. She had the Money as sure as I stands here. There was half a Guinea in Gold found and I can't tell whether nine or ten Shillings in Silver, and some Half-pence.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Will you ask him any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was crying old Cloaths, and he told me, he could carry me to a Place where I might buy a Coat.</p>
               <p>Forster. There was nothing in it; she carried me to a Place where she took my Money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember she was crying old Cloaths?</p>
               <p>Forster. No, Sir; nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Court. You have mentioned she was search'd, You had a Purse, was that found?</p>
               <p>Forster . No, Sir.</p>

            . What do you know of Matter, or have to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Nelson. I was standing, above Nine o'Clock, at my Door, in Newtoner's-Lane , and I saw this man and Girl, coming up the Lane, on Friday was 7-Night. I wonder'd that an ancient Man should go with such a nasty common Creature; we know her very well to be a common Woman. I said, bless me what an antient Man is he to be along with that Creature. He stopp'd to make Water, and she pulled him in at the back Door.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any degree of Violence used; did he make any Resistance. How did the Man appear; was he in Liquor?</p>
               <p>Nelson. He was very middling; he had a Dram, I believe; she pull'd him in at the back Door, at Mr Morris's, in Newtoner's-Lane .</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174706040018"/>Q. Does she live there?</p>
               <p>Nelson. I believe she plies there. As for crying old Cloaths she knows nothing what belongs to it.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was crying old Cloaths in the Street; and he took me to this Publick House, under a Pretence of helping me to the buying of a Coat: When I came, the House was full of People; I says, I don't care to stay; so he he said he would call for a Dram for my Pains.</p>

            . I saw what a Condition the Child was in, the Woman draging of it along, upon that I seized the Woman. I took the Prisoner in one Hand, and the Child in the other. The Mob interposed, and they would take the Woman, and do speedy Justice to her. I begged they would not. Then I took care to get them before the Justice; and I found the Parents of the Child lived at Knightsbridge . I had taken my Handkerchief out of my Pocket, and tied it about the Body of the Child. The Prisoner own'd she had stripp'd the Child in the Prince of Wales's Passage ; and that she had made away with some of the Cloaths. So the Justice committed her; and the Child was committed to it's Parents.</p>

               <p>Hutchins. I had a Mistrust of him; he liv'd in the same House; he went out about five o'Clock in the Morning. I went out and catch'd him in a Court by Chiswell Street, and took it under his Coat. I told them I would have a Search-Warrant, and search for the other Things; the Sword at last was delivered to me by one Stradling ; and the Buttons were brought me by the Prisoner's Sister.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you when you took it from under his Coat?</p>
               <p>Hutchins . He told me, if I would carry it home I might make it up.</p>

He shuts the Door and puts up the Bar, and pinn'd him in; and comes to me, and cries out, Master! Master! I have catch'd him.

The Prisoner at the Bar came and open'd the Street Door, about 6 o'Clock in the Morning; all the Time I was watching for them that should come into my Master's Vault; he came and open'd my Master's Door, and came in: When I heard him in, I goes and takes hold of the Door where the Prisoner at the Bar was, and I fastened him in. I heard him rattle among the Bottles, and I ask'd who was there; the Prisoner at the Bar did not answer me; so I clapp'd the Door upon him. Then I said he should stay till such times that he did answer me; so I fastened him in, and went up Stairs.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. I think the Prisoner is Clerk to a Gentlewoman that deals in Coals, that has Vaults by your Master's Vauls. Have you not known, that he and your People have frequently drank Cyder together?</p>
               <p>Roadly. I never saw him before that Time.</p>

               <p>Attorney General. May it please your Lordship , and you Gentlemen of the Jury, the Prisoner at the Bar, stands indicted for a Crime of a very high Nature, considered in itself, and made particularly Felony by a late Act of Parliament, for the Preservation of the Constitution, and the general Peace of the Kingdom. He stands indicted, Gentlemen, upon an Act made the 19th of his present Majesty, the last Session of Parliament; and it was made, Gentlemen, in order to prevent a Practice which has been growing upon the Publick, Persons being concerned in the Running of Goods not only confining themselves to that Practice, which you must easily see is a Practice very prejudicial to the Publick, but their going arm'd in great Numbers, to the Terror of many of the Inhabitants of the Country.</p>

               <p>And, Gentlemen, to put a Stop to that Practice, the Legislature thought it proper to make the Law I am now to state to you. It recites, That divers, dissolute Persons that have associated themselves, have entered into Confederacy to support one another; that they have appear'd in great Gangs in several Parts of the Kingdom, and when so assembled, have been aiding and assisting in carrying off uncustomed Goods, Goods liable to pay Duties, to the great Discouragement of the fair Trader, and the great Loss of the Revenue; their rescuing Goods after Seisure; in obstructing the Officers of the Crown; and have either wounded, maimed, and some killed in the Execution<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174706040023"/> of their Offices. Gentlemen, after this recital, the Law then comes to Enact, That if any Persons to the Number of three or more, arm'd with Fire Arms, shall (after the 17th of July, 1746.) attempt the carrying away, or landing uncustomed Goods, or any Goods whatsoever, that have been exported, &amp;c. or obstructing Officers forceably in the Execution of their Office, Persons guilty of this Offence, I am stating to you, are made guilty without Benefit of Clergy. The Case of the Prisoner stands thus, upon the 14th of September last one

            , and several other Persons, who are riding Officers of the Customs, and are station'd at East-Bourne one Purpose to prevent these pernicious Practices, these Officers were at a Place called Southland, where they came to intercept a Gang of Smugglers; accordingly, about three o'Clock in the Afternoon, on the 14th of September thirty or forty of these Smugglers, several of whom were arm'd with Fire Arms, with about fifty or sixty Horses, presented themselves to the Officers of the Customs. The Officers ask'd them, what their Horses were loaded with? They told them, by virtue of their Office, they were bound to examine them. These Persons made use of a great many Oaths to terrify the Officers of the Customs; they presented their Fire-Arms, and swore, they would blow their Brains out if they attempted to seize their Goods; but notwithstanding this the Officers were not intimidated, but determined to secure the Brandy and Tea; accordingly they rode up and cut off several half Anchors of Brandy, and several Bags of Tea; upon that the Smugglers presented their Pieces, swore they would shoot them, drove away their Horses, by which the Officers were render'd incapable of seizing the whole.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Prisoner at the Bar was one of this Gang, and he had loaded upon the Horse, on which he rode, four half Anchors of Brandy,

And, Gentlemen, supposing it is proved to you, that this Man was arm'd with two others arm'd, and carrying off Goods, is sufficient to bring it within the Intention of this Act of Parliament, which is the Third, the Fact of rescuing the Goods.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, under these Circumstances this Prisoner is brought before you; and it is of very great Consequence to the Publick, if he is guilty he should be found so. All the World have complain'd of the unhappy Condition of two or three Counties in England, where the Practice of Smuggling is grown to that great Heighth, that the Inhabitants know not how to lie safe in their Beds for fear of them. Gentlemen, as the Legislature thought it necessary to make this Act of Parliament, to prevent so pernicious a Practice to the common Peace of the Kingdom, if it is proved, I don't doubt but you will find him guilty of the Fact he is charg'd with.</p>

When we came up to them they drew up in a Body together, and we ask'd them what they had, we said we would have it all; then they presented their Fire-Arms, two or three long Pieces, one was a brass Piece; they presented these Pieces, and swore we should have none of the Goods; we cut the Goods from the Horses, we cut thirty Half Anchors, we believe there were 150 in the whole. One of them, when I came up first, struck me across the Head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other strike you?</p>
               <p>Mortimer. No, I don't know the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say in your Defence?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please ye, my Lord, as I was going along the Road I met these People accidently, but what Mr Simpson says of my saying I would fire at him, is intirely false. I have a Wife and eight Children, and had it not been in the Day-time, I should have had no Business there , and I had no Arms nor nothing for defence; I had nothing in my Hand to obstruct the Officers or defend myself, and I never followed the Affair. Please ye, my Lord, I could have had thirty People to my Character, but I have not wherewith to do it, for I have nothing to support myself. Mr Simpson has known me some Years .</p>

            . The Prisoner at the Bar came to my House on Friday, the 22nd of May, and she brought me this Yarn, and ask'd me if I would buy it, I ask'd her what she would have for it, she said 18 d. I said, Woman I am afraid you did not come-by this Yarn honestly; so I stopp'd the Yarn, and said, if you can bring any body to your Reputation, and prove you came honestly by it, you shall have it again, or I will buy it of you. She went away, and came no more. I said to my Man, may be your Cousin may have lost this Yarn; so being ask'd, he said he had lost none; but he said there is a Man in Spitalfields who throws such Yarn, Mr Mackenzie; so Mr Mackenzie told him, to look over all his People, which he did, but did not see her at that Time; he went again on Tuesday, and saw her at work.</p>

On the 22d of May she came with a Parcel that is stopp'd, I went to a Relation's that dealt pretty largely in that Yarn, he told me, he had not lost any, but told me that Mr Mackenzie, dealt pretty largely in it; so Mr Mackenzie said I should go to see his Workwomen.

               <p>Jones. I heard a Noise in the House, and in a short time after the Boy came down Stairs and cry'd Murder; and said, Master, I am murdered. My Wife let him in; and when he came into the Room his Face look'd as if it had been in a Blood Tub. I did not much mind it when he knock'd at the Door; I thought he had been saucy and they had given him a knock. My Wife says to me, Why don't you get up, Sam. is murdering the old Man? So I went up Stairs; as soon as I got in at the Door, (he stood with this thing in his Hand) I said, 
               <persName id="t17470604-19-person250">

             do you mean by it? I had no sooner said the Word, but he stabb'd me directly.</p>
               <p>(The Witness show'd the Wound to the Court, and produc'd the Instrument with which the Murder was committed.)</p>
               <p>When he stabb'd me in the Belly then I went to seize him, to see what he had got. I thought I had receiv'd a knock. I did not think of a Stab at first: Then I clos'd with him. I saw that he overpower'd me, and I call'd to my Wife and Daughter; and the Girl brought a Candle in her Hand, and the Prisoner attempted to blow the Candle out; and the other lay upon the Floor all the time kill'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the Deceas'd say any thing?</p>
               <p>Jones. He said, he will murder you, as he has done me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this that you went up?</p>
               <p>Jones . I can't say directly the time, it might be about two o'Clock. I went up without a Candle , but the Girl brought up a Candle.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you observ'd him standing.</p>
               <p>Jones. I saw him standing, and I thought to struggle with him, but when I went to struggle with him he cut my two Fingers, but I did not part from him till I got this Thing from him. When we had got the Mastery of him, then the Boy went down Stairs, and let the Neighbours in; then he dress'd himself; we were all naked, he , my Wife, and I and the Boy, we had nothing on but our Shirts. The old Man that is dead had never a Shirt on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing farther?</p>
               <p>Jones. We took the Prisoner up; he was carried to the Cage, from the Cage to the Justice's. I believe what we have said here was said before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not examine the Deceased ?</p>
               <p>Jones. I went to the Infirmary after he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after this?</p>
               <p>Jones. It might be two or three Hours; I can't say, it might be more or less.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any Wounds upon him?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, Sir, I saw something stick out of his Belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Blood?</p>
               <p>Jones. I saw a great deal of Blood upon the Floor; I'll engage a Quart or two; at least there was that, for it soak'd quite through the Cieling. I saw a great many Wounds on a great many Parts of his Body.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Would you ask this Witness any Questions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You did not see him?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, I did not see you do any thing to him at all; but I felt you hit me; did you not hit me?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know that.</p>

               <p>Q. What Sort of a Noise?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I heard a Groaning, then I heard Pitts, the Deceased, cry out Murder. Then said he, Sam. has knock'd me down again. Sam. said he, What have I done to you, that you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174706040029"/> use me so? A little while after I hears Mr Jones up in the Shop, I heard him say, he has got a Sword or Dagger in his Hand; he cry'd out Murder, to the best of my Knowledge. I went down Stairs and knock'd at the Door, and Johnson the Apprentice came to the Door all bloody. I took the Candle and went up Stairs. I saw the Deceased lie in the Middle of the Room, naked, all bloody, and great Quantities of Blood. The Prisoner never spoke; but the first Word I said, See what you have done? You have killed the Man, his Guts come out - He lay on the Floor all over bloody; he had no other Colour , - the Prisoner had nothing on but his Shirt and Cap.</p>

               <p>Sheilds. Between three and four o'Clock on Monday Morning, the 11th of May, the Deceased was brought to the London Infirmary . I found the Deceased in the Agonies of Death . I examin'd several Wounds he had about him; some in his Breast ; some in his Belly; to the Number of thirteen . He had bled a great Quantity of Blood, as I was informed.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of Wounds were they?</p>
               <p>Sheilds . I have seen the Bayonet , and I am ready to think they were made with that . I ordered him to-bed , and a Servant to attend him; and order'd them to give an Attention, if they could hear if he should speak, but he could not speak.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you tell us, whether any of those Wounds were of such a Nature, that you think might be the Cause of his Death?</p>
               <p>Sheilds . I examin'd the Body, and found four Wounds in the Breast, one of which had enter'd the Heart, another the left Lobe of the Lungs, another had entered the Liver an Inch and a half, another Wound had enter'd the Liver four Inches deep; each of which Wounds would have been mortal, and I apprehend, they were the immediate Cause of his Death.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner . Will you ask this Witness any Question ? What have you to say for yourself? What Defence do you make ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I let the Deceased in about twelve o'Clock on Sunday Night; after letting him in I went to bed again and he too, and I went to sleep, and some how or other he got himself atop of me about two o'Clock. I awak'd in a Surprize, and I said, Mr Pitts, What are you about to do? Says he, you d - d Dog, I'll murder you. Will you, says I; He gets out of the Bed, and I got out of the Bed, and took that Bayonet, and stood in my own Defence.</p>
               <p>Q. And pray, what had the Deaceased in his Hand ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know of any thing he had , I did not see any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing farther to say in your Defence? Or have you any Witnesses to call ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, my Lord, there can be no Witnesses, because there was no body with us.</p>

            . Give an Account of that Coat you deliver'd before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Harding. The Day that my Wife bought this Coat I was out. I read the Advertisement, and carried the Coat upon my Back, and went and demanded the Money that my Wife paid for it.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Harding. The Prisoner came to my House, (I keep a publick House) it was the 3d of May, as near as I can guess, the Prisoner came in and call'd for a Pint of Beer and smoak'd a Pipe; so he ask'd me, if I would buy a Coat for my Husband, for he had an extraordinary Bargain . I said his Coat would not come upon one of my Husband's Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for it?</p>
               <p>Harding. Sixteen Shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by it?</p>
               <p>Harding. He said he traffick'd in Brandy, and the Coat was pawn'd for 7 s. that he had bought it of a Gentleman in the Fleet, a Portuguese Gentleman . I gave him 16 s. all but 4 d. for it.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Have you any Witnesses that saw you buy the Coat .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not know my Trial would come on. I have dealt with this Mr Harding, have sold him Liquors, and gave him Permits with them. I had the Coat in lieu of some Brandy at the Fleet.</p>

Gentlemen, The Cafe I have to lay before you is as wicked a one as ever appeared. It is not only a Crime Committed by herself , but 'tis seducing a Youth of about thirteen Years of Age to be a confederate with her in robbing of her Master. The Case as I am instructed is this; She was hired to live with the Prosecutor Mr Alcock; she continued there but a little white; and there was a Boy, one

She prevails with the Boy to take out Money out of his Master's Till at several Times. The Boy was at last detected. And then comes still a greater Crime, she desir'd the Boy to suppress the Truth, and to charge his own Sister of that Crime she was not only guilty, but guilty of inducing him to commit it. We shall likewise prove his desiring to charge his own Sister with the Crime.</p>

               <p>Alcock. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of the Prisoner at the Bar taking any thing of your's, and what?</p>
               <p>Alcock. I have lost Money several Times; sometimes a Guinea, and sometimes half a Guinea, and other Pieces of Money. I examin'd how this could Possibly be. I never thought or the Boy not the Maid.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did you examine first.</p>
               <p>Alcock. There was a Gentleman in the Neighbourhood came to me, and says, Who does this Boy belong to? He lays out a great debt of Money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174706040032"/> in the Neighbourhood; what do give him a Week? I says, the common Custom is Half-a-Crown a Week; immediately upon this I examined him, and upon searching of him, I found in a Button-hole of his Waistcoat this 18 s. Piece, I have in my Hand; upon that he confess'd the whole Affair; he confess'd he had from Time to Time taken a Guinea out of my Till, &amp;c. Sir, says he, I'll tell you the whole Affair, she broke the Lock before my Face, and there happen'd to be no Money, says she this won't do at this Time. So they go a second time, and he breaks open the Lock, after he had been tutor'd so to do; when she came to him this second Time, Now says she, Dick, try what you can do; the Boy tries, and he opens it , and there happen'd to be Money; Now , says she, take it out and give it me, which he did, and had done it sundry Times; she sometimes gave him 3 or 4 s. out if it, and bid him be a good Boy.</p>
               <p>Court. Then all you know of your own Knowledge is, that you lost Money at several Times out of your Till; do you know any Things of your own Knowledge against the Prisoner at the Bar, touching particular Pieces of Pork?</p>
               <p>Alcock. She took some Pieces of Pork, and carried them to one Mrs Thomson, by Battle-Bridge, the other side of the Water; I heard her acknowledge it before a Person that shall inform the Court of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the Prisoner at the Bar own she had took this Pork, or the Boy?</p>
               <p>Alcock . When I went to her, Oh, says she, if I had not acknowledge the Pork, as for the Money you could have done nothing.</p>

               <p>Wood. She bid me try what I could do, to open the Till.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get up?</p>
               <p>Wood. Yes, Sir, and I opened the Till with a bit of Steel, that was in a Drawer in the Shop, and took a Guinea in Gold, and some Silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that Money?</p>
               <p>Wood. I gave it into her Hands, and she gave me about a couple of Shillings; and she gave me my Victuals that Day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come down at any other Time?</p>
               <p>Wood. Yes, Sir.</p>

               <p>Wood. No, Sir, not when she was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the Piece of Gold?</p>
               <p>Wood. My Master found it about me, in my Cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have an 18 s. Piece?</p>
               <p>Wood. It was out of the 36 s. Piece that was changed, which I took out of the Till.</p>
               <p>Council. The first Time you say there was nothing found in the Till?</p>
               <p>Wood. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. The next Time you open'd the Till?</p>
               <p>Wood. The next Time I open'd the Till, and I found Silver and Gold, there was an 18 s. Piece, or a Guinea.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174706040033"/>Q. Did you or she open the Till at any other Time?</p>
               <p>Wood . Not she and I together, but I have open'd it by myself, and have carried it to her, and she has given me something out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it?</p>
               <p>Wood. I used to carry it to her after she had lived at another Place; I used to carry it to her, and she used to give me 3 or 4 s. and my Victuals in the Park.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Times may you have carried Money to her in this Manner?</p>
               <p>Wood. Several Times.</p>
               <p>Q. How much Money may you have carried to her in the whole?</p>
               <p>Wood. About 15 l.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you was charged with doing those Crimes?</p>
               <p>Wood . When I took the 36 s. Piece, then I changed it, and gave her 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the Remainder of the Money ?</p>
               <p>Wood. I had that about me in my Waistcoat , my Master had that, and 10 s. I gave her, and the rest I spent . It was Master's little Girl that found the 18 s. Piece upon me; she saw a little of it stick out of the Button-hole of my Waistcoat .</p>
               <p>Q. Had your Master examined you before?</p>
               <p>Wood . Yes, but he found but four Pence halfpenny about me; he did not think of any thing being in the Button-hole of my Waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon it's being found upon you, what did you say?</p>
               <p>Wood. I gave it to my Master. I was just about being sent out of an Errand, when I returned I told them all; I told them how it was my Sister that persuaded me; the Maid told me whenever I was catch'd, I should say it was my Sister , and never say it was her, and I did say so .</p>
               <p>Q. Was your Sister ever concern'd in this Affair?</p>
               <p>Wood. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does this Sister live?</p>
               <p>Wood. She lives in Ratcliff-Highway .</p>
               <p>Q. Was your Sister ever at your Master's House ?</p>
               <p>Wood . Never.</p>
               <p>Q. And what was done to your Sister ?</p>
               <p>Wood. My Master put her into the Poultrey-Compter ; then I told it was this Maid.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after did you tell it was the Maid?</p>
               <p>Wood. About two Days afterward .</p>
               <p>Council for the Defendant to the Witness Wood , I think the first Time the Maid open'd the Till, there was nothing; the second Time that you open'd it, there was something?</p>
               <p>Wood. Yes, the first Time she was present with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she ever present when you open'd the Till afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Wood. No.</p>
               <p>Council. What sort of Coin did you find at several Times afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Wood. Sometimes a Guinea, and sometimes Shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the 18 s. you first found in the Till?</p>
               <p>Wood. She was along with me, and I delivered it into her Hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the several Coins at other Times that you took?</p>
               <p>Wood. Sometimes a Guinea, and sometimes Shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find 18 s. afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Wood. I found 36 s. the last Day, and that I chang'd.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you change it?</p>
               <p>Wood. I chang'd it into Silver, and there was an 18 s. Piece in that, and that 18 s. Piece was found upon me.</p>
               <p>Council. Pray how long had the Maid been gone from the Place before you made this Discovery ?</p>
               <p>Wood. She had been gone 10 Months, or three Quarters of a Year .</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she in the House with you?</p>
               <p>Wood . A good while, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. There was no Money in the Till at the Time that she open'd it?</p>
               <p>Wood. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the Maid live in the House with you?</p>
               <p>Wood. Half a Year, I believe .</p>

               <p>Council. Did you hear her own she had taken away two Pieces of pickled Pork?</p>
               <p>Chute. I did, and she sent them away to one Mrs Thomson's. Mr Alcock got her to this Publick House , because he would not go to her Place to expose her; she wanted then a little private Discourse to make up the Affair, than to come to before a publick Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say to you?</p>
               <p>Chute. Says she, this may be made up in a private Manner by some Gentlemen, than before a publick Court; at this Time there was a Person came and call'd her out, and said something to her; then she came in again, and said she was sorry she had confess'd any thing about the Pork, but for the Money they could not hurt her.</p>

             came and knock'd at the Door of our Room, and said, She would break the Door open. With that my Wife bid this Boy by me open the Door. I was in Bed when she came into the Room, She demanded the Bolster , and Words arose . My Wife said, she should not have the Bolster till we had the things she had of ours. I bid her to depart the Room, but she did not think proper to do it. She said she would not go till she had her Bolster. So my Wife was going across the Room she either struck my Wife, or push'd her, I can't say which . My Wife fell; I seeing my Wife falling, I jump'd out of Bed. I saw her Hand go; whether it was pushing or striking I can't say; and my Wife never spoke afterwards .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go and look upon your Wife?</p>
               <p>Swetman . I went to my Wife to give her some Water, but there was no Passage. Mrs May, the Woman of the House, came to the Door. I said I was busy with my Wife, I could not open it. With that she said, she would break it open. I went and open 'd the Door, and she came or look 'd into the Room.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did your Wife lay from the Door?</p>
               <p>Seaman. But a little Way.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Mrs May to know it?</p>
               <p>Seaman. When I got out of Bed, after the Prisoner had flung my Wife down, this Woman, the Prisoner , cried out Murder; and this Mrs May came in, or look'd in, and said, Lord have Mercy upon me, she is dead. I went to lift her up on the Bed, and her Head fell every Way , and never stirr'd more. Immediately after that the Constable and Watchmen came, and she, the Prisoner, was committed, and I also, till the Coroner had sat upon her; and it was the Opinion of them, I heard, that the Fall was the Cause of her Death. When I charg'd the Prisoner she charg'd me, and I was put into Consinement .</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174706040037"/>Q. Did you examine your Wife what was the Matter with her; whether there was any Bruise upon her?</p>

               <p>Swetman. Before two o'Clock I was in the Watch-house .</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body examine her ?</p>
               <p>Swetman. I heard there was a Fracture in her Head , which they thought was the Occasion of her Death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your Wife well before this happen'd?</p>
               <p>Swetman . Yes, she was about to eat her Supper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did no body examine your Wife, to see what was the Matter with her?</p>
               <p>Swetman . None, to my Knowledge, it was not in my Power to send any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the other Witness?</p>
               <p>Swetman. My Son, this Child; none but he was by.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is that Boy?</p>
               <p>Sweetman . If he lives till next October he will be ten Years old.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say to this Matter ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went into the Room for a Bolster I had lent them two Months before. I wanted it for a Person that came to lie with me. They insisted upon it, that I should not have it. He got out of Bed and struck me, and throw'd me down. In the mean time his Wife fell down. I disputed with him, and not with her; the Woman never touch'd me, nor I her.</p>
               <p>- May. I was at Supper, and about eleven o'Clock the Prisoner at the Bar went from me. This House joins to the House that I live in. As I was at Supper, I could hardly have thought she was got up Stairs, one Upton told me there was a Cry of Murder in the House. I turned into the Shop, and said, What Confusion is this, to have Murder cry'd? When I came in I met the Prisoner at the Bar. I said, Where is Murder cry'd? And they said, it was in Swetman's Room. The Deceased fell so near the Door that I could not push forwards. I look'd in, and said, Oh dear! What is done? I look'd in, and there was the Husband and Son. I knock'd at the Door, and he did not open it for some time; and I said, if he did not open it I would break it open by Violence; and when I insisted upon the Door being open'd, he said, I will let you in presently, and he opened the Door; and he said, I was giving my Wife some Water. I look'd, but there was none . He was first charg'd. The Prisoner was without side of the Room when she cry'd Murder.</p>
               <p>- Upton. I was in my own Apartment. I lodge in the same House. I heard Murder cry'd. Mrs Williams cry'd Murder. I ask'd Mr May, as he was Landlord of the House, to go up with me. I said, for God's sake, don't let there be Murder cry'd in the House and no body go up. I went up, and I saw the Deceased, some Part of her was upon the Bed, and some Part on the Ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any Wound upon the Woman that was dead?</p>
               <p>Upton . No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look for any?</p>
               <p>Upton. No, my Lord.</p>
