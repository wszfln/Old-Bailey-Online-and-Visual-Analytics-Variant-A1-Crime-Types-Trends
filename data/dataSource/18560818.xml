                  </hi>. I am articled to an attorney. I have purchased a little property at Whitton, near Hounslow, and have been building a rear deuce on it—I first went to the Tillage about twelve months ago, and took lodgings at the prisoner Smith's residence, to superintend the building—I occupied those lodgings up to about a month since—on 15th or 16th June I purchased a bird of a man named Walker, and on the same evening the two prisoners came down to my house, on my return from a drive, and Goldsbrough claimed the bird—I told him that if he would bring Mr. Walker, and he would say that it was his, he should have it—Smith was present—he turned round, and said, "You b——Jew, what do you mean by doubting my word?"—I then left the cottage, followed by Goldsbrough and Smith—Goldsbrough abused me down the village—I had said nothing to exaspe<lb/>rate him more than I have stated—next day I had occasion to pass Golds<lb/>brough's house, and he held up a board with "<hi rend="italic">Old Clo</hi>" on it, and on my return from the Magistrate's at Brentford, where I went to take out a summons for abusive language, the house was placarded with other boards, "Hot pies;" "Pork;" "Fried fish;" I have a witness here who took a sketch of the house with the boards—in the afternoon he hooted after me, and gave the boys pence to do the same—the boys told me so—this board (<hi rend="italic">A portrail with a large nose, inscribed, "The portrait of Judas Iscariot</hi>")</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185608180002"/>
               <p>was put up outside the house—I cannot walk down the village now unless I am hooted at—I was never hooted at before the boards were put up—the summons was heard on 28th June, and Goldsbrough was fined 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the boards were not removed that day, but Smith removed them the Sunday afterwards—I saw him do it—I have mistaken the date, the summons was heard on the 28th, but Smith removed them the week before that—Smith said, "If you will withdraw all proceedings, I will take down the boards; if not, they shall hang till they rot"—I said, "Pray take them down, and I will withdraw proceedings," and he took them down on the Sunday before the 28th—it was on Saturday that the summons was heard, and it was on the Sunday before that, that Smith took them down—when he took then down he put them in his own front parlour, and I agreed to withdraw the summons, but a friend told me something on the same Sunday that he removed them, and I went out, and found he had left one in the window, with the words, "To let; no b—Jew or <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man need apply"—on the day after the summons was heard, the 29th, the boards were replaced—I saw Smith bring them from his house, with a man named <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, and Golds<lb/>brough assisted him, and said "I will defy the law; I will keep you out of the village"—that course of conduct was continued till 6th July, and on 6th July I went before the Magistrate again—they were both bound over to keep the peace, and the Magistrate cautioned them to remove the boards, but they kept them up till the 9th or 10th, and the same course of conduct was pursued towards me—Goldsbrough called me a Jew vagabond, a Jew <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> driver, a scoundrel, and an uncircumcised Jew, and said before some females that I had only half a, and my wife knew it—on the 12th the Magistrate said, "I cautioned you to remove the boards, and you had no business to let them remain a moment longer," and he bound them over to appear here—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) represents the house, with the boards on it, as taken by a gentleman expressly—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

On 15th June, and some little time afterwards, I was acting as groom to the prosecutor—on 15th June I was having my tea, and Smith came in and told me about the bird—he said that there would be a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>: that Mr. Goldsbrough was coining to see Mr. George about the bird; and I do not think a quarter of an hour elapsed before he brought Goldsbrough, and there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I saw the inscriptions on Goldsbrough's house next day, and a intervals up to 6th July—I have seen Mr. George hooted by the people in the village frequently, and other members of his family, my mistress as well, and I have been hooted after repeatedly—that never happened till the inscriptions were put up, but it has happened ever since—I heard Smith say that Mr. George had better give 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than have anything to do with this case—that was about a month ago—we had been before the Magistrate once then—it was between the time that Goldsbrough was fined and the second summons being taken out—I have seen Smith at Goldsbrough's house while the boards were up—he was there on the Sunday that they were being put up.</p>

               <p>years within a fortnight—I lived with him at No. 49, Beaumont-street—he is a gentleman, and something in the law, I believe—he never had any quarrels with any other people, to my recollection—he has been respected till this took place—it was at Neville's public house that Smith said about the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was about three weeks after the affair of the bird—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> about the bird—Mr. George was not very violent; he was not in a passion; he was rather irritated, because Goldsbrough got squaring up to him—he told him that he was not going to have him there making a disturbance on Sunday night—he said that he should do just as he liked in his place, as Mr. George was only a lodger—the bird died the same night—Mr. George went by the name of George in Beaumont-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and watchmaker, of Church-street, Pad<lb/>dington. In June last Smith called on me, and asked me if I had heard the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> which had taken place between a man named Goldsbrough and Mr. George—I said, "Unfortunately I have, and I am sorry to think that net disgraceful proceedings have taken place, for Mr. George is very little known as a Jew; and I have been here fourteen years, and never had a word with a single person; and people will think that it is me"—he said that he would take care that people should know that it was not me, but Mr. George; and after they had been before the Magistrate, he called on me, and informed me that the boards had been taken down, but were re<lb/>put up, and that other matters would come out against Mr. George which would drive him out of the village—I have heard the prosecutor hooted after, and his family—Mrs. George came and fetched me, and I went with her, and saw some twenty boys, girls, women, and men, Mr. George was attempting to get hold of one of the young men, but I begged him not, but to go home, being Sunday, and I would find the man's name out; and he went home—they were laughing and hooting at him—I cannot say whether Mr. Smith owed Mr. George a grudge, but Mr. Smith wanted to borrow money of him when he lost his wife—he refused, but I lent him some—he spoke of that afterwards to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an insurance agent, of No. 4, Albert-road, Dalston. I saw the prisoner running out of Leadenhall-street; there was nobody before him, to my knowledge—I attempted to stop him, but did not succeed, and followed him into Brown's-buildings, where I saw a pone fall, to the best of my knowledge, from the prisoner—I do not think there was anybody in front of him from whom it could have fallen.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see it drop at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I knew that it was a purse at the time it dropped—I saw it a foot and a half before it readied the pavement—persons clustered round, but I was the leader into Brown's-buildings except the prisoner—at the time I saw it drop, the policeman, the prisoner, and myself were the only three who had got into Brown's-buildings—I was behind the prisoner all the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the manager of Mr. Frederick Dent's business, a chronometer maker, at the Royal Exchange. On the morning of 15th Aug., about 10 minutes past 11 o'clock, the prisoner came in—he took a watch from his pocket, and said, "I have a gold watch, but I have no chain, I wish to purchase one"—I showed him a variety of chains, and he then asked for a gold seal to attach to the chain—I had merely to turn my eye from the counter to a drawer, and in the act of so doing, observed the prisoner abstract a gold chain, and place it in his left trowsers pocket—I discontinued my search, and told him I missed a chain from the tray, on which he made a sudden motion, and replaced the chain on another tray—I immediately told him that that was the chain which he had taken out of his pocket, and which he had stolen, and I should give him into custody—I detained him some time, till the porter came in, and I sent him for an officer—shortly after, the prisoner bolted out of the shop into the Royal Exchange—I followed him, and called "Stop thief!"—he was stopped after</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185608180011"/>
               <p>a time, and I gave him into custody—I gave the chain to the officer—the prisoner was taken to Bow-lane station—he had not asked the price of the chain—it was taken from the tray he was looking at—I had shown him some others, and told him the price of one—he said it was not good enough, I then showed him the others—this chain was double the price of the Albert chain I had shown him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman. I was passing along Thames-street, on Thursday, 17th July, about half past 2 o'clock in the day; I had a little canvas bag in my pocket—I took it out to pay a man for two herrings—I returned the bag into my pocket again—there was about four shillings in it—I went towards Upper Thames-street—the prisoner was standing against a wall, within about a couple of doors of No. 122, Lower Thames-street, and there were two men standing parallel with him—one was just off the kerb, and the other on the kerb—when I came up they closed together, and I could not pass through—I stood a moment, and told them I wanted to go through—the prisoner took hold of my left arm and gave me a violent pinch, and with his other hand he took my bag out of my pocket, and passed it to the other two—I did not see him pass it to them, but he passed by them to go towards the wall in Thames-street—he then passed down Dark House-lane—I called out to him, and said, "You have robbed me"—I called out, "Stop thief!"—a postman went after him—I followed, and called, "Stop thief!"—he was stopped by the people before I could reach him, and a policeman took him—I never got my bag again—there was nothing found on him—I am quite certain he is the man that took it.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ six weeks—on or about 4th Aug. he said that he was unwell, and desired to leave me—I agreed, and he left, but there was no settlement—I had missed property eight or ten days before that, and mentioned the matter, not to him personally, but in his presence—he said nothing that I heard—I missed some more property, but not half of what has been found—the officer brought some part to me, two or three days after the prisoner left, and made me look round, and then I missed a large quantity—there were fire shawls, two muffs, two victorines, some lace and muslin collars, and several other articles, all of which I identify—they were safe a very short time before, and had not been sold—the value of the first parcel sold was from 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the second, 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and the third, from 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

The prisoner has been a customer of mine for about four or five Sunday mornings—he invariably had something in his hand when he came, generally a paper parcel—last Sunday fortnight he came with an immense bundle on his shoulder; he put it on my block, and said, "It is excessively hot"—I said, "Yes,"—he said, "I wish you would allow me to leave this parcel here till to-morrow morning, for it is so excessively hot I cannot carry it further"—I said, "I had rather you would not leave it here; our place is very greasy, and I do not know what it contains"—he said, "Pray let me leave it," and I allowed him to leave it in the back part of the shop; he then purchased 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of meat, which he did not pay for, but said, "I will come in the morning, fetch the bundle, and pay the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I saw no more of him till Tuesday, he then said that he had come for some things out of the bundle; he opened it in the shop and took two pieces of, perhaps it was silk, out; wrapped it up, and then left the shop and purchased some paper for the remainder—I said, "It is an unpleasant thing, take it away—he said, "I will take it away at night"—I afterwards communicated with Coppin, the sergeant of police; he came and I showed bin) the articles—the articles I gave him afterwards were what I received from the prisoner—I was present on the Friday, when Coppin and the prisoner were at my shop—the prisoner said, "Good morning, Sir, I have come for my parcel"—I told Coppin who he was; he got before him, and said, "You do not know me"—he said, "No"—Coppin said, "I am a sergeant of police, and before you can have that parcel I must know more about it"—I have heard the sergeant examined—the account of the conversation he has given with the prisoner is quite correct.</p>

The prisoner came to my place of business on Friday, 27th June last—he first spoke to me in French, a language I do not understand—on telling him that, he spoke in English—he said, "I want you to do me some fac<lb/>similes"—he at first asked me whether I could do fac-similes, and I said, "Yes"—when I showed him the specimens, he said, "That is the very thing I want"—he then showed me a piece of newspaper to indicate the size of what he wanted—he wanted me to do between 100 and 125 fac-similes—I asked him some questions upon that—he said, "I want 125"—he showed me how to place them, and I said, "You want them for portraits?"—he said, "Yes"—he asked me for the price—I made out my estimate, and told him it would be 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "Have you got 125 stones of the size?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "If you have not got them all that size I would rather pay you a sovereign more"—he said, "Are you a printer yourself?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "That is all right then"—he then produced a paper from his pocket, and showed it me—he wanted me to do the signature, to make a fac-simile of the signature—I undertook to do it—he was to call and see it the next day at 12 o'clock, Saturday—he then went away—he came at 12 o'clock on Saturday—I had done the fac-simile, and showed it to him—this is it—he compared it with the letter, and said it was excellently done; he would send it off by post (on Saturday), and let me have an answer in about two days—he came again on the Monday, 30th June—he first produced to me this paper—it was printed without the signatures—he wanted me to do the signatures, the fac-similes from the signatures which he brought—I see the signatures that have been cut out of the genuine bond—they were the signatures that he produced to me, and wished me to put on the blank me that he brought—I asked him what the paper was—he said, "They are only passports to send persons to South America"—I undertook to make the fac-similes—he then produced a parcel of similar papers without the signa<lb/>tures, about 100—I was to affix the same signatures to those 100—I was to get them done for him in fourteen days—he first spoke to me about 100 or 125 fac-similes—after he showed me that parcel, he said, "I want, instead of 125 fac-similes, 1,500"—I made my estimate out, and told him it would be 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he agreed to pay it—I asked him who he was, and where he lived—he said, "Oh, I am living in the country"—I said, "Well, will you oblige me with some reference, please?"—I asked him his name and address; then I asked him for a reference—he said, "Well, I shall leave you a deposit; how much shall I leave you?"—I said, "About five or six pounds"—he said, "I shall leave you 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he left me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which I gave him a receipt—I made some inquiry of lie Peruvian Consul next morning—I was after<lb/>wards introduced to an officer of the detective police, and acted under his orders—after this the prisoner came to me every day, and brought me other papers to do—I had 200 finished by the Wednesday, with the signatures to them—he called on the Wednesday—I have blinds to my windows—he said, "Can you manage, Mr. Deutsch, to keep your door, shut, and your blinds down?"—I said, "Oh, I can manage that"—he wanted me to finish off a certain number a day, and let him have them, and I declined that; I said I would not deliver them until they were all finished—he called from day to day to see how they were getting on—I showed them to him from time to time—afterwards he asked me to return him the original signatures</p>

I remember the prisoners coming up to me, and Beckley—I saw Fuller pass a note to Beckley—Beckley asked me if I could give him change for it—I said I could not, but, if he would come with me to Mr. Twohy's, I would get it changed for him—I and Beckley went towards Whitecross-street—the prisoners did not go with us—I think they followed behind—I and Beckley went into Twohy's house—I asked Twohy to change the note—he said he had not sufficient change, and took it out to get change—on his return he said it was a forged note—I then spoke to Beckley, and said, in consequence of the note being a forged one, I should immediately go to the police office—the prisoners could not bear what passed—Beckley left the house—I went to the house, at the corner of Chiswell-street and Whitecross-street—the prisoners did not go with me; they followed afterwards; then Beckley came, and then the police followed—Sergeant Foulger said, "Where are the men, Mr. Harding, with regard to this note?"—I said, "There they are"—they were then sitting down by the tide of me—I do not think they made any observation at that time—the officers took them into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer shop, at No. 20, Lower Whitecross-street On Friday afternoon, 4th July, Harding and Beckley came to my house—I knew Harding before—Beckley was a stranger—Harding asked me for change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, this is the note—I had not sufficient change, and went out to get it—when I came back I told them it was a bad note, and a forgery, and they ought not to bring it in to me—upon that they consulted together, and I believe one of them went to the station house.</p>

On Friday afternoon, 4th July, from information I received from Beckley, I went to Twohy's beer shop; I ascertained there that a forged note had been uttered by a man named Harding, and from there I went in search of Harding to a public house at the corner of Chiswell-street, and Whitecross-street; close to Twohy's—I there found the two prisoners, and Harding and Beckley—I said to Hard<lb/>ing, "I understand you have uttered a forged note at Twohy's beer shop, where did you get it from?"—we were all close together, and within hearing—he said, "That man," pointing to Fuller, "gave it to Beckley, and Beckley gave it to me, I thought it was a good one"—I then said to Fuller, "You hear what Mr. Harding has said, is it true?"—Fuller said, "I know nothing of the note, or the man either"—Robertson also said, "I know nothing about it"—I then said, "You must consider yourselves in custody, and go with me to the station"—I took charge of Fuller, and handed Robertson over to Hubble—in going along Robertson got away from Hubble at the corner of Milton-street and Fore-street—I saw him running away, and Hubble after him, but I continued on with Fuller—at Moor-lane, Fuller got away from me—after I overtook him, I took him into the station—he gave a false name and address—after the charge was booked, he said he would tell the truth about it, he found the note in this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said that he met Robertson on Finsbury-pavement (this was in Robert<lb/>son's presence), and told him that he had got a note, and was going to make some money of it; and if he would go with him he would give him a bob or two out of it—Robertson said, "He asked me to go with him, but I know nothing about the note."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, carrying on business in Mark-lane. I am acquainted with Mr. Cockayne—on the evening when this occurred I was in his shop, about 20 minutes before 6 o'clock—I observed two men at the window—the prisoner, to the best of my belief, was one—the upper part of his face struck me very particularly—he had a hat on which struck me as rather peculiar—I said something to Mr. Cockayne, and he looked at those two men—I did not take any more notice of them—I continued there two or three minutes—I knew nothing of the robbery till the fol<lb/>lowing morning—the man who I believed was the prisoner had no mous<lb/>tache or beard—I did not notice the other man so much—I next saw the man, who I believe was the prisoner, at the Mansion House, I think on the 26th of July—I did not recognize him immediately—I said he was exces<lb/>sively like the nan that I saw, but I should be sorry to swear to him positively—he is now different in appearance, but I still believe distinctly that he is the man—the upper part of his face is what I speak to more particularly.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of the 18th June, I was at the corner of Mark-lane, in Tower-street, about 6 or very near 6 o'clock—I was going along Tower-street, and a man ran against me—he had no hat on—I turned round, and looked at him—I said, "Why don't you mind where you are running to?"—he gave me no answer—I had an opportunity of seeing his face—the prisoner is the man—he went down Water-lane, which is very nearly opposite Mark-lane—I saw another man in Mark-lane with Mr. Cockayne and Mr. Williams—I next saw the prisoner at the Mansion House—I looked at him, and knew him as he passed me by—I was sitting down stairs, and he passed me by—there were some others with him—nothing had been said to me before that he was coming—when he ran against me, I looked in his face—he was bleeding over his left eye.</p>

               <p>me whether he was the man or not—I did not at first say, "He is like him, hot I thought he had lighter hair;" I did not mention that word at all—I Was positively sure he was the man—I was quite sure he had a lighter coat on—I did not say anything about the hair—he was running from Mark-lane into Tower-street—he was going to turn, but he took a thought, and ran across, and down Water-lane—there was nobody at all running beside the man—there were some persons up the lane—I could not see Mr. Cockayne's shop—at the time the prisoner was running, there were not other men and women running also, not in that spot—they did not come so far as this prisoner came, they stopped at the other crowd, where the other man was.</p>

I keep a boarding house, in St. George's in the East I know the last witness by sight—on Wednesday evening, 18th June, I was in Great Tower-street, close upon 6 o'clock—when I got to the corner of Mark-lane, I saw a man running down Mark-lane with his hands full of jewellery; gold chains, Alberts, and one thing or another—I saw Mr. Cockayne hanging behind the back of the man, and I heard him cry, "Stop thief!"—I collared the man, and he was taken—he was a man who was convicted here by the name of Stephens—while I had hold of him, I saw the prisoner running down Mark-lane, towards Tower-street; he had no hat or cap on his head—I looked at him—he had a slight beard or whisker on his face, not the same as he has now, not half so much—he got away—I never saw him again till last Friday, in Newgate—he was in the yard amongst fourteen other prisoners; I recognized him the moment I saw him—he was the same man I have been telling you of.</p>

On the night of 27th June I was returning home—it was late—I do not know exactly the time—I had come down Long-acre—after I left there, Sullivan and Ravenscroft spoke to me—one of them spoke French to me, and they walked along with me two streets further—I asked them where King-street was—they told me they lived in King-street—we came to the corner of another street, which I have heard is Charles-street—as soon as I turned the corner some persons caine from behind—I was seized—my throat was pressed, I was forced back—my spectacles were taken from my head—my throat was pressed, so that I could not cry out—two or three or four men seized me, robbed me of my watch and purse and a gold pin—they came from behind—I had not seen anybody—I had no opportunity of seeing them—I did not see them—there were three or four men—I think the girls had left me when I was at that place—I could not see very well—as soon as the men had rifled my pockets, a policeman came up—they ran away, I think, as soon as they saw the policeman coming—I pointed the policeman to the passage that I saw them go to—I went with him to the house, and into all the rooms—I saw Quinton lying on a sideboard—after I had been robbed, I saw the men go into a passage, and I think in that passage was the house in which I found Quinton—I found him about ten minutes after I had been robbed—my purse contained about 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I am a sister of the female ward of Charing-cross Hospital It is part of my duty to give out the linen to be washed—on 21st June I made up a bundle of linen, containing twenty-one sheets and two towels—there was another bundle, containing old sheets; they were not cut up into towels, my towels were with the sheets—all the sheets were marked "Charing-cross Hospital"—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the sheets which were in the bundle—the words "Charing-cross Hospital" are not on than now—they were marked like this (producing one)—the mark has been cut out, and another piece put in—I belong to the C ward—I do not find "C" n the corner of this sheet, but here is the place where it ought to be; a piece has been cut out, and replaced—I cannot swear that this is exactly the place, but we generally mark them with the letter C just below the hem—this is like the quality of our sheets, the patients in the ward hem them—this other sheet is of the same quality, but both marks have been taken out of it; it is one of our sheets—here is "Cha" on this towel, that is a private mark of my own—"Cha" still remains, but the rest has been cut out—here is also a private mark "C," that is the letter of the ward of which I am a sister—the bundle of sheets which I sent to be washed has never come back to the hospital—the towels had no number on them, I only find one here.</p>

W."—I have every reason to believe all these are mine—here are two which have the Crown on them, and one with a coronet; they have been given from the Palace for the use of the hospital—I did not miss the towels till the laundress brought home the linen on, I should say, 24th June—she brought me twenty-six sheets.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Sion College-gardens, London-wall, and am a parish clerk. I remember Saturday night, 12th July, I shall never forget it—I was in Foster-lane, at the back of the Post-office, returning home, at a quarter past 10 o'clock, or shortly after—I had occasion to go into a urinal there—I did not notice the prisoner until after I had come out of it—the first thing that attracted my attention was somebody behind me, kicking against my heel, ad though by accident—I turned round, and the prisoner was behind me, he had apparently come out of the urinal; I think he was on my left hand—the said, "Where are you going?"—I said "Going; going home, of course"—he said, "Sir, I am a very poor youth I am starving—I replied, "I cannot help that, you are a stranger to me I have nothing for you"—he said, "Sir, I am starving"—I replied, "I have nothing for you"—he then said, in a louder tone, "You are a gentleman, I am starving, money I want, and money I must and will have"—I replied, "You will have none from me, that is very certain"—he said, "If I do not I will bring a charge against you"—I replied, "A charge! I do not know what you mean by a charge, neither do I know who you are"—he then in<lb/>formed me that a policeman bad obtained fifty golden sovereigns from a</p>

               <p>person in Houndsditch by only sticking to him, but he, the prisoner, was starving, and only wanted a few shillings—I became paralysed by fear—I was walking on while this was pausing, I never stopped at all till I got to the gate of Sion College—the prisoner followed me, and kept close by my side—I had an umbrella in my hand—when I bad got within a abort dis<lb/>tance of the College-gate, the prisoner said, "I need not follow you any further"—while I was opening the gate, which is a heavy massive iron gate, with my right band, the prisoner sprang forward and seized my umbrella from me, exclaiming, "By God I am an honest man, I am starving, I will not give up the umbrella unless you give me two shillings"—I went into the house for the purpose of getting some money, I left him outside the gate—I came back immediately with half a crown in my pocket, and the prisoner was gone, umbrella and all—I made a communication to the police next day, but I spoke to Mr. Lincoln that stone night, be resides in the house—on Monday night, the 14th, I saw the prisoner again, near 10 o'dock; he came to the house twice, the first time I was out—Mr. Lincoln opened the door to him—I was informed I was wanted, I went out and saw the prisoner on the mat in the passage; be took off his cap, made a police bow, and said, "Good evening, Sir"—I said, "Good evening, do you wish to see me"—he said, "Yes; you remember Saturday evening, I have, called for 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," but did not say what it was for—ie asked me to walk out—I went out—during this time Mr. Lincoln went for a constable; that was by arrangement—when I went out with the prisoner, he said, "Sir, you no doubt thought my conduct strange in nut returning with the umbrella, which you entrusted to my care"—I replied, "You mean the umbrella which you forcibly took from my possession?"—he said, "Do not say so"—I said, "I do say so, and although you might he starving, such an act was very wrong"—he said, "After I left you I met my father, who asked me some questions about the umbrella, I became confused, he found me out in two lies; I than toto him all about you, and my father said you must be a b—b—"—I said, "This is strange language, I do not understand it"—at that moment the police con<lb/>stable shook the front gates, in London-wall, where we had arrived by that time—the gates were looked; the constable said to me, "Sir, are the gates locked?"—I said, "It appears so, have you not your key?"—the prisoner laid to me, "Sir, what do the police want here?"—I said, "They have free access here when they please"—he said, "But what do they want have now?"—I replied, "They come in and out here when they please"—he said, "Sir, it seems very strange for us to stand here talking, let us take a little walk, and I will show you where your umbrella is"—I said, "I must inform the porter that the police are locked out here"—I then went to the gate in Philip-lane, on the outside of which were Mr. Lincoln, and the police constable, and on the inside stood Mr. May, the porter; and I gave the prisoner in charge for stealing my umbrella, and endeavouring to obtain money by threats—the prisoner said nothing then that I heard, but at the station house be denied all knowledge of it, and wondered that I was not struck dead, for he had not seen any umbrella—Mr. Lincoln went with me to the station in Moor-lane—the prisoner said he did not know why he was given in charge, and wondered God had not struck me dead, that I was a wicked man—the inspector read the charge to him twice.—he took the umbrella from me by force; I held it tightly, not that it would take great force to take anything from me, because I am not strong—there is not the slightest truth in the suggestion that I committed any assault upon him—I never gave bun any money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Why did you not give me in charge when I robbed you of the umbrella, as you specify? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because you had terrified me—you said that you would bring a charge against me—you did not name the charge—you said, "A charge"—I did not say before the Magistrate that you said an "unnatural charge"—I did not use that word—I did not give you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor any money—I had no money about me—I did not tell the Magistrate I had half a crown, but I had not change, or I should have given you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "I went up stairs and brought a half crown down in my pocket"—you did not tell me that you would give me in charge for catching hold of your person in the urinal, nor did I say "I hope you are not going to serve me as the policeman served Mr. Strange, give me in charge;" it is utterly false, every word—I did not know the name of Strange till you mentioned it—I did not say as we were going along, "Have you seen a case in the paper con<lb/>cerning Mr. Strange?"—I knew nothing of it, and do not to this day.</p>

On Sunday, 6th July, went to Kilburn to spend the day with my brother—before going there, I locked my room up—I filled my teapot full of tea and hot water, to make cold tea, took it into my bedroom, locked the door, and took the key in my pocket—I came back from Paddington about a quarter to 11 o'clock at night—I walked the best part of the way home—I was very hot and fatigued, it was rather a showery evening, and I hurried home—I desired Walker to fetch me half a quartern of gin, and to ask for the loan of a bottle—he brought me back the bottle produced—I said, "John, you have brought me a good half quartern, this is nearly a quartern; as it is I shall divide it in two, and take one half this evening"—I took it up stairs into my bedroom, and took off some of my things, to get to bed—I poured about half of what was in the bottle into a tumbler of cold tea—I took about a quarter part of it—I experienced a dreadful burning and vomiting and on the Tuesday I was very much disordered in my bowels—I ran down stairs with the bottle, and said to Walker, "John, you have not brought me gin, you have brought me poisoa; who dravoed it?"—he said, "I asked Mr. Westcott to lend me a bottle"—I went as I was to Mr. Hopton, a surgeon, at the corner of Judd-street—I saw him, and told him I had been poisoned—he prescribed for me, and gave me a bottle of stuff—I left the bottle I had taken, with him—I was very ill for about four days—I went to Mr. Westcott on the Mondav morning: I did not see him: I saw a stout man, and left word with him—I went home, and in the afternoon Mr. Westcott came—I said to him, "Mr. Westcott, this is a very serious thing for you to send this poison instead of gin; Mr. Palmer has not poisoned enough, but it appears that you want to poison me"—he replied, "In the hurry of business, I am sorry I made a mistake; I suppose it was vitriol and copperas, or some other liquid, that was kept behind the bar to clean the bar and things"—I said, "Well, Mr. Westcott, that is a very serious thing"—he said, "It is a great blessing you did not take it neat,</p>

We print the Country Paper—Mr. Cassell is interested in that paper—we keep an entirely separate account of that paper, totally distinct from other business—the prisoner has been in our service about twelve months—it was his duty to attend to the business of the Country Paper—this is the ledger that the prisoner was in the habit</p>

               <p>of keeping respecting that paper—there was also a day and a cash book, at one side of which were entered the orders, and charges against the customer and on the other side the remittances received from them—it was the pri<lb/>soner's duty to open letters addressed to the firm, and if remittances were sent up, it was his duty to take it to the day and cash book, and to enter the remittances on the credit side of the day and cash book, with the name of the person from whom he received it—these remittances were made to Mr. Cassell on our joint behalf—he was to make out a memorandum that day, or the next day, as it might be desirable to send the cash into the bankers—that was not necessarily done every day, but before taking money to the bankers, he had to make out the account—that in the ordinary course would be an abstract from the day and cash book of the various sums received, but omitting the names of the customers—it was a recapitulation of the amounts by which we ascertained that he had them correct.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before the next time of taking money to the bankers it was his duty to make out an account from the last time of taking it, omitting the names of the customers, but stating the amounts in the cash book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you recollect my taking a parcel of paper out of the counting house about a month before I left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, you had a parcel, and remarked that it was waste paper—it was about the size of one of these books, but more of a roll—the cash and day book was about the size of this book—I do not think that the cash and day book could have been in that parcel, unless it bad been doubled up—it was my place to lock the books up every evening—you never did it unless I was absent—you were about leaving at the same time I was when you took the parcel away—I cannot say whether you went at the same time—we did not, because I was not going the same way as you did, or else I should have gone out with you—you told me you had got that parcel of waste paper from the warehouse—on tying it round with a bit of string you remarked that it was waste paper.</p>

               <p>has been assumed that these two sum, were posted into the ledger by me, without having entered them in the day book, and the only evidence that they have attempted to show as to the loss of this day book is, that I have entered the sums in the ledger and not in the day book, and that I was about to leave; they having discovered that there was a large amount due, and that sufficient money had not been received, they jump to the conclusion that I had abstracted the book; nothing had been said about examining the ledger when this parcel of waste paper was taken away by me; I had been in the habit of asking the foreman for two or three pieces of waste paper, and the use I made of it was to bring my lunch with me; I used the paper for that purpose; one morning I wanted this day book which was missing; I spoke to Mr. Mason and the lad, and asked where it was; they could not find it; it could not be found; it was then mentioned to the firm, and they had ascertained that I took away this parcel of paper, and I was imme<lb/>diately asked if I had taken a parcel of paper out; I said, "Yes;" search was made about the place again; the book could not be found; a detec<lb/>tive was employed, and I was called up again and asked about it, and when I had had it; I recollected having had it the day before, at half past 5 o'clock; I had occasion to use it, and that was the last time I saw it; I had no occasion to use it further that day; well, this detective was told about the parcel of paper I had taken, and it was just such a parcel as you were just told about; I called for Mr. Clew, who gave me this paper, and he was asked if he had given me any; he said, "Yes;" I asked him how many sheets it consisted of; he said, "Twelve or fourteen;" they were sheets of double demy, and folded in this way (<hi rend="italic">Folding a sheet of paper</hi>); it could not be a book; I brought it into the counting house, and tied it with string; I was out in a minute after Mr. Mason, and the only reason I did not go with him was, he was going over Blackfriars-bridge, and I was going the other way; we used sometimes to go and walk together; the detective was directed to go to my house and look at this paper; I directed where it was, and said it would be found, as I left it, with the wrapper and string; he went, and did inspect this paper; I will ask Mr. Fetter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). The officer went to my house while I remained at the counting house; he came back, and was with Mr. Petter and Mr. Galpin some time before I was called up; I asked him whether he had found the paper; he said, "Yes, but not the book;" some conversation ensued, and he was instructed to go again; he was there before I reached home in the evening; I found him there in conversation with my wife and another lady, who resides in the same house; he told me that he had seen</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185608180077"/>
               <p>this parcel, and was quite satisfied that it contained no book; he said he asked my wife to look at the parcel of paper, and, having seen that, he said, "I wish to look at the book he brought home," and she said I had brought none; now how easy would it have been to have taken her off her guard, and have got the book, but there was no one; you have heard the witness Mason say that the parcel was rolled, and the book could not by possibility have been inserted in that parcel of waste paper; the paper was folded by the warehouseman, and he did not tie it round with string, because the string he had was so much thicker than what was in the counting house; I am accused of the loss of the day book; how is it proved that I did abstract it? I had no desk to lock anything up, but up to a certain hour, half past 5 o'clock, I used that day book, and after that time I have no knowledge of it whatever; I did not put it away that night, nor I never did, except in the absence of Mr. Mason; Again, what was the motive for taking away that book I and what was the motive for taking away the ends of the receipt books? if the accounts entered in the ledger did not speak for them<lb/>selves, the receipts that the parties had would speak for themselves; and what proof has there been adduced to you that the items posted in the ledger bad not been posted in the day book? and what motive could there be for my taking away the day book I Mr. Galpin had finished his exami<lb/>nation of the ledger, and I had received notice to quit, because I had given more credit than I ought to do this time; in order to see that the ledger was correct, a professional accountant was called in unknown to me, and the books were taken away, and the first time I had an opportunity of seeing them again was on the day of the expiration of my month's notice to quit; it has been stated that I had the custody of this day book; I deny it; if I had, why had I not the key of the iron safe? the loss of it was brought forward to make it out worse and worse against me; but it is only on suspicion, they have no proof whatever; I had only the charge of the books in use; the current receipt book in use was there regularly in it's place, and there was no attempt to alter it in any way, but, when they found that the receipt book ends could not be found, I am charged with this; Mr. Mason's duty was to lock the books up, and to unlock them in the morning, and he does not know whether he opened the sale the following morning, and he does not know what books were taken out, and what were not.</p>

On 16th July, about half past 8 o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came in—Sullivan asked to look at a coat—I called Lewis, a shopman, who showed him several—I watched them, and saw Carroll stoop down, they then picked out a coat, left a shilling deposit, and were about to depart when I saw a coat hanging from under Carroll's dress—that was not the coat on which the deposit had been paid—it dragged on the floor after her as she moved—the greater part of it was hidden—the part which was visible had these two tickets on it, which are ours—the shilling deposit was handed from the female to the male prisoner—I gave them both in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a reporter, but not specifically engaged on any paper. I attend at the County Courts, and hold authority to attend Mr. Wakley's inquests, and have done so ever since he received his appointment—on 2nd Aug. I had been spending the evening with a few reporters, and was in Crown-street, Soho, on my way home from the Strand to Rathbone-place, where I live—I went into a public house for the purpose of having a glass of stout, seeing the house open, and being rather elevated—I think it was in Crown-street, at the end of Crown-street, but I do not know what it is called—it is at the Seven Dials end—I had in my pocket half a sovereign, and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in shillings, sixpences, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces, and in my coat tail pocket 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I saw the prisoners there—I do not know whether they were there when I went in—I was only at the bar, and did not notice whether the tap room was open—the prisoners said, "Shall we drink your health, Sir?" seeing that I was elevated—(we meet on Friday nights to have something; I had gone first to Shoe-lane, then to Bouverie-street, and then we adjourned to the Coach and Horses, opposite Somerset House)—I said, "Yes," put down a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and some drink, I believe, was given—I got change out of what I paid for myself, and put it into my coat tail pocket (that made 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there altogether)—I went out, and when I had got near Denmark-street I was sud<lb/>denly attacked by a violent blow with, I think, a bludgeon on my left hip, and at the same moment my throat was grasped from behind—I was dis<lb/>abled by the blow on my side, but cannot say whether I fell—I felt my waistcoat and coat pockets being emptied, and had no power to prevent it—at the moment I was about to lose my senses, I saw the prisoners, and recognised them as the men that I had treated—they were going away towards Seven Dials—their backs were not towards me, one was before me, and one behind me—I saw their faces; one was feeling my coat tail pocket, and the other the front—I did not see their faces while they were feeling my pocket, but when they had left me, they both joined to go away—the; did not pass me, so as to put their backs to me—a constable came up, and I gave him a description of them—I said that one wore a <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> hat, a <hi rend="italic">wide awake</hi>, and one wore a moustache—the further prisoner wore the wide <hi rend="italic">awake</hi> (<hi rend="smallCaps">STAGEY</hi>, M.)—I am confident they are the persons I saw at the public house—next evening I went with the constable to Marlborough-street police office—I was taken into a room where a number of persons were assembled, and as soon as I entered I said, "Those are the men."</p>

               <p>about half-past 1 o'clock on the left hand side, going towards Oxford-street at the corner of George-yard, which is no thoroughfare—that was about two minutes before I found the prosecutor, and they were going in a direction from the spot where he was found, towards St Martin's-lane—one had a black hat and the other a brown felt hat—I am quite certain that the prisoners are the men—the prosecutor was not very drunk—I saw him ten minutes previous to this occurrence, and he was capable of taking care of himself then; he passed me in Crown-street—he had been drinking, but was not drunk—I have seen him about the courts, but have never spoken to him—when I returned to my beat I made a communication to constable Gray—in the morning Gray came to me, and I went with him to Cottage-court, Strutton-ground, Westminster, about half-past five o'clock, and found Clifton in bed with his trowsers on; Stacey opened the door in his trowsers and waistcoat—I told them that we took them on suspicion of a garotte robbery in Crown-street—I have not the least doubt that they are the two men I saw going from the place where I found the prose<lb/>cutor—I knew them before—I saw a <hi rend="italic">wide awake</hi> on a chair—I searched them at the station, but fonnd no money.</p>

Bank of England note—I also found in the cupboard three cakes of gelatine, a knife, damp with printers ink, and four pads—there is a faint impression on one of them, such as might be pro<lb/>duced by the copper plate; upon another there is an impression that might be produced by a wooden block, which will be produced, and which resem<lb/>bles the water mark in the paper—I found this steel plate with a small por<lb/>tion of engraving upon it, and a portmanteau containing twelve pieces of paper, similar to those I have already produced—I went into a back room, behind the room into which I broke, I there saw two lines suspended by either side of the wall—I saw several pieces of paper adhering to them, they were common cord lines—I examined those pieces of paper which I found in the back room with the paper that I found in the front, they corresponded in width, quality, and colour, with most of them—in the fireplace in the back room I saw a quantity of ash from burnt paper, and I also saw paper burning on the fire—I examined some of the papers that I found in the fire<lb/>place, they corresponded with the paper that I have already produced—I also produce a piece of metal which I found in the cupboard of the front room; it is the same kind of metal as that of which five figures are made, and will be produced by Huggett—I also found a magnifying glass.</p>

On 12th Aug, I went with Spittle into the window on the ground floor of No. 42, Upper Berners-street—I took Freitag—I searched him—in his trowsers pocket I found a small purse in which was five metal figures, on one piece the figures 8875, and on the other the figure 2—it appears to be the same metal as the piece produced by Spittle from the portmanteau—the 2 can be put either before or after the 8875—in a cupboard in the room I found this wooden block, it is an imitation water mark, such as is used for making bank notes, at the top and bottom are the words, "Bank of England," and in the centre the word "five"—that is the water mark, it imitates the water mark of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—there is no date on the block; the date on the plate is 12th May, 1856—on the table by the side of the press was a stone slab, a square piece of stone with wet ink on it—I told Freitag I should charge him with being in possession of the articles which stood before him, for the purpose of forging Bank of England 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes (the other two prisoners were standing by his side at the time)—he said, "Me know nothing, me a paper hanger," he said that in English—Thompson and Bokw did not say anything.</p>

I had received for the shirts; upon this 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. we lived on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, we three together; Bohm had no money; on Tuesday morning the money was given to me as cashier, to make it as economical as I could; after we had had our dinner, we had 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left; we mid the best we could do was to sell this press, though it belonged to Ulrick; Freitag had taken it with him out of the house, likewise this little black box, but he had no key to open it, and, an it was rather heavy, we expected there was some<lb/>thing in it, out of which we might make money; having no key, it was broken open; the first thing we found was a shirt, which I am wearing now, with the name of Karl Ulrick upon it; we found also a few stockings and old rags, and in a paper wrapped np we found the two plates and several pieces of paper, these little boxes and bottles with the materials in them, and at the bottom the large, square stone slab, which had been used for printer's ink; there was also a roller for printing; Freitag was much astonished, and so was I when we found all these; Bohm was not then in the room, and we called to him, and we stood laughing at it; then, we took counsel as to what we should do with the things; I advised to have the papers burnt, to break the plates, and sell the press; one of the two, I do not know which, said, "Perhaps the best thing would be to bring it to the police court, and we might make some money out of that," but neither of these were executed, and we, being strangers, did not know how to act; I took some of the papers and set light to them, and threw them into the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live in Russell-court, Wapping. On Wednesday, 30th July, I was passing by the door of the White Swan public house, in High-street, Shadwell—I went in to take a shipmate out, and saw the prisoners alongside my shipmate—when I got him outside, Doyle came up to me, and knocked me down, und slipped my guard over my neck—he snapped it, and, in doing so, cut my finger to the joint—he gave the word to Thompson, and Thompson <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> away down Gravel-lane—I ran after him—a man stopped him—I came up to him, and he turned round, and put the watch in my hand, and said, "There is the watch for you"—I had not lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thompson. Q.</hi> Why not give me into custody then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I was afraid there would be more of you come upon me—you were not taken till the next day, but I am sure you are the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Mead-street, Bethnal-green. On Wednesday evening, 9th July, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was in Mead-street, going home—I am a commercial traveller—I had just been settling a little transaction and had hired a porter to carry a load for me to White-chapel—this porter is an intimate acquaintance of the prisoner—there was a female in the public house where we came in contact—I was knocked down in the street and robbed—the female robbed me, and the prisoner and another held me—I saw the prisoner and am positive he is one of the men—this happened about twenty yards from my own house—it was done quickly—I was not drunk—I was dragged across the road into Vincent-street—the woman took 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from my pocket, or thereabout, not lest; it might be a little more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker in Vincent-street, Bethnal-green. On Wednesday evening, 9th July, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I saw Mr. Boden in Sarah-street between the prisoner and another man—the other man appeared to be intoxicated, but he was not—all of a sudden I saw the prosecutor thrown or knocked into the road—he fell on his side and the two men instantly closed upon him in the road—the other man caught hold of the prosecutor by the collar and dragged him across the road underneath my window—in an instant afterwards a woman sprang from I do not know where, but she went close to the prosecutor, thrust her hand into his breast, as if she must have known where the money was, took something out and disappeared—as soon as the woman had taken the money the prisoner left the road, walked on the pavement, and walked away, and the other man after him—I knew the prisoner before by sight, and am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, in Stingo-lane, New-road. On the evening of 2nd Aug., about half past 10 or a quarter to 11 o'clock, I was in my cart at my door—I was just going to drive three or four doors off, when a party of three or four men came along, and began swearing at me in a very dreadful manner—one of them stopped the pony, and he rather reared up and went on the pavement and obstructed the pathway—I jumped off the cart, and said, if they insulted me I should lock them up—thereupon one of them took hold of my whip and threatened to break it, however I got it from him, and got on the cart again—I then said, "You Irish vagabonds, you ought to be locked up"—Haley on that got oft the cart, collared me, and pulled me off—I woidd not positively swear to Haley being the one that pulled me off the cart, but it is my firm conviction it was him—I was a great deal agitated at the time, I could not swear to the man who held the horse by the head—when I was pulled off the cart, Haley took the whip and broke it in three or four pieces—I then collared him, and retained him in my grasp—there was a crowd of persons round at the time—I found my watch out of my pocket, hanging by the chain, about five minutes afterwards—the witness Palmer cased out to me, "Mr. James, I think you have lost your watch, then is man running away"—I then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185608180098"/>
               <p>found that my watch was gone, and the guard was broken—Haley grasped me by the handkerchief, and twisted it round as hard as he could twist it, and put his knuckles in my throat—my skin was broken in five or six places, and I lost a very small quantity of blood—I gave Haley into custody—I have not got my watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 12, Stingo-lane, New-road. I saw Mr. James in his cart, near his own door—I heard Haley insult him—I saw him make a snatch at his Albert chain; the watch fell out of Mr. James's pocket, and hung down—I ran to him, lifted it up, and gave it into his hand, and said, "Take care, Mr. James, or you will lose your watch"—there was a man at the horse's head preventing it from going on—I cannot say who that man was—I saw another man jump on the cart, catch hold of Mr. James, and pull him out—I do not know who that man was—previous to his being pulled out of the cart, Haley caught hold of the end of his whip, pulled it out of his hand, and broke it in three or four places—Mr. James then caught hold of Haley, and Haley caught hold of him by the throat, and his companions also—he twisted his cravat in order to tighten it about his throat—I saw a man run away, he appeared to be an associate of the others; he appeared to have something in his hand, and I called out, "Mr. James, I think that man has got your watch"—I afterwards saw Haley taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside in the neighbourhood of the Yorkshire Stingo. On the night of 2nd August, I saw the prosecutor in his cart near his own door—I wan close to it—I could not get into the baker's shop on account of the horse being pushed on the pavement by one of these men—it was Gorman, he had hold of the horse by the head—Haley was at the side of the cart—he pulled Mr. James by the side of the collar, and the watch guard was in his hand, and he pulled him nearly out of the cart—Mr. James recovered himself a little, and Haley took his whip out of his hand and broke it—two or three of them then got Mr. James out of the cart—I was afraid they would strangle him—I went and got a policeman—I saw one of the men take something from Mr. James's pocket, I cannot say what it was; and one of them, I believe Haley, said, "<hi rend="italic">Cut</hi> it!"—and the man ran away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not this so (<hi rend="italic">Reading</hi>) "I kept some sago and arrowroot in the coal scuttle as well as the footman?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, my coal scuttle does not go idle, I make everything useful—I had a servant named Alice Blackman—I am very sorry to say that she is dead—I know that she is dead, because I went to the workhouse and saw her the day before she died—I think that is about two years ago—she was not with me at Mrs. Stepben<lb/>son's—she lived with me six years; she did not leave me when I went to Hammersmith—a charwoman named Helis used to do for me at Mrs. Stephenson's—I had the two parlours there, and the third room, and the use of the kitchen—I was examined before the Magistrate in March last; and made as nearly as possible the same statement that I have made to-day—the curtains were ordered to be given up to Mrs. Stephenson—the Magistrate heard the whole of the case—I was examined also at Westminster before Lord Campbell and a special jury—they wanted me to compromise, but I would not—I do not know who wanted to make a compromise, but my solicitor came out to me—Mr. Barber has been my solicitor for a year or two—we found each other out—as soon as these things were taken I certainly found that I was in the midst of thieves—I remained among the thieves for eight or nine months; but I went to my builder, and gave him a year's rent in advance, to get my house done as soon as possible for me—I did not have a quarrel with Mrs. Stephenson before I went—she is not worth quarrelling with—I do not quarrel with such people as these—I did not give her the regular notice, but I paid her the quarter before it was due—I did not refuse to pay it for a long time—I never refuse to pay money—I mean to say, that when they said that I must pay a quarter's rent, or give notice, that I at onoe paid the money; I made no words about it, more than I bare with you—I always pay my money; I neror trust—I mean to say, that when</p>

               <p>I left there were no unpleasant words between us with regard to rent or notice—I was going without notice, because I knew they wanted the money—they were not satisfied with robbing me, but they wanted my room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you had a quarrel with your daughter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost all friends have that do not agree; I dare say you have some in your family—I do not know that my daughter and I have been otherwise than friendly, but we do not agree in opinion—we have never been without seeing one another—in Feb., 1856, my daughter gave me some information about what she had seen at Mrs. Stephenson's house—I knew a very little while before, 'that she was going to Mrs. Stephenson's—she came and told me that she had been to the apartments—I did not know that she was going before she went—Goddard, the officer, came to examine the premises after this alleged robbery; he told me that he saw some marks outside the windows.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the last witness. In Feb. last I visited the house of the Stephensons in Devonshire<lb/>terrace, and noticed on the mantelpiece these cups, which I immediately recognised as my mother's property—I did not notice anything else belonging to my mother on that occasion—I communicated with the officer, Goddard, and with him and Clarke made another visit to the Stephensons, having com<lb/>municated with my mother in the meantime—on going into the front par<lb/>lour I took the cups off the mantelpiece, gave them to Goddard, and said, "Those are my mother's"—I do not think Mrs. Stephenson heard me the first time, but her sister said, "She has taken the cups off the mantelpiece"—she made no remark—on looking round the room I saw this footman, took it in my hand, and said, "This is my mother's"—Mrs. Stephenson was present, and said, "It is not Mrs. Palmer's"—I looked at it and said, "Yes, this is the place where it has been broken and has been mended," and handed it to the policeman, but Mrs. Stephenson said nothing—the curtains were hanging up at the window, and there were some shells—I said, "These are my mother's shells"—Mrs. Stephenson made no remark; she gave no explanation as to how she became possessed of the footman, the shells, and the curtains—there was also a spice box, which I took up in the same manner in the down stairs room, when we had left the parlour, and I said, "This is my mother's;" she made no reply—I saw the curtains hanging at the window, and said, "Those are my mother's curtains"—Mrs. Stephenson was in the room, but I did not hear her say anything—I tured round, looked into the back room, and said, "Here is the third curtain at the back window; that is the curtain that my mother used at her cot<lb/>tage, it is more faded than the other two;"I heard no remark from Mrs. Stephenson at that time—when we came up stairs the officer took the cur<lb/>tains down, and Mrs. Stephenson said, "If they are Mrs. Palmer's curtains I knew nothing about them; I bought the ticket of a Mrs. Day; they were pawned in Drury-lane"—Goddard said, "Where does Mrs. Day live?"—she said, "I do not know"—he asked her where she lived when she bought the ticket? and she said that she did not know—I have looked at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185608180103"/>
               <p>the curtains—I have no doubt whatever as to their being my mother's pro<lb/>perty—the third curtain, it will be seen, is more faded than the other two—I had seen them in use—one my mother used for three years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a charwoman, and helped Mrs. Palmer to remove from Devonshire-terrace. I was there at 6 o'clock in the morning, and went to Chelsea with the goods—I cleaned out the cupboards, it was my business to do so—I did not leave a thing in them—Mr. Oxford was there, and he is here—I cannot say whether he was present at the trial in the Queen's Bench—I saw him feel into the cupboard in the back parlour, and am able to say positively, that there were no articles left in it, because I dusted it out—I heard of an action being brought against Miss Palmer—I saw Mrs. Stephen<lb/>son afterwards by chance—I really do not know what passed between us—I do not recollect whether anything was said about the action—I know no more of Mrs. Palmer than being called in as charwoman—I was frequently there to tea with Mrs. Palmer, and sometimes I have dined with her—I was there backwards and forwards for four years—I never saw these cups after she was at Eden-grove, I knew them there, and I know that they were put to be packed up there.</p>

I assisted her to remove from the Stephensons in April, 1855, and superintended the removal of her things; my son, and a person named Heightinan, also assisted—before we finally left I examined the parlours, and Heightman made some jocular remark as regarded Mrs. Palmer—I searched the rooms and the cupboards carefully—there was nothing in the cupboard in the parlour when I searched it—there was at that time a chair or two left behind, and during the time the men were carrying them, I went round the rooms to see if</p>

                  </hi>. I live with a person named Egan; I am not married to him, I have lived with him twenty-nine years; he is a boot and shoe<lb/>maker. I have been employed by Mrs. Stephenson for upwards of two years, to clean out the rooms—I remember the time when Mrs. Palmer lived there; I was there at the time that the van was there removing Mrs. Palmer's goods, and Mrs. Stephenson then spoke to me, and asked me if I could come the following day to clean out the apartments; I told her that I was engaged at Dr. Bayford's—I went on the second day after Mrs. Palmer left, at half past 10 in the morning—while I was cleaning the grate in the front parlour, Mrs. Stephenson came from the back parlour to tin door, leading to the front parlour, and showed me, I cannot take my oath whether it was two or three cups and a shell or two, and made some observation about them—I saw nothing else there.</p>

               <p>me that Mrs. Stephenson had been charged with perjury about the cups; I said, "I am surprised that you did not call me before, because you know I showed them to me when she found them in the cupboard"—he did not say that be knew I knew all about it—he did not tell me what the perjury was—I went to wash next day—I did not meet Mrs. Stephenson before I went to wash.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by saying now that the first time you heard of it was from her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I did not see her husband till the day after that</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at the Hammersmith police court.

In December, 1833, I was present at his marriage to Ann Webster, the prisoner, at Lambeth Church—they lived together six or seven years, or a little longer, and then they went away in the country and separated—I used to see him sometimes after that and sometimes not, he used to go abroad in steamboats; sometimes he has gone for three or four years, the last voyage he was gone two years—I cannot speak exactly to his being away seven years—I do not know where the prisoner was at that time—I last saw her before that, last October, and before that I had not seen her for seventeen years—she then came to see me—I saw the prisoner about two years before last October, because he was gone out to the Brazils in a Brazilian frigate—I might have seen him a year or two before that, he was never at home long—the prisoner came to my house this day week—Mr. Bird was then living at my house, he has been living there since April—she came again on the Saturday and was given in custody—I was present when she saw her husband at my house.</p>

I thought he was dead"—he was not, when in the Brazilian service, away more than seven years at a time—I know that they never lived together after they separated—Bird had a brother who was drowned—it was put in the paper, "Drowned one Bird"—(I did not know the second husband)—I do not know that she is a milliner—I did not know whether she was alive, I have often heard my brother say that he thought she must be dead—I cannot tell whether she wore widow's weeds, not seeing her.</p>

On 11th July last we were off the coast of Holland, fishing—there were nine hands on board; the prisoner was one, and Francis Toombs another—there were four men and five apprentices—the captain had left the smack the day previous, to go on board another vessel, to get provisions—in the course of the afternoon, I and the prisoner, and Toombs, went on board a Dutch vessel—we stopped on board some time, and had some Hollands there, and we brought some with us on board our own boat when we returned, which was I think between 6 and 7 o'clock, but I cannot say for an hour or so—I think we brought one bottle of gin on board; I did not know it was in the boat until we got on board our vessel; I did not bring it—I was down in the cabin that night; there was the boy Hamilton, Dunning, Toombs, and myself; Toombs was lying on the settle, Dunning came down afterwards, as nigh as I can say between 12 and 1 o'clock—I think Toombs was awake when Dunning came down—I saw Dunning take a bottle of naphtha which stood in the middle of the hatches, and pour it over Toombs—it was not full—I do not know how much there was in it—he came down into the cabin, took up the bottle, and sprinkled it over Toombs—I do not recollect his saying anything before he did it—in about two or three minutes Toombs was on fire—Dunning was then down in the cabin—when Toombs was on fire we went out of the cabin—I was the last one down in the cabin, and I got burnt—Dunning was close to Toombs when I first saw that he was on fire—I did not see how it was that he got on fire; after he was on fire, he got up, flew to me, and laid hold of me while he was in flames; that was how I got my arm burnt—I shoved him away—he went out of the cabin on deck, and I believe the apprentice threw buckets of water over him, but I did not see that—I saw him afterwards on deck he was very much burnt</p>

I am quite sure the house is empty, there is only one old gentleman living there, and I understand he is from home"—he said that he did not come out from there, and knew nothing of the house—I took him back towards an oyster stall, and met the policeman and the other prisoner—Miss Reason found this crowbar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the oyster stall, and gave it to me—there were marks on the door of No. 24—I have compared the marks with this crowbar, and they correspond exactly.</p>

On 18th July I saw the prisoner in my house, between 4 and 5 o'clock—a neighbour came into the skittle ground, and asked me to go into the bar, which I did, and I gave some caution to my wife—soon after that I went to a bowl, and found a six<lb/>pence there—I doubled it, and my wife put it on a shelf—when the prisoner left my bar, he went to No. 9, opposite, not more than fifty yards off—I saw him again in about twenty minutes—he came for a pint of beer—I served him—he gave me a sixpence—I put it on the counter, and had four penny pieces to give him in change, but I saw the sixpence was bad, and I told him it was no use to come with that money there—I doubled up the sixpence by the tester, and told him to pay me for my beer in good money—he paid two penny pieces—I told him about the other sixpence, and told him to make it good—he said he could not—I waited some considerable time to see whether he could pay me, or get some one to pay me—I would not let him go till he paid—after a delay of half an hour, or three quarters of an hour, when I found he could not, I sent for a constable—the second sixpence was picked up in front of the bar, by a person who saw it dropped—it was given me by Dixon—I handed it to the constable—I also gave him the one that had been bent before, and which was on the shelf—the prisoner had not been in my house before, to my knowledge—he did not say how he became possessed of the sixpences.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, L</hi> 49). On 17th Aug., a little before 5 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Princes-road, Lambeth. I saw the prisoner with this bundle with her—she saw I was noticing her, and she went into a public house—I told a person to tell her to come out, I wanted to speak to her—she would not, and I called her myself, and asked her what she had in her apron—she showed me, and it was these two pairs of boots and two gowns—I asked her how she came by them—she said one</p>

               <p>pair of boots was her husband's, and all the other things her own—I asked her where she lived, and she said at No. 18, John-street—I took her there, and found she did not live there—I then asked her where she did live, and she refused to tell me, and seemed very much confused—she said the things were her own, and she was going to pawn them—I said, "You must go to the station"—she said, "Don't take me there"—she had some halfpence in her hand, and she offered me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for some beer—I refused to take any money, and took her to the station—she was searched, and a duplicate was found on her—while we were examining the prisoner, the prosecutrix came in, and gave information of the robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> These things were given me by a woman in the street; that was what I said. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, you said they were your own—I had one pint of beer by the sergeant's permission, and I paid for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Hearne; he is a fire wood cutter, and lives at No. 8, Garden-place. I went to bed last Sunday night at 10 o'clock—I had fastened the doors, and bolted them—my husband generally gets up at 4 o'clock in the morning, and the policeman called him as usual, the next morning, but he did not want to get up so early that morning—he answered the policeman and went to bed, and when he got up at half past 5 o'clock, the street door was open—he went down and missed his boots—he called me—I went down and found the back door was open, and then two frocks and the boots were gone—I went to the station, and the prisoner was there—she said to my face that these were her things—I said, "They are mine, and I can prove it"—when we were before the Magistrate, she said she had them given her—I am quite sure she said to my face that they were her's—they are my husband's property.</p>
