On the 17th of July I went to my banker's, Messrs. Hankey's, and procured ten 5l. Bank notes, which were Nos. 19,259 to 19,268, inclusive, and dated June 18, 1828; I deposited them in a desk in my counting-house, from which I had previously lost money- I had seven sovereigns in the desk; I had not marked the notes, but knew they were successive numbers; I rumpled them up in my hand, and put them into the desk in that state; I locked the desk - (I had previously lost a key of that desk) I went to the desk in an hour and a half, to give the seven sovereigns and ten 5l. notes to my clerk to be marked, in case of a loss, and missed a 5l. note, No. 19,260; I did not miss any gold: I had Mr. Wood (the clerk) and the prisoner, who was my cook, apprehended, and also the housemaid. The prisoner was searched, and the 5l. note, No. 19,260, which I had lost, was found on her; the officer took it from her pocket, in my presence, in a leather purse, with a clasp to it; I also found on her a 10l. note, four sovereigns, 21s. 6d. in silver, and a master-key of the desk from which I lost the note, and also of the clerk's desk by the side of it; I had lost it some time previously - it would open both desks, but the clerk's key would only unlock his own desk. I found the duplicate of a silver snuff-box on her - I had lost that box before, but do not know when; it was afterwards shewn to me, and is mine; it has my name engraved on it - I have had it twenty years.</p>

On the 19th of July my father left me in the shop with the baby; a man came in, and took my father's watch off the nail in the cupboard; I never saw him before, but I know the prisoner is the man, because I saw him when he took it - I had seen it in the cupboard before he came. When he came in he asked for a penny-worth of milk - I went to get it him, and when I had turned round to get it, I heard the watch-chain rattle; the cupboard had two glass doors, one of them was shut and the other put too; he could see the watch in the cupboard - any person outside could see it: when I returned with the milk he was walking from the cupboard up to the dresser, with one hand in his breeches pocket; I looked, and the watch was gone; I said, "You have got my father's watch;" I put the milk down on the dresser, and he said, "Don't make a noise - don't make a noise; I will give it you;" he laid hold of my shoulder, and throw me down; he then ran out, and I after him, calling "Stop thief! you have got my father's watch;" he was brought back to the shop in about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in any fear at this time? A. Yes; I was afraid that he was going to take the watch, but not of anything else; I did not see him take it off the nail, but it was in the cupboard before he came in; I saw Mrs. Wyatt in the shop directly I returned.</p>

               <p>NICHOLAS MABLESON. I live at Boston, in Lincolnshire. I was in London on the 6th of August; I met a woman on the evening of the 6th or 7th of August - the prisoner was not the woman who I met in the street; she overtook me - I followed her to a house in a court; I do not know the name of it - it was not far from Spitalfields-church - we went to a public-house, and then to a private house, where I saw the prisoner - we were in a room on the ground floor - the other woman brought a light: I gave her half a crown, then pulled off my coat and laid it on a chair at the foot of the bed - my money was in a canvas purse in my side coat pocket: the prisoner then pushed the door open, flew at me, and struck me in the face; nobody came into the room but her - she then flew at my coat; I said, "You bad villain, what are you going after" - they both got hold of the coat together - I said"You bad husseys, you are going to rob me" - I caught hold of the coat, we all pulled, and they pulled me into the passage: the prisoner had got hold of it first; there were several others in the passage, I received a blow on my right side, and somebody said, "The rascal, murder him!" I thought it was a man who struck me, but I could not see. I had hold of the coat when I received the blow, but I could then hold it no longer - I had almost got out of the passage when I received the blow - I went home without the coat, and saw no more of it till about ten o'clock, when I went there with a watchman - we found the prisoner and took her; both the women had hold of the coat when I let go of it; there was a 10l. and a 5l. Boston Bank note in the pocket, also two 1l. Lincoln notes and fifteen sovereigns; they were all in a purse; I had seen it all safe half or three quarters of an hour before, and am sure they were safe when I went into the house; I went to the place with a watchman about ten o'clock and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When they took your coat, what became of them? A. They all went away with it and a man came into the room and said "What do you do here?" when I went there at ten o'clock, that room was locked; we went into the other room - as soon as the watchman opened the door I saw the prisoner, and said, "You are the woman who helped to rob me" - she said "Me! that I did not" "Oh! you bad hussey, (said I) I know you well enough, you helped to rob me;" she was taken to the watch-house - I am certain it was her; I was perfectly sober, and had drunk nothing but a 6d. glass of wine and water, and about half a glass of gin with the woman who decoyed me in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me in the street? A. No, you helped to rob me in the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came your coat on the chair? A. I gave the woman half a crown and was going to stop there, but immediately I put the coat there, the prisoner broke the door open - they both got hold of the coat before me; I did not catch hold of it a moment after them - we all caught hold of it together as near as possible; I received several blows in the passage - I pulled till I received the blow in the passage; I received several blows, but cannot tell who gave me the blows: I held the coat till I received the last blow - the prisoner said "You rascal, we will murder you if you offer to resist" and she struck me the moment she came in.</p>

Hankey's; I advanced the money for him - I afterwards heard that he had absconded; I went to his house, as he had some money of mine in his possession - I could not find him; I afterwards saw him in Chancery-lane in custody, at a lock-up-house - that was about the middle of March, about a month after I had discounted the bill; I had an interview with him there, and he said something about the bill.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. He was in custody then, had you not promised him favour provided he told you the truth? A. Certainly not; I did not depute Berwick Melton to apply to the prisoner to request he would give me information on the subject, and say, "I would not hurt a hair of his head" - on my solemn oath I did not; I do not know John Hanbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that neither yourself, nor by means of any third person, you used any means to induce him to give you an account of the transaction? A. Never in my life; several persons were present at our interview at the lock-up-house.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. You spoke to him of this bill? A. Yes, and he declared to God Almighty that I had not got a bad bill - he also added, that if anything could give a man satisfaction in his present melancholy situation, it was my liberal conduct towards him during our acquaintance; he said no more at that time; I had another interview with him the next day but one at the same place, and spoke of the 50l. bill - I had made some enquiry after I first saw him, and told him I was fearful, from the result of the enquiries I had made, that he had deceived me with regard to those bills; without any reservation he said then, "I am sorry, but they are forgeries" - I left him then, and have never seen him since.</p>

               <p>Q. What he said was in a general way, you did not particularize this bill? A. Yes, I did particularize this bill; I had a memorandum of two bills - I have since destroyed it; the bill was in my possession then - I shewed him a slip of paper, on which I wrote the particulars of this bill, and another of 150l. - they were the largest bills I had; I went to him to tell him the result of my enquiries; I gave him the full amount for the bill, deducting the discount - I took no more than the regular discount, but cannot now say how much that was; I was not at Calais - Mr. Vincent went there; I conceived he had absconded, for he had obtained a bill of mine, and had money of mine - I think my conversation with him was before a docket was struck against him, but I never attended to the Commission at all; the bill purports to be accepted by a person living at Colchester - he was a stranger to me, and so was the drawer; I took it entirely on the prisoner's recommendation.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. You called at Mr. Fenn's house, where you had discounted the bill, and found him from home? A. I did - I went there for money which he had of mine; he has never pair it to me - I have never received it.</p>

            . I am an attorney. In consequence of information and instructions which I received, I went to France after Fenn in March last; I went to Paris, and found he had left; in consequence of what I heard I went to Calais, and found him there; I think it was at the London hotel - it was at a house: I had known him from the 2d of January this year, but am not certain to a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him, what passed between you? A. He appeared like a frantic man - he stated that he was ruined, and stated who had ruined him: I held out no inducement or promise of favour to him; he did not require it: I made a memorandum of what passed between us on the evening of the same day - here it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and tell us what he said? A. His first words were "I will go quietly to Newgate, only don't put me in irons - I will plead guilty; I shall then have about six weeks after I am condemned: I will be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110007"/>seen by no one; I will do as Fauntleroy did, and it will he all over in a minute; I was coming to England to deliver myself up to Justice." I desired him to compose himself, and produced some bills to him.</p>
               <p>Q. He mentioned somebody had been his ruin, and appeared frantic - was that the first he said? A. The first he said was "Melton is my ruin; he has gained by me 7,000l. within the last two years," and when he got more reconciled he named some other persons, and he said I must not leave him, or he should cut his throat; I staid with him, and afterwards brought him to England.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any officer with you, or did he come quietly with you? A. He came quietly with me for he was travelling under a false name, and the commissioner gave me his passport; I have seen him write during my acquaintance with him, and know his hand-writing -(looking at the bill) I believe this, purporting to be the acceptance of J. Powell, to be the prisoner's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you saw him he told you he was coming home? A. Yes - one Cook was with me; did not hold out inducements of any sort to the prisoner - I never told him if he would make up the amount of money deficient I would protect him; I believe

               <p>Q. They called on you with an account of the transaction, for you to authenticate before it was published? A. I cannot say whether it was before or after. I know my own hand-writing; I believe I struck out some words - I do not know whether it was afterwards published - I never saw it in the newspaper, nor was it read to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this (producing a manuscript) - "I know the above to be true in substance and effect, J. Vincent, solicitor, Clifford's Inn?" A. That is what I was called on to do; I struck out some offensive words.</p>
               <p>Q. This is an account of the transaction, not of an examination? A. I was called on to do it.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You say there was some person with the prisoner when you first saw him at Calais - where did you first see him? A. They were together; they had got their boxes, and were going on board the packet for England; I stopped with Mr. Fenn - the other person went on with the packet: Fenn was very anxious to go on with the packet, but I would not let him, as I had been out six nights and days; the conversation between us was after that person had gone. The examination was taken before Mr. Alderman Brown, when Fenn was in prison for debt; I cannot say whether it was before or after that examination that I was applied to, to authenticate the statement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whose handwriting is that paper? A. I believe it is my brother's writing - he is my clerk; Davies and Northover desired me to supress their names, and it was to keep the newspapers from putting in worse, that that was communicated; I did not instruct my brother to write that paper - I do not know but what I might instruct him to copy the rough draft that was sent to me - it was sent by a reporter; I authenticated it, when I found more than twenty forged bills in person's hands.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was there a rough draft of a paper sent to you? A. There was - it was not written by my direction; I had nothing to do with it - I authenticated it certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the statement contain some of the matter that was in the original? A. Yes; the original heading was in that way, only it contained allusions to other persons, which I struck out, and I did so in another instance, I think in the Sunday Times - I know I called on them, and struck it out while it was in the press; they did not publish that account, but there were several accounts. The paper which has been shewn to me contains the same matter as was in the original draft. I thought I was doing a service to the persons by what I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you also attorney for a Mrs. Cook? A. I was - I knew nothing about the prisoner, and therefore could not know him as Peter Fall - I knew him by no other name than Peter Fenn.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (Written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I am now called upon to defend myself against charges which place me in the most awful condition of responsibility that can oppress the mind, and alarm the heart. When I contemplate myself in this awful instant of my life, standing as a criminal accused of that violation of the laws of my country, which makes the forfeiture of existence, the punishment of guilt. When I look back upon the station in society, which but a short time ago, I filled with respectability of character, and usefulness of exertion - when the rapid current of conflicting thoughts, bring to my reflection, the sad reverse of all my better hopes, and happier prospects: I feel conscious, that under a mental pressure of disquiet and apprehension, so overwhelming, the difficulty of securing sufficient composure, and self-possession for a methodical and deliberate arrangement of all the circumstances of the case, which the task of defence comprehends, must be extreme; more especially, when to an individual in the unhappy condition in which I now stand before you, the better skilled and more advantageous aid of counsel is by law disallowed. If I may hope for firmness to encounter this difficulty, I look for it not in the presumption of self justification, but in the motives which originated the very transactions that have inculpated me, and brought me to this fearful issue of their results. Yes, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, from these motives, best known to myself and to my God, I seek now for that stability of mind which will enable me to render my defence in your estimation, so far available of its object as to induce you to pity, not to condemn. To shew how these motives have been connected with these transactions, I must entreat your patient hearing, while I enter into a detail of the occasions and causes from which they have arisen, and which, when compared with the evidence of my prosecutors, and the motives which have induced them to bring me to trial, will, I hope and trust, evince in my behalf a disposition more prompt to make the exigency in which I found myself involved, subservient to the restrictions of justice and truth, rather than subversive of either. I would begin these details by truly asserting that these prosecutions have come most unexpectedly upon me, in as much as those who have preferred them first detained me by civil action, although they had been long in possession of all the evidence of the nature of the transactions upon which they found their indictment; and therefore may it not be rightly concluded, that if their object had been to promote the ends of justice only, and if they had been fully convinced that those transactions would have borne out such a proceedure, they would long before have made them the subject of judicial enquiry, instead of seeking to profit themselves by a compromise, which they repeatedly proposed, but which, in the ruined state of my affairs, it was impossible for me to find the means of carrying into effect; and even had I possested those means, acquiescence on my part would have been an act of the grossest injustice to my other creditors, and moreover, with a strong conviction of my own motives, I then felt impressed with a consciousness that had they recourse to such a proceedure, there did not exist grounds to sustain an indictment. Had that consciousness been of a contrary nature, and had it reproached me with criminal intentions, it cannot for a moment be doubted, but that I should most gladly have seized upon the facility which they offered me of rescuing myself at all events from so perilous a situation, and out of the wreck of my property I might perhaps have gathered sufficient resources to have enabled me to meet their offer, and join with them in defrauding the rest of my creditors; but I did not apprehend such peril, because I felt that I had not incurred it; and I also felt that, as a bankrupt, whatever could be realized from the wreck of my property was not my own but the property of all my creditors. Subsequently to the offer of this compromise, I went through the ordeal of a commission of bankruptcy, and mark, that the act of bankruptcy was proved by Mr. Vincent, the attorney for the prosecution, although I had previously told him, when in Calais, that I wished to return with all speed to London to prevent this. In the progress of that commission I met with no opposition; my last examination was passed, and in a few days I should have been at liberty to make the most streanous exertions in my power to do as much justice as I could to all my creditors. But, although not opposed, it appears that I was very closely watched by my prosecutors; and on the eve of my liberation from prison as a debtor, they withdrew their civil detainers, and I was, without any intimation or expectation of such a measure, transferred to another prison under more awful circumstances. Here allow me to make use of an intermediate remark; had I accepted the offer of a compromise, and been able or willing to have given an unjust preference to my prosecutors, their present mode of proceeding would never have been adopted. It will be proved by evidence, that had I been in circumstances to have given 1000l. to my prosecutors, I could have possessed myself of all those documents which have made the grounds of this prosecution. Here then, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, suffer me to direct your candid judgment towards the intrinsic quality of that justice, which they assume as the disinterested principle which has induced them to place me in my present calamitous situation. It will be further proved, that promises of all kinds, entreaties of all kinds, threats of all kinds, have been by them, made use of to bring me to the compromise which I have mentioned, from an unfounded supposition, that I was in possession of a sum of money equal to their expectations. My share, however, of the proceeds of these ruinous transactions was too small, and the share of my prosecutors too large, as the collective amount of the business of several yearsmay seem to enable me to retain any such adequate sam in my hands as might have enabled me to satisfy these my prosecutors; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110009"/>this they ought to have known; for, although they discounted bills, through my agency, to the amount of at least 12,000l. a year, they always took care to make me pay 20 and sometimes 30 per cent. No one can more deeply lament than I do, the fatal infatuation which induced me to join others, and amongst these my prosecutors themselves, and their attorney, in this unjustifiable species of pecuniary traffic by bills of no relative value: but the facility which the gain of usurious interest offers to the negotiators of such paper, however worthless, or however introduced, provided they bear one supposed responsible name, will account for the temptation, although it will not justify the practice. In an evil hour I yielded to the temptation. For a period of several years my prosecutors participated largely in the benefits of these transactions, not confining themselves to their own means, but very frequently obtaining my acceptances for theirs to facilitate and increase their means of discounting largely; and yet these are the persons who now appear to prosecute me, endeavouring to wrest these transactions into such a shape, as may enable them to subject me to the infliction of the last and fatal sentence of the law. As to the very serious charge of forgery, with which I stand accused, my prosecutors well know, and they declared it before Alderman Brown, the Magistrate who committed me, that my name alone was at all times sufficient for them to negotiate any bills which I might offer, when they wanted to raise money for other discounts; and, indeed, they oftener came to my house to solicit bills from me than I to theirs. There could not therfore exist any necessity for my using the names of others so illegally and so unwarrantably, for the fraudulent accomplishment of my views. If it be asked why I have not brought forward the persons whose names are connected with these bills, I have to observe, that as they have been parties with me in the usurious application of them, they have (as it is natural to conclude) withdrawn themselves from my reach to avoid my controul. It has been represented in the exparte statements of the Journals of the day, that I absconded from England, and that Vincent, the attorney for the prosecution, with Mr. Cook. one of my prosecutors, had gone in search of me. But where did these gentlemen find me? Why, at Calais, on my return to England, just about to step into the steam-boat, after having finished the business on which I went to France, and which was totally unconnected with my pecuniary affairs. I had learnt in the interim, that the state of my affairs required my return; and when those gentlemen met me, they examined my portmanteau, under the impression that I had a large sum of money with me; but they found nothing but a few articles of jewellery, from which Vincent took a diamond ring, which he put on his finger, and said he would keep for the trouble he had been at; and Mr. Cooke took the rest, together with Bank-notes to the amount of 45l. which they never would have returned, had I not informed Mr. Wigley, the attorney for my commission, of the circumstance. Far be it from me to throw out any reflections upon the character of Vincent or my prosecutors, which the appalling necessity of my present situation cannot deduce from the facts of my case; I am quite aware of the doubtful reserve of assent with which such reflections are usually heard, when proceeding from the lips of one similarly conditioned to myself; but, if it may be admitted that the solemn consideration of that condition may so far influence my heart, as to make it circumspect in every assertion and representation of fact, then I would fam hope, that what I have stated and may continue to assert, is not the language of sophisticated contrivance, but a plain description of real occurrences. On the faith of this declaration, I would entrent you to decide between the conduct of my prosecutor and my own; I was returning to make the best I could of my embarrassed circumstances - they met me, not providing any cautionary means for the concealment of my return, but openly going on board a vessel amidst the rest of the passengers; when, instead of constraining me by arrest for debt, or upon a warrant for any criminal charge, they proposed to me to give them what money I had, adding that they had a plan for my escape: but, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, from what had I to escape? my conscience did not echo at this word, nor did it suggest its meaning in any sense which might he appropriate to the position of my circumstances, for surely had escape been my object, I had far better opportunities of completing it before my prosecutors met me, than any which they could have devised; and least of all, should I, with so much fatnity of plan, have frustrated such an object, by returning to the very country from which that escape would have been indispensible. From such a proposal on their part, what can be deduced, but the evident conclusion that they would have opened every channel for my evading the claims of my other creditors, had I been able to accede to their demands, by purchasing that chance on their own terms; and neither law nor equity would have been matters of consideration to them, if justice to these creditors could have been sacrificed to their joint proposition; and yet with this plain fact against them, they take credit to themselves for having (as they call it) overtaken and secured the man whose escape they would have sanctioned. Forcibly impressed with a just sense of their conduct, which I had rather leave to your feelings, Gentlemen of the Jury, to characterize, than take upon myself to pourtray: my resolution was instantly formed - I had only to persist in what I had previously determined upon. I returned with them, instead of returning by myself; and to shew that such return was an act of my own voluntary occurrence, when we arrived in London, I went to a coffee-house to sleep, while they returned to their own homes. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I do earnestly implore you to put all these events together, and allow me, as it is customary in all circumstances which bear relation to the conduct of every prisoner who comes before you, that portion of considerate admission which gives to such conduct the aspect of unconscious criminality: if such unconsciousness of crime, had not, in all its calmness, had possession of my breast, and if I had contemplated escape as the only alternative to save my life, I might have avoided returning to London; and when actually returned, I might have taken advantage of the opportunity given me, of sleeping at the coffee-house, in that degree of freedom which left me to my own disposal. Had I availed myself of any one of the facilities of escape, which the proposal of my prosecutors placed in my power, I had not now been before your Lordship, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury, waiting in anxious tri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110010"/>bulation of heart and mind your decision upon the facts which I have stated, so far as you may deem them correlative with that justice of which you are the authorised dispensers. But, Gentlemen of the Jury, I do most fervently beseech you to detach your judgment from all possibility of influence, arising from every assertion that has been brought into action against me, previous to this solemn period of my appearing at the bar. One such assertion I would anxiously rebut, and the more so, because I can most unevasively deny it before that Omniscient Being whose name I still reverence, and who knoweth the very imagination of the thoughts. Mr. Pratt, one of the prosecutors, has declared that I have admitted to him the bills were forgeries. Let me ask you, Gentlemen of the Jury, to what purpose could I have made this admission? even supposing it were true, could the faculties of my mind have been so astounded by mere alarm as to have betrayed me into it, surely that alarm, if guilt produced it, would have led me to take quite a different course, for that alarm must have been for my life; and who is there that under any alarm of this kind would not seek to preserve life, and to extricate it from peril? Could I, on the other hand, have made the admission when under no compulsion so to do, when my conscience would have upheld me in an unqualified assertion of my innocence of the charges brought against me. It is true that it sometimes happens to a timid mind tacitly to admit an accusation which it knows to be false, under the conviction that no proof of it can possibly be adduced; but, Gentlemen of the Jury, neither fatuity of mind arising from consciousness of crime, nor timidity acted upon by a principle of expediency, held any ruling influence over me of which Mr. Pratt could take the advantage, so as to substantiate the constructions he has put upon my words, for in fact I made no such admissions; I deny it utterly, and on the truth of that denial I stake the salvation of my soul. I did indeed so far yield to his promises on the one hand, and his threats on the other, as to admit that the bills were bad - bad in a commercial sense, in which sense the word is always understood; and in this sense alone I used the expression, meaning that as I myself was unable to honour them, I did not expect they would be paid by the other parties. It is clear that when Mr. Pratt took those bills from me, and gave me other bills in exchange, not money, as he had sworn, besides taking 15 per cent. for his accommodation, he was satisfied with my responsibility; and at the time he asked me for bills, I most unequivocally declare that I felt that responsibility to be commensurate with Mr. Pratt's - I say his responsibility; for Mr. Pratt forgot that when he swore he gave me money for the bills, he gave me other acceptances, not cash altogether. Mr. Cooke also, though he swore before Alderman Brown that he had discounted the bills with his mother's money, no doubt forgot at the time they were done by him with part of his own acceptance, other bills and part cash. Thus far, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have confined myself to the principal transactions by which I am inculpated, and to the motives which have remotely or more immediately led to them. Perhaps in such a case of so deep an importance to myself, as a matter of life and death, and also so important to society and to yourselves as to the urgency of one essential point that such a decision may become too consistent with the justice due to society, of which my prosecutors would now appear the advocates, and to the sacred suggestions of your unbiassed consciences; perhaps, I say, under such a complication of the most active anxieties that regulate the exertions of man, both in defence and accusation, it may not be deemed irrelavent or inexpedient that I should sepresent to you, for your advangeous consideration, the conduct of the attorney for the prosecution Mr. Vincent, who first proved the act of bankruptcy against me, next offered to me the terms of compromise, both personally and by messengers, then suggested to me the conditional plan for my escape, and lastly, as you now see, has devised, in co-operation with my prosecutors, another plan to take away that life which I would not purchase at the dishonourable price of sacrificing my other creditors to the cupidity of himself and his clients. Since my arrival in England I have been assailed by the most insidious and contumelious instrumentality to which a malignant and inhuman spirit could give action. I do most contritely confess that like other men I have offended both inad vertently and wilfully against my better judgment; but I do protest against the means and motives which ich e been applied by my enemies to distort and multiply my offences from among those enemies; and in elucidation of those means and motives I feel compelled, in justice to myself, to select by name and profession Mr. Vincent, the attorney for the prosecution. I have good reason to expect, if the witnesses which I shall bring forward will compute, by the standard of Christian rectitude, the immeasurable distance which divides personal consideration from the power and opportunity of testifying, in behalf of an individual whose existence is weighed in the balance of life and death, that I shall be enabled to trace to that Mr. Vincent a most unfounded and acrimonious article in some of the morning papers of the 2d of April, the major part of which he himself personally knew to be false, and that at an instant of time, when he was, by professional and personal assurance pledged, in word and honour, to do all he could to assist and serve me. Whether or not my prosecutors were privy to this enormity of cruel, and in my present circumstances sanguinary anticipation of the success of their projects against me. I have not the means to prove, although I have too much reason to suspect their co-operation. To you, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, such conduct as I think I shall prove against the attorney for the prosecution, must appear abhorrent and abominable; and so far I feel I am justified in bringing this circumstance before the cognizance of this Court, and in justification of the epithets which I have used of "cruel and sanguinary." I can incontestibly prove that, failing in his object of compromise, he expressed himself in the following deadly terms - "I will have his life; and like a wasp, will sting him to death." Why this acrimony on the part of Vincent, the answer is obvious; he dreads my being restored to society, lest I should bring in light deeds which, as an attorney, must strike him from the Rolls; such as deeds of usury in the discount<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110011"/>of bills, and taking post-dated cheques for a week, and giving his own, at the enormous charge of five per cent per week, with the addition of a dozen of wine as a present. I have deprecated that possible construction of the tenor of my defence, so far as it may be exposed to the charge of denunciatory accusation of my prosecutors and their attorney; but I think I may refer the justice of my observations to that test of their motives and measures which the more equitable and humble feelings of yourselves, Gentlemen of the Jury, will naturally, and I hope simultaneously adopt: and now, Gentlemen of the Jury - for to you I address myself more particularly - in the appeal I have to make to your convictions, your feelings, and your decision. Hitherto I have presumed to make my address to his Lordship conjointly with yourselves, and I have done so on this ground, because as the Judge, by whose direction the useful or fruitless endeavour of my defence will be pointed out to you, I have addressed myself to him in the earnest anxiety of mind, that whatever his adjudication of my case may be, he may perceive that I have so modelled that address that he may be in possession of my own knowledge of the facts, and of that construction of them, which is, whether arising out of my motives or actions, or may be in correspondence with his impartial view of both, and in adoption to that privilege of every man before a court of British judicature, who cannot be regarded as guilty until your verdict has pronounced him to be so. In that tremulous state of suspense which every man labouring under so solemn an accusation as that against which I at this important moment have had to contend; I leave my fate in your hands, with a well-grounded confidence, that whatever may be your decision, no advantage will be withheld from me which my view in this defence may have made out in my favour, nor any disadvantage adopted by you which may deteriorate my cause, or set aside those hopes of a favourable verdict, which my conscientious convictions of better motives than what my prosecutors have ascribed to me may have justified me in forming. Gentlemen of the Jury, allow me to place myself before you, exactly as I feel in my heart and soul that I ought to appear to you. I am accused of a very heinous crime, that of forgery; I protest against this accusation by the most solemn asseverations of my innocence. I have opened to you the whole tenor of my transactions out of which this accusation has originated; I have asserted, and my assertion will be proved, that my prosecutors, if they were in possession of that evidence which would substautiate the accusation, have offered and endeavoured by various acts of their own to induce me to accept a compromise of the illegality of the act on which they have grounded this accusation; I have developed the means and instrumentality which they have used to urge my acquiescence in their offer. I have placed before you the opportunities and facilities which they offered me of escaping from the consequences which they, in their anxiety to obtain my acquiescence, urged upon my consideration, and pressed upon my self reference; I have laid before you the reasons for my refusing that acquiescence, and I have, I hope, made it appear that it was not consciousness of guilt, but of duty, which has operated upon me throughout all my resistance to their promises, entreaties, and threats; and I have manifested a desire to act with impartiality to those of my creditors to whom such an acquiescence in the views of my prosecutors would have been unjust, disgraceful, and dishonest, in the worst sense of these terms. Bu Gentlemen, if I were to enlarge the sphere of my appeal to your favourable construction of my defence beyond this part of its extent, I should plead to my personal susceptibilities, and implore their intervention in my behalf, while I relate to you that the widow of the late Mr. Lewis, who was an assistant of mine for above twelve years, and who was to have succeeded me in my school, and her three orphan children, for whom I stood godfather, and whom I promised the father on his dying bed to support, that their daily subsistence, and, I may add, their very existence in society depends on my exertions and opportunities of supply for their wants, were they present here, and could be aware of the consequences of your verdict, their little hearts would burst out with the exclamation "Be merciful to our only friend and protector, and restore him to us," but, Gentlemen, it is not my object to overpower my feelings, or to interest yours beyond the influence of your judgment; but, if upon your having maturally weighed the nature of the evidence against me, and the character of the witnesses who have given that evidence; if, upon comparing the meditation of the crime of which I am charged, and the total inadequate proofs to bring it home to me; if, upon considering the incongruity between the motives of my accusers, and those which could be supposed to actuate me to the perpetration of the deed which forms the ground of accusation; if you should haply think that, upon any computation of injury suffered by the parties who bring forward their accusation, their loss has not been equal to that gain which they have so long derived from their participation in their transactions which are alleged in accusation against me; and, finally, if you perceive from the nature of that proof by which they have sought to substantiate their charge of forgery against me, the premises are incongruent with those proofs, or those proofs not sufficient to substantiate those premises; then, Gentlemen of the Jury, I would infer, with that measure of hope, which I may justly be supposed to calculate upon, in accordance with the honourable impartiality and humane consideration of a British jury, that you will at once, by your verdict, relieve me from the awful responsibility under which my spirit now struggles and groans in afflictive foreboding, but not in guilty anticipation of your decision. Hitherto, Gentlemen of the Jury, I have said but little in extenuation of that criminal perpetration with which I am presumptuously charged, destructive as all degrees of this crime of forgery must be to the interests of society in a commercial country like ours, still, even if it had been proved to have been committed by me in this instance, I am prepared to prove, that so far as my prosecutors are concerned, they, and they only have been injured, and the injury which they have suffered has been nothing in proportion to their participation in these usurious gains which they have been for several years securing to themselves; if I had committed the turpitude which they have sought to fasten upon me, and to which they would make my life the sacrifice, to them only is that injury confined, and from the sense which they themselves have shown they had of that injury, I would infer that they cannot have been materially, if at all, affected in their property and pecuniary interests, when, as in fact, they would have compromised that loss by offering to take one-fourth of its amount, not scrupuling to comprehend in that compromise a certain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110012"/>and assured plan for my escape from all penalties attached to the deed, which they then did not designate as forgery, but which their disappointment of my acquiescence has led them after, beginning by a civil action, subsequently to form into the shape of a felonious act. I would hope that I need not further urge these circumstances upon your consideration, judicial and humane. There does, however, remain to me one painful urgency upon my personal anxiety to interest your sympathy, which I would not, which I cannot, suppress. You see before you, Gentlemen of the Jury, the eleemosynary guardian and protector of three helpless orphans, without any seasonable succour they must long ago have been left to the perils, and corruptions of a world of vicissitude and temptation. I have hitherto shielded them, so far as mortal intervention could effect it, from the privations of one, and the viscious infections of the other; and, at this very moment, I feel it my duty more than ever to use all my endeavours to provide for them, when their mother has been stripped of all the little furniture which her husband left her at his death, it having been sold by public auction for the benefit of my creditors. If my life continue not, they will in vain seek for succour from any other source, and my fate determines irremediably theirs. I know, Gentlemen of the Jury, that this is no plea against the decision of your impartial view of my case; but I do also know, that if it be within the range of that impartiality to save my life from the attack now made upon it, you especially that have children, will feel an additional gratification to that of doing your duty, in the consciousness that you have saved the lives of three human beings from the worst of evils, in giving to their earthly protector, the renewal of his opportunities of continuing that protection. I hope I may so far rely on your justice, beseeching you to endeavour to divest your minds of any prejudice which you may have entertained from reading the statements in newspapers. I am aware that such an endeavour is almost beyond the power of man fully to accomplish; still, I do entreat you will make the attempt, and I am persuaded you will do so, remembering that those statements were made by Vincent, the attorney for the prosecution, in conjunction, no doubt, with the prosecutors, for the better accomplishing his cruel designs, and thereby prevent that justice being done to me which a plain statement of facts, unprejudiced by false and exparte statements, must have produced, in ensuring me your favourable verdict. But, Gentlemen of the Jury, I forbear further to urge your humane feelings in contradistinction to or even in concurrence with, your justice. I hope I may say that I rely implicitly upon the latter, beseeching you to endeavour to divest your minds with emotions beyond the power of description, in all their force. I do unfeignedly implore the Father of Mercies, and the God of all consolation, before whom we must all one day appear, to give an account of our use or abuse of his mercies dispensed to each of us, to direct your judgment, and to conform your wills to the following of his own divine example, in judging, not according to appearance, but in righteous judgment, and that judgment tempered with mercy."Be ye merciful, even as your Father which is in Heaven is also merciful."</p>

               <p>Case of Clerical Delinquency - Further Particulars.</p>
               <p>In consequence of certain rumours, we have made inquiry into the conduct of this person, and in the whole annals of guilt, we scarcely find one equal in atrocity. It appears that about thirty years since this man was ordained in holy orders, under the name of Fall, but why, or wherefore, he subsequently changed his name to that he now bears, remains at present a mystery- under the assumed name of Fenn, he was employed as a teacher in Kirkman's academy, at Islington, and about ten years since purchased, on his own account, an academy in Bloomsbury, in which he succeeded beyond his most sanguine expectations. Unfortunately for him, and, we may say with truth, for the greatest body of his creditors, Mr. Fenn was not satisfied with the profits derived from his school; he started also as a bill-broker, or rather discounter of bills, taking to himself (as others of that notorious class do) an exorbitant rate of interest- he thus made many bad debts, and was himself ultimately induced to resort to other usurers, who, like himself, though more wary, were not wanting in the rate to be charged to a brother miscreant. Spurred on by this connexion, he was led to commit the crime of forgery, and not only committed various forgeries himself, but he also made one of his tutors draw and accept bills in fictitious names - he also had the unmanly hardihood to involve his pupils in his guilt, for he has also, in a like manner, made them draw, accept, and indorse fictitious bills, and has circulated that kind of rubbish (among tradesmen only) to an enormous amount; and in order to give a greater facility to his criminal traffic, an account was opened at Messrs. Ransom's bank; this circumstance gave a degree of credit to his movements, and by an insinnating address, pretended friendship, and plausibility of manner, ingratiated himself with various tradesmen; he would in some instances pretend that he possessed a a bill for a large amount, such as 2000l. on this nobleman or the other, and that he was himself to receive 200l. or 300l. from the pretended nobleman, for the accommodation, and consequently could afford to give the unsuspecting tradesman 50l. for the loan of 500l.; the tradesman confiding in the sanctified clergyman has in many instances been thus duped to the tune of 2000l. or 3000l. Again the clergyman would produce one of his concocted bills, and say "If you discount me this 200l. at 5 per cent. I will take 50l. worth of goods, and you shall draw a bill on me for the amount of the goods;" so that this fellow has in many instances obtained 250l. for one of his forged bills of 200l. It appears that the circumstances which led to his immediate detection, was his absenting himself from his home, together with several of his cheques (which he had post-dated) becoming due, which were returned, as a matter of course, by his banker, for want of funds; under these circumstances a meeting was convened, and an intercepted letter coming to hand, disclosed the whole system, and that the Rev. gentleman had emigrated to Paris, under the assumed named of George Lewis. It may be imagined that he had associates in his guilt, and cosequently those associates leave no stone unturned to prevent inquiry. We say, if certain parties (whom we can name) are not equally culpable, how is it that an immediate inquiry has not been instituted? public justice demands inquiry. It is a curious fact, that with all the Rev. gentleman's frauds, it does not appear that he has lodged any of his concocted paper with his immediate associates, namely, the bill-brokers. The following are a few of the persons who hold the Rev. gentleman's forgeries:-Messrs. Davies, of Giltspur-street, Auctioneers; Mr. E. Jones, Whitefriars'-wharf, coal-merchant; Messrs. Toswell's, Garlickhill; Messrs. Cookson, Strand; Mr. King, Bolton-street, Piccadilly; Messrs. Hansler and Mc. Kensie, Round-court, Strand, wine-merchants; Messrs. Davidson, Oxford-street; Mr. Pratt, Parliament-street; Mr. Marshall, Great Ormond-street: Mr. Wigley, Essex-street, solicitor." - I know the above to be true in substance and effect. G. VINCENT, Solicitor, Clifford's Inn.(The authentication did not appear in the newspapers.)</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110013"/>JOHN HANBURY. I am a printer. I was at Calais this year; I saw Mr. Vincent the attorney and Mr. Cook there about the 24th or 25th of March: the prisoner had then been there one day and one night, and was returning to England with me. I came from Paris with him; I came home by myself, leaving them at Calais, and saw them in London the next day, the 26th.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did Vincent, or Cook in his presence hold out any inducement to the prisoner to confess himself guilty of the crime, or to make disclosures? A. They did, both of them, Vincent in particular. He made no confession in my presence: this was at a house called the Crown. close to the landing-place - I heard these offers made both in England and Calais.</p>
               <p>Q. State what passed at Calais. A. We met Mr. Cook and Vincent at the door, as our trunks were going out to the packet, and we were going to breakfast - they wished to speak with the prisoner privately, and wished me to retire - I refused, as I was his friend, but after some persuasion on vtheir parts I did retire for a time; in the interim the prisoner's trunk had been brought back to his bedchamber; on my return I saw Cook and Vincent searching his trunk, and several Bank notes and sovereigns were on the table: I asked them if they had any writ for him whereby they could detain him in Calais, as they would not let him return with me; they said No, they were his friends, and he was quite safe in their hands. I asked if they had seen Messrs. Wigley and Boteleer at Paris - they said No, they had not - they acted for themselves; they had no wish to hurt him - they only wanted their own and to let him escape - they said they had a plan for his escape if they could get their money. I then applied to the prisoner to know if I should stop with him - they assured me they were his friends, and it was fortunate for him that he had fallen into their hands: I then told him I must go, and he gave me a 5l. note to bring me home, for my money was spent - that is all I recollect passing in Calais.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, were you sent by Vincent to propose any terms to the prisoner? A. I was, with a Mr. R. Thompson - Mr. Pratt did not send me to him.</p>

            . Q. Did you not send that witness to Fenn to threaten him for his life if he did not confess what he had done with the money? A. I never spoke to the man except at Calais - I never sent any message by Richard Thompson - I do not know him - I found there were six or eight persons equally guilty with the prisoner - there is a Mrs. Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say to Mrs. Thompson that if the prisoner would acknowledge the truth as to the bills, he should not be hurt in any way whatever? A. I never did.</p>

             re-examined. Vincent did send me and Mr. Thompson to Fenn - his words I think were, he would lose his life if he did not confess where he had hid his money.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did you go over to Paris with the prisoner? A. No, I met him at Paris - I went there for Mrs. Lewis - I went to Calais first, and found he had gone to Paris - I first went about the 19th or 20th March, and found him in the post-office - I went to the post-office to inquire for him, instead of the police-office, by mistake- he came in to inquire for a letter while I was there - he went by the name of Lewis at Paris - he has been Mrs Lewis's protector since her husband's death.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean, I suppose, they were living together? A. I deny that insinuation - it was as a father; he promised the husband on his death-bed that he would protect the wife and children - I was present - that was in November. Mrs. Lewis was not in Paris: I went there for her to see what was the matter with Mr. Fenn, as she expected him in two days, and he had not returned. I did not know he was going by the name of Lewis till I went off - I then heard it from Mrs. Lewis: I have known him twelve years; I never knew him by the name of Fall or Ford; he has been in England ever since I knew him; I have heard from him that he has been in Jersey, not in Guernsey; I have heard that he went by the name of Fall by the papers; I saw the outside of a letter before I went to Paris, but not the inside - I cannot say it was from him. I travelled with him from Paris to Calais - he still kept the name of Lewis: I did not see Messrs. Boteleer and Wigley at Paris - I know they were in Calais, as I saw them there - Mr. Boteleer is a gentleman of great respectability connected with some fire-office in Bridge-street. I have been printer to one morning journal these ten years; I had permission to go to Paris - I know nothing whatever of the bill transactions. When I saw Vincent and Cook at Calais, my baggage was going to the packet with the prisoner's - I was at Calais about two and half hours after that, but not with them - I refused to leave the room for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and when I went out I came in again - I was not absent half an hour, and did not stop there half an hour - I left them to go on board after the trunks were searched; I was present then - there were some Bank notes and sovereigns taken out, and I believe there were some papers, but I did not take particular notice, as they professed themselves such friends - I had not breakfasted when they came.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath, had you not breakfasted, paid your bill, and was going on board the packet? A. I never paid a bill at all, Mr. Fenn paid it; when I was going out of the passage they presented me with the bill - I said the gentleman up stairs would pay it - that was an hour after I first saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Mr. Cook made some professions to him? A. He clasped his hands together, and said he was a ruined man (Cook did) - he smacked his head, and said he was a ruined man, and begged him to confess what he had done with his money, as there must be money somewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. With whose money? A. The prisoner's. Cook said he must have money, and wished to know what he had done with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the whole of the inducement held out? A. In Calais it was. Fenn paid my expences, and so he did Cook and Vincent's - Mr. Cook told me so; I had no communication with Mr. Pratt.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. They appeared to treat him as such great friends:- you did not particularly notice what came out of the trunk? A. They did so. I only know of charges against the prisoner's character from the newspapers.</p>

Skillern came up and took hold of him - he had run up a court about one hundred yards off, but I never lost sight of him; I felt my purse and money safe five minutes before, and could not have lost it, for my pocket was deep; I put him into a hackney coach - he there said, he was the son of respectable parents, and requested me not to bring the case before a Magistrate; I said it was a public duty - I was certain of his person; he then said he would make up the sum to me if I would not bring the case before a Magistrate. There were seven or eight persons hustling me before, and one man behind me with a box, was looking as if to see if the thing was complete - I kept my eye on the prisoner, and do not know what become of the others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where had you received this money? A. I brought it from Bedford; I changed a sovereign at a booksellers in Ave Maria-lane - my purse was then safe, and I am certain it was safe when I got to the Belle Sauvage, as nobody was near me - I had not felt it after I left the shop; I do not remember a coach coming out of the inn-yard - there was one outside; that might have occasioned a stoppage on the payment; I think I told the Alderman of perceiving the man's hand on my thigh, or on my pocket - I know it was his hand by seeing his face; I cannot say what I told the Alderman; the prisoner stood on my left side, obliquely - none of the gang offered to obstruct me; he was taken about thirty feet down the court - I said he had stolen my purse; he said I might search him, for he had not taken it, or something to that effect; he was searched, and only a few shillings found on him - he might have conveyed my purse away by sleight of hand; he was not out of my sight - he might have given it away before his hand was on my thigh; when in the coach he at first said I might be mistaken in the man; I said it was not so; and when he found that would not do, he said rather than be taken, he would make it up to me - he said he would give me the money provided I would not take him before a Justice.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was your pocket turned out or not? A. No; I had buttoned it, but I found it open - the prisoner wore a dark coat and waistcoat.</p>

            , JUN. I was walking arm-in-arm with my father. I perceived several men round us - we could not move; they hustled us - I had no idea they were going to rob us; I thought it was done intentionally; my father turned round suddenly, and said he was robbed; I then saw the prisoner about a yard from my father - he ran across the road, down a court, and was taken; I am certain he is the man who ran, for I saw him all the time. I was in the coach - he said he had respectable parents, and did not wish to be brought before a Magistrate, and afterwards said he would make good the money if we said nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you walking nearer to the wall than your father? A. Yes; my father's left side was towards the street; I did not notice any stoppage of carriages; I tried to get out of the crowd as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not another man get out of it by crossing the way? A. If he wanted he might, I suppose - I will not say nobody was nearer to my father than him.</p>

            . I am a Blackwell-hall factor, and live in Church-passage, Basinghall-street. On the 31st of July I went with my errand-boy into Wood-street to fetch two pieces of cloth, which were put on his shoulder; he turned down Lad-lane and I down Love-lane, and when I got down by the church, at the end of Love-lane, I saw the prisoner carrying the two ends of cloth on his shoulder; I thought they looked like mine; I had been absent from the boy about five minutes; I went across, took up the end of the cloth, and saw the number by which I identified it, and asked him where he was going with the goods; he said he was going to Bishopsgate-street with them, that a gentleman in Lad-lane sent him with them; I asked his name - he said he did not know; he kept walking on; I said they were my goods, and as we got near Browns, the clothworkers, I got the door open, put him in, and gave him in charge; the cloth is worth about 27l.; I was about three hundred yards from Lad-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not ask you to go back to the place where the gentleman gave him the cloth? A. No;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110016"/>I do not remember anything of the sort; I was at the Compter with the boy; I do not recollect saying anything to him about identifying the man; I most likely was angry with him, but not for not identifying him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>MILLER's Defence. I was sitting on the rails in Smithfield Market; a gentleman came up, and asked me to carry a parcel for him from No. 42, Newgate-street, to the Goose and Gridiron public-house, St. Paul's, and I was to ask for Mr. Green; I went to No. 42, Newgate-street, but could not see the gentleman; I went to the passage and saw the parcel there, but not the gentleman - I asked two men in the passage for Green; they asked if I had come for a parcel - I said, Yes, and they lifted it on my shoulder - I let my hat fall as I came out, and this young man picked it up, and walked by my side - I never saw him before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear you were not half an hour on the road hustling and quarrelling with them? A. It was not half an hour I am certain; I do not think it could be twenty minutes; I did not strike either of them, nor threaten to punch West's head; French did not interfere till he was pushed against the wall; they did not push me against the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Turpin say if you attempted to punch West's head you must fight him, as he was a better match for you? A. He did not; there was no watchman till we got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110017"/>to Ealing; it happened about a mile and a half from Ealing; I was quite sober; I never said I had a scuffle, and lost the things; I have seen West's father several times, but never told him I was rather fresh, not tipsy: we did not leave work till six o'clock; we had been working at Ealing for Mr. Thorn, and went to take a walk; we had two pints of beer and one pint of ale at the Red Lion public-house, but had no spirits all day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. They said you were going the wrong way, was it so? A. No, it was the right way.</p>

Turpin turned round, and ran away; we took West.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you and your friend armed yourselves with sticks to renew the battle? A. We did not; we had no sticks in the church-yard; the gentleman who came out could not see me knocked down; as they were talking to Fincher, about 100 yards off - Turpin ran up and struck me, and directly they heard the gentleman's voice, they ran away; we got sticks to defend ourselves in case we should meet them again; we did not offer to strike them - the bundle has not been found.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had any of the men sticks? A. I saw one stick standing against the wall, who it belonged to I do not know; West said he was perfectly willing to go to the cage.

I never saw the prisoner before; her mother was about six weeks in the place where I lodged - she lodged in the lower room for a fortnight, and then came to lodge in the same room with me, at <placeName id="t18280911-16-crimeloc85">No. 5, Crown-court, White's-yard, Rosemary-lane, Whitechapel</placeName>

                        targets="t18280911-16-off84 t18280911-16-crimeloc85"/> - a woman named Smith kept the room, and lived there; another woman lodged there; Smith had two children, and the other woman had two children also. On Tuesday, the 26th of August, I saw the prisoner there; I was out for about five minutes before this happened, and when I came back I found her in the room - I had never seen her before there; Toomey and the prisoner's mother were there - Mrs. Smith was not there: there was another woman named McCarthy, but she went down as soon as the row began - there were three children in the room, mine, Toomey's and the prisoner's: my child and the prisoner's lay on the bed - Toomey had hers in her arms; there was a fire in the room, and a kettle on it, when I went in. As soon as the row began the prisoner told her mother to take the kettle off the fire, because it was boiling.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, the prisoner said "Take the kettle off because it is boiling?" A. Yes, and the mother took it off in about two minutes, and put it down on the hearth: the prisoner's mother got hold of Toomey and asked her what business she had there; she said she was in a gossip's place, she had been there before, and she would be there after.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110018"/>Q. Who did she mean by the gossip? A. Smith, who keeps the room; when she made that answer, the prisoner went up and struck her over the side of the head with a stone bottle - Toomey said she was much obliged for the reception she had given her, and she did not expect such a reception, when she came up stairs - then the prisoner went over to Toomey, and struck her in the face with her fist again: up to this time Toomey's child was in her lap, and mine on the bed - Toomey then put her child on my lap, saying it was a pity to let a blow go twice; she then got up, took hold of the prisoner, and knocked her down on the other bed - she fell on the bed without much violence; she shoved her on it- the prisoner's mother and brother then came and began to beat Toomey; I then got up, saying it was a pity for two to be on one, and began to part them as well as I could - the prisoner screamed Murder! three times when Toomey beat her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Toomey and the prisoner were fighting? A. Yes - she screamed Murder! Mrs. Anderson came up and began to separate the prisoner and her mother from Toomey and the brother: they were separated, and the mother went out of the room to look for an officer - I had put Toomey's child in bed along with my own, and in the same bed with the prisoner's child; they all three lay on one bed - when Anderson separated the prisoner, she (the prisoner) came, pulled my hair and tore my gown off; I was not able to resist after that - I went over towards the window to put my hair up; my cap and all was off - the prisoner then went over to the bed, took her child off and laid it under the window; I saw her put a child there - I cannot say whose it was; she then made over to a kettle of boiling water, which lay on the hearth, and said if she could not get her revenge on the b-l-y women, she would on the children: she took the kettle in her hand and threw it in among the children in the bed; she threw kettle and all on the bed - she then ran and took her own child from under the window: the lid was on the kettle when she threw it, but it came off and was found in the bed afterwards - she threw it up towards where the children were, at the head of the bed; there were two children then on the bed - her own was under the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the kettle fell on the children? A. No. I heard it go against the wall with the force of the blow, about three fingers' length above the bed. I ran to take my child off the bed, and saw the kettle in the bed; I dipped my child into a tub of cold water which stood opposite the bed - its clothes were entirely full of water - the heat of the water burnt my fingers as I took her up - it was all over water except its face and stomach, which lay on the bed: I screamed out that my child was killed; a man ran up stairs and took it to the hospital - I was there till it died, which was about one o'clock next day - it had never had a day's sickness in its life, and five minutes before it happened, I saw it on the bed as well as ever it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have never been married? A. No; it was the only child I ever had - I cannot say what day of the month it was christened: I never swore it to anybody - I never had occasion- I get my living by selling oysters and fruit; I lived with a man named Moore, but not at that time - he is the father - he is now at sea; I am eighteen years old next St. Patrick's day - Moore has been at sea five months, and was at home when the child was born; I have lived at this house ever since it was born, and never saw the prisoner before that afternoon: I cannot say what time it happened - I believe it was about two or three o'clock in the day - the prisoner's mother and I had lived in the same room together for about three weeks; the prisoner had never seen the child before, to my knowledge - I did nothing to her but separated them.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not you take away the mother in order that Toomey might beat her? A. I took her away that the prisoner and Toomey might fight it out together - they fought for about three minutes before they came up stairs - they fought for about ten minutes altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it begin? A. Toomey and the prisoner had some words down in the court - they made it up, and came up together; they had not fought down stairs, they only had a couple of words, as I heard them say - they fought for about ten minutes altogether, then the kettle was thrown - it had been off the fire ten minutes: I saw the prisoner with one black eye, when I saw her at Lambeth-street - she beat Toomey more than she beat her, only she did not give her a black eye; I never said she took the kettle off the fire or hob, nor that she poured the water on the child; I only just dipped my child into the cold water, took it out again, and screamed Murder! the prisoner had called Murder! three times - that was before Anderson came up.</p>
               <p>Q. She was beating Toomey almost all the time? A. Yes; Toomey wasover her on the bed - she got the best of it; the brother was about eight years old - he was beating Toomey in the face with his fist; the mother was dragging her by the gown and tore it off her back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she throw the kettle the very instant she was separated from Toomey? A. After she beat me, Anderson shoved her away from me to part us; I never offered to fight either of them - I only pushed the mother away, I did not strike either of them; I went to the hospital in five minutes, leaving the prisoner and her mother in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner like a mad woman? A. No; she was perfectly calm, quite collected, not at all agitated - I observed she was not at all alarmed at what she had done.</p>
               <p>Q. You took particular notice to see whether she was agitated? A. When I saw the people come about her, I saw her putting up her hair as unconcerned as if she had not done it at all; I did not join in the row - I sat on the bed; she had invited Toomey up to have tea with her - I was on the bed when she and Toomey came up stairs; I always called the child little Mary or little Mary Moore. I am a Catholic. Smith, my landlady, took it to the priest to be christened about three weeks or a fortnight after it was born.</p>

            . I am single; I know the prisoner and her mother. On the 25th of August I had had some words with the prisoner; she afterwards called me up stairs to her mother's lodging in Crown-court - I had my child with me; I went up, and the prisoner began to abuse me - we had not many words before she came over and struck me; I was sitting down with my child in my arms - she struck me on the head with a stone bottle; Crawley<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110019"/>was in the room, and had a child in her arms - the prisoner had her child; she laid it out of her arms before she struck me, and put it on the bed; she struck me once without the stone bottle, then struck me with it: her mother was in the room and came over and struck me, then caught me by my hair and dragged me about - they were both on me at once; I gave my child to Crawley to defend myself from them both: Crawley seeing them both beating me threw the two children on the bed, out of her arms, and came to save me from them: the prisoner's brother was in the room - he struck me too; they were all on me, when Crawley came to my assistance - Crawley came between them both as well as she could, to save me - I was then standing; I cried out Murder! and Mrs. Anderson ran up stairs - she put them all aside as well as she could, disengaged me from her hands and separated us: the prisoner then took her own child out of the bed and put it under the window, about as far from the bed as I am from your Lordship; she then went up to the fire, a kettle of water stood on the hearth; she said if she could not have revenge on the women she would on the children - she took the kettle off the hearth and threw it over the bed, right over the two children; she stood at the side of the bed, near the wall; she did not pour the water out, but threw kettle and all - the kettle did not go near the children, as I saw; it stopped in the bed, it did not hit them - the lid was on when she took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. From anything that passed, had you an opportunity of knowing whether the water was cold or hot? A. It was on the fire when I came up; I did not see anything done to it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When it went out of the prisoner's hands, where did it hit? A. I did not notice; immediately it was thrown, the children began to cry - Anderson called"Murder! the children are scalded to death" - I took up mine; Crawley took her child up and dipped it down - a man came up and took it to the hospital; my child was also sealded, but not so dangerously as the other - I took it to the hospital; the doctor dressed it - I brought it home. Crawley's child was called little Mary Moore.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is that your child you have got in your arms? A. Yes. I took it to the hospital two or three mornings, and had leave to stay with it there - it was getting well: I did not strike the prisoner till she struck me twice; I know her mother, but had never quarrelled with her - I live at No. 11, Crown court.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had you at her house? A. I was going for some tea and sugar - I was not asked to tea; I called Murder! two or three times, and that brought Mrs. Anderson up: the prisoner did not cry Murder! she had a black eye, which I believe I gave her - Craw. ley did not fight, she only came between us - I did not see her strike at all; the fight might last about a quarter of an hour - the prisoner was in a very great passion; nobody but her beat me; there were three of them against me - I could not do much - I got into a passion when she struck me; the children lay on the bed dressed, not under the clothes - we had been talking at the foot of the stairs, but not scolding; I got into a passion when she struck me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Though you were not asked to tea were you up stairs? A. The prisoner asked me to come up; after the child was scalded she sat on the bed, and seemed to take no notice of the children.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were talking at the foot of the stairs, what words passed between you? A. I cannot tell the words - there was no quarrelling then; the quarrel began up stairs, by the prisoner saying she was a married woman, and one thing or another; I said if she were married, she had no occasion to talk about it; I do not know what was said afterwards; I said if she were married that was enough - I had not said she was not married.</p>

            . I am married, and live at No. 5, Crown-court, on the second floor. On this day, before I went up, I heard a noise, as if they were all fighting together; I ran up stairs - it was between four and five o'clock; I first saw the prisoner's mother on the bed very much in liquor, and Mrs. Toomey was beating her - I tried to part them, and did so; as soon as I parted the prisoner's mother, she ran down stairs - the prisoner and Crawley were in the room; when the mother had gone down stairs, the prisoner fell on Crawley, and beat her - I parted them; the prisoner went away - the three children were all on the second bed - (I always knew Crawley's child by the name of Mary Moore;) the prisoner then went and took her own baby off the bed, and put it under the window, about two yards from the bedstead - she then said as she could not have revenge on the b-y women, she would on the children; she took the kettle up, and threw the hot water over them - the lid jumped off, and went under the bedstead; the lid was on it when she took it up, but was afterwards found under the bedstead separate from the kettle - the kettle was full of water, which went over the children; I called Murder! - Miller came up, and took Crawley's child to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Toomey was beating the prisoner's mother when you came? A. Yes; they were all fighting together - she was beating her severely; the mother was a very stout woman, and very much in liquor; Toomey was over her - Crawley and the prisoner fought for about ten minutes; Crawley did not strike at all - it was the prisoner beating her; Crawley did not beat the mother, it was Toomey - the prisoner called Murder! - I suppose, from the noise I heard, they had been fighting for a quarter of an hour - the prisoner was not much beat; the mother hallooed out that her daughter was being killed, and went down to get an officer - her daughter was not being ill-used at that time; they were all fighting together - the bed was about a yard from the fire.</p>
               <p>COURT to CATHERINE CRAWLEY. Q. You said there were a couple of words between the prisoner and Toomey, at the foot of the stairs? A. Yes - they had a few words - I cannot say what it was; I heard them talking: the prisoner's mother caught hold of Toomey directly she came up, and asked what brought her there - Toomey said she was there before her, and would be there after her, in her gossip's place; the prisoner said she was married - Toomey had called her a wh-e; those were the first words - she said that before Toomey had said anything to her.</p>

            . I am a student at the London hospital. On the 26th of August the child was delivered to me, in the presence of Perry; it had been scalded all over its belly, its back, the front and back of its bowels and legs; it had lost a great portion of skin, and appeared very much exhausted, from the shock it had received; it continued under my care till one o'clock the next day, and then expired; I ascribe its death to the scalds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know it had been immersed in cold water? A. Yes; they told me so immediately it was brought - that was calculated to do it good; I had no hopes of it, and told them it would not survive long; by the shock I mean the hot water.</p>

I have no reason to believe that the prisoner and deceased did not live comfortably together - they always cooked their victuals in the room, and kept their coals in a cupboard in the corner of the room; there was some tinder in front of the fire-place; it might have been caused by something being thrown into the fire. I dare say there was a quarter of a pound of grease or gravy in the pan - it had not been overturned, but laid on the floor, a yard and a half from the fire.</p>

            . I am nurse at the hospital. Two females brought the deceased in, she was dreadfully burnt; I saw the prisoner on the following morning about eight o'clock; he came and said he wanted to see the case that was brought in burnt; he asked for Ann Silver, I shewed her to him; he brought nothing with him, nothing passed between them; he wanted to kiss her, but she smothered her head in the clothes, and said she did not want to see the wretch.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she died was she conscious of danger? A. She said four or five times she was well aware she should not recover, and used to ask me every morning what I thought of her wounds; she got more and more certain that she should die: she was strongly under that impression from the time she first came in; and while I was putting oil on her, she said she and her husband had quarrelled, that she was cooking some steaks, and had a lot of waste paper in a box, which she threw on the fire, and while she was doing that her husband struck her a blow; she turned round to strike him again and her petticoat caught fire, and she ran down stairs; that one of the lodgers went up to tell him she was burnt, and he said she might burn.</p>

On a Wednesday in July, about nine o'clock in the morning, I bought some provisions, and was going home with them; and in Whitecross-street I was taken suddenly ill; the prisoner Smith came up and said, "You seem very poorly, you had better go in with me and have a cup of tea as I only live next door;" I was standing against the wall, with my head on my hand; I had taken one glass of gin to make me better, but it did me no good - I went with her all the way down Glos'ter-court and Chequer-alley, into a house, where I found Booth making tea; Smith said go and sit down; she sat between me and the door. Thetford got out of bed, and said, she never laid in bed but when there was nothing to be done, but she saw there was some business to do to-day - she got out of bed; she was not dressed - she snatched my basket out of my hand; I said "Ayn't I to have my basket?" she said "The basket is not your's, 't is mine, and all that is in it;" she told Smith to keep the door shut, and put her foot against it; when she saw what was in the basket, she said "There is not enough here to buy us gin enough;" one of them then took my shawl off, and then I missed Booth out of the room; I begged of them to let me go, and I would not molest them, as they said if I made a noise they would smother me; they said "There was something else they wanted;" I said I had nothing more; they asked me to unpin my gown - I began to be frightened, and said I could not go without my gown - one took me by one arm, and the other by the other, and told me to take it off quietly, or have it done, for it would be best for me, as that was their business, and they would have it, or would smother me; they took it off - I lost my senses; when I came to myself, my boots were taken off; also my bonnet, my handkerchief from my neck, and another from my head; I said "Now you have got all my clothes; if you will let me go, I have only got my stays and petticoat, I will go as I am;" they said "You will go home, but not yet; you shall go home if you are quiet;" I burst out crying, and they told me to go and lay down, and I should be better; I laid down somewhere in a corner - I do not know whether it was on a bed, for I was so ill. and hardly in my senses; when I came to myself, I asked Booth where my clothes were gone; she said as she was going to market, two strange women took them from her; I remained there till five o'clock at night, from nine in the morning, I was so frightened - I had no refreshment; at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110022"/>five o'clock, Booth put me on an old bonnet without a crown, and an old coat to cover my nakedness; she called it her coat, and got a man to help to assist me home to my husband - I was not able to walk, for I had been sadly treated; Booth found the man by the way, and asked him to assist me home, and she went with me to my husband, and told him, "Here is your wife, who I fetched out of the street from a pack of boys who were ill-using her;" my husband laid hold of me; I could neither stand nor speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she had brought you home drunk? A. I do not recollect; she asked for her coat; my husband told her to stop, as he should like to know where she fetched me from; she stopped; he shut the door, and left somebody there while he fetched an officer; Booth was outside the door - she and the officer went together to her place with my husband; I remained at home, and was not out of bed for two days from their ill-treatment - they dragged and pulled me about in a very shameful manner.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On the Monday after this happened, the prosecutrix came to my next door neighbour, who is a grocer - he came to me; I requested the prosecutrix to come into my shop, and she then said she had been robbed by three women, and illused; in consequence of what she said, I told her to go out and I would follow, and told her to look into the person's face well as she went down the street, and stand before any one she could point out, till I came up; she was not out long before she stood before Booth, who was selling fruit in the street, and said that was one of the women - I immediately took her - Thetford was standing by her; I observed her drop her head, and turn round - I took particular notice of her face, and know her again; I saw her in Chequer-alley some days after, and took her; on the way to the watch-house, I said "Where do you lodge?" she said "Where do I lodge;" I asked her twice, and she gave me the same answer, but the third time she told me - I went by her direction, but she never lodged there; I returned to the watch-house, and said "Where did you say you lodged?" she said I was to go to Mrs. Timms, in Ball's-yard, Golden-lane, and she would take me to Mrs. Ellis, where she lodged, as she had said before; I afterwards found she lodged with Booth. When I apprehended her, I sent for the prosecutrix, who said she was the woman who jumped out of bed, and took her basket; I was in pursuit of the other prisoner some time; she was taken on another charge; I looked for her in consequence of the prosecutrix's description of her person: and the prosecutrix saw her locked in the same cell with four other women; she was calling for a light for her pipe when the prosecutrix entered, and said "Oh! that is the woman by her voice;" and when I fetched her out, she said she was the woman; Smith said "Yes, I know you;" I searched the house four or five days after the robbery, but found nothing.</p>

Booth made no reply: Thetford was not taken for two or three days, and then the prosecutrix identified her as having taken her basket, and when Smith was taken she identified her - Smith said, "I know you - I know you;" and began to make some frivolous excuse, which I cannot recollect.

My husband is a jobbing gardener, and lives in White cross-street; I know the prisoners by seeing them sell fruit in the street - I have known one of them ten years by sight, and have seen the other in the street with fruit; I know nothing of Smith: the prosecutrix left the prisoner about eleven o'clock - she had been there from nine in the morning, as the landlady told me; she is not here.</p>

In August, 1827, Hoffman and Co. were brokers of a ship in which we were interested, and were indebted to us 64l. 1s. 11d. on account of one ship, and 166l. 3s. 1d. on account of another - the 64l, 1s 11d. has been brought to account, but the other amount has never been entered in the cash-book, and has never come to our hands.</p>

             re-examined. The prisoner left the prosecutor's service on the 24th or 25th of the eighth month, 1827 - two days after this payment was made; he had a very sudden discharge I believe.</p>
               <p>MR. LILLWALL. The prisoner was dismissed almost immediately after this circumstance; we discovered this about a month after, and employed an officer, but could not find him till now.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This prosecution has come most unexpectedly upon me - those who have preferred it might have made it a subject of enquiry last Session; on my return from America I requested a friend to call on them, and express my contrition for my imprudence - they received him in the kindest manner, spoke in the highest terms of my services, and said if I had not gone astray they intended to place me beyond the situation of a clerk; this friend found no difficulty in bringing them to a compromise - they told him they thought me entitled to reversionary property, and would take that if it could be made over, and would take the amount in easy instalments if my relatives would give security for it; my friend left it to their solicitor to draw up the document to be signed by my mother and myself for 20l. a-year to liquidate the debt; satisfied with this, and relying on their word, which I would have taken as a most solemn oath of any person, I began business on my own account, hoping, by diligent attendance, I should regain the character, to which before I had been always entitled to, as well as prevent my mother being called on for payment of the 20l. yearly; I was suffered to carry on business a very short time - it was daily on the increase, when, through the treachery of some concealed foe, the party who had lent me a small sum to begin with, demanded it and arrested me, and threw me into prison; this did not prevent my exertions - I got out of prison and expected the refusal of two situations, which would enable me to liquidate the prosecutor's demand, and notwithstanding their solemn affirmation, on the 16th I was taken on a charge for felony; convinced of the evil of my follies I had determined to become a steady man: let me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110024"/>leave my fate in your hands, fully confident you will not attribute the prosecution to love of justice, but to some other motive, and under these circumstances will restore me to society; if you think there is not enough to produce an acquittal, you will consider the Act now in force, admitting the affirmation of Quakers, was not in existence at the time the offence was committed, and I submit my case is not within it.</p>
               <p>MR. LILWALL. I was called on by a friend of his about four months ago - I said I regretted the circumstance very much on account of the high opinion entertained of him and his talents, and we had a view of making him a traveller - I gave him no encouragement to set up in business, nor did I know he was in business - his friend did not say where he was to be found; the officer has been in search of him ever since; Mr. Cochrane came and proposed it should bepaid by instalments - I immediately referred him to my solicitor.</p>
               <p>- COCHRANE. I called on the prosecutors on the prisoner's behalf - he declined entering into any arrangement in consequence of the absence of his partner, and made an appointment on the 14th of June, which I attended - Evans' proposition was, if they would allow him to become a useful member of society he would endeavour to pay him 20l. a-year, and would make over some property which he had in reversion, and would submit to any privation if they would allow him to reinstate himself in some employ - I believe I stated that he was in England, but not where; they stated distinctly whatever arrangement might be entered into, should be without prejudice to any proceedings they might adopt, but if he gave security they had respected him, and did not wish to hurt him.</p>

            . I know the prosecutors' warehouse - it is in the parish of St. Mary the Virgin. I have the box - I took it from the prisoner in Little Moorfields, about one hundred and fifty yards from their house; I stopped him with it - he said it was his own; I saw people coming out of the prosecutor's house in search of something, and took him in there - Mr. Gottheimer claimed it, and the property in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the officer took me, I turned round to see the person who employed me to carry it.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL FRANKLAND. He said at first that it was his own, but when he found I was an officer, he said a gentleman gave it to him to carry.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He came across, and asked where I got the box; I immediately replied, "The person employed me to carry it."</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FRANKLAND. I saw another man standing at the corner of Aldermanbury, a few doors from the prosecutor's house - the prisoner was standing still; the man came up to the prisoner, and then he came back: I went into a house almost opposite, and saw that man come out of the prosecutor's house with this box - he met the prisoner, who took it from him and ran off with it directly; when I first saw them they were about twenty yards from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was never near the place it came from, and did not know it was stolen; I left my father's house about ten o'clock in the morning, going towards Bishopsgate-street - in London-wall a young man came up and asked me to carry a box; I said I would - he said he would follow me and pay me for my trouble: I carried it for him a short distance - an officer took me, and asked where I got it; I stated as I have told you.</p>
               <p>JURY to SAMUEL FRANKLAND. Q. Did the prisoner converse with the man before he went into the house? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is he not a carpenter? A. Yes; he was dressed in a flannel jacket: when I took him to the watch-house I went to see if the chisel corresponded with the marks on the door, and did not hear him give his address, nor have I heard him give his address.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You left him conversing in the watch-house? A. Yes. It was a common carpenter's chisel, and corresponed with the marks on the door; I think he had passed the door for a yard or two, when I met him - he did not stop at it; I do not know whether he saw me - there was a gas-light within eight yards of the door, which would enable Moon to see him; I had not seen him there before; the court is about sixty yards long, and has two gas-lights.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The chisel is part of my tools, which I daily use. I met George Brady at twelve o'clock; we spent the day together; I saw him home to Joiner's-row, he being a little drunk, and was coming that way home - as I entered Graystoke-place I saw a lot of watchman surrounding the bars; when I got up one of them said,"Where are you going?" I hesitated, thinking he had no right to ask me - he said a person of my description had attempted to break open those premises; I immediately told him who I was and where I lived, and went to the watch-house without hesitation; I said my name was John Williams, thinking it a very trivial offence; I told them my right direction - he went to try the chisel; I am told one larger or smaller would fit the place. As to my not giving my right direction, it is false - before I was taken to the Compter I said my name was Sackett, when I thought it was likely to be serious.</p>

The boy was brought to me on the 15th of August by the prisoner; he had a violent blow on the right side of the head; it was a lacerated wound - had fractured the bone, and the brains protruded; I merely applied a handkerchief as a bandage to keep it steady - it bled, and I advised his being sent to St. Bartholomew's hospital; the boy was about ten or eleven years old; a pewter pot might have inflicted the wound - anything with a circular edge might have done it; the boy remained in my shop about ten minutes while the prisoner fetched him a jacket - he then took him away on his back to the hospital.</p>

On Friday, the 15th of August, this boy was brought in - I do not know who by; he was about ten years old; I found a large lacerated wound on the right side of the head - his skull was extensively fractured and driven in on the bone; the wound was about three inches long and about three quarters deep; the skull was fractured just above the right ear - part of the brain was exposed, and came through the wound - every thing proper was done to him; I saw him several times every day - he got worse, and died on Friday, the 21st, at the hospital: his head was opened, and the right hemisphere of the brain was in a state of suppuration; he died of inflammation on the brain, arising from the blow he had received; it might have been inflicted by the sharp edge of anything; a pewter pot might have occasioned it.</p>

               <p>Q. They knocked you down? A. No - I fell a very little way; the man ran away with my hat - I followed him, calling out Watch! and did not lose sight of him; the watchman came against him, and knocked him down in the mews; I saw him taken, and am certain of him - I was sober; one of them came behind, and put me on my knee - I did not fall; I only had one blow, and then my hat was taken - they all had black faces.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 10th of August, between one o'clock and a quarter past, I heard Watch! called - I immediately went up, and the prisoner ran down Cumberland-mews, out of the Edgware-road; I followed him down the mews, and laid hold of him about three parts of the way down; I brought him up, and met Sullivan coming down with something, without his hat; he said, "That is the fellow that took my hat" - the prisoner said it was not him; I then took him up the Edgware-road, but could not find the hat where he said he was knocked down, which was about fifty yards off - I went into the mews in about half an hour, and found the hat and handkerchief in it, about twenty yards from where I took him; I had heard something fall when I pursued him down the mews - it was in the direction he had run.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the handkerchief or hat - I was not near the man at the time Watch! was called: I was going towards Pimlico when the watchman stopped me - I said an Irishman was running after me, going to hit me.</p>

On Saturday, the 12th of July, the prisoner came to me, stating that his mother was dying, and he wanted some relief for her: I said I should make inquiry, and he gave me his address, which I found was false: I saw him at twelve o'clock on the 14th of July in the lobby of my house - I was engaged with some gentlemen till about a quarter-past one o'clock, and at twenty minutes past one, I left my watch over the chimney-piece in my study, and went out to meet a gentleman at the Union hotel, Cockspur-street - it was a gold watch; I returned at two o'clock - I met the prisoner before that near the Union hotel, and asked where he was going; he appeared very much frightened when he saw me, and said he had been on a message for his master; but he had no master - I returned home at two o'clock and missed my watch; he had given me his mother's address as No. 24, Drury-lane - I immediately went to Bow-street, accompanied an officer to Drury-lane, but did not find his mother there; she called on me that evening herself - I afterwards went to where she did live; it was some place leading out of Drury-lane, but I am sure it was not where he directed me; I have not found my property - the watch cost me 40l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did he give you the address in writing? A. No; I know I went to the address he gave me, but I now forget the number; I think it was No. 24; I paid attention to the number at the time; his mother heard she was inquired after, and then came to me - No. 24 is on the left hand side: she lives in a place on the right side, and about two hundred yards off.</p>

            . I have been five years in Mr. Roach's service; the prisoner lived there some time; he called on Sunday, the 13th of July - I opened the door to him; he said he wanted to see Miss Roach; I went up and told her- she desired me to send him up; he went up, and I did not see him again that day: next morning, about twelve o'clock, he came to the door, and wanted to see Miss Roach; she told me she would not see him - he was in the passage, and came down stairs; I had not asked him down - he stopped in the kitchen till after one o'clock, when Mr. Roach went out: I was not in the kitchen all the time, but the other servant was; he went away a little after one o'clock: after Mr. Roach went out, I saw him in the kitchen - I was in and out of the kitchen during Mr. Roach's absence, and so was the other servant; he left after one o'clock, and went out alone, as far as I know; I did not see anybody go to let him out. The family consists of my master, his two daughters, the housekeeper, cook, and myself - everybody was at home but Mr. Roach; I saw the watch at twelve o'clock that morning hanging over the mantel-piece in the study - it has usually hung there for several years; he sometimes takes it out with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not invite him down stairs? How long had he lived there? A. I believe nearly a year; I did not ask him down; there was nobody to let him out; it was rather warm weather - the outer door is left open sometimes - I will not swear it was not open that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does the street door stand open in hot weather? A. The street door is never open - I meant the back door; nobody could come in at the back - the kitchen door opens into the area; whether it was open I cannot remember.</p>

             re-examined. I saw the watch about twelve o'clock; Mr. Roach called me about two o'clock, when he missed it; I went into the study, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person come to the house from the time the prisoner left till Mr. Roach came home? A. A person called, whom the cook let in - the prisoner was in the house then - it was about the time that the prisoner came; he went away before one o'clock, but the prisoner was there after; I did not let the person out - it was a man she was buying some cloth of - she was in the kitchen with him, and went out of the kitchen with him to let him out; I did not hear the door opened for him - I know he went out before the prisoner; whether this was before Mr. Roach went out I do not know; I never saw that man before, to my knowledge - he wanted the cook and me to buy some cloth; I went out of the kitchen, but the cook bought some - I think it was between twelve and one o'clock when he left the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know anything of the man? A. No - I have seen him since; he carries cloth about: the prisoner came in while he was there, and went out after him.</p>

            . I am a goldsmith, and live in Drury-lane. I saw the prisoner one Monday in July - I think it was about the end of the month, and about two o'clock in the afternoon I saw him at Seven-dials; I was talking to a young man - he came up, and asked me to go and have something to drink - I went to a public-house- he asked me to go and take a walk with him - I did so; we went to a place, and he sold a watch, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go? A. To Temple-bar, to New Boswell-court; we knocked at the door, and went up stairs - he and the man agreed for the watch; he had told me he was going to sell a watch - he did not shew it to me. Guest lived at the house - I did not see him; I went up stairs afterwards - he went up first: when I got up I saw a tallish young fellow - I did not know his name - I never saw him before: the prisoner was there then, and showed him a watch - I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Be careful what you say - you have been examined before; what day in July did the prisoner come to you in Seven-dials? A. On a Monday - it was in Little St. Andrew-street, at the end of it - I cannot tell the date; he asked me to come and have something to drink - we went to a public-house at the corner of St. Andrew-street; there was a young man with him - nothing was said about a pair of shoes; the prisoner went and bought a pair after we went to Boswell-court - he did not ask me to go with him to buy them, before we went to Boswell-court, or say anything about them - he said he had a watch to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. I am going to ask you a question, and advise you to be careful how you answer - did he shew you the watch? A. No - he did not shew it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not show it to you before he went to Boswell-court? A. No; he showed it to me when he got up the court, but not in Seven-dials - we went into the house; I cannot tell the young man's name- Grant is the man who lives there, but he was not in the house - I know him by sight now, but not before this - it was not Grant who I saw in the house; the prisoner sold the watch to the man who was there - I saw the watch afterwards; I think he sold it for 8l., but am not sure; I did not see the man pay - I was not in the room when it was paid; I saw some money on the table; I cannot say how much - the room is on the first floor; I cannot tell whether the shutters were closed - I got there at half-past two or three o'clock; it was a yellow watch, and had two seals - I believe one was plain - the other was a rough looking one; the chain was yellow - I think the watch was a thin one; it had a plain white face - I did not stay there above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You at first said you did not see the watch? A. Yes; I saw it, but cannot tell what size it was - he showed it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any reason for swearing that he did not show it you? A. I cannot; I saw some money on the table - I did not count it, nor see anybody take it up.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to guess the price at 8l.? A I do not know, I am sure - the money was gold; I saw more than four sovereigns. I get my living by hard work now, not at the tread-wheel - I was once a prisoner in this Court - I do not know what it was for; I cannot remember - I think it was for a coat; I was not convicted. I have been tried at Clerkenwell. for an assault, nothing else; I have been before a Magistrate once - I will not swear it was not five times; I think about four times - I was only committed once.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went to the public-house to seek this man? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that when he has drunk a little he is almost in a state of insanity? A. No, I do not - I do not know where he lived - his shop is in Walker's-court - I had been told by several people that morning that he had been looking for me with a knife to kill me, and not being able to find a constable to go with me, for they were afraid -</p>
               <p>Q. What constable did you go to who refused to give you assistance? A. Webb for one; he belongs to the parish - I went in search of a Police officer, and could not find one - I have been in London four or five months - I lived at Chelsea before that; I knew the police office, and applied at Marlborough-street that day, but was refused a warrant; I applied to Bishop, the clerk, who refused it, and not being satisfied, I applied to Mr. Roe, the magistrate; he said, if I brought any person forward who would swear they heard him he say he would kill me, he would grant the warrant, and I went for a street-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, never mind that - was not this man drunk? A. I cannot swear he was drunk - he spoke to me sensibly enough, as I thought; he might have been drinking - but to say he was drunk, I could not; I only asked him the question, and as soon as he gave me the answer I came out - there were some people round him in the public-house; they appeared to be tussling, or holding him, or something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. He was behind you when he struck you - if he intended to put an end to you, was there anything to prevent his running the knife through your back? A. That I cannot say - he might have stabbed me in the back if he had chosen; I cannot say where he thought it best to stick me; I am informed if he had made the blow a quarter of an inch further back, I should have died in two minutes - I cannot swear that he was drunk, nor that he was sober; I was not in the public-house above two or three minutes - when he told me his determination, I left; he spoke seriously and determined - he did not stutter as a drunken man would: the landlord was there, and could see what state he was in.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If he was drunk, had you any hand in making him so? A. No; I merely went and asked him a question, with a witness, that if necessary I might make an affidavit before a Justice - I did not say a word to him more than I have mentioned, nor do anything to him - nor did I ever in my life abuse or threaten him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see any knife in his hand in the public-house? A. No, my Lord; he stood at a table in front of the bar - just as I went in, I saw people about him, and I thought they were pulling him; I had not then spoken to him - I do not know whether he had dined; I did not see any liquor before him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When you left the public-house, where did he go? A. I suppose he left the house after me - I did not see him come out, but he came to me in three minutes - I went as far as Walker's-court; that was my way home; I leaned my elbow on the post, considering what I had best do - the court was not in my way to Marlborough-street; it is in the way to his shop, and very near it - I generally go home that way.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of St. James. I was in company with the prosecutor when he went to the Black Lion public-house; I saw the prisoner there - he was called out of the room; the prosecutor asked if he was there, and somebody else called him out of the tap-room; he came and stood against the bar - the prosecutor asked if he had been seeking for him, as he had been told so, and asked what he wanted with him; I did not distinctly hear what answer Higgins made, as a person happened to speak to me - the first I heard him say was,"I will kill him if I can;" I then came away with the prosecutor - he did not use any words to him at all, except asking him if he was seeking for him, and spoke quite civil to him; he did not touch him - there were two or three more men between them; I saw nothing in the prisoner's hand; we walked along to Walker's-court, and stood there about two minutes, between thirty and forty yards from the public-house - the prisoner's shop is about two doors from where we stood; his shed was shut up, and the shutters put too - it was on a Fri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110032"/>day; I happened to turn my face that way, and saw Higgins two or three steps from the prosecutor - I saw the knife glitter in his hand, as if it was fresh ground; I turned and said, "Oh, Lord! he is coming with a knife"- the sun shone bright on the knife; he came up, made a stroke at the prosecutor, and cut him on the cheek; the prosecutor stood with his back towards him - he came up behind him, rather on the right-hand side, and made a blow at him with the knife - it struck him on the cheek; he made a hit as if he chopped, not a thrust - I immediately seized the arm that held the knife, and got it down, so that he could not raise it up to make a second blow; one of my hands held his wrist, and the other the small of his arm - the prosecutor got hold of him about the same time; nobody assisted us; we struggled together till we got his back against the sheep's head shop, and then I found my coat confined by the blade of the knife; I disengaged it, then caught hold of the small of his arm again, and called out, "Take the knife from his hand"- somebody came up and took it from him; he called out, "Higgins, loose the knife - he loosened it," and the person took it; Lindley, the constable, came up, and just then the prisoner said, "Ah! the b-gg-r, I have done him" - that was just as he loosened the knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he in a great passion when you first went to the public-house? A. He did not seem in a passion when he came out - he seemed rather exasperated when he said he would kill the prosecutor; he seemed angry when he spoke the last words in the public-house - we instantly left the house, and I saw him in the street in about two minutes; I saw him again between thirty and forty yards from the house, two or three doors from his shed - we might have gone along any other street; his shed was shut up, and his neighbours said it had been shut all that morning, and he had been going about for the inspector, to kill him; I do not think he was drunk at the public-house, nor did I think him sober - I think he was rather mothered in drink, like a person that had been intoxicated, half sober and half drunk; he was called out of the tap-room to the bar - I did not see anybody tussling with him, but I was further back than the prosecutor - I stood behind him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether he was angry or exasperated, had the prosecutor done anything to make him so? A. Not that day - I had not the least idea of his intending to follow us; he struggled with me after I got hold of his arm - we all struggled together.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. James'. I was called in the street, and saw the prosecutor pass my shop; I immediately went to the corner of Walker's-court, and saw the prisoner standing with his back to the sheep's-head shop; I said, "Higgins, you have done the business" - he immediately said he was sorry he had not killed the b-gg-r, and would go with me wherever I pleased; I had not said he was my prisoner, or anything - he knew I was a constable; he went very quietly up Berwick-street to the office, and said nothing more to me about it; he seemed much agitated at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you mean that he was violent and outrageous in his manner at times as he went along? A. Yes - I certainly considered that he had drunk considerably, or else he never could have used much expressions; I think he had been drinking - I do not mean to say he was drunk exactly, but much flurried and agitated - I have known him twenty years; he has a wife and one daughter, who is married.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe when he drinks he gets very violent and outrageous? A. Yes, he does; I have seen him very outrageous, and supposed him drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. When he has drunk for two or three days together, has he not been violently agitated, and almost mad? A. Yes, he certainly is; when he is not excited by drink he is quiet - he certainly had the appearance of being much excited by liquor; I have not the least doubt of it myself - I can see it in no other light; I form that opinion from his manner and conduct, and through no other means.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I beg you to forget your twenty years acquaintance, and mind what you are saying - you say you thought him drunk, or he would not have used such expressions, what expressions were they? A. He said several times going up to the office, "I am sorry I have not killed the b-gg-r; he said so two or three times - it was that that made me think him drunk; he had no coat nor hat on; he did not stagger particularly in going to the office, but went in and out like a man that was agitated - I should think the drink might have occasioned the passion, because I heard he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in a quarrel when he was drunk before? A. No, not particularly.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you drinking with the prisoner the day before this happened? A. Yes, and the same day; he called the day before for five half-pints of gin in half an hour, and I suppose drank a glass out of each half-pint; then he went into Reuben Martin's public-house, and called for two pints of gin - I was with him; he was drunk before he went there - I was in his company on the 1st of August, at the White Bear public-house, about eight or nine or ten o'clock in the morning; he had a quartern of gin, and two or three people pulled him away, saying, he had had enough - this was before ten o'clock; some person brought him away from there; he appeared drunk then - I afterwards saw the prosecutor go down the street, and go into the Black Lion, which Mr. Sweetman keeps.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then at twelve o'clock he was as drunk as he well could be? A.

            . I am a surgeon. I attended the prosecutor - I found a transverse wound on his cheek, about three inches long, near the chin; it was within an inch of a very dangerous part; it is calculated to disfigure him, but not to do him any great bodily injury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That dangerous part is well known to anatomists, but not to a vulgar man? A. Just so; he might not know he was going near so vital a part.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far was it from the throat? A. An inch from the mortal part; the throat is known to common people to be a mortal part; but that particular part, the carrotid artery, is not known to them; the wound is above the throat - it was a transverse cut across the chin, within an inch of the carrotid artery; the best part of it was within half an inch of the back of the neck, but three or four inches above the throat.</p>

            . I keep the Black Lion. The prisoner was at my house on the 1st of August, shortly before two o'clock, in a very high state of inebriation - I have known him twenty years; in his sober moments he is as humane and kind as any man - when excited by liquor, he is literally insane.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was he before this occurrence took place? A. As much like a madman as ever I saw, and he was so all the week - I refused to serve him with drink immediately before this.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see him come into your house that day? A. Yes; he was in and out three or four times; he was there about eleven o'clock in the morning - in short, he was from my house to the other opposite all the morning - I cannot say how much he drank in my house - a good many people gave him drink, but I would not serve him - I did not serve him after I found he was intoxicated - he was not drunk at eleven o'clock, not that I could discern, but he was bordering on drunkenness; I only saw him at eleven and two o'clock myself, but am informed he was there three or four times - he was as drunk as he could be between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he walk? A. He has a very strong constitution, and can keep on his legs very well, but his mind is quite different - I saw him go out of my house at two o'clock - he had no coat or hat on; he had no knife in his hand, I am perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he express any intention what he would do, or what he was going to do? A. I did not hear anything of the kind - he sleeps in Walker's-court; two men went out of the door with him - I do not know whether they had given him drink; I do not think they followed him - I requested them to take care of him, and they saw him to the door, and stood talking at the door with him a minute or two; I saw nothing further of him.</p>

On the morning of the 7th of August, the prisoner came to my room, as usual, for the keys of the warehouse - I sleep there; I gave them to him - he went to open the warehouse, and about a quarter or twenty minutes after seven o'clock he came into my room, and wished me to step down, as the officers had stopped him as he was going to sell some old wrappers and cords; I went down: the officers asked if I allowed him to take them; I said No, I knew nothing of it - they produced a bundle of wrappers, which are worth at least, 2l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he was going to sell them? A. Yes, after he was stopped; we use them to pack bales; goods do not come to us in them - they are outside and inside wrappers: we generally return them, or they are charged to us.</p>

About two weeks previous to this he asked me what was to be done with the rubbish of the warehouse, when it required to be swept away; I said, "Have it examined by the warehouseman; and what we cannot use in packing or otherwise, you may have;" he has been three or four months with us.</p>

It is such a dangerous place, it is not safe to say anything - I was never charged with anything; I once took a bit of becon out of a neighbour's house out of a lark; they never threatened to prosecute me; the house was open between nine and ten o'clock at night - I said, "I will just play you a bit of a lark," and took it; they came before I was up in the morning, and asked if I had taken it - I said I had; it belonged to one Weller who worked with my husband; I took it to cantion him - it was in the kitchen, as soon as you open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason you did not go before a Magistrate? A. I was afraid of saying anything, but I am obliged to come forward now, because I mentioned it; I did not know they were robbed when he came out; it is not a high window - it is on the first floor; I was within about a dozen yards of the door; I knew he did not belong to the house; I did not like to give information, as there are so many men in the place who would not mind killing anybody - there is a bad set in the town.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did the prisoner do when he came out of the window? A. He ran as hard as he could up the lane; I did not know what he had been about; he lives in the town somewhere - no constable came to me about the bacon.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were the four? A. There was Allen, Rose, Neal and Child; they played for steaks, and after that game was over, we all had a civil game to ourselves - Bamford played, and the other witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they there the whole time the play was going on? A. Yes, all but Neal; he went after the steaks, when they were lost: they began playing for steaks about eight o'clock - Neal went after them, and was not gone more than a quarter of an hour - there is a passage to the house; a person can go up stairs without coming into the parlour, I suppose - Baylis and Fisher were there, and could see the game of cards - the house was full of people.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you recollect the night the robbery happened? A. Yes; I am sure it was on that night - I heard of the robbery next night.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you mean to say you are porter to the Duke? A. No; I have not been there above six weeks - they are building a new observatory; I am employed there by the week.</p>

            . I live at Isleworth, and work at what I can get to do. I was at the Coach and Horses, on the Monday night, the 28th of July; I went there about half-past six o'clock, and remained till five minutes to eight, then left the house, and met Bamford, Thomas and Fisher about one hundred yards from Mr. Gardener's house; I went back to the Coach and Horses, and it was about ten minutes past eight - they were going up the lane to the house; there was a beef-steak party, and I was going for the steaks when I met them - I returned in a quarter of an hour and found them there - they remained there till between twelve and one o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did you go for the steaks? A. About five minutes before eight o'clock; I was one of the party that played - I think we began to play about seven o'clock: Rose, Allen, Giles and I played - Hamford, Tayler and the others were not in the house then; we played at Put for nearly an hour - there was nobody but us four in the room when we played for the steaks; I am sure of that: when I returned with the steaks, we eat them as soon as they were cooked: there were several persons in the room when I returned, all at cards, nearly: there were two tables and they played at each - they played while we eat the steaks.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Other persons might come in and join the three persons you left behind, while you were gone for the steaks? A. Yes.</p>

             re-examined. After my work was done that night I went into the room about nine o'clock, and had a pint of beer; seeing a great many people in the parlour, I went round the place - Neal and others were there at Put; I saw him go for the steaks - he says it was a few minutes after eight o'clock, it was after nine; he says there were but four in the room - there were seven if not eight, when he went for the steaks.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you in the room when he went for them? A. Yes - it was dark: I came out at the same time - I got to the bar door and met Mrs. Sharp; I did not look at a clock to see the time - it was after nine o'clock, for my people do not leave work till half-past eight, and I walked about my grounds till nine o'clock; my grounds look into this room - I was not in the public-house at eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>MRS. SHARP re-examined. Q. Was the shutter of your bed-room closed, when you went to bed? A. Our bed-room window was fastened down in the evening, about seven or eight o'clock, but when I went to bed, the window of the room he got in at, was up - that was not our bed-room, but one on the same floor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your money was in the bed-room? A. Yes - the window over the tap-room we found open in the morning; there is only a passage between that and our bed-room - I had fastened that window about eight or nine o'clock the night before; both rooms are in front of the house, and are bed-rooms.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you not mistaken in it being the 30th of July? A. No; it was Wednesday morning, the 30th of July; I saw Howard Lewis at Lambeth-street office at the second examination, but had no conversation with him - I have not published any bill, describing the watches; I never described them to Lewis - he was at the office when I gave the particulars; we have an entry of every watch in our books, of the maker's name and number, the day we take them in, and the price lent on them, but not the description - all the rest is from my memory; I examined them several times - we can always tell the description by taking off the cap; I mentioned these particulars in the presence of Lewis at the last examination but one - Mr. Avila was at the last examination, but gave no account of the matter.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw him at the office with the jacket and waistcoat on, and from that you think him the man? A. No, from his stature and appearance.</p>

I did, about ten minutes past seven o'clock; he had a blue jacket, dark trousers and boots, and I knew his face well; I saw him standing looking in at the centre of Mr. Avila's window; the time Cunningham mentioned brought the circumstance to my attention; I turned round to my brother, who was in the shop, and remarked to him what I had seen; Lockyer called on me that morning, and I reported it to him, what I had seen; he gave me a description of the dress - it corresponded precisely with the dress of the prisoner that morning; I am positive the prisoner is the man I saw - I afterwards saw Norris, the officer, and described the same thing to him. I saw the prisoner again in the evening; he was not then dressed as in the morning - I observed that to the officer directly he came; I have known him for several years - it was between seven and eight o'clock when I saw him; he was in company with a young woman; I sent for Norris immediately; he passed our shop, in a direction towards King Edward-street- Norris came to me immediately; I accompanied him to the Halifax Arms, public-house, in King Edward-street, found the prisoner there, and Norris took him.</p>

Lewis, No. 4, Cable-street;" it is now exactly in the same state as when I found it on him - I told him I took him on a charge of felony, and at the watch-house asked him about the note; he told me it was paid to him by the captain of a vessel who he had been out to sea with; in the month of June, 1827, when he came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he had received it in 1827, or that he had been to sea in 1827? A. He said he had been home about thirteen months, and at the time he came home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110039"/>he received the note; I looked at the note, and found it dated the 31st of January, 1828; he denied all knowledge of the robbery; I asked how he became possessed of the money - he said he saved it up to buy a hawker's licence. In consequence of information I went on the 4th of August to the premises of Levy, who then lived in Ship-alley; I knew he had before that lived at the corner of Pell-street; I only knew one Levy in Pell-street - I went to his house, to search for the watches; I did not find them - he was not at home; he came to me next morning at the office, and I showed him the note; I went on Wednesday, the 6th, to Lewis' house, in Cable-street - he was not at home, but came to the office to me, in consequence of my leaving a message for him; I told him my business, and he gave me a description of some property, which corresponded exactly with the description Lockyer had given me - I showed Lewis the note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you sure what he said applied to that identical note, or that he had received a 5l. note? A. My question was "Where did you get this 5l. note?" I took the note out of his pocket at the time. I have known Lewis about two years; as long as I have been in office; I do not know his writing - the note was not out of my sight when I showed it to him; he did not write on it in my presence.</p>

            . I am a clothes salesman, and live at No. 4, Cable-street, Wellclose-square. The prisoner came to my shop on the 30th of July, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and said he wanted to purchase some clothes, that he was going to sea; he selected clothes which came to 4l. 15s.; he pulled a gold watch out of his fob, and said he wanted 10l. for it, and if I would take that he would pay me for the clothes; I examined it - it was a double bottomed one, jewelled with rubies, half capped, stops and seconds - that is all I observed about it- I did not notice the maker's name, or number; I told him I did not exactly know the value, but would step to a neighbour, who was a watch-maker, and if it was worth the money I would do it, if he would wait the while: I went to Levy, and ascertained the value from him - he gave me 11l. for it; I left it with him - I returned, and told the prisoner I had got 10l.; I sold it to Levy, and told him a person was waiting at my house to sell it; he gave me two 5l. notes and a sovereign; I requested Levy to indorse the notes - he did so, in my presence; (looking at the 5l. note produced) this is one of them; he wrote his name in Hebrew - I know this to be one of the notes, for when I returned, at the prisoner's request, I indorsed the note with my own name; I know it to be the note I received from Levy, by the name on it in Hebrew, and I wrote my name and address on it; on my return home I presented one of the notes to the prisoner, and the other I was about to take the amount of clothing out of, when he said if I would give him the two notes he would pay me for the clothing; he did not do so, but produced another watch from his waistcoat pocket, and proposed that I should take that for the clothes; my suspicions were then rather raised - I opened the watch, and found it was a single case, gold dial plate, and doomed gold watch - I gave it back to him, and told him I would rather not do that: I had given him the two 5l. notes, and endorsed them with my name, at his request; I put the second watch into his hand - he said, in rather a hurry, "I will call again presently, and pay for the clothes," and went off in haste, leaving the clothes on the counter; he went off very quickly, and I heard no more of him till the officer called, and desired me to attend at Lambeth-street, where I saw him - that was a week after; Norris had called when I was out, and left word for me to come.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is your house from where you called on Levy? A. On the other side of the square - he then lived in Ship-alley; he lived there about three weeks - it is not above a minute's walk from Pell-street, about the length of this Court; the prisoner was an entire stranger to me - I never went by the name of Levy; I am a Christian, and of course should not take a Jew's name - I do not often deal in watches; the mates of ships are in the habit of exchanging watches for clothes when they are going to sea - silver watches, and so forth; it is seldom we have gold watches, we buy watches of them, and dispose of them to the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always take 1l. out of 11l. for selling them? A. I was not going to give him 11l. when he only asked 10l.; I took 1l. myself - I consider that just.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that justice ever bring you here before? A. I have been here several times; and I was tried here ten or eleven years ago for a thief, but not being a thief, I was honourably acquitted - that is the only time I was tried here; I was tried at Hicks's Hall, for a misdemeanor - I had sold some palms to somebody, who hung them at his door, and they were owned; I was tried for receiving them, but acquitted; it was six or seven years ago - nothing else of that sort has ever happened to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this Hebrew all that Levy wrote? A. Yes, there is A. Levy, Pell-street, on it - he told the magistrate that he wrote it; I cannot recollect whether that was on it when he paid it to me. [Here the witness, by desire of the Learned Counsel, wrote his name on a slip of paper.]</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you give information about this? A. When Norris called, and asked me questions - I did not then know the prisoner's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take Norris to Levy? A. No, I did not see him myself - I have not seen the note; the prisoner got no clothes from me - I did not hear of the robbery till Norris left a message for me to come to the office.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you notice the prisoner's dress? A. He had a short blue jacket, speckled trousers, and a light waistcoat - he appeared to me to be a sort of inferior officer in the East India service.</p>
               <p>JOHN NORRIS re-examined. When I took the prisoner, he wore a black waistcoat, with silver buttons, and a blue jacket; I went to search his lodging, and found the clothes, which had been described to me - that was the same night on which I took him, the 30th of July; I found a waistcoat, trousers, and an old pair of boots - he had the blue jacket on when I took him, and at the next examination he had the trousers and waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL AVILA. My premises are in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney. On Wednesday, the 30th of July, I was from town; I returned next day - I have no partner.</p>

            . I lived in Pell-street, and afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110040"/>in Ship-alley - I live there now; I went to live there between six and seven weeks ago - I know Howard Lewis - he stands there.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray at any time in July, or thereabouts, had you any dealing with Howard Lewis? A. No, I never had dealings with him, he bears such a character; I never bought a gold watch of him for 11l.; I was asked that question before the Magistrate privately, and gave him the same account (looking at the note); this Hebrew is in my writing; the translation of it is "Abraham, the son of Joseph Levy;" and the English, "A. Levy, Pell-street," is my writing - I did not write that at the request of Lewis- I never had any dealings with him; I am a seller and dealer in jewellery and cutlery; I can repair a watch - I cause watches to be made; they are not made in my shop - there are seventeen different people employed to make a watch; I receive the parts from different people, and put them together.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you one of the seventeen who get your living by watches? A. I can take one to pieces; the Hebrew characters on the note are my writing - that note has been in my possession; I swear I did not give it to Lewis, for I never had dealings with him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Does the Hebrew writing give you any information of the time the note left you? A. No; I cannot tell when I paid it away, but it must have gone out of my possession when I lived in Pell-street, as I always indorse them when I pay them away; I have not written Pell-street on a note since I have lived in Ship-alley; I turn in my business 150l. a month, or 200l.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you sure that you never, through the medium of any person, had dealings with Howard Lewis? A. I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you ever in trouble yourself? A. No; my character stands unimpeached.</p>
               <p>JURY to HOWARD LEWIS. Q. Do you know the person of Abraham Levy? A. Yes, perfectly well, for years; he is the person I sold the watch to; he contradicts me, but I gave sufficient proof to the Magistrate of my being correct - he said to me, "Come this way, Mr. Lewis, and I will pay you;" I thought he meant me to follow him - I followed him up stairs; he opened his bed-room door; he then saw me, and said, "I do not mean you to come here, I will come down to the shop to you;" I stated to the Magistrate that I saw in the bed-room what appeared a four-post bedstead, with new carved pillars; the officer was sent to see if it was correct.</p>
               <p>JOHN NORRIS. I know an officer was sent there; he came back, and stated in the prisoner's presence, that LEWIS'S description was quite correct.</p>
               <p>HOWARD LEWIS re-examined. I said I supposed it was a four-post bedstead, as I saw the posts at the feet, but could not see the head; when the officer returned, he said there were posts at the feet, but it had been turned into a tent bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. When the man refused the clothes, did you not feel disappointed? A. Rather so - he made off very quick, or I should certainly have gone after him; but I had nobody in my shop - I thought, by his producing a second watch, that he had not come honestly by it; I did not go to the office till Norris called, as I knew nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am the wife of George Garrett. The prisoner and prosecutor lodged in our house in Compton-street: I was in bed when the prosecutor went out, and did not hear him go - but the prisoner awoke me as he went out by slamming the door - I sleep down stairs; both Taylor and the prisoner used to leave their keys behind the door for me; I got up at seven o'clock, went up at half-past seven, looked behind the door, and Taylor's key was gone; I immediately went up, and found the door open, and the key in the lock - I missed his box the moment I entered the room - the prisoner was gone then; I do not exactly know at what time he went, but he awoke me with shutting the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was him? A. The prosecutor goes out at six o'clock, and it was after six - I did not see him: he had lodged with me for ten months; and the prosecutor a year and a half. When I missed the box, I was alarmed, and called Stillwell, a lodger; I did not go up to the prisoner's room till the prosecutor came - I then found the box close to the prisoner's door, which was locked, and the key behind the street door - I opened it, and found a chisel in the room, which the officer tried on the 12th, when the prisoner was brought home; I did not know of his going away; he owed me 5s. for a fortnight's lodging.</p>

            . I am a porter and am Barrett's brother-in-law. I have seen the prisoner several times at his house; I met him on the 12th of August, in Somerset-street, Whitechapel; I asked why he left his lodging - he said he had no money to pay for them; and had brought his things away, or they would be stopped for the rent: I said I wished him to come back with me, as there was a disturbance at the house, and he came back; I did not say what it was about - we sent for an officer, and gave him in charge; he went readily with me; I had not told him there was a charge against him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say, Taylor wanted me, because he had lost a box from his room? A. I did not- I said nothing about taking him for felony.</p>
               <p>MRS. GARRETT. A young man lodges in my cellar, with his mother and supports her - they have been there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110042"/>six years; I know he was in bed and asleep at the time - I sleep one room above them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left my lodgings because I was getting short of money; I had left once before, and when I turned myself round, I came back and paid them - she had told me if I took them out any more, she would swear a robbery against me; I paid her 5s. to redeem them: they swore at Hatton-garden that the box was found in my room, then said it was on the landing-place, and when they found they were swearing false, they brought the chisel and said they found that in my room - one said the door was locked, and the other that it was not; if it was locked, the same key that locks a door, will unlock it again. There is a suspicious character lives in the cellar - she swore at Hatton-garden she had no lodgers but those up stairs: this man goes out every night, and comes home at all hours, and brings others with him - they are concealed there till night approaches, and then go out on their prey.</p>

On the 29th of July I went to bed at half-past ten o'clock at night: every thing was then safe - I got up a little before six o'clock in the morning, came down, and found the door at the bottom of the stairs fastened - we never fasten it; I then went up stairs to the back bed-room, looked out of window, and saw my kitchen windowshutters broken open, and the window open - the shutters had been forced by a crow-bar, about an inch in width apparently; the impression was about an inch long - I examined my house, and missed all the property stated in the indictment (enumerating it), the value of which was about 18l. or 19l.; I have since seen the tea-caddy and handkerchief. In consequence of information, on the night of the 1st of August I watched with the constable, and two witnesses, at a hay-rick in Mr. Boswell's field, at Brentford, and about ten o'clock saw two persons come towards the rick: we had been watching about a quarter of an hour - I believe the prisoners to be the two persons; I am certain of Farrow - I heard one say to the other."That gate is open;" they then said one to the other, "There is that box, you know;" they got over the rails, and into the rick-yard - Farrow went to the hole in the rick where the caddy was - he took it out, put it in again, and said, "Nobody has been here;" it was a light night - I am certain of Farrow; I knew him before; he left the caddy there, and then they went to where the phosphorus-box and centre-bit were; and when Farrow put his hand into the hole, he said, "D-n my eyes;" he took out his centrebit and phosphorus-box - they then went round to the back part of the rick; then came by, and passed me, got over the rails, and ran up the field as hard as they could - we all three pursued them; I do not know that they had seen either of us - and as I ran up the garden, I fell; and when I got to the garden-gate I found it shut - I saw no more of them that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You talk of the place where the caddy and phosphorus box were - had you been there before, and seen them? A. Yes, about a quarter of an hour before; and in consequence of finding them there, we were watching - I had not told other people that they were there; Dickinson and Theak, who were watching, had told me of it; I went to watch with them, and the prisoners were the first persons who came - I was stationed at the near side of the rick - it is a common hay-stack, with four sides to it; Theak and I were on one side, and Dickinson was more in front, so as to see the end, and the side where I stood - the caddy was at one side and the phosphorus-box and centre-bit, at the end - I could see the side and the end where I stood; I have known Farrow two or three years; it was a light night; I speak to their persons, not their voices - they did not see us they came towards us - I saw Farrow's face full, but not Craw's - I saw Farrow twice; he came twice to the side of the rick I was on; he came first for the caddy, then went round for his companion; both got over the fence, close by me, and ran up the field - I cannot say whether they saw me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What means have you of knowing Craw? A. I am not positive of him.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Mayo, a butcher. On the 1st of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I found a tea-caddy, phosphorous-box, centre-bit, and pocket handkerchief in the hay-rick, and took them to my master, and by his direction I brought them back to the rick, and placed them where I had found them; about nine o'clock one of our men went with me; he is not here - I joined the prosecutor and Dickinson to watch, two men came to the rick - I cannot swear to them; one of them took the tea-caddy out, and put it back again - the other one was a goodish bit from him at that time - I saw nothing more done to the rick.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you looked at them as hard as you could? A. Yes, as far as I could see them.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the night in question, I was watching with the prosecutor and Theak - I saw both the prisoners come to the rick; Farrow I can swear to, the other I cannot positively swear to: they came up about a quarter-past ten - the first word I heard Farrow say was, "There is the box, you know;" they came up to the rick, and one of them said, "This gate is open;" I had left it open myself on purpose - one of them then said "Let us go through this gate;" the other then said "No, we will get over this corner." I saw them go to three separate places in the rick, and put their hands in, but whether they took anything out, I cannot say - Farrow went to where the caddy was; they then went to where the phosphorus-box and centre-bit were, which was about the middle of the rick, at the back - one of them (I believe it was Farrow,) said "D-n my eye;" they went to the further corner, where the handkerchief was, and put their hands to the rick again - they made no remark there; they came back again to the phosphorus box and took that away - I saw them do that; they went out by the corner, where Attfield, and the boy(Theak) were; they walked down the field - I pursued them down the garden; I went rather fast after them, as Attfield did not pursue them; I followed them through the garden, till I came within ten yards of Mr. Boswell's garden gate - I there heard the gate go too; I heard them come out of the field gate, and stopped till they came by the gates - they walked; I went and looked in the direction they were going; they were still walking; one of them said to the other "Let us go and have a drop of beer here;" the other said "No, it is very bad;" I went in front of them, pulled out my staff, collared Farrow with one hand, and the other with the other - I holloed for assistance; I am certain I collared the two men who came from the rick, and have every reason to believe Craw was the other - I only lost sight of him in going down the field; I had lost sight of them at the first oaset - they had gone about five hundred yards before I collared them; Farrow, finding nobody come to my assistance, said "I won't be handled;" he directly caught hold of my staff with both hands, and tried to wrench it out of my hand - I was obliged to let go of the other to hit him, and both escaped for that night; I did not see either of them again till the 5th of August, when I saw Farrow at Brentford; I have every reason to believe he saw me; I was about a hundred and fifty yards from him- he was with two girls; the moment he saw me, he ran up Drum-lane - I followed him through the Lion yard, and as soon as he saw me he ran away; I pursued, and never lost of him for a quarter of a mile, then he turned down an alley; I pursued him - he went across the canal though the water, swimming part of the way - I went over the height, and was searching for him for a quarter of an hour, and then found him in custody; he was very wet all over - I am sure he is the man I had seen at the rick; I have known him from a boy, and am certain of him. I apprehended Craw last night at Hounslow, at the Cricketers public-house, about a quarter-past eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say the persons went to three distinct places on the rick? A. Yes. First to where the caddy was, then to the phosphorus-box, and then to the handkerchief; one of the witnesses could not see the last place; I am certain they walked away - they did not run till after I collared them; I never saw them run till after they got from me; I collared them in the road - I never said they went through a wood - they were in a field and I in a garden; I lost sight of them then.</p>
               <p>Q. And coming into the road, you found two men walking deliberately? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES ATTFIELD. This tea-caddy and handkerchief are mine, and part of the things taken that night; I saw the caddy in the house the same night; I am confident it was on the table in the parlour, as I passed through to go to bed; I do not know when I saw the handkerchief - it might be a few days before - the door opening from the kitchen to the parlour, was found open - whether it was shut the night before I do not know; I am certain I fastened the house up myself before I went to bed; I found the kitchen door put against the stair foot door to prevent my coming down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You lost a good deal of property? A. Yes. I have found nothing else; the robbery was committed on Tuesday, the 29th, or Wednesday morning, the 30th - the things were found in the rick, on the 1st of August; Farrow lives with his father at Brentford; his premises have been searched, but nothing of mine found: I am a stage-coach driver.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH DICKINSON. I searched Farrow's premises on the 5th August, when I apprehended him.</p>
               <p>FARROW'S Defence. I never went near any bay-rick; I went by a path, by a bay-rick; I was going to Ealing to see a young man, about buying some eels; I did not see him - as I came back I met a young man, a stranger to me; we walked together and came by the rick, but I did not see any rick; when I came to the White Hart public-house, Dickinson stopped me - I asked what he wanted, he would not tell me, and I walked away from him.</p>
               <p>CRAW'S Defence. I slept at Hounslow that night; they have made a mistake.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was turning up Botolph-lane, and halfway up the lane heard a cry of Stop thief! two persons turned the corner - an Irishman caught hold of me, tripped me up, and said, "What is the matter with you?" I said Nothing; and this gentleman was not round the corner for two minutes; he said the next day that he did not actually see me drop it, and Maloney said he could not say I was the man, but he stopped some man; I was put back, and this witness took him to have refreshment, and said, "Why don't you swear to him, and crush him, as I have done" - Maloney came and told me this; I asked him to state it to the Alderman - he said he would, but the officer had been to extort money.</p>
               <p>Witness. I did say not so; Maloney said he could not swear to him - I said, "How is it that you can't swear to him when I took him from you?" I saw nobody running before the prisoner - he was the person pursued; I saw him not two minutes after the alarm.</p>

            , I am an assistant elder. I received information from Phipps, and took the prisoner into the counting-house; I said if he had anything he had better acknowledge it - he said he had tea about him, and began taking it out of his left-hand pocket - he took out about 10 1/2 ozs; it was in a breeches pocket, about eighteen inches long - we took him to the Compter, and he cut the pocket off while he was there; I have no doubt of the tea being the same as that in the chest - there was a small quantity of green first, and then black; a chest of green on the floor he worked, on seemed as if a hand had been dipped into it - he has been fourteen months in the service, and had 21s. 6d. a week, working from seven till three o'clock.</p>

               <p>MRS. POTTS. Here are four stockings, a handkerchief, and this piece of ribbon, which I know to be mine - the sovereigns were in the same drawer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When the sovereigns were lost, did you not tell her about them? A. Yes, I had so much confidence in her; she did offer me her keys to search her box; she said it was unpleasant to be suspected, and cried - I said, I was sure she would not rob me of a needlefull of thread I had such a good opinion of her - she had lived with the people who kept the house before; they discharged her, and I not having a servant, kept her; one or two young men used to come to talk to her - I have a daughter, but no man comes to see her - the handkerchief was marked, and here is where the threads have been picked out; I have the roll the ribbon was cut from; one stocking was found in her box, and the rest in her bed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you say about the ribbon? A. The Magistrate matched it with the roll; it tallies exactly, and the quantity is the same as is missing.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not offer that if she would confess her guilt, you would not prosecute her? A. I did before she was committed; I said I was particularly fond of her, and if she would confess her guilt I would not appear against her; her father came afterwards, and said he did not think I should go on with it - I said, I must go on, as he had gone to the extreme; she did not confess - I did not wish to prosecute.</p>

Borradaile's;" he said, "I do not:" he had been very frequently at our house before, from them - I said, "You have been very frequently in the habit of coming to our house to receive money - I have paid you money frequently myself;" he said he never was in the habit of coming to the house at all - those were his words; not that he had never been there: I am certain he has very frequently been there - I had very often paid him money at the counter: nothing further passed between him and me - an officer was sent for; he and Higgins were both taken into custody.

It may be so, Sir William Curtis is a partner - the cheque has not been in my possession ever since; I know it by my initials on the back, which I put on at the time, after I had questioned him - I did not keep it a minute after it was presented; I gave it to the solicitor; I did not put my initials on it when I first parted with it - I do not recollect whether I did it the same day or not, as it was near the close of business; I do not think I did put them on the same day - I knew the cheque when it was put into my hands, from the filling up and the writing; I suspected it when it was first produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Higgins' manner increase that suspicion, or otherwise? A. It increased it - he hesitated very much in his answer how he would have it; I did not send him to fetch the prisoner - he was detained; the prisoner said he did not belong to Messrs. Borradaile's; I have since heard that he had been discharged that morning - his answer was so far correct; he said he had not been in the habit of coming to the house; I did not ask his name - I knew his person well; the porter was present at this conversation.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. It was about half-past four o'clock when Higgins brought it? A. It was; I sent for a constable, but not immediately; I had some little conversation with Higgins previous to my sending out to Burgess - a little more conversation passed than I have mentioned; I kept the cheque in my hands till the boys were taken up - it then got into the hands of the solicitor; I gave it into the hands of our head clerk, Mr. Stevens - he did not return it to me; I had not then marked it - I cannot positively say whether I marked it that night or on Monday morning, (this was on Saturday).</p>
               <p>Q. After you put it into Mr. Stevens' hands, did you see it again? A. I think on Monday morning, but am not certain; I have not the least doubt of having put my initials on the same cheque - this is the same cheque; the prisoner said he was not in the habit of coming to our house at all, and said he did not come from Borradaile's- I did not ask him if he had ever belonged to Borradaile's; I said, "You belong to Borradaile's."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect when you first saw the solicitor? A. I think on the Saturday afternoon, but I had no conversation with him; I was busy, and do not remember.</p>

            , JUN. My father is a waterman, and lives at No. 18, Gedling-street, Dockhead. I have known the prisoner about three months - he came to me on Saturday, in July, at Bankside - he asked me if I was going over the water, and then he asked if I would give him a cast over; I did so, after asking my father's leave; when we got over my father stepped out on the stairs, and then told me to moor the boat - the prisoner and I went over Three Cranes-wharf, and when we got up into Queen-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110049"/>street, he asked me to go a little way with him, he should not be above ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I said if we should not be longer I would go; when he got up two or three lanes, he asked me if I would go in there with a piece of paper - he pointed to the house, where I went in, and gave me a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he ask you to do? A. He asked me to go in there with a piece of paper, and say, "Short," for he was going somewhere with a letter; I was to take the paper in there, and put it on the counter and say"Short."</p>
               <p>Q. If you got anything, what were you to do? A. To bring it to him; he said he would be outside by the time I came out - he gave me the paper; I took it into the house; the clerk asked me what I would have - I said"Short:" after some conversation the prisoner was fetched in - I told the clerk, Burgess was outside: I put the same paper down to the clerk, as the prisoner gave me; I laid it on the counter.</p>
               <p>MR. BRACKET. The term, "Short," means the smallest number of notes.</p>

            . I am father of the last witness. On a Saturday in July I remember going with my son across the water - when I came to the water side. Burgess was with my son, and I went over the water with him - I stepped out on the stairs, leaving my son to make the boat fast.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear who proposed to the other to go? A. No - I stepped out on the stairs; they crossed some other boats to the wharf; I did not hear them say a word - they shoved the boat from the steps to make the rope fast.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Mansion-house. On Saturday, the 12th of July, I was fetched to Messrs. Curtis' banking-house, and took the prisoner into custody, and young Higgins with him, for presenting a forged cheque of 35l.; when I went in, the prisoner, in my presence, stated to Mr. Gates, that Norris, the foreman of Messrs. Borradaile's, had sent him with the cheque to the banking-house: I took them both to the Mansion-house, then went over the water, saw Mr. Norris, and brought him to the Mansion-house, where the prisoner and Higgins were in custody; nothing was said to him in my presence - Brand. the marshalsman, was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you were there, Mr. Gates, the solicitor for the prosecution, was there? A. Yes - the prisoner made the statement about Norris in about two minutes after I got there; they were talking when I went in.</p>

            . I am solicitor to the Committee of London Bankers; this prosecution is carried on at their instance. On the 12th of July I was fetched to the banking-house of Messrs. Curtis - the prisoner and Higgins were there; at the time of my going into the counting-house a conversation was going on between Burgess, Higgins and a gentleman there, who, I think, was Mr. Stevens; the conversation ceased as I entered, and it was stated to me that there was a forged cheque brought in by the two boys, and I was requested to do what was needful; the cheque was produced to me - it was between four and five o'clock; the cheque was lying on the desk before them; I questioned Higgins, who, I understood, had brought it in, and he stated, in the presence of the prisoner, the facts he has now given in evidence; finding Burgess had given it to him, I told him the serious consequences of the offence, and cantioned him against stating anything to me that might affect himself, and told him to state nothing but the truth; I then asked him from whom he had the cheque - he said from Norris, who was the foreman of Messrs. Borradaile's; that he had received it from him that morning, and was to take him the money for it in the afternoon; I then asked if he was quite certain that Norris was the person from whom he had received the cheque (taking the cheque in my hands) - he said he was; I took it into my possession, and kept it till Monday morning, when I went to the Mansion-house, and I think it was then Bracket put his initials on it; it had not been out of my possession before then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This prosecution is by the Association of Bankers? A. Yes; I was sent for as their solicitor; Mr. Stevens was in the room when the conversation took place - he might, or might not, hear the cantion I gave the prisoner; there are one or two desks in the office; Mr. Stevens was at the end of the office and busily engaged - it was cancelling time, but it is possible he might have heard it; when I entered the room he was about as far as I am from you, and said to me, "These are the lads who brought the cheque, will you attend to them" - he then left that desk, and went to his own desk: I told the prisoner what he said would be given in evidence, and more particularly, if he told an untruth it would be more prejudicial to him; I always make it a rule to caution a person before I ask a question - I told him it would be more detrimental to him if he told an untruth, and then he said Mr. Norris was the person who gave it to him; I told him it would be a serious thing if it was not so - he replied that Norris was the person; I think Mr. Bracket put his initials to the cheque at the banking-house previous to my going to the Mansion-house about eleven o'clock in the morning - it had been in my possession till that time; it lay on the desk on my entering the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say Mr. Stevens retired from that desk to his own - whose desk was he standing at at the time? A. I cannot say - it was one of three or four desks which stand in a room; Bracket was not there; Rhodes entered the room at the time the conversation was going on.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110050"/>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean to say Rhodes heard what the boy said about Norris? A. I should think he could not help hearing it; he was as near as I am to you: I think I made a memorandum of what the prisoner said - I have no memorandum about me; I speak from memory - I sent for Norris to be taken into custody.</p>

            . I am a marshalsman of the City. On Saturday, the 12th of July, the prisoner and Higgins were placed in my custody - I had a short conversation with the prisoner, he was charged with uttering a forged cheque: I had heard him say, in the office at the Mansion-house, that he had received it from Norris - that was before he was examined, not when he was under examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened he to say that? A. I believe the question was asked him by somebody, I think by Mr. Gates; and an officer was despatched for Norris - Mr. Gates left the place, desiring me to take care of the prisoners; during his absence I was speaking of the enormity of the offence - I did not say anything to induce him to make a statement - I asked how he could be guilty of such a thing, if the charge was true against him, which I hoped he would prove not; he said he had the cheque several days in his possession - I said, "Then how is it that they would suffer a cheque to lay in your possession, and not call for the proceeds before" he said he had had cheques lay in his pocket for days before, and it happened so in the hurry of business sometimes; nothing further passed - I searched him on Mr. Gates' return, which was in about half an hour, and found on him three cheques, with the names signed to them, but the sums blank - these are them(looking at them) they were in his left-hand jacket pocket, with other papers; I produced the cheques, and Mr. Gates, I believe, put some questions to him - he said he had them from a boy named May, who (he said) was in Messrs. Borradaile's employ, in the counting-house; May was sent for - Norris afterwards came to the Mansion-house, and, I believe, the first words Norris said, was, "You know, Burgess, you were discharged from Messrs. Borradaile's," for some reason; I believe Mr. Gates asked Norris, in the prisoner's presence, if he had given him the cheque; Norris denied it, and said he had not given it to him; and denied that it was the signature of the firm - the prisoner was then dumb - he made no answer; he heard what Norris said: May was afterwards sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean that the whole of this took place before you went before the Magistrate? - A. Yes; he did not go before the Magistrate that day: Mr. Gates first came to the Mansion-house about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Gates, on seeing him at the Mansion-house, desire to know from whom he had the cheque? A. Yes - he did not say he had already heard from whom he had it; I do not think anybody was present when I talked with the prisoner; I believe he is sixteen or seventeen years old; I knew the charge affected his life.</p>
               <p>Q. And after "enlarging on the enormity of the offence," you questioned him? A. I put this simple question to him - I did not tell him his answers would be given in evidence against him, it not being my original charge.</p>

            . On the 12th of July I was foreman to Messrs. William and George Borradaile, and am so still. The prisoner was in their employ, and left on the morning of the 12th of July; I am acquainted with Messrs. Borradaile's hand-writing - (looking at the cheque) this is not in the hand-writing of any of the firm, nor any part of it; no other persons are authorized to draw cheques in their names; I did not give this cheque to the prisoner on that day, or at any time; I have been in Messrs. Borradaile's employ ever since I left school, about thirty-five years; before the present gentleman came into the house. I know nothing whatever about the cheque; I know very little of the prisoner's hand-writing: I was sent for to the Mansion-house on the 12th of July, about six o'clock in the evening - I saw the prisoner and Higgins there.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the prisoner was in the service of your employers, had he ever been sent to the banker's? - A. He was repeatedly sent to Messrs. Curtis', not less than twenty times; I was asked, in the prisoner's presence, whether I had given him that cheque, and said certainly not; part of the prisoner's employment was to clean the counting-house out; the cheque-book sometimes was kept in the pigeon-holes, where memorandums are placed, and when he was cleaning the counting-house he might have access to the cheque-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in the prosecutors' service? A. Since 1793; I superintend the manufactory - I am confident I never saw that cheque; there are several firms named Borradaile in London, but not Borradaile only; I never knew our firm sign blank cheques - two other clerks and a lad named May had access to the cheque-book, as well as the prisoner; the warehousemen have no business in the counting-house, but they might have access to it. I have sent the prisoner to Messrs. Curtis' many times; I believe he came into the employ in October, 1826; he has been with us nearly two years.</p>

            . I am in Messrs. Borradaile's employ, and have been so since November, 1827. I never gave the prisoner these three cheques; I know nothing of these three; the day before he left the service I saw him take two cheques out of the cheque-book, which laid on Mr. George Borradaile's desk; they were blank cheques - I asked him what he was going to do with them; he said Nothing - that they were of no use: nothing more passed - he took the two cheques, doubled them up very small, and put them into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you did not give him these three - did you give him any others of the same kind? A. No; I said I knew nothing of these three; but I saw him take the two I have spoken of, and double them up very small; I only know of those two; I never had anything of the sort in my possession; I saw him take them from the cheque-book; I knew the cheque-book by the appearance of it - there was not "Cheque-book" written on it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they were blank - did you look at them? A. No; the cheque-book is never filled up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you occasionally look into it, I suppose? A. I have occasionally cheques to go to the banker's, and I have fetched cheque-books from the banker's; I fetched that one more than a month before this happened; I had not looked into the book after I fetched it - I thought it wrong for him to take them; I did not go and tell of it: he said he was going to do nothing with them; I said nothing about it till he was taken.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110051"/>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was that next day? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM BORRADAILE. I am in partnership with George Borradaile - we are furriers; our manufactory is in Bridge-row, Southwark. (Looking at the cheque) this is not my hand-writing, nor my brother's - nobody is anthorized to draw cheques in our name; we never draw blank cheques, nor leave them in our cheque-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these three cheques - are either, or all of them, signed in your or your brother's hand-writing? A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have no other partners? A. None - I am certain we never authorized any person to sign cheques for our firm - my brother is not in town.</p>
               <p>The cheque was here put in, and read [see indictment,] also the three blank ones found on the prisoner; they were on Sir William Curtis and Co., and each signed William and George Borradaile, apparently in the same hand-writing as the one uttered.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CURTIS, ESQ. My father. Sir William Curtis, Mr. Robarts, and myself, compose the firm of our banking-house.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN to HENRY HIGGINS, JUN. Q. Where did you meet Burgess that morning? A. At Bankside, about two o'clock - it was not by appointment, but accidental; we waited a few minutes till my father came from dinner, and then crossed the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go, directly after you landed at the wharf, to Lombard-street? A. Yes; he stopped to buy one pennyworth of apples - I am not quite sure that it was two o'clock when I met him; we mostly dine about two - I do not know at what time we got to the banking-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You stopped no where but to buy one pennyworth of apples? A. Yes, we stopped a good bit at a public-house - he asked me to go in; I had no suspicion of anything wrong - I swear that.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You said it was about two o'clock when you landed the prisoner from the boat, and said you would go with him if it would not take more than ten minutes or a quarter of an hour? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long did you stay at the public-house? A. We stopped a good while - he said he was only going in for a minute or two.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he tell you he was going to take you to the banking-house to give you a paper to receive money? A. No, not till he got close to the place - he said he was only going to the public-house for a few minutes - we had some porter, and he kept me a good while - he said my father would not get a fare yet; I told him I must not stop above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>MR. BORRADAILE. We understood and believed the prisoner to hear a good character.</p>

             re-examined. I found the prisoner at the corner of Abchurch-lane, about six or seven yards from our door - our house is at the corner of the lane; he was on the same side of the lane as the house is, and on the pitching, not on the pavement - our door is in Lombard-street, in the centre of the house; he was a yard and a half or two yards down the lane - I dare say he could see anybody go in and out of our house - he was just round the corner; as soon as I went out of the house I saw him, and brought him in - he could not see into our windows, they are very high.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You say he stood some distance down the lane? A. He could see anybody coming down our steps from the banking-house door - he stood at the corner of the street, watching to his left; as soon as I went out at the door I saw him, and took him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon after you got out at the door did you see him? A. In less than a second, as soon as I was off the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon could he see anybody coming down the steps? A. He could see through the rails, which project out two feet or better.</p>
               <p>MR. STEVENS. I am engaged in Messrs. Curtis' house; Beckett gave me a cheque; I referred to Mr. Robarts, and sent immediately to Mr. Gates; I put the cheque into Mr. Gates' hands - before Mr. Gates came in, I think I put it into Mr. Robart's hands, and he returned it to me; it was not out of my sight while in his hands - I put no mark on it; I believe this cheque to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it in your possession before it got into the possession of Mr. Gates? A. I should think not a quarter of an hour - it had been in the room where I was all the time.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Mr. Robarts was not in the same room as you? A. No: I think I put the cheque into his hands - I did not leave it with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it to Mr. Gates, or lay it on the desk? A. I think I gave it into Mr. Gates' hand.</p>
               <p>JURY to HENRY HIGGINS, JUN. Q. Had you ever been to a banker's before? A. No: the prisoner gave me the cheque at the banking-house door; I did not read it - it was doubled together; he told me to put it on the counter - I did not know what "Short" meant.</p>

In July last, I had a temporary lodging at Norwood - on Saturday, the 5th, I left my house about six o'clock, to go to Norwood, and about a quarter to six on the following morning, I heard my house had been broken open and robbed - I came to town, examined the premises, and found the bricks had been taken out of the wall in the passage, leading between Mr. Taylor's house and mine - there was a hold large enough to admit the person of a man; the petition had been cut with a centre-bit, and the whole pannel taken out, so as to admit the party into the shop - I have only one door to my house, that is in the centre, in St. Ann's-lane; the shop is on each side - my door remained perfect: the passage has a blank door, opening into St. Ann's-lane - there is no way of opening that door, but from the inside, without violence; there is a large lock inside the door, which lock I found forced off- it is in the possession of the officer; I examined the church-yard gate; it was locked, but there was the appearance of it having been forced: I examined my shop and missed the articles stated in the indictment - the whole of my window was stripped; almost the whole of my jewellery was taken away, and the shop cleared - all except a few plated articles; the value of the property taken is between 400l. and 500l. - I have not recovered any of it; I also lost my day-book and ledger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the female prisoner before the 5th of July? A. Yes; about a week, or ten days, or possibly a fortnight before the robbery, she came into my shop, and locked at a penknife and some scissors; she got into conversation with me about the Post-office, and ultimately bought a thimble for 18d. and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you leave any confidential person in care of your property? A. Yes; I left my brother-in-law, and a female servant: the passage I mentioned, runs between my house and Mr. Taylor's - it is only used for the purpose of the charity-children going to church; it was so used at that time, but is now nailed up; the door was kept locked, and was opened inside by the sexton - the children go from St. Ann's-lane into the door; I believe that was the only use made of it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. The property lost was all in your shop? A. Yes; the whole was in the window - there is only one door to my house in St. Ann's lane; the passage door is at the extreme end of the shop.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's service. On the 5th of July, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the male prisoner at the door; he came to the shop door, which was not open at that time - the window shutters were down; I went and opened the door to him - my master had gone into the country, and Mr. Allan, his brother-in-law, was not at home; he sleeps on the premises - there was nobody at home but myself; I opened the door - he nodded at some waiters in the window, and said"Are those silver waiters in the window?" I told him I did not know; he asked if I knew the price of them - I said I did not, that Mr. Hopping was not at home; he asked how long it would be before he would be at home - I said I did not know how long he would be, but his brother would be in presently; he said "How long do you think it will be?" I said about a quarter of an hour - he said very well, he would be back by that time; I am sure Heath is the man - I think I have seen him before, passing the door; I cannot say whether it was once or more. I went to bed about ten o'clock, and was disturbed about half-past three in the morning, and found the house had been broken into, and robbed; I went down the cellar with two watchmen - Perry had aroused me; I saw the wall in the passage, it was terribly broken down, and the bricks out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice the waiters that Heath directed your attention to? A. No; but I concluded he meant a large waiter and two small ones in the window - whether they were there the next morning, I cannot say.</p>

He went out of town about a quarter-past six o'clock in the evening; and about seven I saw the prisoner come to the shop, he asked me "What is the price of those silver waiters?" directing my attention to a pair in the window - I told him they were not silver; he then asked the price of that large one, it was a good deal larger; I told him that was not silver - he then asked the price of a pair of silver fish-knives, and said "I suppose they are silver - what are they per ounce?" I said I could not exactly say, for Mr. Hopping was not within at present; I said they were silver - he looked about in the window for a minute, but asked no more questions - he went away; about half-past three o'clock in the morning I was called up by Harrison or Bates; I got up, and found the premises had been broken into and robbed - the fish-knives which he had asked me about were gone, and the three waiters left; some property was left in the shop, some was left in the passage tied in a handkerchief, but I did not find that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He inquired the price of an article, and you said you could not tell him, on account of the absence of Mr. Hopping? A. Yes; he was never inside the shop, but at the door.</p>

            . I am constable of Aldersgate ward. On the morning of the 6th of July, about half-past three o'clock, I was in Little Britain with Bates, an inspector of the watch; we were coming round Little Britain - I could not see the prosecutor's house at that time, I might be seventy or eighty yards from it - I observed two men come round the corner; they were merely jumping and dancing about, and one of them turned round the corner down St. Ann's lane, apparently from Mr. Hopping's premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you standing when you first saw them? A. On the opposite side of the way to St. Ann's-lane, towards St. Martin's-le-grand; I know the church passage, and the blank door there - they were coming from the right<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110053"/>hand of the church-passage; I saw them come round the corner of St. Ann's-lane, and saw the side face of one of them, seven or eight yards from the church-passage, by Mr. Degrave's house, which is at the corner of St. Ann's-lane, and Aldersgate-street; they were nearer to the church-passage than to the church-yard gate, and were jumping and dancing about - they did not appear to have anything with them; to the best of my belief, the prisoner is the man whose side face I saw - my suspicions were not raised; Bates and I made a remark - we went over and spoke to the watchman; the persons went towards Falcon-square, they ran; we crossed over towards St. Ann's-lane - I saw Perry the watchman, coming down the lane towards St. Martin's-le-grand, I met him. I went to Mr. Hopping's premises, the church-passage door was then open - I went in with Bates, Perry also came into the passage, and there was one or two more there; I found the bricks taken out of the wall on Mr. Hoppings side of the passage, and the pannel cut out - two bread-baskets tied in a handkerckief laid in the passage: the hole was large enough to admit a man - these pieces of wood were taken out and laid in the shop, I have compared them with the apperture in the wall, they corresponded exactly - they have been bored with a centre-bit; I went into the shop with Bates - Perry had aroused the people of the house; I found a dark-lantern in one of the drawers inside the shop; I also found a phosporus box, centre-bit, and screw-driver - I applied the centre-bit to the holes in the wall, it corresponds - the screwdriver is a likely instrument to have broken the wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the back of the person you suppose to be the prisoner chiefly towards you? A. I only saw his side face as he passed me; I had no suspicion then - he was but a short time passing me; I observed him coming down the lane, and as he came round the lane, I had a view of his side face likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner afterwards shewn to you in a public-house? A. He was; I did not say he was not the man - I said I could not exactly see; the place was so dark I could not see him - Bates and I were sent in to look at him, separately; I do not think he was in the room with me, nor have I any recollection of Foster being in the room - he was allowed to go at large after I saw him in the public-house.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What did you say when you saw him? A. I said at that time I could not see him - he was up in a corner of the tap-room of the Castle and Falcon, which is very dark - it was on Sunday, the 6th of July, between eleven and twelve o'clock; that part of the room is particularly dark - he was stooping down, reading the newspaper, which was the reason I could not see his face; Foster, the marshalsman, told me to go in, and see if I could see him - there were other persons in the room; I went in alone - I returned to Foster, in the yard, and said at that time, "I don't think he is the person," because I could not see exactly, as he was in a very dark corner - I told Foster so; Goddard then went in, but nobody else; Foster then let him go; either he or Coutan went in, and told him he might go about his business; I saw him going; and when he came out of the tap-room he was in a much lighter place; I had very little doubt of him then, when I saw him standing up - I told Bates, I had very little doubt he was the man, but I could not say positively - Foster was gone, and he was allowed to go; I have very little doubt, from the appearance of his side face, that he is the man, but cannot take on myself to swear positively to him.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch of Aldersgate ward. I was with Harrison, on the morning of the 6th of July, at the corner of Little Britain, just turning into Aldersgate-street; I could see the corner of St. Ann's-lane - we were at the corner of Little Britain, when we saw two men coming from the corner of St. Ann's-lane towards us; they were, I suppose, twenty or thirty yards from the church-passage; I believe Harrison discovered them turning the corner; the prisoner is one of those persons; he was the nearest to me - I have no doubt whatever of him; they proceeded from the corner of St. Ann's-lane towards Falcon-street; they did not appear to have anything about them - the other man left the prisoner opposite Aldersgate church, and ran forward; the prisoner followed him, walking; I stood, and looked towards them, and the prisoner looked round at me very earnestly, just as the other ran, as he was walking after him - I had then an opportunity of seeing his face perfectly, and have no doubt whatever of his person - I first discovered his face by the Castle and Falcon gate; I was within thirty yards of him; I saw his face again as he went towards Falcon-street; he looked towards me when the other ran; we proceeded to the corner of St. Ann's-lane, endeavouring to see our watchman, to see if those men came out of St. Ann's-lane, and just before we crossed the road Perry appeared on his station; and in consequence of what passed we went to the house of Mr. Taylor - Perry described the robbery to us; we went in pursuit of the two persons I had seen, through Falcon-square, towards Cripplegate; Perry ran another way; we continued in pursuit not more than a quarter of an hour, not having anybody to protect the premises; after the pursuit, we returned to Mr. Hopping's premises - I found the blank door in the church-yard, leading to the passage, had been opened; the lock had been unscrewed, the bricks taken out of the wall, and the wood cut out of the pannel about a foot long; they had entered the shop there; I did not examine the church-yard gate - I waited till Mr. Hopping came to town, which was about seven o'clock, and told him the particulars - I described the man I had seen to Mr. Brown, the marshal, and between twelve and one o'clock that day I was sent for by Foster, to the Castle and Falcon, and there was a person in the tap-room, among sixteen or seventeen more; I went into the taproom, in consequence of what Foster said - it was rather-dark there; I looked about, and saw the prisoner sitting at the further corner, in the dark part of the tap-room, with his arms folded, reading the newspaper - I was satisfied immediately, from his countenance, that he was the man, in my own mind; but I wished to see his stature - I left the tap-room, went into the yard, and saw Foster; something was said to him; the prisoner was allowed to go at large - I saw him come from the tap-room, and had a much better opportunity of seeing him than when in the dark part of the room; I recognised him as one of the persons I had seen that morning, between three and four o'clock, at the corner of St. Ann's-lane.</p>

Yes - you turn to the right and down St. Martin's-le-grand, before you can turn into St. Ann's-lane; I had turned into Aldersgate-street, and was coming from Little Britain; St. Ann's-lane can be seen from the corner of Little Britain: since the improvements for the New Post-office, the houses are all taken down to the church; I was in Aldersgate-street, in front of the church, and could see the corner of St. Ann's-lane, but not into the lane; I first saw them come round the corner - what part of the lane they came from I cannot say; they passed us - we were on the other side of the street, going slowly towards St. Ann's-lane, as they came towards us quickly; I was sent into the public-house to identify the man - he was over the newspaper, but I doubt whether he had light enough to read it.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Ann's-lane. - On the 5th of July, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I was at the corner of Mr. Payne's, the watch-maker, about eight doors from the church-yard, fifty or sixty yards from the prosecutor's premises; I had been my rounds, and was trying Payne's shutters, and about three o'clock, when I went up there, I had seen a man standing by Mr. Payne's - I should know him if I saw him; he was a thin-faced man, about my height; it was not the prisoner. About half-past three o'clock I was standing at Payne's, trying the shutters, and looking down, I saw two gentlemen (as I took them to be) come out of Mr. Taylor's,(as I supposed) his shop is next door to the passage, going up to the church-yard - that is the passage they came from- they went towards Bull and Mouth-street; I supposed they had come from Mr. Taylor's: I found afterwards they had come from the passage; they walked - I did not suspect anything, as I had tried the doors going up, and found them secure; there was nobody in the lane but those two men - I only saw their backs: I cannot say whether either of them was the prisoner's size: they could hardly have turned round the corner before I saw Bates and Harrison - they could not have got more than two doors from the corner. In consequence of what passed between us, I went towards Mr. Hopping's premises, having first tried Mr. Taylor's, and found them secure; there was a bit of paper which took my attention, on the step of the door that leads up the church-passage - that step immediately adjoins Mr. Taylor's door; I found the pssage-door a little ajar - it is usually kept locked; we went in - the lock was off, and lying down in the passage; I found the wall broken through, and the pannel cut away; I did not go into the shop - the first thing I saw in the passage was two bread-baskets, tied in a handkerchief, and a card of rings by the side of them, and I think two purses; I called up the inmates. The church-yard gate, leading to St. Ann's-lane, was fast - I tried it.</p>

On the Sunday morning before this robbery I was standing at the church door before morning service began, a little before eleven o'clock, and saw the male prisoner at the gate, trying something to the lock; I went down to speak to him, but when I got down I could not speak, for I was so frightened, and returned; he was trying the lock of the gate, and when I went down he took his hand away, and put something into his pocket.</p>

            . I know both the prisoners. I saw the female prisoner on Sunday morning, the 6th of July, at my house, No. 7, Three Herring-court, about twenty minutes before eight o'clock - she had a small box- I do not know what was in it, I never saw; it was a tin box - I was up: Mrs. Foster, who has just been called, was in bed in the room; I do not know where she is - she lodged with me; when the female prisoner came in she asked if I had done her cap - I said I had not; she then asked me to lend her a candle, which I did; she went into the passage, and sealed the box - I did not see the box till after she came in again.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that she sealed it then? A. She said she wanted the candle to seal the box; she was going to send it to Charles Turnley - I know Turnley by sight; she did not tell me what was in the box, nor did she tell Foster, in my hearing; I swear that. I heard Mrs. Foster examined before the Magistrate, and remember what she stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you again, did she say to Mrs. Foster, or to anybody else in your hearing, or to you, what was in the box? A. She did not, nothing of the kind; I never heard anything of the kind - she did not mention Heath's name, nor any name - I do not recollect that she mentioned anybody's name.</p>
               <p>COURT. It is right to remind you you are on your oath. Witness. I have said quite correct.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Look at that handkerchief? A. I know nothing of that handkerchief, Sir - I never saw it before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Recollect yourself, whether she mentioned any name? A. No; she did not mention any name - I have stated all she said; she did not state anything about anybody having been taken - I do not recollect saying so before the Magistrate.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Hackney-road; I know the prisoner, but only by this transaction. On the 8th of August, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw him coming up Hackney-road, with a pony walking- I was going down the road; I returned in half an hour, and saw the pony standing at the Durham Arms public-house door; he was inside: I asked the young man at the public-house if it was for sale - I went home; the young man came over, and said it was for sale: I went over, and asked the prisoner what he asked for it - he said six guineas; I asked if he would warrant it quiet in harness; he said Yes, that he had had it twelve months; I asked if he would allow me to put it in the chaise - he said Yes; I did so - it ran away, and kicked the harness all to pieces; I told him I would give no such money for it - he said he would take a little less; I gave him 4l. 10s. for it: I asked his name - he said William Castle, and that he lived at the Rose and Crown public-house, Wimbledon; I gave 5l. and the pony to Mr. Chaplin, for a horse, the same day, because it kicked in harness.</p>
               <p>Q. If it did not suit you, how came you to buy it? A. I bought it, and sent it to Smithfield; it was a mare pony - I also went to Smithfield myself, and gave it, with 5l., to Chaplin; I have seen it since, in the possession of the prosecutor, and have every reason to believe it is the same - it was a black pony, but had no particular mark.</p>

I saw the prisoner sell the pony to him on the 8th of August, and am certain of his person: he said his name was William Castle: I went and put it in harness with master, as he said he would warrant it sound and quiet in harness - I have seen it since at Bow-street, and have every reason to believe it to be the same.</p>

            . I am constable of Wimbledon. I received information from Low, and apprehended the prisoner on Sunday evening, the 31st of August, at Wandsworth; from the description Low gave me I knew him - his name is Frederick Holloway; he lived at the corner of Wickhouse-lane, Wimbledon-common, and used to keep a shop there some time ago, but has not done anything lately, to my knowledge; he lived about a quarter of a mile from the Rose and Crown - I mentioned several things to him which I suspected him of; I told him of this robbery - he said he knew nothing about it; I found six awls, a key, and a knife on him; he is something of a saddler: I have driven the prosecutor's poney, and know the one produced at Bow-street to be the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You did not apprehend me? A. No; I had been searching for him - a young man stopped him at Wandsworth, and fetched me directly.</p>

             re-examined. I generally keep a horse; when a pony of this sort runs away and kicks, it is not worth much; if it had been as he warranted it, I do not think it would be worth more than 6l.; Holloway has been bit in purchasing it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce three aprons, two handkerchiefs, and a pair of stockings: I apprehended the prisoner at Mrs. Eaton's house, on the 2d of September - they sent for me, as she came there; I found two keys in her pocket, which she said were the keys of her box, which was at her brother's, No. 7, Holywell-lane; I went there, and found two boxes, in which I found these things - her mistress had charged her with stealing the property; the key fitted the lock; and at the bottom of the box I found the gold ring.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she absent when you searched the box? A. She was in the Compter; Walters and a young woman were present, and the prisoner's brother - I did not find them at the first search; I did not know the prisoner's clothes; I took the things away, and what she did not own I took away - I found a pair of stockings, one handkerchief and three aprons; I was not particular in searching, for it was late at night, and I did not know the girl's property; there were ribbons all cut to pieces, and there might be more things; I did not search particularly, as I wished Walters to be with me, as she knew her things, but it was too late; there were two boxes, one nearly a yard long - I intended to go next morning with Walters, as nothing was marked which I expected; I had heard a ring was stolen - that was among a parcel of other things; I was obliged to shake them all out to find it; her brother was present at the first search, and a man, who, I believe, was the landlord of the house - there were two or three in the room; I found everything the first time, but one handkerchief and the ring - I went again next day in the afternoon; her brother was present then, when the ring was found - I searched more minutely then.</p>

            . I keep a shop in the general line, at No. 7, Holywell-row, Shoreditch. The prisoner's brother lodges with me; I was present when the officer came to her brother's apartments to search her box - it was about half-past eight o'clock in the evening; he brought the keys with him, and searched minutely - he searched every particle, for I was there the whole time; he searched every part of both trunks - he took the things out one by one, as they were neatly put in - he shook them, and threw them out in the middle of the room; he undid every pair of stockings: there was a pocket-book, with two duplicates, one for her gown, and the other for her mother's wedding ring, which was pawned before she went to her situation - he opened every bit of paper that was as big as a shilling - nothing was left at the bottom, and a bundle, which was not in the trunks, but which was brought up, he examined minutely; she was going to take it up herself to the room, but when she heard the officers were after her, she went and surrendered herself- the officer took away what he supposed belonged to the prosecutrix; if the ring had been there I must have seen it, so help me God! - it could not have been there without being found; I was not present at the second examination of her boxes, but her brother was; the officer, a young man from the Elephant, the young woman and the prisoner's brother all went up together - as the brother was there I thought it unnecessary for me to go; I went up in about five minutes, and asked the officer if he had got anything else - he shewed me this case; I did not see the ring in it; the young woman was searching the box and the officer sitting in a chair; the young woman up with her hands, smiling, and said, "I have got the very thing that will do her;" I said, "What is it?" the officer shewed me the ring - I thought to myself it could not be there when the search was made before: I asked the brother, and he said the young woman herself had taken it from the box.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner heard there was a charge against her, she voluntarily surrendered herself? A. She came to my door with a bundle, and sent it up; she had plenty of opportunity to go up to the box if she liked, but did not - she went to the Mansion-house, and then to the Elephant as I am informed.</p>

Soap, candles, sugar and things; I keep a chandler's shop; her brother has lodged twelve months with me; Wallis was not present at the first examination - the officer took away a shawl, a handkerchief and stockings then, and some petticoats; he took away the contents of the trunks - I cannot say what they were; I asked if he had a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the officer searched minutely, as such, and you were watching, you must have seen what he took away? A. I cannot say, as I did not take an inventory; I am sure the ring was not in the box for everything was shook out - the ring was in a red case, and I could not help seeing it, if it was there; I asked the prisoner's brother, and he said she found it in the middle of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Somebody, according to your account, must have put it in then? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. Take the handkerchief up - whose is that? A.

            . I am clerk to Mr. Bricheno, at the Skinner-street place, where the prisoner was employed - he ought to account to me there, for the money he receives every day, in the evening; he had a book of cheques, by which he kept his account - he calls the account over from the counterpart of his cheques, and I enter it into a book, and then call it over again, to see if it is correct - I then ask him how much cash he has; he gives me an account of his gold, silver, and copper, and if anything is short, he puts so much short; the counterpart of the cheque is written by him. Neale, of Philip-lane, sells our intermediate beer: I have an entry to him on the 1st of May, of half a barrel, 12s. 6d., and 12s. 6d. paid - I took that entry from the prisoner's month, and from his receipts; here is the counterpart of the receipt in his writing - it corresponds with my entry, and at the end of that day I have his own writing for the money he paid in, which agrees with the account he gave; 12s. 6d. is the only sum he accounted for as received from Neale. On the 13th of June, Springsguth came, and particularly wanted some beer to be sent; he ordered one half-barrel, or eighteen gallons - I could not send it till one of the men came home - he came again about eight o'clock, and soon after I sent by the prisoner one half-barrel for him, and another for Mr. Wilkinson, of Tenter-row; he returned at half-past ten, saying he had brought one back, as Wilkinson's was shut up, and had put it into the ton room - he paid me 12s. 6d. for Springsguth's half-barrel; there are so many casks in the ton room, we could not discover whether the other had been put there or not - he never gave me an account of having sold Springsguth two half-barrels.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it your business to pay over to the prosecutor the sums as you receive them? A. No, in a lump - I pay them next morning, keeping each drayman's cash in a separate bag; the prisoner never ran an account with me - he said on the 24th of July, that he had been knocked down and robbed of his books; that was after this transaction - he did not send for me to his lodgings: I went there to take him into custody - that was about three days after he said he had been knocked down; he had not come to business after the 24th; I did not find him at his lodgings, but in the street: five days before he was taken, a message was sent that he had been knocked down, and lost his book; that was the very last day he went out with the dray - when I saw him he seemed as if he had been fighting; he said he had lost the books, not that he was robbed of them - he is married, and has a family.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If he had laid out any money for necessaries, would that be charged to him immediately and deducted? A. Yes - that was settled every Saturday night: I produce the original book; he accounted to me every night for what he received.</p>

            . This receipt is in the prisoner's hand-writing; I have not got the counterpart of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Look at both these receipts - do you say that both these names are in the prisoner's handwriting? A. I am positive the same person wrote both; he did not pay me more than 12s. 6d. - it is impossible I can be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written) I most solemnly assert my innocence of the charge altogether. As regards the money which Mr. Springsguth's brother says he paid me, I can call to mind, that on the 13th of June last, late in the evening (it might be about nine o'clock), I was sent out with beer to several customers, and among the number Mr. Springsguth was one, and ordered one cask; after going to the customers (to whom I had been), on my return homewards, I called upon Mr. Springsguth, having two casks left; always alive to the interest of my employer, I prevailed upon Mr. Springsguth to take both the casks, for which, it appears by the receipt, he paid me. My Lord and Gentlemen, I observed before that as Mr. Springsguth ordered but one cask - the counterpart of the receipt might have been marked for one cask, while I delivered the money for two casks, thus the error might easily arise; he it as it may, I am confident the money was accounted for; Mr. Greathead (if he speaks impartially) cannot deny that errors have crept in, in the manner I have just now described- I am conscious of having given Mr. Springsguth's money to Mr. Greathead; it being late, he put the money into his right-hand waistcoat pocket, and did not enter it in the book - next morning he might have forgotten it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of September I saw the prisoner attempting several pockets; he went up to the prosecutor put his right hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and took this handkerchief out - he then put in his left hand; I touched the prosecutor, and went to seize the prisoner's hand; he pulled it away: I collared him, and he threw the handkerchief down - I took it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He said at the first examination that he took it out of my hand, and at the second that he took it off the ground; he says there was a crowd, and how could he see me take it; I was remanded.</p>
               <p>JOHN GIRTON. I did not say I took it from his hand; he was remanded to bring people to his character, but he brought none.</p>

On the 9th of September, about one o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner at the top of Stonecutter's-street, Shoe-lane, carrying a basket; I asked him what it was - he said "Apples" and he was going to take them to Plumtree-court - that he had brought or bought them from

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When did Killick make his appearance? A. I was not at the watch-house then: the prisoner said nothing about Killick - he was at the Mansion-house, and both were sent to the Compter; I did not hear Killick say, he had given it to him - he was afterwards discharged, and the prisoner was committed; Rogers and Street said at the Mansion-house, they saw Killick put it on his shoulder.</p>

It did, but not the apples: Killick knew I dealt with Jacobs; I saw him that night, when I put the fruit by. The prisoner told the Alderman, that Killick put the basket on his head, to carry to his lodging in Plumtree-court - I know Killick lodges there; I do not believe the prisoner stole it at all.</p>

               <p>JAMES HOPE. I am a broker. On the 22d or 23d of July the male prisoner offered me a bed for sale; he said he wanted to take some things out of pawn, as he was going into the country, and had lost his wife - having a hatband on, I thought it true, and bought it for 15s.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner WILLIAM FOWLE. I hope you will consider that it was by my order my wife did it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not take particular notice of the cow you saw the prisoner with? A. No - I noticed it being whitish, and some red.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate at Hatton-garden threaten to send you to gaol for the manner in which you gave your evidence? A. Yes, I said I was not positive of the month - not that I could not say whether it was last October or the October before; I said I did not know the month to be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you did not know whether it was October last or the October before? A. I cannot swear about it - I do not know about it - I will not swear I did not say that; I said it was before Christmas, the latter end of the year - I never could have told the Magistrate I thought it was after Christmas - I told him it was before.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not tell the Magistrate you thought it was after Christmas? A. No, I will not - it was mildish weather; I told him it was not cold weather, it was calm.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of your examination, did you not tell him that you did not know whether it was warm or cold? A. I possibly might.</p>

            . I live at Hackney, and am a cattle-dealer. I know the prisoner; I bought a cow of him; I had seen him before but not to know him; it was on the 24th of October last, at Romford market, I gave him 9l. 10s. for it, which was a fair price - 10l. was the full value; I asked him where he brought it from; he said from William Lane, Esq. of Leytonstone - he said he was the under gardener; I asked him how long Mr. Lane had had the cow; he said Mr. Lane bought it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110062"/>at Croydon fair, which was a month or six weeks before; I asked why they parted with it; he said they were to have it for the land, and had got a couple of Alderney ones instead; I paid him for it, and delivered it to Lapthorn my drover - it was white with red about the head, and one red spot on the side - it was a remarkable one; I had it only about four hours - for when I got home at night I found it had been claimed and taken away; I did not see it afterwards till the next day, when I went to Hartwell's with an officer - it was the same cow that I had bought of the prisoner; I was examined at Hatton-garden on a Monday, about seven weeks ago - Lucas was there; I have seen the cow every week since at the prosecutor's - it is the same as I bought of the prisoner on the 24th of October - I know it by the particular marks about it - it is a very remarkable cow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to state that you had seen it before it was sold to you? A. Never; but I have seen it every week since, as I am in the habit of going there every week on business; that is not what makes me speak to it; I picked it out the next morning from among others in his shed; I cannot help seeing it when I go, as I go into his shed; I had seen the prisoner's face before, but not to know him; I cannot say where, but suppose it must he about the market - he was not taken for nine months after; I said at Hatton-garden that I was certain of him; I said he was the man directly I saw him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said before the Magistrate that you believed he was the man? A. Not to my knowledge; I said directly I saw him, "That is the man I bought the cow of." I am positive I said nothing about only believing it.</p>

            . I am constable of Islington. I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday, the 26th of July, at his own house, Elder-walk, Islington; I had been after him two or three times before, about this cow; I went a month or five weeks before one night, and as I went in at the front door he got out at the back and ran away - I saw him go into the court - that was the first time I went to the house. I had been looking for him for three months, not before; I was told of this six or seven months ago, and was desired to look for him, and did, but could not find him; I do not know how long he has lived there; I was at Hatton-garden - Lucas was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You first went to look for him three months ago? A. More than that - it may be five months; I went to look for him immediately after I was told to do so - other people were looking for him before that; I went about five months before with one of them, but they had been before that: I went to the house about nine o'clock, it was getting dark, it was on the 26th of July; I do not know when the first time was - it was about three months ago that he escaped - I saw him going through the passage; I had seen him about before; I believe he has no family.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There have, of course, been a cunsiderable quantity sold? A. That pattern has been kept many years, but the forks are of a particular sort - they had no mark before I found them behind the oven - I believe the name was burned into the knives, but I cannot say: I put a mark similar to the figure 5 turned upside down, and five forks I marked with a figure 7: the knives appeared to have been dipped in blood, and, of course, were dirty - they appeared new; Mr. Colwell had bought some of that pattern within three months, from Bryan, a town maker; the prisoner said they were his own.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you miss any parcel of knives and forks? A. No; I saw the prisoner come in the morning - he brought no parcel with him; there is a convenience for cleanin them near the oven.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Might he not easily have brought them in his pocket? A. He might; they were not dirty, except from the blood.</p>

On the 21st of August I was concealed under a trap-door, and could command a view of the old oven very plainly; I saw the prisoner go and wash his hands and face; he pulled out his watch, then went to the oven, opened the door, and pulled out a parcel, which he put into his pocket; I had seen the parcel in the oven the night before, when I was concealed, and knew they were knives - he went out; I told Dodd, who followed him; the prisoner did not go anywhere to clean them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might he not have taken them the night before, if he thought proper? A. I should have seen him; he did not know I was hid there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was he there the night before? A. Yes, two or three minutes before nine o'clock; he came and washed his face, and went away - Dodd and another shopman were in the shop then.</p>

            . I live in the Haymarket. - The prisoner has been my porter for nearly four years. In consequence of what I heard I went with an officer to search his lodgings, and found a great quantity of property, which I knew to be mine, tea-pots, tea-trays, knives and forks, and several articles - none of them had been marked by me, but had our private marks on them; I never gave him permission to take anything from my stock - the knives found on him are not an old pattern - the forks are; they do not match the knives; I have had forks of that pattern in my stock about twenty years, and had ceased to sell them, being quite out fashion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever sell them yourself? A. No; they were my father's stock; I never sold any of the articles found to the prisoner - I have sold such things, with the same marks, to other persons; there is no article I can identify, except by the private mark.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to Mr. Colwell's on the 21st of August, and took the prisoner; I produce the knives and forks, which I found on the counter - Dodd was present: I heard the prisoner say they were his own; I went to his lodging - I had been watching him some time before, and ascertained them to be his lodgings; I there found a tea-pot, a set of waiters, two patent locks, one of Chubb's patent locks, a pair of snuffers, two finger-plates, a drop-latch, a lot of files and tools, a milkpot, a mustrad-pot, a quantity of other tools, files, planes, and various things; I saw Bond find, concealed under the bed, seven knives and froks, and two curtain-pins; the prisoner was then in the watch-house - I produced the things at the office; he never accounted to me how he got them.</p>
               <p>- BOND. I found the things under the bed.</p>
               <p>MR. COLWELL. The knives and forks found on the prisoner are such as I had on my premises; the knives are made by Bryan, and are marked "London made;" they have been on a board, but whether used or not I cannot tell - here is the tea-pot with the mark erased; I think there seems a smear - this milk-pot I can speak to decidedly, also the tea-tray and waiter to match it; my private-mark is on several of them; I have no mark on Chubb's lock, but the number stamped on it is the number I had from him - here are several articles with my private-mark, and several tools have the marks erased, and that very lately; here are seven knives and forks which are used at my own table at times, and which I could not have sold - I had not missed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Suppose you had seen these forks eight or ten miles off, could you say they had not been sold? A. No, certainly, but they are two patterns, and I happened to have the same pattern of each of them.</p>

            . Here is a figure of 7 on one of these forks - I did it with a tool; this is the only one I can find the mark on - here is the 5 upside down, on all the knives - I marked them the morning before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have not these knives been much used? A. They have been, on a board; they may have been used - the edge of one is hacked; I doubt their having been used.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Look at the other three knives, do they appear quite new? A. I have no doubt about it.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. There is a milk-pot, it is rather a remarkable shape? A. Yes - it is the same as I had; I borrowed it at the same time; I am confident it is the same.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has he lived in the same lodging two years? A. No - he had it when he first lodged at our house; he remained there till within about eleven months - I have seen the tea-pot, but not to notice it much; he was in Mr. Colwell's service when I first knew him.</p>
               <p>MR. COLWELL. My shop-mark is on the milk-pot; I think it could not have been in use two years, and the mark appear as it does; though I think it has been in his possession some time from the mark - my mark is on the tea-board.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Colwell's employ - he discharged me about three weeks ago - I had lived two years and ten months with him; the prisoner was in his employ as a stove-grate maker, and left last April; Fryett and him were on friendly terms; I frequently saw the prisoner about the neighbourhood after he left, and in company with Fryett; about two years ago, I saw Fryett hand the front of a stove through the iron railing to the prisoner, who took it away - it was taken out of Mr. Colwell's shop; I have heard Fryett quarrel with him at times - I heard Ward ask Fryett for a coffee pot, some metal spoons, and a japanned waiter - I do not know whether Fryett gave them to him: I have heard them reproach each other about what was done, and have heard Fryett say, in Ward's presence, among others that Ward had taken things to Scoltock's shop; and that he had seen things in Scoltock's shop which he could prove were Mr. Colwell's; this was before he left - Ward made no observation about it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to swear he did not deny it? A. I have no recollection of his denying it - I have heard the same thing mentioned two or three times; I did not tell Mr. Colwell of it- it might be eight or nine months before I was discharged; I was discharged on account of Mr. Colwell losing so much property, he did not suspect me - I was not charged with it; I was discharged in consequence of what was reported in the papers, principally that Fryett should say I had stolen more than anybody else, and had shared in it; I have not seen the stove front since, and do not know what Ward did with it; it had come from the foundry; Ward finishes them - I do not know whether it has been found.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's lodging, at Wharton's, No. 9, Crown-court - the prisoner was not at home -Wharton shewed me up to his room, which is a front room on the second floor; I saw his daughter there, and asked her for the key of a cupboard which was padlocked; she did not give it to me - I forced the closet open, and found a large quantity of goods of various descriptions, and forty-five packets of nails and screws, which I produce in the state I found them; the prisoner came in while I was searching, and saw what I had found - he said they were not his, they were his daughter's - the daughter was not them present; a quantity of old locks and keys were found in the closet - he said they were part of an old stock which he had brought from his shop in Belton-street, where he formerly lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you got the keys here? A. No, they were not claimed by the prosecutor; they were old iron, laying at the bottom of the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his daughter tell you the things had been brought there three weeks before, by a person who she described, and in her father's absence? A. No, nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110065"/>of the sort - I never heard it; I went to his house on Thursday, the 21st of August - Mr. Colwell was with me, and two other officers, and I believe heard what passed; she did not, in my preasence, say anything about the man not having called for payment.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did the daughter say? A. She said her father always kept the key of the closet; I then broker it open - the prisoner never gave me the key of it.</p>
               <p>MR. COLWELL. I went with Upson to Wharton's house, and saw the search made; the daughter said her father kept the key; and on Upson saying he would break the closet open, she said he would be very angry if he did; she did not claim any property there - I believe I can speak to all these things - the papers enclosing the nails and screws are marked by my young man; there are twenty-four parcels of nails, and the rest screws - I never sold the prisoner any of them, nor authorized him to take them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the daughter say the goods had been brought there by Fryett some time previous? A. I never heard it; Ward lived between two and three years with me - Fryett had access to all the property - he was allowed to go where these things were, and Ward was not; he was a porter, and Ward a workman.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Ward had no authority to go there, but could he go if he chose? A. If he went there, I should expect he was going to ask Fryett for something - he could go there in our absence.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged at my house, in the second-floor front room - I directed Upson to his room; when he moved in, a quantity of old iron and chains were brought, and several other things were put at the bottom of the cupboard. but nothing like these goods - he came in October, 1827.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he from time to time meet you and speak to you? A. Yes; I came by his house about a week after I meet him in Piccadilly - he began abusing me in the same sort of manner, and we both had a row, not a fight, but rough language; he called me a d - d informer, and such like - I gave him as good as he brought, but no blows passed: he went in doors, and brought out this thing, or one like it, and said if I came near him he would rip my g - ts out with it; I went away - I saw him again on the 30th of August.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long might that be after your last meeting? A. From three to live months.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had anything passed between you during that time? A. No; I was coming from the Feathers public-house, where I had been for change - I came up as far as his house, and met one of my men named Joe, who I had to pay some money to; I settled with him - I was four or five minutes settling with him, and he went away; I was then talking to Mr. Heath, when the prisoner came out of his house, with some lead in his hand - he held it up, and said, "Bl - st you, do you want any more lead to pay your men with?" I said, "You had better go in doors, you old fool, and mind your own business"- I went on talking a little to Mr. Heath, and the prisoner said, "What have you done with your wh - s of sisters? they are all wh - s together;" I had said nothing more to him; he said, "If you don't go off my premises, I'll shove you off;" when he said my sisters were wh - s, I walked up to him, and said, "You had better turn your old wh - e out of doors. and take your wife in, and not meddle with our family;" he then shoved me off the pavement - I was on the public pavement, not on his premises at all; he shoved me into the road - I held up my elbows, and told him if he would come out of doors like a man I would give him a good thrashing; he said, "I will serve you out another way;" he went in doors, and fetched this thing out, or one like it - he came down one or two steps, and made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110066"/>one push at me, down towards the bowels; it was a sort of thrust - he caught it back again without it striking me, and then it was in my eye before I could put my hand or anything to stop it; I did not see it done, it was in so quick, or I should have tried to stop it - it went right through my eye-lid, and pushed my eye out; some part of my eye is in, but I am quite blind - I have lost the sight of it altogether; in drawing it back the sharp part of the instrument caught the inside bone above the eye.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he did this to you had you ever struck him, or anything? A. I had neither struck him, nor struck at him; when I held up my arm and said I would fight him if he came out like a man, I was not above a yard from him. I was confined to my bed eight or nine days, and had two surgeons to attend me - I had nothing whatever to do with what happened to him at the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. It began by his asking you to have another piece of lead? A. Yes, we abused each other; I know William Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he interpose before you received the injury, and say if you did not go away perhaps some mischief would take place? A. Never - I did not see him at all; he did not come in between us; nobody desired me to go away. I know Smith - he lodges in the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You said "Go in you old fool;" did you not use tenfold more abusive language? A. I did not; he was not in the house when I said if he came out I would fight him - he was on the footpath.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you not foreing into his door, after him, when you received the blow from him? A. I was not - there was nothing to prevent his hitting my bowels if he chose: he did not say he was sorry for the injury I had received, and that he only meant to knock my hat off - he never said a word of the kind; I did not at the time suppose I had received so serious an injury.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where were you when you said, if he came out of doors you would fight him like a man? A. On the footpath, and he was on his steps; he pushed me into the road before that - I did not see Smith at any part of the trasaction.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HEATH. I am a cow-keeper, and live in Ebury-street. I was in conversation with the prosecutor on the 30th of August, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; the prisoner came out - he was at the door when I first saw him, with some lead in his hand; he began shaking it about, and asking Green if he wanted some lead to pay his men, and called him a d - d informer; he told him it was no lead of his - Green tried to avoid him as much as he could, by turning to me again; he told him not to be such a fool, but to go in and mind his own business - after that the prisoner began again, and wanted to know what he had done with his sisters and their bastard children; I do not know what he called his sister - Green told him to leave his sisters' names alone, or he would pull him up for it; Green and I then walked into the road, on the pavement, and the prisoner said if Green did not get off his ground he would make him; we were on the public path: Green then said if he had any inclination for that he would come a little closer to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Inclination for what? A. To make him get off the pavement; Green walked towards his door and the prisoner pushed him off the pavement into the road; I am certain Green had not touched him; he had a pencil and pocketbook in his hand at the time; he turned round after that, and told him if he would come out into the road he would fight him, but would not touch him on his own premises - he was then standing on the step of his own door; the prisoner then made allusions again to Green's sisters, saying,"What have you done with your sisters and their bastard children?" Green said, "Don't talk about other people, turn your old wh - e out of your house, and take your wife in;" there might be a few more words pass, but nothing of any provocation that I can recollect - the conversation ceased; I was sideways to them, and could not see the prosecutor after he pushed him off the pavement; the conversation ceased for a minutes and a half or two minutes, and I saw no more till I saw the instrument go into his eye; I did not see the prisoner come out; I saw nothing but a hand come out of the house with the instrument in it, which went into the prosecutor's eye; I was on the same side of the way, and there is a board at the side of the door, so that I could not see; Green was turning towards me, and I saw the instrument enter his eye; I saw the water gush from his eye, and ran to his assistance; I saw the prisoner and another person in the passage - they banged the door too, and bolted or locked it, and I saw no more of him; Green was dangerously ill for some time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was a great deal of bad language on both sides? A. Very little more than I have stated - it did not last ten minutes altogether; the pavement is very narrow - there are two boards up at the door, so that I could not see what passed; I saw the instrument come out as from the prisoner's door and strike Green in the eye; when I went to Green's assistance I looked into the passage and saw another person down the passage; I had not seen him before, and who he was I cannot say; I did not see the blow aimed at Green's stomach.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not Green approached, and was he not going into the prisoner's house at the time the blow came? A. No; he was standin still, opposite the door - his own house is on the opposite side; he was not going into the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was he doing when the blow came? A. Standing on the pavement, and I suppose turning to come to me again as we were talking on business - the conversation had ceased nearly two minutes.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say they went in and shut the door, how many persons were present when the thrust was made? A. Two were in the passage, the prisoner and another - I said they shut the door; I saw nobody but the prisoner go in at the door.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the person in the passage ever out of the house? A. I did not see him, only the prisoner; I do not know how long the person had been in the passage.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and live in Royal Hospital-row, Chelsea. I was in the centre of the road when this happened, about twenty minutes past six o'clock; I came out of a door where I had been doing a job, and a row commenced between Mayden and Green; Mayden was the first who spoke, he had some cuttings of lead in his hand, and said, "Bl - t your eyes, do you want any more lead to pay your men with?" Green said, "Go in you old fool do, and mind your business;" Mayden said,"Go home and look at your wh - s of sisters and their bastard children;" Green said, "Go and turn that old wh - e out that you have in doors, and take your own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110067"/>lawful wife in doors;" with that the prisoner pushed Green off the footpath into the kennel. Green said,"If you will come out I will fight you like a man;" Mayden said, "No - I'll do for you in another way;" he then went into the house at the shop door, and was gone the space of a minute or so, and returned with this pump book or sucker hook, and made a thrust at his bowels, underhanded, with a direction for the hip; the prosecutor drew back a little and it did not reach him; he then rose it instantly overhanded and made a thrust, and drove it into his right eye - (here the witness described the thrust by holding the instrument in his right hand, and passing it between the finger and thumb of his left hand) - it struck his forehead bone, so that I am sure it might have been heard fifty yards off - nobody interfered in any way with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The blow might have been heard fifty yards off? A. I never heard such a blow; the reason he did not receive the first blow was, because he drew back; the prosecutor did not square at him when he offered to fight him, nor lift up his arms at him - he rose his arms to save himself when he was pushed into the gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. When he pushed his arms up was not the prisoner within his own door? A. No; the prisoner was at the bottom of the step are outside - it might be twenty or thirty yards from Green's own door; there are boards on each side the prisoner's door, that is for the convenience of the business he carries on.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath - if what you tell us is true, that the prisoner was down the step, out of his house, must not Heath have seen him? A. You asked me where Green was; Green was a yard and a half-from the prisoner's door.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say he pushed him off the pavement into the road - how high is the road from the pavement? A. Six or seven inches, when I speak of the distance from the door, I mean from the door, not from the wooden shouldering that projects about twenty inches.</p>

            . I live next door to Green. On the 30th of August I was about three hundred yards off, on the opposite side to the prisoner's house, and saw the prisoner come out with some lead on his arm; he said "D - n me, do you want some more money to pay your men with"- Green said "No, you had better go in doors, you old fool, and mind your business" - then he shoved Green off the pavement into the gutter; the prisoner then went in, and laid down the lead pipe which he had in his hand - I saw him bring out a bucket book, like the one produced - he made a blow at Green's bowels; nothing more was said in my presence; I was about ten yards off - I heard nothing pass, but saw the prisoner job the instrument into Green's eye, and saw the stuff run down his cheek; the prisoner then went in and shut the door; Coulman and a person named Glenton went for an officer, and while they were gone he came out at the front door - I went after him, and said "Mayden, you must not go away;" he said "It is no business of yours" - I said "It was business of somebody's - you don't know the consequence of it;" I pressed him to come back - be came back, and the officer took him; the people asked "What was the matter?" - he said "only another lead rig."</p>
               <p>Q. While this was going on, did any one interfere between the parties? A. Nobody whatever - not a soul - nobody could get between them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you hear me put a question about anybody getting between them? A. No, I was out of the Court - nobody did get between them - I was about ten yards off.</p>
               <p>JANE BROWN. My husband is a carpenter and joiner. I heard none of the conversation between the prisoner and prosecutor - I was out of doors opposite to Mr. Mayden's door; I saw Green with a book and pencil in his hand, and a man talking to him - I saw Mayden come out and say something to Green; they said a few words - Green stepped up to Mayden, and Mayden pushed him off the payment - Green then never resented nor lifted his hand, but turned his shoulder in this way, and then Mayden went in for about a minute, came out again with an iron weapon in his hand, and aimed it at Green's bowels, and in a moment rushed it into his eye.</p>
               <p>Q. In all that time did Green attempt to strike him in any manner? A. I never saw it - nobody came in between them, nor attempted to part them; I could not help seeing it if they had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you live there? A. In the same street. I heard none of the bad language - I am not deaf.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Could you hear that language was going on? A. There was abusive language, but I could not distinguish what it was.</p>

            . I am a builder. There was an inquiry at the Police-office about some lead, and after that I saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's presence - they had a few words, and the prisoner went in doors, and brought out a pump hook; this was six weeks or two months before the 30th of August; he brandished it about, and said he would do for him - he said "D - n your eyes, you are nothing but a common informer. you bl - y fool," and all that sort of language; he continued abusing him, telling him he would poke it into him, or knock his head off, and brandished it about at the same time; he said he would poke it into him, or rip his guts out - Green then went away; I saw him again about the first week in August - he was coming down the street, and said to me "Tommy, do you want any more lead?" - Green was not present; I said No; and he lifted up this instrument, and said"Either you or Green shall have it before you are many months or two months older."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When this passed, had not Green and him a good many words? A. I believe Green d - d him, and he d - d Green - he flourished the instrument over his head, but did not hit him with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say "If you won't go about your business?" A. I did not hear it - it might be said - I do not recollect it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gentlemen, this originated from a lead concern; there had been several rows between Green and me, and he laid himself in my way on several occasions, but the last row was about the lead; I went out, and was stretching a piece of lead - words ensued - he called me; I said to him "Do you want any more old lead?" - he said"You bl - y old b - g - r, turn out your old wh - e and take in your wife;" I went in doors directly, and going into the shop, knocked down this sucker hook with my right shoulder - I shut the door, and fell down over two pieces of lead - I took the hook up to move the lead, and as I had brought 10 cwt. of lead from Kensington that day, the place was very full; I tumbled down, and coming into the shop knocked the hook down - I moved a little lead to get the door open, and on opening it who should I see but Green there - he had followed me up to my door; I thought the row was done - I opened the door to hang the hook up, and there stood Green - "Come out, you bl - y old b - g - r, and I will fight you, (said he) - "you old b - g - r, turn out your bl - y old w - e;" I put my hand to him, and said "Green, go away, I want to say nothing more to you" - that is the time they say I shoved him - I was in my shop when he called me all these dreadful names, and he had got a new hat on, which he said he had bought with the money for the information; I went to knock his hat off his head with the hook, and unluckily it went into his eye, which I did not intend to do, God knows; and when I found he was hurt, I told them "For God's sake, take him to Doctor Hunter as quick as possible - I was so much hurt I did not know what to do; the only intention I had was to knock his hat off with the sucker hook - I have been extremely sorry ever since - I always inquired of every person who came to see me in prison how his eye was - whether he had lost it or not.</p>

            . I am a mason, and lodge in the prisoner's house. I was at home when this accident happened - I saw the prosecutor there, but did not see him come; when I first came out of doors I saw Green at the door, with one foot on the bottom step of the door - there are two steps to the prisoner's door, besides the cill; the next thing was, he was putting himself in a posture as though he was going to fight - he was then within a yard of the prisoner, when I saw that I ran to him, gave him a shove, and said "For God's sake Green go away, or else something serious may happen;" I then got on the top step of the door, between the two, before the accident happened, and immediately I got between them the accident happened - there was most dreadful language used on both sides.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the prosecutor was within a yard of him, squaring at him, just before it happened? A. Yes - I have measured the stones. When I first saw the prisoner he was about one foot nine inches within his own door, on the cill; the whole of the step and pavement together is a foot and seven inches wide, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were in the house - where was the prisoner when you got on the top step, between him and the prosecutor? A. The prisoner was within his own workshop, and the prosecutor stood on the pavement - I stood on the cill of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You were on the cill? A. No - I was on the step; the prisoner was within the cill from a foot to nine inches; the prosecutor was below the two steps on the pavement - I did not notice any body about, I was so busy parting the two persons; there were a great many people, but I could not notice them - I was not present at first; I saw that hook in Mayden's hand; he had it in his hand when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. What, when he came into the house? A. No - I believe, to the best of my knowledge, he was never out of the house; I never saw him out - I was not there when he had the lead.</p>
               <p>Eight witnesses gave the prisoner the character of a good tempered man.</p>

               <p>Q. Why not take them up them? A. I will tell you: I have cantioned Anderson over and over again, that he would suffer for it, as he was constantly about picking pockets; I waited that day to see if he would commit a felony; Walford did not attempt a pocket at all.</p>
               <p>ANDERSON's Defence. The gentleman never cautioned me - I am as innocent as a child unborn.</p>
               <p>WALFORD's Defence. I was only passing by, and just touched it with my umbrella.</p>

            . I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in; the prosecutor charged her with robbing him of 5s. 6d. - she said she knew nothing about it, and had only 2s. about her; I found 2s. in her pocket, but felt something lumpy in the corner of her pocket, and found in a part, sewed from the rest, a half-crown and three shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The watchman who took her is not here? A. No, she said something about the prosecutor spraining her wrist - he denied it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I was going through Coleman-street, to Crooked-lane, when the prosecutor passed me - he then turned round, and followed me; he spoke of the lateness of the night; I said I had been at work all day, and was going to sit up with an elderly lady; when we turned into Princes-street he asked me to cross to the Bank side - I told him No, I would not, I liked the light side best; when he seized hold of my arm, and was guilty of the most unbecoming liberty; he sprained my wrist, I am a cripple in it at this time; I screamed out for the watchman, but he did not come to my assistance - my prosecutor called, and he came immediately, when the prosecutor accused me of robbing him of 5s.; when he came to the watch-house he said 5s. 6d. - I had 7s. 6d. in my pocket, (which was one I had not worn for many years, my other being wet) - it had been used for cleaning irons. A few years back I kept a boarding and lodging-house at Walworth, and had a lady, a niece of Lady Melbourne's, lodging with me, for whom I used to market, and had made that division in the pocket to separate her money from mine; I had that evening received 2s. 6d. for a waistcoat I had made at Hackney, and 4s. for a pair of trousers in Hoxton, and some little repairs in Paul-street, 1s. 3d., making together 7s. 9d., which accounts for the money found in my pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you have a private-mark on them? A. No; some of them are numbered, but I speak to them by their appearance; they are differently formed though so much alike; I do not make them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The same maker might make others? A. Yes; but they have been in my possession for some years; one is marked on the brass, but not by me; I do not swear positively to them by the mark - here is 8 on one and 17 on another - that is not very common; I never observed it before on burnishing tools.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Colwell. My brother delivered this tea-pot to me - I can see the remains of the mark N and X on it now - it is a private mark of my own, to tell the invoice price, which was 5s. - we have a discount off that.</p>
               <p>MR. COLWELL. In consequence of information from Dodd, I went to the prisoner's shop in Tottenham-court-road, on the 25th of August, with three officers, and saw the prisoner - it was the Monday morning after the Saturday that the tea-pot was bought - the officers searched the premises, and found several things of mine which were marked, and brought them away - I left several which I knew to be mine, but they were not marked; I brought away another tea-pot, on which I could discover the mark, though it had erasures on it, and the original wrapper which had been on it in the shop - I know the wrapper, from the number which corresponds with the number on the tea-pot - here is N X on it - that was on it when found; I have not the least doubt of this, and the one bought by Dodd, being mine; here is a snuffer-tray - the same alteration has been attempted on that; the original mark was I E; there are two or three more marks made to obliterate it; here is a nursery lamp with the same obliteration - I cannot discern the original mark on that: here are a parcel of cocks which I know to be mine by the wrapper they are in - there is W H on them, and R N; they are marked singly - the wrapper was turned inside out when I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110075"/>them, with the writing inside; here is a cock I can speak to decidedly, it was marked E of - there has been an attempt to obliterate it, but there is enough for me to know it; I know these cocks to have been in my possession, and I should think they were never sold; here is one of Chubb's patent locks, No. 1323, which is the number in my invoice - I never remember selling it; here is a parcel of stove screws - they have an original mark on them - other marks have been added to confuse them, but I know my original marks - they are in a paper which also has my mark on it; here are some more screws - the original mark has been f p - it has been altered into a T; another parcel of screws, which were marked f p, is now altered to T R; here is a salt-cellar, marked f a; a set of fire-irons, which I know by the pattern, but the marks are taken off by emery paper - they were bought of a particular maker, and are a pattern we generally keep; another pair of fire-brasses, the original mark was F R X- I can swear positively to them; another pair have a mark taken off the place where I mark my goods; here are three other pairs, the marks on which are taken out - the goods were produced by the prisoner; I shewed him several parcels as they were found - he said he had had them a long while in his house; I shewed him these six cocks which were in paper, and asked how long he had had them - he said for some years; I said that was quite impossible from the bright appearance of them - he said "You know they keep bright for a long time if kept in paper;" I took them up, and seeing my mark on the bottom of the paper, I said I knew fully that he had not had those in his possession six months, as they had not been in mine so long; he told me he had bought the goods at Braid's sale; I believe there was a sale of Braid's stock about four years ago; he particularly spoke of having bought these cocks there, and said he had bought all the goods at sales generally; I had no dealing with Braid; I had the prisoner taken to Bow-street; he gave an account there of how he got them.</p>
               <p>MR. WOODS. I am clerk to the Magistrates of Bow-street-office, and took the examinations in this case. I did not take down one word that the prisoner said - it is not the practice.</p>

               <p>MR. COLWELL. He said he had bought them of a person named Ward, and then said Harry Ward. (Henry Ward, my servant was tried here yesterday.) I believe in answer to a remark of Sir Richard Birnie's, he said"I bought them all generally of Ward;" I afterwards saw Ward at Bow-street, and the prisoner recognized him as the man he bought them of - I did not mention the tea-pot he had brought to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were there a great variety of articles at the prisoner's shop? A. Yes; it was chiefly filled with old cranks - there were some other things of the same description as mine; I have two persons who serve in my shop besides myself - I sell my goods with the private-marks on them, and cannot swear I never sold the tea-pot; the six cocks in the paper I speak to from the paper, but two others are marked on the cocks - I speak to them decidedly; the paper has certainly been in my shop - I speak to the lock by the number, I did not take the number down myself; we never sell stove-screws - there is a private-mark on the paper, but not on the screws: there is generally a difference in stove-screws, I can tell mine from another make - I asked him about the fire-brasses, and these curtain bands, as I knew them by the pattern, he said he thought they came with other things from the sale - Braid's was the only sale he mentioned; he did not mention Ward's name at his own house - he said at Bow-street, that he bought that lock of Ward; Sir Richard Birnie asked where he got several other things, he said "I bought them of Harry Ward;" he said so of the fire-irons and cocks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were all the things produced at Bow-street? A. They were; he said he gave 34s. for the lock - he might buy it much cheaper at Chubb's.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You do not know the cocks, but the paper - do you send out the paper with cocks? A. No; if the paper had been with its right side out, I could instantly have told what cocks they were - I know the lock from the number, for I was one of the first who had Chubb's locks, and it is an early number; the mark on the paper of screws was outside, and a pattern-screw tied outside - I had missed the curtain bands about six months ago, and had not sold them; I never knew of Ward having sold him any things, he was not authorized to do so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you sold six cocks together, should you send the paper with them? A. I might then, but do not remember selling six together - I may have thrown aside my papers as waste when the goods have been sold; it is often done - mine is a large business; I could not miss these goods without taking stock - Ward's name is Henry, he called him Harry familiarly; Ward was present during part of the examination - I never sell stove-screws, and do not think others do, they are for use in the business; I never knew an ironmonger sell them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Colwell to Scoltock's shop, I know it was his house, I had seen him before, and knew him: I told him I had a warwant to search for property which Mr. Colwell suspected to be there - he was behind the counter, and told us to go on with the search for he had nothing but what belonged to him: I searched and found a good many things - all Mr. Colwell claimed were laid together; and when I asked the prisoner where he bought them, he told me he bought them of a man who hawked them about - I did not ask him the man's name, he said he should know him again if he saw him; these goods were in his presence at the time - I heard the conversation between Mr. Colwell and him about the cocks; he said that parcel of six cocks had been in his possession a long time, and he believed he bought them at Braid's sale - there was a great quantity of all sorts of ironmongery about the shop, fire-irons and cocks; at Bow-street, he said he had given 24s. or 34s. for the lock, but it had been so long in his possession, he could not call to mind the sum; I think he said he had it two years, I am pretty sure he said so - the brass-irons, and other things, he said he bought of Ward: Ward was brought in, and he said he was the man, and that he had bought the lock of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was Mr. Colwell in the shop when you were? A. Yes, all the time; and could hear all that passed.</p>

            . I was formerly in Mr. Colwell's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110076"/>employ; Henry Ward was also in his service - I saw him take a set of common steel fire-irons one evening up to Scoltock's shop in Tottenham-court-road, I went with him - they were similar to those produced; he came out without them, and shewed me 3s. - they were Mr. Colwell's irons; I think it was about two years ago - I went with him again very shortly after that, and he took six beer cocks - it might be a week or more after he took the fire-irons; Fryett had brought the cocks down from the shop - I think they were taken away loose, not in paper; Ward took them into Scoltock's shop, came out without them, and brought 6s. out in his hand - I never went to the shop after that; I recollect this patent lock - I know Ward had one of these from Mr. Colwell's; I saw him take it out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner near Mr. Colwell's shop? A. Yes, two or three times; he came and knocked at the iron rails, Ward went out to him - I saw which way he went, and Ward followed him; I was examined at Bow-street, and was locked up with Scoltock and Ward afterwards - Ward grumbled, and said to Scoltock,"You know you only gave me 5s. for the lock;" I did not hear what passed further - Ward had told me in the prisoner's hearing, that it was the same lock as what I had to do with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you go and tell your employer what had been done? A. No; I was taken up and examined at Bow-street - I was out on bail; I was at the bar yesterday, and was let off - I believe evidence was offered; I do not know anything about it, but I was acquitted.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. After you were at the bar, did any witness stand were you do now? A. No - I told Mr. Colwell about the fire-irons before yesterday - I surrendered here yesterday.</p>
               <p>MR. CHARLES CHUBB. I know this patent lock by the number to be one I sold Mr. Colwell; here is an entry in our books made by my father, who is at Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>The Court called on Mr. Adolphus to elect on what article he proceeded, and the six beer cocks were fixed on.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to THOMAS DODD. Q. Do you mean to say you can tell the beer cocks, which you say were taken to Tottenham-court-road? A. I do not mean to say I can swear to them - I saw the cocks; there were six.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw the cocks taken out of Mr. Colwell's passage by Ward; they were carried to Scoltock's by Ward, who came out with 6s. in his hand? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. How do you know he did not receive a great deal more? A. I cannot say; only that is what was in his hand.</p>
               <p>The Record of Ward's conviction was here read.</p>
               <p>JOHN UPSON. I was examined on Ward's trial - he is the person I saw at Bow-street, and of whom the prisoner spoke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the things conscientiously, thinking them honestly come by - this man represented himself to me to be in business in Belton-street, and that it was the remainder of his stock; I gave a fair and honourable price for it - he was formerly a master smith in Belton-street: the fire-irons are from the country.</p>

I have two certificates, which I have compared with the parish registers of Hackney and Chatham and found them correct - I apprehended the prisoner on the 27th of July; he was given in charge by his first wife, at Chelsea; I told him the charge - he said he had long expected it, and the reason he had married his second wife was that he had a respect for her, and did not wish her to be called a prostitute - his second wife is not here.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I freely admit having fallen into errors of losing property, but I do declare solemnly, as to secreting money for my own benefit, I have not done. On the day in question I had the east end of the town to collect from - two persons are generally sent there, and in order to make the best of my time, I hurried myself; it was very hot - I went without anything till four o'clock; I had then got all my accounts but two, and felt myself so extremely exhausted, I sat down, and suffered myself to be betrayed by drinking an extra pint of ale, which got the better of my nerves - I did not know what I was doing, nor do I at the present moment, if it is the last word I have to utter, know where I lost the property. I have been a tradesman in London sixteen years, and never had my character called in question: and am sorry I should fall into this error from my own weakness, but Mr. Higgins. Jun. knew if I drank too much what was the effect. I have a wife and five children, who I have brought up respectably.</p>

On the 23d of July I was lodging in Jewin-street; I accompanied a friend in a coach to the Peacock public-house at Islington; we then strolled about the place, and went into the Belvidere gardens about nine o'clock, played a game or two at skittles, then went into the house and staid till near twelve o'clock, when I left alone - I went down Goswell-road as I thought, but understand I went Clerkenwell way; it was a dark night, and the prisoner accosted me - it might be in Aldersgate-street; he asked where I was going - I said home; he said which way, and I said to Jewin-street; he got hold of my arm, and said he should be glad to walk with me; I said I did not wish him to put himself out of his way, I could walk myself; he said he lived that way and would walk with me; I said very well; and we walked arm-in-arm; in coming down Aldersgate-street I met a gentleman at the corner of Jewin-street, who said, "Is this <placeName id="t18280911-107-crimeloc555">Jewin-street</placeName>

Yes, said he; I went and knocked at my own door, and was immediately thrown down in the street by the prisoner; the gentleman had followed us up the street, and walked past us before I was thrown down, and got ten or twelve yards behind us just as I was in the act of falling, after I had knocked at the door; the gentleman ran up and said,"Have you been robbed?" I said, not that I knew of; he said, "Feel in your pocket;" I felt, and my handkerchief and gloves were gone; the prisoner ran away, and the gentleman pursued, calling Stop thief! he was stopped somewhere in Aldersgate-street and brought back to me by the watchman before I got in, and we went to the watch-house; my handkerchief and gloves were found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you a warehouse of your own at Manchester? A. Certainly I have, in Dickenson's-court; I was there last in June - my business has been going on there since; I believe I had not been in London for ten years before; my friend is not here - he lives at Manchester; the prisoner accosted me about twelve o'clock; I was not quite sober nor quite drunk, merely merry.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is not true that you solicited this man's help to lead you along? A. Certainly I did not - I cannot tell where he accosted me, I believe it was in Aldersgate-street; I think I left the Belvidere before twelve o'clock - I do not know the time; I had a watch but no money - I spent it all.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, were you not standing in a state of drunkenness and helplessness on Mutton-hill when this man came up to you? A. I tell you it was no such thing; I felt him suddenly feel my waistcoat pocket in Aldersgate-street; I did not fall till I got home - that I swear; I asked him to go in doors when I got home, and if I had got him in, I should have taken a little examination.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no watchman to give him to in your way. A. They are gentlemen I do not wish to fall into the hands of.</p>

            . On the night in question I was coming home from the Theatre, and saw the prosecutor at the corner of Jewin-street - the prisoner had hold of his arms; Hudson was rather intoxicated, and was rather pulling to get away from him; I heard Jewin-street mentioned - I stopped and said, "Is this Jewin-street?" they said Yes; they went on together; I thought from the prisoner's appearance that they were friends, but the prisoner said, "Come along, we are all right Sir!" and his saying Sir, I thought perhaps it was not so; I followed them, and in the way there was a scaffolding, and about ten yards from that is his lodging - hearing one of them knock, I thought I would walk past, and as I went by I heard Hudson say, "Will you come in, and have something to drink?" The prisoner said "No - I have seen you safe home Sir;" I passed about twelve yards, and looking back, saw him push the prosecutor into the middle of the road; I immediately ran back, and said, "Have you hurt yourself Sir?" he made no answer; I then said, "Has he robbed you of anything?" he said "He is a regular thief;" I then called Stop thief! the street was quite clear - the prisoner heard me, and must have been aware that I was the person who followed him - he ran nearly a quarter of a mile, from Jewin-street and I after him, the watchman took him several paces off; he was taken to Hudson, who was still at his door - the watchman examined his fob, but he had puthis watch-seals in; I saw the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110080"/>soner searched at the watch-house, and the handkerchief was found in his hat, and a note was taken out of his breeches pocket with Hudson's name on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had not the watchman to put his hand to feel if the prosecutor had his watch safe? A. I do not think he had; I was very near them till they got to the door; the prosecutor said at the watch-house that the prisoner had put his hand into his waistcoat pocket; he did not say so in the street; I was about twelve yards off when he was pushed down; the prisoner must have seen me pass, but there is a turning two yards further; I am a law-stationer - my office is in Mitre-court, Fleet-street; it is not my office, but Mr. Furlong's; I have a little business of my own - I live in Old-street - this was my road home: it was about a quarter past one o'clock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. No objection was made by the prisoner to be searched? A.

               <p>The prisoner in his Defence, which was partly inaudible, stated, that he had seen the prosecutor leaning against the railings on Clerkenwell-green intoxicated and had assisted his home, that when they got to Jewin-street he insisted on his going in, which he refused; but the prosecutor endeavoured to pull him in, upon which he forced himself from him; that on the road they fell and their hats came off; he picked his own up, and thinking the handkerchief had fallen out of it took that also, but had never seen the gloves or the note; but if he had the note, he muat have picked it up conceiving it to be his own; he stated himself to have an income of nearly 500l. a year, and could have no motive to commit a robbery.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in Leather-lane. On a Wednesday night in July, I was going for some medicine for my son, who was very ill; it was twelve o'clock or half past when I went out; I came across Ray-street, Clerkenwell, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor - the prosecutor was much intoxicated, dreadfully so, he could not stand; he was close to the rails just by a small ironmonger's shop; the prisoner, who I thought I had some knowledge of, made me stay to look at him, fearing the prosecutor would be robbed - he had a watch and umbrella, his seals hung out from his fob, and his hat fell off; he asked the prisoner to take him to Jewin-street, City; I did not understand what the prisoner said, for I was in a burry: I saw them go away together - the prisoner picked his hat up, gave it to him, and they went up the Green together: the prisoner lead him - he could not stand</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have robbed him in the road about the Charter-house, and then run away very well? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he not say he had bought them in Rag-fair? A. No; he said the two in his hat were his own, and at the second examination he said one his father's initials in the middle - there was another letter besides Y in the middle; I know his father is a respectable man.</p>

I am awake to that," and went to sleep again - Paveling came to me and said "Look out;" I kept my eye on the prisoner and saw him put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket and take some silver out, but what it was I cannot say - Paveling came and said "I want to speak to you;" I went out with him into the passage: he asked if I had seen it - I said he had better acquaint his master; he said he had, but he did not chose to interfere - his name is Lennox; he keeps the Bell, Bell-yard, Gracechurch-street - during this time the prisoner came out, asked for a candle, and said he was going to the privy - I saw him go to the cellar and return, and Jackson returned; they both went in on the same side of the box, but did not go near the prosecutor again; they asked for another pot of half-and-half and asked me to drink; I said if I did I would pay part; I paid for a pint - they then said they would have another pint, and that the sailor should pay for it when he awoke; I said I would have nothing to do with that, and called for a pint for myself - they drank theirs and said they would have another, and the sailor should pay for it; the waiter said if he was to pay for it he must awake him; he roused him up and told him there was a pot of half-and-half to pay for; he put his hand into his right-hand pocket and pulled out a note, he turned it over to his left hand pocket, put his hand into his pocket again, and said something about half-and-half - he rapped his arm on the table and said he did not like such tricks: Paveling said "If you have silver why not pay for it out of that;" he said "I have no silver, it is gone," and then threw down a sovereign - I had seen the prisoner take the silver out of his pocket: I believe I left the house first.</p>

On the 15th of July I was sent for to the prosecutor's; Miss Smith told me in the prisoner's presence to search her box, saying she had lost some articles and suspected her - the prisoner said it was her box and opened it herself: a ring, seal, three books, and some papers were found in it, which I produce.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. These books are what I have for my children - the ring and seal are my daughter's: I have five daughters and four sons.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long has the prisoner sat there? A. For three months - the fruit people are considered a great nuisance; the Warden has tried every means to keep them away - there are other fruit women there, but nobody was on the box but the prisoner; they sat down by the side of the wall - I only know the prisoner moved the trunk and was on it at eight o'clock and nobody else: I know the other women who sit there by sight.</p>

Scotts's carts drove up; Tilbury and Collins drove the two first carts, and Hawes, (who is since dead) drove the third; they were coming from Paddington to Shepherd's-bush, loaded with brees - behind each cart was a sack, which contained corn, as I thought; they stopped at the Red Lion public-house - each man took his sack down, filled their nose-bags, and hung them to the horses' heads; Tilbury had a much larger quantity than the rest; I should think full a bushel - during this time, Pratt, the ostler came up; Tilbury gave him his sack, he took it away into the stable; I waited till they went away - and did not apprehend them, having nobody to assist; they were all within three yards of each other, and followed Pratt up to the house; the cart was about ten yards from the stable; I got up and followed Pratt to the stable, then went back and laid down again - they went into the stable, and afterwards into the house; I stopped till they went away - which was about a quarter-past five o'clock; but did not go into the stable; the sack has never been found.</p>

On Saturday night, the 31st of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110087"/>August, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was in Peter-street, Cow-cross, going home to Attfield-street, Goswell-street; I am labourer to Mr. Burgess - I was not quite sober - I knew what I was about; I had two half-crowns and a penny-piece in my right-hand breeches pocket; the prisoner, who was quite a stranger, came up, and wanted to see me home; I said I wanted nobody to see me home; - he said "Oh no, I know you - I will see you home;" I said "I did not want him; and at the corner of <placeName id="t18280911-132-crimeloc687">Peter-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He said he had two half-crowns? Q. Yes: I had been to Fleet-market to buy some water cresses for my daughter, who was ill; I had been to Gray's-inn-lane before that, and had part of a pot of beer among three of us; I went to no other public-house, and drank nothing else till I got to the Cock in Fleet-market; this was about half-past eight o'clock; I staid there about an hour - I went no where else, but stood in the market talking to one and another for perhaps two hours - I had two glasses of gin at the Cock, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. That would hardly have made you tipsy? A. Why, if a person has no bread all day, and his children ill, he is soon made tipsy; I had eat nothing all day but a mouthful of bread in the morning; I was not drunk - I was not lying on my face in the street; two women were going to fight in the market - I held up my hand to part them, and got it scratched; I did not know them - nobody helped me up; I know Mr. Gooch helped me up by Saffron-hill - he did not help me up; I saw no gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there was not another gentleman helping you up when you were lying in the mud? A. I was not laying at all, I was never down - I was walking when the prisoner offered his assistance; nobody else came to assist me that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The women were fighting in the market, not in Peter-street? A. No - I never saw the prisoner till I got to Saffron-hill.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on my beat between twelve and one o'clock on this night; I saw the prisoner and prosecutor turn the corner of Peter-street and Saffron-hill - he had his arms round the prosecutor's waist; I was walking to and fro by my box, opposite to Peter-street, and saw them together for a minute, but took no notice till the prosecutor called me over, and said "This man will not let me go home;" I said to him"Why not let the man go, if you know nothing of him;" he said he knew him perfectly well, and would see him home, and how dare I insult him - that he knew him, and had picked him up drunk, and that he lived in Baltic-street; the prosecutor certainly was not sober, but knew what he was about, and charged him with robbing him of two half-crowns and a penny-piece; the prisoner said"Do you suppose a person of my respectability would go to rob a man like that;" I replied I knew nothing of his respectability, he was charged with felony, and must go to the watch-house; the prosecutor walked very well to the watch-house, and was able to state how he was robbed; as the prisoner was going to be searched, he put his hand into his pocket, took out two half-crowns with an old penny-piece, and gave it to the watch-house man - he was searched further, and no other money found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner walk with you to the watch-house? A. He did - it is about three hundred yards; I did not take hold of him - I had no lantern.</p>
               <p>Q. Walking three hundred yards, he had an opportunity to get rid of the penny-piece? A. I kept my eye on him - there was a light at the watch-house; I saw the prosecutor's face - it was as it is now - it was not scratched all over - it did not appear to me to be scratched; I never heard him say so; he did not say he was robbed till I had been up a minute or a minute and a half - while there was an altercation about his knowing him, he put his hand to his pocket, and said he was robbed of his money - the prisoner was sober, and could see me, and did not attempt to escape.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were close to him? A. Yes, I walked by his side, as I should by any other prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then is it true he was searched afterwards, and no money found? A. Not to my knowledge - Watson had left the watch-house when I locked him up - he could not have been searched in his presence; the prosecutor said nothing about the penny-piece till I produced it - he and Watson both went away together - the prosecutor's face looked a little dirty, as a man might leave work - I saw no scratch on it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see it run over? A. No. I said I had lost two half-crowns and a penny-piece, before it was found; I will swear that - when I came out the watchman went to his beat, and I home; I never saw him before.</p>

On the Sunday morning in question I saw Odel laying on his back on the pavement, and took him up; the prisoner, who I never saw before, helped me up with him - we brought him on to my own door; he said he lived in Baltic-street, St, Lukes'; he seemed quite tipsy, and could not speak or walk; I have not seen the prisoner since, nor heard him make his defence.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What made you out so late? A. I happened to be out with a friend - I had been to Leather-lane; I am a journeyman baker, and work for Mr. Dick; I parted with the prisoner just opposite my own door - I did not tell him where I lived; he found me out quite by accident, through a friend of his who came to me where I was at work, three weeks ago; he found me out in Norwich-court - I had parted with the prisoner there about a quarter-past two o'clock; the prosecutor could not speak or stand at first - he came too when we led him a little way; the prisoner said he lived in St. Luke's, and would see him home; I am certain of the time, for I looked at the clock when I went in; I parted with them just opposite my door, and believe the prisoner saw me go in.</p>

On this Sunday night I was lying down at my father's door, and saw him run into the next house - there was another with him, whose face I did not see; the prisoner ran as hard as he could, with his right hand in his breeches pocket; the prosecutor came by two or three minutes afterwards, and said he had lost his watch and seals; there were some persons standing at the window; I was afraid they would come and beat me, or I should have told him what I had seen; I saw the prisoner again about ten minutes after; Mr. Pledger was gone; he came out of the house - he had the watch in his hand, and was shewing it to the persons who stood there; he said to them, "We have got it now - it is all right;" I had seen those persons before; they do not live about there; Mr. Pledger saw them when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110089"/>he came up, and they sent him the wrong way - about a dozen of them stood there; the prisoner went into Golden-lane, with the man who had run into the house with him.

               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you tell him it was about linen? A. Three or four men were round, and in that neighbourhood if I had told him the charge, he might have been rescued.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know his name? A.

Not to my knowledge; I saw him come in once and go out, but whether he cmae in again I do not know; I told the Magistrate he was not there; but I am perfectly satisfied now that he did come in once; I did not recollect it at the moment; he sat down in the room; I told the Magistrate he was not there to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear before the Magistrate, "I am sure my young master did not sit down?" A. He did not sit down; the whole of the evening the gentleman asked.</p>

Yes - the prosecutor lent it to you, and you returned it to him; I saw you turn up Cooper's-row with the bundle - there was nobody near, or I should have given you in charge; the knife was tried to the box at Lambeth-street, and fitted the lock.</p>

In Finsbury-place South; I saw him in the back yard as I came down stairs; there is no gaslight in the yard; there is a vacant ground there - it was a very stormy night, which every one may remember; there was no light there - it was between two and three o'clock; I swear to the man - I did not see his face till I got to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, did you not swear you saw that prisoner? A. Yes, because I saw him in the watch-house, and he was taken coming from the premises - I saw him in the yard, and called the watch and officers.</p>
               <p>Q. What enables you to distinguish that man more than any other? A. His back was towards me when he went over the wall.</p>

            . I live near Mr. Friedeberg. Early in the morning in question, at the back of the prosecutor's house I saw three men, and judging all was not right, I went down and mentioned it - they were close at the back of the premises, in a yard belonging to Mr. Turner; I saw three men; I went down stairs and communicated what I had seen to an officer; they went in pursuit of them, and took the prisoner - I cannot say he is one of the men I saw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him taken? A. No; it was a very stormy night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not so dark, it was impossible to distinguish one man from another? A. At first it was quite dark when I saw them, but not when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them, it was not possible to distinguish any man's features? A. Yes, it was at that time.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the watch. On the night in question, on going round the Circus, which is near Mr. Friedeberg's house, I was called over by the last witness, who informed me he had seen three men behind Mr. Friedeberg's house. I placed two watchmen round, and then went off to the watchhouse for assistance. I then proceeded round the corner of North Buildings, where I supposed they had got in, and staid till I got assistance, when an officer came up with a watchman - we proceeded to examine the ground - we broke open the door of a stone-mason's yard - could find nothing - we then jumped from there into the vacant ground, and continued searching there till ten minutes after three o'clock. We then spoke together, and agreed to leave the ground, placing two watchmen in the stonemason's yard to look out - we withdrew and had not got many yards before we heard rattles spring and a call of Watch! I was the first who came up to a folding-gate, which was fastened with a chain; I burst the chain open, and saw the prisoner coming towards the gate as if endeavouring to make his escape; I hallooed to my brother watchmen,"Here is one;" they immediately went into the stone-mason's yard; Burridge jumped over into the yard, where the prisoner was - he then made his escape towards the London Institution, but was taken by Burridge, and I saw the property found on his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you watching? A. From ten minutes past one o'clock to ten minutes past three - and at a quarter-past three, the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. If anybody has sworn the prisoner was caught in less than ten minutes, it is not true? A. He was caught within ten minutes after the rattles sprung; the information was given to me before the alarm.</p>

            . I am superintendant of the nightly watch. On the night of the 3d of July, I received information with my brother officers, that three men were supposed to be in this back ground. I got there five or ten minutes after two o'clock, and was in dilligent search, as the ground leads to a good many houses; I searched the stone mason's yard - a man might be concealed there for half an hour, and not be found; it was a heavy rain with thunder and lightning - we placed two men to watch, and as we went away, there was a cry of "There he goes - there is one on the wall." I ran back to Northbuildings - we had broken open the stone-mason's yard before; the prisoner came in contact with the waste ground, but seeing us two there, he ran along the wall - I jumped over, and caught him as he endeavoured to escape from the wall - I caught him on the dead wall of the Institution; he then had the bottom of the silver candlestick in his hand - he said he would make no resistance if I would not hurt him; I said I would not - I found the property on him; he had thirteen yards of linen wrapped round his body - my brother officer found a pint pot, a half-pint pot, a milk jug, several spoons, and different property on him.</p>

Yes - I was present when the prisoner was brought to the Mansion-house, and swore to the property at the first examination; he was remanded for my sister to swear to the cloth, which I did not know - I did not say I could not swear to the plate because it was not marked; I said nothing about marks - the window was cut, the latch drawn back, and so they had got in at the window.</p>

            . On the 3d of September, I was at the end of a Court, in Whitecross-street; I heard a cry of Stop thief! but being infirm, I did not step up - the prisoner ran past me about twenty yards, then put his hand across his breast, took the bundle from his left hand and then threw it on the ground; he was taken almost immediately - he ran against a house that was being repaired and was stopped.</p>

He ought to have accounted to me that day, or the next, for this sum, but never did - I repeatedly asked him if he had received it after that time; he said he had not; he left me on the 16th of June, and on the very day I discharged him, I asked him if he had received Mrs. Bell's money - he said he had not; I said "I had proof of it;" and then he said he had received it, and would pay me - he might receive 3l. or 4l. in a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you and he enter into some agreement about commission? A. Yes; he was to have a commission on all sums received - he introduced me to ten or twelve new customers - I think not more; he was to have ten per cent. on what new customers he obtained.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you put him into a mad-house? A. I did; I assisted in causing him to be put there; he went on the 16th of June, the day he was discharged - I thought him mad; I had not observed any symptons, and indeed at that time I did not know that he was mad, only from the account of his friends - he had said a number of silly and foolish things; I thought it not right to lock a man up as a felon, and consented to his being placed in an asylum - he was discharged from there in three weeks, the surgeons considering there was not a single sympton of madness in him; I believe I was under a mistake regarding his insanity.</p>

On the 6th of September, the prisoner came to the shop - I did not know him before - he wanted to toss for ginger-beer: he then came up to where I was selling ginger-beer, and said he wanted change for a half-sovereign - he afterwards said he must have change, and threw the money on the board - I took it up, and considering it to be a gilt sixpence, I refused to take it - my man took it up afterwards. I am not certain that the prisoner is the man - he said it was a half-sovereign; he was taken up outside my door - the watchman was in the house at the time he was turned out - I do not think they took him immediately - I understood they let him go; I did not see him again till he was at Guild-hall - I cannot say when that was; nor whether he is the man.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Kilburn. On the 14th of September, about nine o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoners about four miles from Pope's, in company with two more - Trwyett had a bag; I asked what he had got there; he said what was his own property - that he had bought and paid for it; I found a dead goose in the bag - its head was cut across; it appeared to have been dead about four hours; I called a watchman - we secured the prisoners; the other two ran away.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 13th of August the prosecutrix came to me, between one and two o'clock - she told me she had been stopped by three girls in Parliament-street, as I understood; I asked where the girls were - she pointed to Martin, and said, "There is one of them going down to the Horse Guards, that is the one who struck me and robbed me;" I took her - Martin said several times she knew nothing about it; when we got to the corner of King-street, Storer and another girl were coming up as if from Downing-street, towards us - they said, "My dear, what is the matter?" the prosecutrix pointed to them and said, "That is the girl who has got my property, take her in charge" - I said to the other girl, "You must go with me to the watch-house;" she said she would, and she went as far as Garden-lane, and then ran away down there - it was rather a dark night, and she got away; Storer was in front of me, and struck the prosecutrix several times - I told her I would knock her down if she did not be quiet, and at that time the other got away; we went on to the watch-house, and gave charge of Martin - when I came out I saw Storer near the door; I thought she might be the person who had received the property, and desired her to go in that the prosecutrix might see her - she went in; the prosecutrix said she did not think she was the girl who had her property, but she knew she struck her when Martin robbed her; she seemed to have no doubt of that, and gave charge of her.</p>

            . I was night-constable at the watch-house when Martin was brought in; Storer was brought in then, and the prosecutrix gave charge of her as being the person who struck her while Martin robbed her - Storer then took hold of her bonnet, and tore it all to pieces - the crown of it had been broken in before; this is a part of the ribbon which was round the prosecutrix's neck when she came to the watch-house.</p>

At half-past twelve o'clock at night I was drinking in the Heathcock public-house, and took home a girl who was tipsy; as I came back I saw this prisoner in charge of a watchman - I said, "Sally, what is the matter;" she said, "I am given in charge" - I followed them, and saw a girl behind with a bit of ribbon in her hand, which she said was part of the sandal of her shoe - I staid outside the watch-house, and the watchman came up and asked me to go in; I went in, and was given in charge; this girl walks Charing-cross, and I walk the Strand - we are both unfortunate girls.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is not the prisoner half-witted? A. No, not to my knowledge - I did once drink with him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was with Lilly when he searched the house, and when he found the prisoner, as he has stated - we asked him if there was any other person with him; he said No - he said he bought the chisel at ten o'clock at night, and entered the premises at half-past eleven; he said he bought the chisel for the purpose of entering the premises - I cannot say whether he said to rob them; he said had Mr. Woolrych been in town, he should have taken something, but not much; but had he known he was out, he should not have taken anything.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell this to the Magistrate? A. I made the same statement, and the evidence was read over to me: Mr. Fitzpatrick, the Magistrate's clerk, asked me the questions - the prisoner stated he had been in the house from half-past eleven till half-past two o'clock; he did not tell me he never had a notion of stealing anything, but it was merely to frighten Goodwin; I never heard that expression - he did not say in my hearing that he never meant to rob the house: I did say, when we found him in the privy, that I wondered what brought him there, if he did not mean to rob - I did not know him before; he did not say how he knew that Mr. Woolrych was not at home - the other watchman was with me and heard what passed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The watchman asked me what I intended to do to the house; I told him it was not with an intent of robbing at all, but I did not say a word of Mr. Woolrych's being in the country - I had no intention of robbing; I knew there was nothing in the house.</p>

            . I was going up the row with Croft, and hearing a piece of work we went back, and got against Tunny's door - I did not see the first of the piece of work, but I saw Tunny come out of the door with a piece of a bedstead, as it appeared to me, and he struck Rolfe over the head with it - he was very much covered with blood; Croft said it was a great shame, and went to take the stick out of his hand - he hit Croft on the arm and on the side; after a few minutes Croft got the stick from him - he then ran in doors, and fetched out an old rusty sword, as it appeared to be, and said that the first one that came near to him he would run him through - that was on the threshold of his own house, not in the passage; the street door of his house was open - I do not know whether it had been broken; I had before that seen him lying down near the step of his door - I believe Croft was then washing Rolfe's head at the next door but one; I did not see any person kick him - I was not in the house with Rolfe when he was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT to JAMES TUNNY. Q. Did you see this witness? A. Yes; she kicked me on the cheek as I lay on the ground; she lives with Croft - I am sure she is the person who kicked me, and she was fined 14s. for it at Queen-square; I did not come out with any bed-post - I had no sword in my hand at all; I could hardly draw my breath - there were people about me directly; I could not see who took my money - I had changed half-a-crown in the afternoon, and had 1s. 4d. in my pocket; the pocket was turned out - there was no fight between Callaghan and the prisoners - he only struck in his own defence, and I said it was a shame for two to be on one; I was then going back to my own door, and just as I got there they knocked me down - I have no doubt they intended to take my life; I never struck either of them at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ROLFE. There were two men taken up with that woman for breaking the door, and they had a fortnight each.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Kelly. On the 9th of August I was in the parlour, which looks into the shop; the prisoner came in for one pennyworth of paper, which I served him with - I did not see him take anything; but my mistress, who was in the room, did - he then turned to go out, and my mistress called Stop thief! I went after him and gave an alarm; at the corner of Sackville-street I saw him take something from under his coat and put it into his hat - he ran down Sackville-street and dropped two books; I took up one - I did not see him caught; he had just turned the corner of Churchpassage, but I am sure he is the person - some persons picked up the books and gave them to me, I gave them to the officer: I had not sold them - nobody had been to the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me put the books into my hat? A. I saw you put something into your hat - I swear you are the person.</p>

               <p>MR. KELLY. These are my books; they have my private-mark on them - they had been on my counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A young gentleman came up to me and said I had got two books; I said "What do you mean" - I had no book about me; he said he would take me to the place they had been stolen from - I said I would go any where, and as we were going back, a girl came up and brought a book, which she said I had dropped in Sackville-street - we met the constable; the girl then said I had stolen three books - I have since learned they belonged to Mr. Kelly, in Vigo-lane, but I do not know it; the girl says she lost sight of the person who stole the books, and if so, she might very easily mistake any young man for me. <rs id="t18280911-171-verdict871" type="verdictDescription">

On the morning of the 18th of August, at seven o'clock, I was standing about, after leaving duty, I saw the three prisoners pass me, near Grafton-place, coming towards London, by the road from Finchley - I stopped Matthews first, with this green bag; I found these two bits in it - I asked where he got them, he said he had been in the country for them; a gentleman had sent him for them - I left him in custody at a public-house and went after the other two; I took them and found this chisel concealed down Watson's overalls - they had both some apples about them: the other two had got about one hundred yards on before I took them; they were walking - the same bits were shewn to Mr. Stotton on the Tuesday, I think it was - I went to Finchley and fitted this chisel to the window; it corresponded with the marks exactly, and I have no doubt it had been used to break it open - there was some pitch on the window and there is some of it on the chisel - these are the bits.</p>

Mr. Bailey then left the church and went away, and we went away also; we got nearly to the end of the street, when we saw the clergyman returning on the opposite side of the way - he called us back, and he performed the ceremony from where he left off; the ring was put on her finger, and she came home to her mother's house; I stayed there till eleven o'clock at night, when I left them there together; I saw the prisoner the next day, but I have no recollection of seeing Jones that day - I saw him a day or two afterwards, I cannot say how often; I saw him afterwards, it might be three or four times; I saw them together at her mother's two or three days afterwards - they appeared to me as man and wife; William Jones is still alive - he was at the hearing at the office on the 2d of August; I did not sign the book because I am no scholar, and Mr. Bailey said he should take it on himself, and the sexton and clerk signed it - we had a certificate the same day; I am sure the business about the ring took place during the ceremony.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is she not a very respectable person? A. Yes; I do not recollect that the clergyman suggested that the banns should be put up again; he suggested that the sexton and clerk should sign the register - I believe the man and woman could neither of them write, they both put their mark - I knew of Jones living apart from her soon after the ceremony, but I did not know of her going by the name of Miller; John Hogg was her last husband, and he is here, and I did not know him.</p>

            . Q. Have you heard the account given by this witness? A. Yes; but it does not bring to my recollection their leaving the church; I know there has been such a circumstance as the clergyman quitting the altar, but I cannot say that that was the case in this wedding - I cannot recollect it, but I cannot say it did not happen; I have known a party to be sent away, and then brought back and the marriage completed.</p>
               <p>COURT to THE REV. MR. BAILEY. Q. You have heard what the last witness has said? A. Yes; I have taken particular pains to recollect, and it does not occur to me that the parties left the church - I will not swear they did not; I recollect that I was convinced she did not describe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110105"/>herself a spinster intentionally; I do not recollect any woman being there at all.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames Police. I apprehended the prisoner at her mother's house in St. Mary, Rotherhithe, on the 28th of July, I think it was; I told her she was charged with marrying two husbands; she said she had only one; I said nothing to induce her to confess; she said her first husband was Miller, but he was dead, she said that about four years ago he went on board the Sally, Captain Sinclair, and that all hands were lost; she said she could prove that she had got some money for her child; when she got to the office, I asked if she knew anything about Jones - she said she did, but no one could say she had married him, but one woman, and that woman I might find if I could; when she saw the witness before the Magistrate, she said she was married, but Jones went one way and she went the other - this was at the examination; I showed her the copy of the register at the office; I do not know whether what she said was taken down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did Hogg apply to you about this? A. I think on the 27th; I got a warrant at his desire on the Saturday night, and executed it on the Monday.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know Jones? A. No, I have been married nine months; I did not know the prisoner in 1825 - I have seen Hogg write; I believe this to be his hand-writing, it is similar to his hand-writing which I have seen before - the prisoner had a little furniture; I know that her mother has been obliged to pay the rent of the house in which Hogg lived with her as his wife; she went by the name of Miller, and as a widow up to the time of her marriage with Hogg; she has one child by her first husband: I have known her altogether about three years, but have no recollection of her being said to be married to Jones in 1825 - I never knew a person of the name of Jones pretending to be her husband; I lived in the same house, but never saw a person of the name of Jones there, or claiming her as his wife.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother; she is twentytwo years of age - I remember Jones, and the circumstance of its being stated, that the ceremony of marriage had been performed; she came home that day and told me it was no marriage at all - Jones did not come home; she continued to live with me, in the name of Miller, in my house; she never went by the name of Jones, and was never from under my roof - Jones never lived with her as his wife; Hogg has made me pay the rent of the house he lived in since he took up the prisoner - he put a broker in and seized the goods which I had put in the place when they lived together; I paid six sovereigns for the rent.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did Jones live before he married your daughter? A. In the neighbourhood; he did not come with her from church, but he came there in the afternoon; I do not know what became of him that night - I left him in the house when I went to bed, about eleven o'clock, and saw no more of him till next day - my daughter was in the room with him when I went to bed; I do not know where he slept - she slept in the house with me, but not in the same bed; Jones was only about my house two nights, but there is no one can prove that they saw her and him go to bed, or in bed - he afterwards went to his work, and has been at his work; he lived in the neighbourhood, but never troubled her nor me either.</p>

God! I am dead man - if I had a hundred necks, I must lose them all;" he afterwards added "Let me go to Newgate quietly - don't put me into irons;" he then held up his hands, and said "Melton, Melton has ruined me! he has robbed me of upwards of 7,000l. in two years;" he might have said more, but I do not recollect it; we did not allow him to go on board, but we secured him; I had this £159 bill with me, and produced it to him; I said "Mr. Fenn, how is that you have been so inhuman as to use me so - I hope this acceptance is a good acceptance;" he looked at it, and observed "James Lucett I have known for years, you may rely on it as a very good acceptance - it is as good as a Bank note;" Mr. Vincent was by at the time, and he asked him the residence of the acceptor - he said "he lives at No. 1, South-parade, Queen's Elms, Old Brompton," which Mr. Vincent wrote on the back of the bill - (here it is;) nothing more was said about it, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Is not the Citybar twenty yards beyond your mother's house? A. No, it is opposite - the house is in the county; I have lived there fifteen years, and my mother has been carrying on business for thirty-five years; I have no interest in the business - I merely receive a salary; I am her representative in the business; I have known the prisoner a great length of time - I have not had many transactions with him; I have discounted many bills for him, which he took up, but they were forgeries; he never brought people to me to discount on my solicitation - this letter is my hand-writing; (read.)</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir - After no little persuasion, I have got the bill, and send it inclosed; likewise the silk handkerchiefs; if you will have a 200l. at Mr. Melton's for it to night, you will oblige me, and if you will look me out a nice little bill for 50l. at two months, this will save me half a crown; if you will also get another 100l. of Melton, for the one I sent back, it will rub all off."</p>
               <p>Witness. The fact was, I had some bills in my hands which Fenn gave me, and represented them as very good bills, but which I was dissatisfied with, and I wanted to have an acceptance of Melton for them; upon my oath, I did not discount these bills for myself, but for my mother - I had the use of her money, which he knew; they were never discounted on my own account; I had not the means when I discounted the bill in question I gave him the difference, deducting the discount; to the best of my knowledge I gave him the money for it at five per cent., but then he gave me another bill in payment for articles purchased - I sometimes gave him money, and sometimes a cheque; we had an account at a banker, in my name, by the advice of all parties; I solemnly state I have no share in the business - I never discounted at more than 5 per cent.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was it you found the prisoner at Calais? A. The latter end of March; we brought him to England, and he was taken to a lock-up house in Chancery-lane; he has been in custody ever since.</p>

I was employed by Mrs. Cook, and went to France with the last witness; we went to Paris for Peter Fenn, but did not find him there - we re-traced our steps to Calais, and found him in company with a man whose name I have learned is Hanbury, at Lawson's, the Crown hotel - we had been up six nights, and declined to go any further, or to let him go; Hanbury remained but a short time with us - they had got their trunks outside the house, and were going to the packet, which was to sail in about five minutes - they had had their breakfast; I told Mr. Lawson that Fenn's trunks must go in again, and we went up stairs, where the prisoner gave Hanbury a 5l. note: Hanbury left the hotel in about three minutes; when I first saw the prisoner, he appeared frantic - paralyzed, and I made a memorandum of what he said at the time; Mr. Cook was there the whole day, but I went to take a walk, as I had got Fenns passport, and I knew he could not leave; what the prisoner said was (reads) "Melton is my ruin - he has obtained 7,000l. of me in the last two years; I will go quietly to Newgate, only don't put me in irons - I will plead guilty, I shall then have about six weeks after I am condemned; I will be seen by no one - I will do as Fauntleroy did, and it will be over in a moment; I was coming to England to deliver myself up to justice;" I produced this bill to him, and asked him what it was - he said it was good, and I marked it "good" in pencil; I told him I doubted its being good, as it appeared to be all in one hand-writing; he said No, it was drawn upon his friend James Lucett, whom he said he had known for twenty years, (I think.) or a great many years, and it was as good as gold - I told him that Old Brompton was a very large place, and to give me the address of James Lucett - he gave it me, and I wrote it on the back of the bill, in his presence, No. 1, South-parade, Queen's Elms, Old Brompton - I came to England with him and Mr. Cook; I have since seen Mr. Lucett.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you the person who was examined yesterday. A. Yes: when he came to London he had not an opportunity of escaping. I gave him leave to go to the Hummums, but my brother watched him there - I did not tell him my brother was watching him; he could have attempted to escape, but he did not to my knowledge.</p>

            . I am not acquainted with the prisoner - this acceptance is not my hand-writing; I did reside at the place stated at the back of the bill. but I do not reside there now, nor did I on the 14th of December, 1827.(Bill read, see Indictment.)</p>
               <p>COURT to JOHN COOK. Q. Did your mother know of your discounting this bill? A. Yes; there was an account opened at the bankers' in my name, at the request of my mother, on account of her age, and at the request of our friends also - Fenn knew I acted for her.</p>
               <p>The prisoner here read the same Defence as on his former trial,(see page 710) and with reference to the case in question, stated that he had himself frequently discounted bills for Mr. Lucett, which were payable in Parliament-street; he added the agent from whom I received them brought me a blank acceptance of Lucett's, wishing me to draw it rather than him - having known Lucett for several years, I yielded, and became the drawer, thinking it was Mr. Lucett's acceptance. Vincent has said to day he sent his brother to watch me closely while I was at the Hummums; he can only have said that from hearing my defence yesterday - I still repeat that I was at liberty; the coachman who drove me from where they left me, to the Hummums, asked me if he had not better drive me at once to my private dwelling, or to any other place in the neighbourhood, as I told him I did not like to sleep at such a place as the Hummums; when I once asked Cook why the business was conducted in his mother's name, why her name did not appear in the bills as well as his own, he replied, "The business is my mother's, and should any of these bills prove bad, or he unpaid, if I cannot take them up, I can soon get white-washed in the Bench, and the business be my mother's still."</p>

On the 5th of September, at nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners standing by the lamp-post near my master's window - I observed them for about a quarter of an hour; they were walking about - I went up stairs to breakfast a little afterwards, leaving no one in the shop; I had seen the prisoners just as I went up stairs, which was about a quarter past nine o'clock - I locked the street door when I went up; about ten minutes after I had been up stairs I heard the cry of Stop thief! - I looked out at the window, and saw the prisoners pursued by the witness Scholey; I ran down stairs, and missed two diamond rings from the window - Scholey told me the direction they had taken- I followed them, and overtook them in Brunswick-square; Austin assisted me to take Cox - I then pursued Hilder; he had been stopped by a person, who immediately let him go, and he ran away - I told the person who had hold of Cox, to hold him fast, and I pursued Hilder; when I came up to him, he struck me two blows, but Prestage and I took him - I said he had broken our window and stolen some rings - he said, "Don't lay hold of my collar, take hold of my arm;" we then took them both to the watch-house in the square. Bird brought me five rings on a card, which I knew to be Mr. Newcomb's; and afterwards, when I got back, I received two cards of rings, which had been thrown into a shop - I knew them to be Mr. Newcomb's property; I had seen these rings safe in the morning before I went up to my breakfast; they were in the window - when I came down and missed them, the window was broken, but it was not broken when I went up stairs; I did not miss any more - the glass appeared to me to have been cut, and I found a piece of glass; some of the rings were near where the glass was cut, and some about a foot from it - the glass was not cut large enough for a hand to have been put in; I suppose the rings were got out with a wire - they were worth about 40l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you partner with your uncle, Mr. Newcomb? A. No: I had never seen the prisoner till that morning; the lamp-post is about four yards from the window - I did not see the prisoners searched; there were not many people running - there were not more than six running at the time these men were taken, and not more than a dozen about- I kept hold of Hilder, and went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHAMBERS. Q. How many people were standing at the lamp-post? A. Three; but one I could not swear to - ours is a common bowwindow; there is an immense number of people passing there - the shop is not separate from the house; the dwelling-house is over the shop; my uncle does not live there constantly, but he does live there.</p>

            . I am a licensed victualler, and live in Shoreditch. I have known the prisoner from five to six months, by his coming to my house - he is a labourer and a watchman at the Excise-office. Between nine and ten o'clock one evening, he came to me, and brought twelve half-crowns, and said "Mr. Grove, I wish you would take care of these for me;" "Very well (said I) do you know how many there are?" he said "Never mind, I will be back in ten minutes:" when he came back I said "Do you know how many there are?" "Not exactly" said he; said I there is 30s.: I cannot form any judgment when this was- I think I heard of this woman being robbed the next morning, but there was no inquiry about the half-crowns for several days; I had never received any money from him before - the prosecutrix lives about half a mile from me; I do not know what the prisoner's wages are - I have heard from him that he is paid every half quarter, but I do not know.</p>

I have a letter which I received from him, (I believe about a week after I received the money,) saying that he had been taken up, and desired me to send him 10s. by his friend Broadhurst, which I did, and here are the other half-crowns - I believe he has two children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at work at the Londondocks on the 22d of July - about half-past six o'clock I came home; I had not been in the house a minute when the prosecutrix came down, and said "I have been robbed" I said "God bless me, who could rob you:" "O dear," said she, "I am robbed" - "Let us go up stairs and see," said I; we went up, and I said "God bless me, you have been robbed," but I did not notice the door - we came down to the middle room, where there are two old women- I asked them if they saw any man go up stairs, they said No - I said "It is very odd you sit here, close to the door, and not hear anybody go up stairs:" my little girl looked out at my room door and said "Father, there has been three men up stairs," and I said to the old ladies, in the middle room, "There, don't you hear what Hannah says, that there has been three men here" - she said she did not hear it; I came down, and said to my girl "Go and fetch West, the officer, and I will have my room searched"- as soon as she was gone, my youngest daughter, who is six years old, said to me "Father, Hannah has brought down a red cloak, and it is under the bed;" I said "Get it out," she brought out the cloak and the gowns from under the bed, and gave them to Mrs. Cushion; and then she said she wanted some money; I asked what money - she said she had some money in a leather bag in a box, but that I never saw; I said "Don't make yourself uneasy, my pay-day is coming, and I will pay you every farthing she has taken from you."</p>
               <p>COURT to FRANCES CUSHION. Q. Did you point out the prisoner's room to the officer? A. Yes - that was the room he lived in; the little girl did not bring in any cloak while I was there - she took it from under the bed.</p>

            . I live in Union-row, Hackney. On the 2d of September, about twenty minutes before two o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another man coming from Mr. Routh's - about forty yards from the house; I stopped them coming up an avenue; the other man had nine ducks- he ran, and dropped them; I took up the ducks, but he escaped - the prisoner stopped, put his hand into his bosom and drew out something; I had desired them to stop - the prisoner said "What is the matter," and then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110110"/>drew this from his bosom; I followed the other man some distance, and the prisoner went towards Hackney - I lost the other man in a nursery-ground; he dropped the ducks in a field, and I took them up - that was about one hundred yards from where the prisoner and him had, been together: I took the ducks to Mr. Routh, and then went to the watch-house, where I saw the prisoner in custody, and am certain of his person - the moon shone full in his face; he was so near to me that I could have touched him- I can speak confidently to him from his features, and the manner in which his handkerchief was tied: when I went to the house, Mr. Routh came to the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If I were as near to him as he says I was, why did not he take me? Witness. I wanted the man with the ducks; I knew my brother watchman would take him from the sound of my rattle - what he drew out appeared to be a pistol.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in the New-cut. I saw the prisoner on the Monday morning - he offered some beading planes to me; I did not see anything else; just all that time the witnesses came in; I believe the prisoner said they were his own property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner was offering them to pawn? A. Yes, I had only asked what he wanted for them; there were a great many other people in the shop; it was between ten and eleven o'clock; we open at eight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is Charlotte-place, New-cut, where you live, from Belgrave-place? A. It must be two or three miles.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there not a name on those planes? A. Yes, no attempt has been made to erase the name.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am shopman to Mary Gilbert - she did live in Cockspur-street, Charing-cross; she is a widow- she is a goldsmith and jeweller. On the 31st of July I watched the shop window; I saw the two prisoners there: Mayston put his hand through a pane of glass, (which had been previously broken), and took hold of this case of articles; Bullock was close by him, and when he drew them out Bullock took them of him, they immediately parted- I ran and took Mayston, and my fellow-shopman took Bullock, and when he had got hold of him I saw him throw two of these articles into the road; they were taken to St. Martin's watch-house - the articles are worth 50s.</p>

            . I am the wife of John Sarjeants. On the 8th of July I was in my back room on the first floor, and heard a strange footstep coming down the stairs; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner - I asked what he wanted; he said he had come there for relief: he said money was meant for such as him - he was distressed, and would have it; the office is in the house, but down stairs, and he was coming down from the attic; I told him Mr. Sarjeants was not at home, and he could not have it then; I saw something bulky under his frock - I came down after him to the street door, and said, "You have robbed this house!" he said, "I have not," and he ran about five yards, to the second house, when he took out the boots, and threw them down; I took them up - Mr. Smith ran and took hold of him, and brought him back; there were some other trifling articles found on him, which I had mended up to give to a poor woman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he been at your house before to ask for relief? A. I cannot say I recollect him; but I believe he was relieved, in December last; the office was then up two pairs of stairs; these are the boots he dropped - they have my husband's name on them.</p>

On the Saturday night previous to the 17th of August, I saw the prisoner on the Pavement, near Finsbury-square - he was a stranger; he asked me where I was going, and whether I would take a glass of anything to drink; I went with him, and had a glass of gin- he then went home with me, and there he gave me 1s. for drink; he asked me if he could stay all night; I said he might if he thought proper - he asked what he must give me; I said a sovereign - he said he could not afford so much, he would give me half a sovereign; he gave me a sovereign, and I gave him half a sovereign in exchange - I put the sovereign into my pocket; I slept with him that night - we got up about seven o'clock in the morning, and walked out; he breakfasted with me - I provided the breakfast; we dined together, and after dinner I went up stairs - he came up after me; I took off my pocket, with my sovereign in it, and put it under the pillow; my brother called on me, and I went down to him - he gave me two half-crowns and two shillings; I changed one of the shillings, went up stairs, and put the remaining silver into my pocket; I laid down, and went to sleep - when I awoke the prisoner was still there; I heard a voice below, and came down, leaving him up stairs washing his hands - he came down in about two minutes; he had agreed to stay with me, and to go out walking, but he came down, and went straight to the door; I asked where he was going - he said he should be back in a few minutes, by the time I was dressed; I ran up stairs, found my pillow turned over, and the money and pocket all gone; I had a penknife in my pocket, with a white handle and two blades, and a bit of gold on one side of the handle; I looked out of the window, and saw him just turning the corner - I called my brother, and told him I had been robbed; I saw the prisoner again on the Friday following - I caught hold of him, and told him he was the man who had robbed me, but if he would give me what he took from me, I would do nothing to him; he said he would see me d - d first - I had put the money by towards my rent, which I pay monthly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not he say he had taken no money, and he would return you none? A. He certainly said he had not robbed me, but he offered it afterwards; I told him I only wanted my money, and he refused to give me any - no persons had come into the house while we were up stairs; there was a man and his wife in the parlour - it is not an improper house; I only go out sometimes when work is short - he went out in the morning, and came back for his handkerchief, but not after he had robbed me; no property of mine was found - I cannot tell how many young men had been there in the course of that month; I will not swear there had not been ten that week - it certainly was nothing but shortness of work that induced me to go out. He did not say that he would go before any Magistrate; there was a gentleman I knew, whom I happened to stand talking to - I do not know whether he heard the conversation; I had left him - he might be a yard from me; I spoke to the prisoner directly - the gentleman was near the gutter, and we were up against a shop; I still kept talking to the prisoner, and the gentleman accompanied me down to the Mansion-house - I suppose he might hear me talking about it as we were going along; he is not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110113"/>here - he knows my friends in the country, and is very respectable; my money was not in a purse - I paid for the breakfast and dinner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time at night did you meet him? A. About eleven o'clock; we got up in the morning about seven - he went away about four.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Waterloo-street, St. Luke's; the prisoner has been my lodger for six weeks - I saw him on the Tuesday before he was taken into custody; he was cutting a piece of leather off his shoe with a small knife that had two blades, to the best of my knowledge, and as far as I could see, a white handle - it appeared to correspond with the description I have heard from the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could you swear to the knife? A. No, but when the officer came I told him what I had seen - I had seen a knife in his hand on another occasion which his wife was trying to get from him, and he said"That is a knife I received from a young woman, and you shall not have it."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you the least notion how your sister was getting her living? A. No, I had not; she has held herself out as living by her industry - she is between twenty-four and twenty-five years of age; and is married, but lives apart from her husband.</p>

            . I am clerk to Sir Richard Carr Glyn &amp; Co. On the 21st of November 1827, they were agents to Messrs. Whitehead &amp; Co.; they had several banks - the Stratford-on-Avon, the Shipston-on-Stour, the Chipping Norton, and the Warwick; they were in the habit of issuing 10l., 5l., and 1l. - at all these banks their 10l. and 5l. notes were payable at Messrs. Glyns; the 1l. notes were not payable there, but they were paid if presented - my business was in the country office, and to keep an account daily of all the notes of Whitehead's paid by Sir Richard Carr Glyn - they were counted separately according to each Bank; the notes are first paid in what is called the town office - I fetch them from the cashier, and take them into my office; all the notes of all the Banks are there indiscriminately put together with a ticket upon them, specifying the amount of the whole - I sort the notes of the different Banks into tens and fives, and specify the amount on the back of them, if there were ten 10l. notes, and so on- having done this, I deliver them to Holloway to copy them into the note-book - that having been done, they come into my possession again; when banking hours are over, I add up all the amounts together of one day's payment, as in this case; (producing a book) here is the amount of the 10l. notes, the 5l. notes, and the 1l. notes - they are all added up together, and then I enter them in the bill-book; the entry in the bill-book is then compared with the notebook by Holloway. On the 26th of October 1827, there were paid thirty-seven 10l. notes, thirty-nine 5l., and ten 1l. making a total of 575l.; the numbers on the back of these notes are my making - here is on the back of this"370l." that means the 10l. notes - here is 195l. that means the 5l. notes; and here is 10l., that means the 1l. notes - on the 1st of November, here is entered thirty-six 10l., thirtythree 5l. and nine 1l. notes - total 534l.; this is the prosecutors' note, (looking at it) and the figures on the back of it are mine; the figures are 360l., 165l. and 9l. - total, 534l.; on the 19th of November, there were fifty 10l. notes, twentythree 5l. notes, and nine 1l. notes - total 624l.; this is one of the prosecutors' notes, and the figures on it are mine - on the 20th of November, here is 700l., 450l. and 2l., making a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110114"/>total of 1,152l. this is Wellington's writing - I have looked through all the books of Sir Richard Car Glyn, in which an account of the prosecutors' notes are entered, and there are no entries corresponding with the sums I have mentioned, except these four dates - the gross amount may correspond, but not the particulars; I believe these notes must have been passed at Messrs. Glyn's on the days I have mentioned - when I have done with them, I give them to Holloway.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. These memoranda are made by you on the backs of several of them? A. No, only on the outside note, and then I hand them to Holloway - if I receive any more notes in the day I make a fresh mark, but I do not make the total till the close of the day; the other numbers may become incorrect in the course of the day, but the total will be right; Holloway gives them to Daniels to lock up, and they would remain several days till Daniels sends them out again; the cashiers pay the notes, but none of them are here to day - I do not know whether there is any one here who can state whether either of these notes came back since the 20th of November - the principal clerk keeps one key of the place where these notes are put; there is no date put on these notes by me, only in the book.</p>

            . I am a clerk at Messrs. Glyn's. On the 20th of November there is an entry of Whitehead's notes in the book - these figures on the back of this note are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. If this had not been the outside note there would have been no figures on it? A. No; we know it has not been in our hands since the 20th of November, because we have not paid any of these notes since then; before that time we should have paid 1l. notes; I did not see this note again till I was before the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. As a clerk of Messrs. Glyn's, do you know if any 1l. notes have been paid at your house since? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know of any placards being issued? A. Yes; I do not know whether the numbers of any 1l. notes were given - it is so long since I saw the placards, that I do not remember whether there was any notice taken of the 1l. notes at all; I dare say there were many thousands of their 1l. notes in circulation - this is one of the first placards - (Looking at it).</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Glyn's. I received the notes from Parteger, and made an entry of them in the note-book which I have here; on the 26th of October, 1827, here are thirty-seven 10l., thirty-nine 5l., and ten 1l. - total 575l.: on the 1st of November, thirtysix 10l., thirty-three 5l., and nine 1l. - total 534l.: on the 19th of November, fifty 10l., twenty-three 5l., and nine 1l. - total 624l.: on the 20th of November, seventy 10l., ninety 5l., and two 1l. - total 1152l.: when I receive the notes in the evening I copy them, make them up in a parcel, put a label on them, and deliver them to Daniels - that is done every night regularly; Mr. Daniels locks them up in an iron-safe till they are wanted to be sent down to the country Bank: on the 21st of November I received some parcels of notes from Mr. Daniels - I looked over the labels, and checked them with this book; the notes, from October 12th to November 20th, inclusive, were all in those parcels, and each of the parcels contained the notes paid on each of the days mentioned - those of the 26th of October, 1st of November, 19th and 20th of November, were all in this parcel: I also delivered some sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Then the whole of your payment for that Warwick Bank in that period was very considerable? Yes; 1900l. or more - there must have been hundreds and thousands of their notes in circulation in the country; these notes were to be returned to Mr. Greenway for the purpose of re-circulation; many notes, on the backs of which we have made marks, have got into circulation again; the public would be used to see notes with our marks on the back of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Have you, since the 20th of November, paid any notes of that Bank printed in black ink? A. No.</p>

            . I am a clerk at Messrs. Glyns. It was my habit to receive Messrs.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Were you aware of the placards being issued? A. I do not know whether I recollect that - but we were not to pay any of the 1l. notes printed in black after that; we paid the 5l. and 10l. notes which were not mentioned in the placards.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Had all the notes numbers on them? Yes - but we only took the numbers of the 5l. and 10l. notes, and the placards only had the numbers of the 5l. and 10l. notes - the 1l. notes not being payable at our house, we did not take the numbers of them.</p>

            . I am one of the partners of the house of John Whitehead and Co. - there is another partner beside Mr. Whitehead. On the 21st of November last I was in London, staying at Furnival's Inn Coffee-house- I received on that day a blue bag from the clerk at Messrs. Glyn's. which I took to Furnival's Inn Coffee-house - I had taken my place to go by the Warwick mail that night; I took out of the blue bag a parcel of sovereigns, and put them into another bag - the porter took my portmanteau to the mail, and in the evening the mail called for me; a little before eight o'clock; I went up stairs at Furnival's Inn Coffee-house, and took the two bags out of a drawer - I directed the porter to take them and put them into the seat of the coach; he took them and went to the coach door - I followed him close; when I got into the street there was only myself and the porter that I observed; I was going to open the coach door myself, but a person from within opened it, and I directed the porter to get in and put the bags into the seat - he appeared to me to lift the bags on the coach floor, and at that moment a person from the back part of the coach ran against me; when I recovered the shock, I observed the porter putting the heavy bag, containing the sovereigns, into the coach seat - and I observed to him that he had not put the blue bag into the seat; he appeared to search for it, and declared it was missing - there was a woman in the coach; I looked for the bag but it was gone; the next morning a person was introduced to me as the person who had run against me, it was not the prisoner; when I went from the house I saw no one but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110115"/>the porter, but as soon as the bag was lost I proclaimed it immediately, and there was a great concourse of people; I went immediately to Messrs. Glyns, and also to the Mansion-house - placards were printed, and advertisements were put into the newspapers - I used all means in my power to make it known; here is one of the placards which were published, containing the numbers of the 5l. and 10l. notes, but here is no statement of the 1l. notes at all; we continued to issue 1l. notes of the Warwick Bank where I reside, but I cannot tell what the other Banks did; we did not issue any more of these others; these are of the Stratford-on-Avon, Shipston-on-Stour, and Chipping-Barnet; the houses at Stratford-on-Avon and Chipping-Stour is still open for the payment of notes only.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. At which house are you resident? A. At Warwick; the notes of the Stratford-on-Avon, Shipston-on-Stour, and Chipping-Barnet, were issued at those houses, not at Warwick; there were 12,000l. in notes in circulation, and our notes had a great circulation in the country; they have all been paid and destroyed except 572l.; there was nothing in the notes stolen to denote to a stranger that they formed part of the parcel that was lost; the placards contained no description of the 1l. notes: we lost one hundred and eight 1l. notes of those houses, and one of the Warwick; there is at this time five hundred 1l. notes properly in circulation; we got back about 19,000l. in 5l. and 10l. notes, but none of the 1l.; I do not suppose the prisoner is the man who ran against me - he was committed for stealing, but that was the act of the Magistrate; I gave the same account I have now.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. What other means did you make use of to apprize the public of your loss? A. We continued to circulate placards, and repeated cautions to the public, against taking the notes, in different papers, in February, April, and June last.</p>

            . I am book-keeper at Messrs. Waterhouse's booking-office, Islington. I know the prisoner - I am in the habit of occasionally changing country notes, which are not payable in London, for the gratuity of 1s. in the pound; I had seen the prisoner three or four times, but did not know his name till I saw him at Bow-street: he came to me on Saturday, the 5th of July, and brought five 1l. notes of the Stratfordon-Avon and Shipston-on-Stour Bank, and wished to know if I would change them - I said I could say nothing to it till I had inquired about them, but if he would call on the Tuesday I would tell him; he came on the Tuesday, and I gave him 4l. 15s. for them; these are two of the notes which I cashed for him on the 7th of July, to the best of my belief (looking at them). I gave the whole of the five 1l. notes which I received from the prisoner to George Mallison, a porter, to take to Lad-lane, and in about a fortnight I received these two back again - the prisoner came again on the evening prior to his examination at Bow-street; he brought ten 1l. notes of the same Banks; he wished them to be cashed, and I told him if he called on the Thursday I should be able to give him an answer - he said, if they passed all right, he should be able to put several others in my way: on the day following I sent these ten 1l. notes by Coles to Messrs. Glyn's, which I found, by a book I had, was a house that did business for them; in consequence of the answer I got from Messrs. Glyns, I spoke to Gardner the police-officer then, and on the 15th of July I gave him the ten notes which I received from the prisoner - I am confident this (looking at it) is one of the ten notes I received from the prisoner and sent by Coles, by the name of "Wall, the 19th of November," on the back of it; I had received notes from the prisoner prior to this, which I sent to Lad-lane, where they were paid in, and I received the money of the guard on his return from Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the date of the first transaction? A. I should think a week before those which I sent to Lad-lane on the 5th of July; must have been the latter end of June or the beginning of July - I did not know the prisoner lived in Islington, but I learned it at Bow-street; I have since heard he carries on a straw business there, it is nearly a quarter of a mile from the Angel office: I suppose not more than twenty coaches start from there to go to the country - more go from the Peacock; we only book for Water-house's coaches - it is usual for persons to bring country notes to book-keepers at coach-offices, and pay 1s. in the pound to change them; I sent the first portion of notes to the country Bank of my own head, not by the direction of the prisoner - I did not pay the cash till I had received the cash for them; eight of the Stratfordon-Avon Bank have been paid, which I received from the prisoner; he lives in the same street in which the Angel stands, and on the same side of the way - I do not know that I have seen his straw hat shop; the notes were in Coles' possession from between eleven and twelve o'clock in the forenoon, till between two and three o'clock in the afternoon; I had not made any mark on them before I delivered them to him, but I had noticed the dates and indorsements - I did not make any mark on them when they were brought back to me, I merely looked them over. and gave them to Gardner; there are no marks of mine on them - I made no marks on the notes I gave to Mallison; they were out of my possession nearly a fortnight before these two were returned from Lad-lane - I gave these to Gardner.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you noticed the notes? A. I observed the dates of them, and what an uncommon length of time they had been out; I had noticed the indorsement before I gave them to Cole - to the best of my recollection, the notes I received back from Cole were the same which I gave him; I am certain I gave the same notes to Gardner which I received from Cole and from Mallison.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you pay the 4l. 15s. before these two notes were returned? A. Yes, in consequence of the book-keeper having sent the money for them.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. GREENWAY. Q. Are not the 1l. notes reissuable? A. Yes; there are notes of the same date out now; and some which have been twenty-three years out.</p>

            . I am book-keeper at the Bolt and Tun Inn, Fleet-street. The prisoner came to my office the latter end of June, (I think,) and I changed some Caermarthen notes for him; he came to me in June, I believe it was, and asked me to exchange some Stratford-on-Avon notes for him - I said I would for 1s. in the pound; after I had exchanged them I asked his address, and he told me "Mr. Williams," and I think Back-lane, Islington - I believe I gave the notes to Mr. Gray, my employer; the notes I gave him were those I received from the prisoner - they were notes of this appearance; I cannot swear that these are them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I think you say you changed other country notes for the prisoner? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Have you any other reason for saying you received these from Adams, than because you did receive notes from Adams? A. No.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you receive three notes from another person, which you delivered to Garnet? A. Yes, I marked them at the time I received them; I have no recollection of receiving any other notes, except from Adams.</p>

            . I was formerly an officer of Bow-street, I first knew the prisoner in 1801, at Hertford, where I gave evidence against him and two others; he was convicted, and sentenced for seven years' transportation; I gave evidence against him at Maidstone for returning before his time - I have no doubt he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Then the felony was committed twenty-seven years ago? A. Yes, he was tried the second time for no other felony, but for returning before the time; I did not know that he had the King's pardon.</p>

When I was going up towards their house on the 20th; Culley was drinking with some men, and he asked me if I would toss with him for some beer - I said No, I did not want any such thing; I was not inclined to toss for it - he then ordered me to take the horse up into the stable: then he asked if I would give 2l. for it, and then Wilkinson came up.</p>

On Friday morning, the 8th of August, between six and seven o'clock, I saw the two prisoners and another near Miss Tooth's house; they were in a suspicious manner consulting together, and in a short time I saw Kingston entering Miss Tooth's garden-gate - the other two were watching, one looking up one street, and another up another, and when a person came up one of the streets they gave an alarm to Kingston, who came out again - I saw Kingston enter into the gate repeatedly in that manner, and at length, when it was getting near seven o'clock, the three had some consultation together, and then they all entered the gate - I then had no doubt that they were had characters, and I went to a neighbour or two to assist me to apprehend them, but I could get no person; I took a stick with me and went to take them myself - I went down High-street and into Old-street-road, but before that I saw them all three coming out of the gate, and the prisoner Styring had the desk - I ran down the street towards the square, and met them coming out of the square; Styring was behind the other two, and he was carrying the desk - I said to him "Where are you going with that;" he made no reply, but turned round and threw it at my person - I turned my hand and left it in the road, and pursued him; I cried Stop thief! and several other persons ran in pursuit with me - I did not loose sight of them till they got to Shoreditch, and before they had been out of my sight a minute, I saw Kingston in custody; a gentleman took up the desk and carried it to his own house- I went to Miss Tooth's house, and so did the gentleman who had the desk; when they went in at the garden-gate it appeared to be on a latch, and Kingston lifted up the latch - I did not see them go into the house, but when I got into the house I saw the window up, and the mark of a man's shoes inside and outside of the parlour window; I had never seen either of the prisoners before to my knowledge - I saw Styring in custody near the Police-office; he was taken to a different watch-house.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Burford's, in Ratcliffhighway, and look after horses and chaises. I was returning from the stable after doing up my horses, a little after ten o'clock, and going down Old Gravel-lane, to our back door, I heard a cry of Stop thief! I looked round, and saw the prisoner the first person running; I stopped him, and heard a person say, "I have lost my watch;" I then saw a watch in the prisoner's hand - I caught at it, and got the chain in my hand, but he held the watch in his hand, and began to kick in a manner I could not bear, so that I was not able to hold him; he got the chain from me, there being no seals to it, I could not hold it - he ran off, and threw away the watch: I took it up, and was going to pursue him, but two young women stopped me as the watchmen came up, and accused me of the robbery; I stated how I came by the watch, and he took me to the watch-house; I got there before the prisoner, and when he was brought in I recognized him as the person who threw the watch away; he was then taken and locked up; it was a darkish night, but I knew the prisoner well - I have seen him pass my master's house scores of times.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110120"/>Cross-examined. Q. What is Mr. Burford? A. A paper-stainer - he has three horses and two chaises, and a chaise-cart, and another gentleman has a horse and chaise in the same stable; I quitted Mr. Burford on Monday - I was a regular servant of his for nine months, and had 16s. a week. Mr. Burford, Jun. and myself had a few words, and I left them - they did not accuse me of anything; I never was here but once before, that was about a man getting into the stable; I never said to any one that I had a job here which I got three guineas by, and I should like to have such another; I got my expences at that time, which were above a guinea; I have seen the prisoner buying and selling fruit, and serving master with fruit - there were other persons running, but he was the first; there were others running after him - I stopped him; I did not take hold of the chain till I had hold of him; a person(who is a bricklayer) saw him throw the watch away, and saw me pick it up, but he is not here - neither of the young women saw me pick it up; I cannot tell how they came to accuse me of the robbery - perhaps they might be confederates; I knew the prisoner's name was Cohen; neither of the young women are here - if I could have found them I should have given them into custody; I did not state that the prisoner's name was Cohen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you had hold of the watch-chain did you know the prisoner? A. Not at that time, but when I saw him at the watch-house, I knew his name was Cohen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then, when you had hold of the chain you had doubts about who he was? A. I knew his face very well indeed; I was then taken to the watch-house, and in consequence of my stating it was Cohen I was discharged, and he was kept; my master and two respectable gentlemen came to the watch-house, and stated where I had been.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the watchman came up to you and took you? A. Yes; I pointed out the person in the mob to him - he took me to the watch-house, and in going along I saw Cohen in the custody of another watchman and a bricklayer; when I saw him I said that was the man; the watchman is not here, and I do not know his name.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then when Rainer first came in he said nothing about how he came by it? A. There were no questions asked him till the prisoner was brought in - the person who brought in Cohen brought in a piece of watch-glass, which was picked up near to where he stood.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Rawson. On the 15th of August, about twenty minutes to ten o'clock, I was in Black Lion-lane, and saw the prisoner and another boy coming down from the front of Mr. Wild's premises, in a private road; I went up to them, and said, "Halloo! what have you got there, a fowl - will you sell it?" he said, Yes - I said, "Have you been buying it?" he said Yes, he gave 1s. for it; I said,</p>
               <p>"Are you sure of it?" he said,"Yes - I bought it of a man in the Green-lane, with a donkey and panniers;" I took it in my hand - it had its wing broken, and was very dirty underneath; I said, "I will take you to a man who I think will own it;" I took him to Mr. Wild, and he claimed it; the prisoner did not say anything - he was about forty yards from the prosecutor's when I first saw him; this was before ten o'clock - he was then taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Then he told you he had bought it? A. Yes, and he offered to take me to the man, but I did not go, because I knew it to be Mr. Wild's.</p>

On the 15th of August the prisoner was brought to my house, with the fowl (which I knew to be mine); I had seen it, to the best of my recollection. the day before - I had seen the prisoner the day before, go past my house with two other lads, and told them it was no thoroughfare, and they turned back: the prisoner said he had taken the fowl, together with the other lad, but he had not thrown at the fowl.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Partington then present? A. He was present part of the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out into the fields to go bird's-nesting, and saw the fowl in Mr. Johnson's field; we tried to catch it, and then I took it; we came by the gentleman's house, looking to see if we could see any one to own it, and the gentleman took me.</p>

I said, "I don't know;" he said,"Look into his basket" - the basket was then opened, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110122"/>the prisoner took out this package, threw it down in the shop, and ran away - I pursned, and brought him back; it contains four brushes of my masters, worth 5s.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Shew me those bills? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. When you apprehended the prisoner on that Saturday, was he told what it was for? A. Yes - I mentioned to him in the morning that he had been keeping his accounts very bad, and before he left me I should expect him to clear up his accounts - he said they were all right; he had had a sovereign of me, and had paid me money at different times - there was 3s. 4d. then left, and I owed him 15s; he had paid me the 8s. 4d., but said nothing about the 6s. 6d.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you have a character with him? A. No, he came as a lad to work for us at two or three shillings a week; when I called him back, he was in the yard about ten yards from the counting-house - he had quitted the factory, and had the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110123"/>baize under his arm; any one could see it - we never knew that he took cochineal home to grind; he lost three fingers, and then we employed him in the dye-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he his hat on at the time he was stopped? A. Yes, he had a place to grind the cochineal on our premises.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had by mistake taken 2lbs. of cochineal to grind, and was returning it to its place when the prosecutor charged him with stealing it.</p>

I have known the prisoner twenty years - he came to our shop on the 9th of August, a little after nine o'clock in the morning - he had been in the habit of coming there from time to time; on the 9th of August, I went to a drawer in the parlour at the back of our shop, and gave my husband some money out of a pocket-book - there is a door from the shop to the parlour - it is not a glass door; I do not know exactly what money there was when I went there, but I left two 20l. Bank notes, 3 sovereigns in gold, and 17s. in silver - I am certain that is what I left; there were some shillings among the 17s., and it was all in a small pocket-book; when I took the money out, the prisoner stood on the left hand side of me, and my husband on the right; I cannot exactly say how near he was to me, or that he saw what I was doing; I gave the money to my husband that I took out - he and the prisoner were to go to buy some goods for the shop- they went out together about half-past nine o'clock - he returned with my husband between ten and eleven; he soon went away then, but returned between five and six in the evening - he did not stay long then, but he came again between eight and nine in the evening, and went away a little after twelve; I do not remember his saying anything to me, but my husband was speaking to a man about making him a grate, in the yard, and the prisoner wished me to go and tell my husband not to let the man make the grate, because he could get one much cheaper, but I did not go; I saw the prisoner shut the door between the shop and parlour once or twice in the course of the evening, and he had shut it in the afternoon as well; in the course of the evening, I went to the drawer in the parlour to get change for a sovereign, that was a little after ten o'clock - the money was all right then - I saw the pocket-book there; I left the sovereign in the same drawer, but not in the pocket-book - I took the change for the sovereign out of a bit of rag in one corner of the drawer; I have a bacon-knife, which I saw the prisoner take into the parlour between eleven and twelve o'clock - he did not stay in the parlour above two minutes, if he did so long - the parlour door was then a little way shut, but not close; no one came into the shop but the customers - none of them went into the parlour; when the prisoner went away, he said nothing particular - he bid my husband good night - I do not know that he bid me good night; my husband shut the shop up between twelve and one o'clock; my husband had not been in the shop all the evening - after the shop was shut, I saw the bacon knife on a table close by the drawer in the back parlour; I went to unlock the drawer, and it was unlocked - I had left it locked; I did not observe any marks on it; I missed all this money - it was all gone; it was between twelve and one o'clock; the bit of rag with the rest of the money was safe - this was on Saturday night, we expected the prisoner the next day; he had promised to come, but did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You told your husband you had this money? A. He knew I had it - I told him that night that I had missed it - I will swear that; I did not tell anybody that I did not miss it till between twelve and one o'clock on the Sunday, nor till Sunday afternoon, when I went to look for a brooch in that drawer - I did say on the Saturday morning that two sovereigns was all I had in the world; because I did not wish the prisoner to know what we had got; I said so before the magistrate - that I will swear; it was my husband who was asking me for money when I said I had no more - I only said it out of a bit of fun; he knew I had more - he had as much money as he wanted of me for his business - he had 6l or 7l.; he asked for more, but I thought he was asking for too much, and I said "Don't ask me for more - I have but two sovereigns left," but he knew I had more; I did not wish the prisoner or any person to know what I had, and because I thought my husband was asking too much; I did not take any one else up on this charge; I sent for a little girl to know if she knew anything of it - I did not accuse her of stealing it - that I will swear - I persist in that; I did not accuse her of stealing it from between my pillow and bolster, nor tell her I would transport her if she did not tell me the colour of the pocketbook, nor that I would transport her father and mother if she did not; I did not send for the streetkeeper to take her, but my husband went out to fetch her, and he met Forbes, the street-keeper, who came in, he found a piece of wood broken from the drawer, and said he had no doubt the prisoner was the man; and he would assist in taking him - this was about five or six o'clock on Sunday evening; I searched the drawer ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110125"/>curately on the Saturday night, but did not discover that it had been broken; I did not offer the girl a sovereign to tell the colour of the pocket-book, nor anything of the kind; I did not on my oath; I did not give her sixpence to hold her tongue; I gave it her because she cried - that was when it was discovered that it had been broken open, and I knew she could not do it - she might be there an hour in conversation, but not two hours; I mentioned when she was there that I had lost notes - I did not say sovereigns and silver only; the prisoner has been exceedingly kind to my husband in his business - he assisted him in buying things, but my husband always gave him things home with him; I have been married five years, nearly - I am lawfully married; my husband did not go for the street-keeper to take the girl up - he met him by accident; he went to the girl's mother's, and brought her from there; she had left my house at half-past ten o'clock, and I had seen my money safe then, but I did not recollect that when I sent for her, my agitation was so great; she had been there on the Sunday morning, but I did not ask her then, because I expected the prisoner to come and bring the money back; I did tell him at Hatton-garden, that if he would give me my own money I did not want any one's else - I might say so in his father's presence; I did not say "Your father is a respectable man, and can easily raise the money;" upon my solemn oath, I did not tell Mrs. Griffiths that I had put the money in the drawer on Saturday morning, and did not miss it till Sunday afternoon.</p>

            . I live in John-lane. I was in my shop on the evening of the 9th of August - between eight and nine o'clock that morning I had asked my wife for some money, and she gave me about 6l. altogether; I think she took about two sovereigns out of the pocket-book - I saw her take it out, and the prisoner stood on the left hand of me and close to my wife; he saw my wife take the money out - he was in the shop in the evening; he went into the parlour several times during the evening, and I noticed him taking the bacon knife to cut a slice of bread for a drunken man - he cut the bread in the parlour, but he did not stay there more than a minute or two; the drunken man was outside my shop window - the prisoner left the knife on the dining table; he went away between twelve and one o'clock, and told me he would be over on Sunday morning, if he did not go to his father's; I did not know exactly how much money was in the drawer: when the prisoner was gone my wife found the money was gone - she made an alarm, and I went to the drawer and examined it - this was between twelve and one o'clock on the Sunday morning: I did not see any marks on the drawer at that time, not till the street-keeper pointed them out - I saw them then, that was on Sunday; the marks were on the upper part, where the bolt of the lock shoots in - it was a small place; the street-keeper compared the bacon knife to the place - I merely said I suspected the prisoner, and I went with two officers on the Monday morning, about eight o'clock, to apprehend him; he was at his residence, on the other side of Christchurch - he asked me if I accused him of it; I said I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know that your wife had all this money? A. I did not rightly know how much she had, but I knew that she ought to have near this money - I gave it her; I did not ask her for any more than the 6l. that morning - I am certain I did not; but previous to her giving me the 6l. she gave two sovereigns out of the pocket-book, and said I must not ask her for any more, for that was all she had: I knew she had about 40l., but she did not like to satisfy the prisoner how much she had got - he was exceedingly kind to us; she told me that night that she had lost the money - I went and looked at the drawer then, and examined it again on the Sunday, by day-light; the prisoner was not more than two minutes in the room - I was about one minute looking at him; I did not immediately send him to cut the bread, but a man came and asked for a pennyworth of bread, and he said, "You can sell a pennyworth of bread?" and he went and cut: I had a right to suspect the girl, as I had been robbed by a girl before - my wife knew that; she did not exactly know that I went out for the girl - I brought her in; the street-keeper was there: it is possible my wife might say, in Forbes' presence, that it was all nonsense, that she had been robbed by a girl before, and she could not get the money from her till she got an officer to take her into custody, and then she got it - I did not take notice of every thing she said; I have no recollection of such an expression; I did not hear her offer the child a sovereign if she would tell her the colour of the pocket-book - she did accuse her of taking the money, certainly; she said to the girl, "if she knew anything about it to tell her the truth" - I told the streetkeeper I had been robbed, and I rather suspected the girl; I did not see my wife give her 6d. when she was going away, but she told me of it afterwards; I cannot tell what she gave it her for - she asked the girl if she had seen anything of the money about; she said she thought she had mislaid it, and put it under her pillow, and the girl had taken it from there - I will not be certain whether Forbes was present; I suppose the girl was there half an hour; it was not so long as an hour - I went to the girl's father, her mother was out; I do not recollect that I told her father I was sure his daughter had taken the money - I told him I had been robbed, and he said the girl had brought nothing there; I think I did not tell him I was sure the girl had robbed me: the prisoner came as a friend to assist me - I offered to make him a recompense, but he never took anything but a few goods; he introduced me to a few customers, and to some wholesale dealers - I know now that he was taken very ill the next day.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner on the 11th of August, at his lodging in Collingwood-street, over the water; I saw his wife, and asked for Mr. Chapman; I said I had a job for him - she said she would be there in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour if I would wait somewhere; I said I would wait, and she went into a cart-house or shed and closed the gate - I went in, and in about two minutes she came, and said it was useless my waiting, Mr. Chapman would not be there for an hour and a half or two hours; I told her I thought he was in bed; she said he did not sleep there, he slept at Kennington; but in about five minutes I saw him - I told him Towell had been robbed; he said, "He don't suspect me, does he;" I said, "Yes he does;" I told him he must come outside and speak to him, which he did; he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110126"/>nothing further but denying the charge; I found 9s. on him - this was about eight o'clock on the Monday morning; I had been sent for on the Sunday by Field, a brother officer - I went to Mr. Towel's about seven o'clock one Sunday evening; the street-keeper showed me this knife, and I compared it with the upper part of the drawer - it appeared that this knife had been forced in, and the shuttle of the lock had been forced down - the knife fitted the place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you known the prisoner any time? - A. Yes, for years; he knew I was an officer; I did not know that he referred people to his father's house in consequence of the obscure situation he lived in; I searched his place and his wife, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent - on my oath I never saw the money; and I do not believe the prosecutor ever had it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When was this conversation? A. Between six and seven o'clock on the Sunday evening - what he said was, they had no occasion to go to that drawer, but they were going out in the afternoon, and he considered he had not money enough in his pocket, and he asked his wife to procure him some; it was the Sunday afternoon he spoke of - this was after I found the drawer had been broken.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who did he say were going out in the afternoon? A. His wife and him; he said they were going out that same afternoon, and then they missed it; he said they had no occasion to go to that drawer, but he considered he had not money enough, and he was going out that afternoon to meet some friends; he did not say anything to me about a brooch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Mary Griffiths there? A. Yes; I went in with Mr. Towell, and the child was crying; I went directly to the parlour, and the bolt had been shot; Mrs. Towell said she was very happy to think she had not given the girl into custody: when I first met Mr. Towell, he told me he had been seriously robbed; I went with him to Griffiths's house, and from there we returned to Towell's, and the girl was crying - Mrs. Towell said she suspected the girl, that she had been robbed by a former girl, and she owned it to the officer afterwards; he said he considered he had not money enough in his pocket, and he sent his wife to get him some - that she went to put the key into it and it would not unlock; he did not say what money his wife had given him; I have known the prisoner twelve or thirteen years; I have not been particularly intimate with him - he has not been living in that neighbourhood lately.</p>

             and the prisoner; I had arranged with Fogg before - I asked the prisoner if he had got any shan to sell; he said No, but he had got some out and out couters, meaning counterfeit sovereigns, to sell,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110128"/>which were to be 5s. a-piece; I agreed to take three, which were to be brought to me on Saturday night, the 12th of July - he came that night, but said they were not ready, but he brought them on Sunday morning, the 13th; he brought three counterfeit sovereigns; I gave him two halfcrowns and 7s., and promised to give him 3s. on the Monday - they had paper round them, and he told me to keep them separate; in five or ten minutes after we had left the house, I saw Fogg - I shewed him what I had got - he marked them and returned them to me; the prisoner came about three o'clock in the afternoon, on Monday, the 13th, and I paid him the 3s - I know Alexander Mitchell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q. What sort of a lodging-house is your's? A. A sailor's lodging and navigator's; there are married men and women there. I believe - I do not keep a house for the reception of men and women, but if a sailor and a woman come there I am not to ask if they are married - Horne is an acquaintance of mine; I do not know that he has been in trouble lately - I never was in trouble; I never speculated in shans and couters before the 13th of July - the first information I had of this was from Horne, at Fairlop-fair; I knew what a couter meant, it is a very common word; if a sailor comes to sleep at my house it is usual for me to take care of their money - I have had a great deal of money in my hands, and in the morning I returned it to them; they do not find any couters among it, unless they gave them to me - I never saw a bad sovereign in my life before.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames-police. Watts gave me information on the 12th of July, and on the 13th he shewed me three counterfeit sovereigns, which I marked and returned to him; on the 19th I was with Mitchell and Carter on Tower-hill, but I did not take the prisoner untill the 22d of August, at Kent-street, in the Borough - he was sitting at breakfast; I said, "White, I want you, I suppose you know what for" - he said, "Yes, I have heard something about it;" I told him it was for selling bad sovereigns to George Watts and George Horne - he then said he thought so of Horne when he saw him at his house the day before, and what could he do this for? - he said, "Well, I understand they can only give me two years for it," and asked if there was anything else against him; I said not that I knew of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many of you went to apprehim? A. Four - we had four brace of pistols, and powder and shot; I was more afraid of his dog than I was of him - he told me if his dog had been at home I should not have had him then; I knew Watts before - he did live over the water, but I never knew of his keeping a house until he kept the one he lives in now; he came to me first on this subject, and asked what they were to do - I said I would mention it to the Mint, and tell him; I do not think Horne was with Watts the first night - if he was, I had no conversation with him; I have known Horne five or six months - I never knew that Watts and him went about to catch people with money; I do not believe Watts keeps a house of reception for sailors and common women; I have been in his house, but I saw no woman but his wife.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON to GEORGE HORNE. Q. Were you examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes, and I gave evidence which was taken down in writing; I was in company with Watts when Fogg went to him - I believe it was on the 10th, but I do not recollect the day; we were not coutering together - you are talking French to me; it is a matter of indifference to me, whether I was ever at the tread-mill; the "lead story and the goose story" have nothing to do with this subject - I believe you are right that I had been about, to endeavour to precure people to sell counterfeit coin; I know Fogg, but he did not know of my being engaged in other things - he never employed me till I met him with Watts, on Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. You have known Fogg some time as an officer? A. Yes, but he never employed me to purchase bad money before; I saw him twice, once when I made my own purchase, and once when Watts made his - when we went to Tower-hill and met Fogg, it was for Watts to tell him what had passed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see him on Tower-hill? A. On the 19th of July.</p>
               <p>JAMES FOGG re-examined. I saw Horne on Tower-hill on the 19th of July.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you know nothing of Horne before that? A. No, and never knew he had been in custody till to-day - I told him when he came into Court, not to deny it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What part of the house do you live in? A. In the back premises; there are some little cottage at the back - there was a great mob; I cannot say that there were not full two hundred people about - there were fifty or sixty round Mrs. Jones when she was lying on the ground; I contrived to get sight of her, but I do not know how - when I came out I went and threw it into the mob; she had not had too much to drink, she is not such a woman - it was a red handkerchief, with flowers and a table in the middle; no one interfered to save the handkerchief - she had been lifted up by some people before she lost it; I do not know the man who was fighting with Stocks - George was not a lodger of Mrs. Jones.</p>

I did not fetch Mr. Harris I am sure - my son-in-law and a man of the name of Adams fetched him, and he asked me if I could point him out the man; I went down to the Three Elms, and Adams took the prisoner and turned him over to Harris - Harris appeared at Queen-square; if I were to die in your presence this moment, my Lord, I never said to Harris that I was in a state of insensibility for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and any one might have taken my handkerchiof, but I believed it was the prisoner - I said I had been a wife thirty-eight years, and never had such blows in my life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you taken your tea that night? A. Yes, at five o'clock, but I am a person who never takes liquors for months together, when I do take it, it is as a remedy for the spasms in the stomach - I did not take notice whether Harris was sober; I had some conversation with him, to tell him who it was that struck me - if I were to tell the sincere truth of my mind, I do not think he was sober; I did say I did not take notice whether he was sober, but it was because I did not wish to injure the matter - I know I was treated by the prisoner as I have stated, and that is all I have to say; I do not altogether take upon me to say whether Harris was sober or drunk - in my own opinion I do not think he was sober; if I did say I did not take notice, it was because you were bothering of me, or because I did not wish to injure the matter, which way you please to take it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to GEORGE HARRIS. Q. Is there the least pretence for saying you had the slightest appearance of intoxication about you? A. Not the slightest, I was as sober as I am now.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Joseph Rankin, of Ulster-place, Regent's-park. On the 17th of June, I paid the prisoner some money for his master; I cannot tell how much, but I paid him when he brought the meat - the last I paid him was, on the 1st of July, 1s. 1 1/2d. - he gave me this receipt, and these other receipts are his writing: here is June 16, 1s. 8 1/2d.; June the 11th, 8s.; June the 25th, 2s. 1d.; June the 27th, 7s. 2d.; and June the 26th, 2s. 9 1/2d.; the prisoner wrote the receipt to them all, and I paid him the money for his master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not he always give you a receipt? A. Yes - in his own name.</p>
               <p>MR. GREEN re-examined. Q. What was the habit of the prisoner's settling with you? A. Every day at first; and then I never had any money since October last; I suffered it to run all that time - it is upwards of 34l.; he said at first the lady was ill, and then he said he wanted the abstract of the bill and I gave it him - I have asked him for the money several times; I think the first time was before Christmas - the debt began on the 12th of April, and it went on till the 1st of July, and is 34l. 17s. 10d. - I thought they had had all this; I do not know whether they have or no - the prisoner has never accounted to me for these sums of money paid in these bills; he told me they had not paid - I said several times "It is very strange Mrs. Horton don't pay her bill;" he said at one time she was out of town, and another time she was ill - I think I spoke to him about it in June: but in July he asked for the abstract te be sent, and I said I supposed she was going to-pay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Up to October she used to pay daily? A. Yes. for a little time prior to the 12th of October, and from then I have received nothing: he brought orders for meat and he took it; he told me part of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110131"/>time that she was out of town, but there was part of the family there - I let it go so long because she was a respectable lady, and I did not like to ask for fear of offending her; my books are not here, but there is an entry in them of the bills, and of the money I received - I was not ordered to bring them here; I took them to Mary-le-bone Office - the books are the things that would tell what I received.</p>

I was on my rounds on the 10th of August, and went into the Plough public-house; I received information there, and waited until the afternoon, when the prisoner came, and I took him into custody - I took two 10l. notes from him and seven sovereigns and a half; I told him what I took him for - he looked very stupid and strange, but gave up the notes very willingly; I asked him how he came to do so, he said he was very sorry - he did not deny it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) On Monday, the 16th of August, I was in bed about ten o'clock at night, when my mistress came to my bed-room door, and desired me to get up - my master followed her, and insisted on my getting up, as he had missed a sovereign; they searched my pocket, and found nothing in it but an old purse - they then searched my work bag; in it was a pair of black silk stockings that I had washed and mended, but had omitted taking them up stairs; in my box was a waist ribbon I had purchased in the shop of my master after I had been there about a month, a black handkerchief I had bought in the country, a small ganze scarf I gave 1s. 3d. for in Charles-street, Soho-square, all of which they have sworn to as their property, as well as a collar I had given to me by a friend, and was in pledge, with some other things, for 10s.; my master and mistress both said if I would say where the sovereign was they would not send for an officer, but pay me my wages, and I should return to my friends; next morning, when they searched the shop, the sovereign was found on the floor; though they had found it, they sent next morning for an officer.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HARRISON. I told her if she did not tell me where the sovereign was, I would send for an officer; she then came down into the shop, and took it up from a corner, as she pretended, but I think she had it in her mouth; she brought me down 10s., which she said she had picked up, but I do not think she had; I had frequently missed money out of the till.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took the lamp into the shop to have oil in it- I saw the sovereign lay in the shop; I touched it with my foot, but not with my hands - I thought it did not lay in my way, and I did not meddle with it; they called me up, and took my key - my mistress unlocked my box, and searched it; I told them I saw the sovereign in the shop - my mistress took it up, and put it into my master's hand.</p>

            . I met the two prisoner at a quarterpast four o'clock in the morning, coming from Highburygrove, with these two flats - each of them had one; I asked what they were - they said rabbits, which they had bought at Finchley; they said they lived at home with their father - he did not like the rabbits, and they were going to take them to Newgate-market to sell, as they were a nuisance in the house; I took them to the watch-house, and in going to the office in the morning one of them said, "Master, I am sorry we did not tell you the truth - we did not breed the rabbits, we bought them, and we live in Long-lane, Smithfield; we could not make up 10s., and the man let us have them for what we had got;" I said I should ask them nothing, and they said no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did James claim them as his property? A. It was James who first spoke to me; Thomas never spoke to me: I have heard that they are not related to each other; I believe the proper name of James is Hitchman, but they said they were son's of the same father, and gave their names as James and Thomas Williams.</p>

            . I am a saddler, and live at Tottenham. On the 5th of September I was in my shop- about one o'clock I saw a young man named Layox pass my door, whom I had taken up two years before; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner join him just opposite the public-house - they passed my house once or twice, and went into a cook's shop and bought something to eat; they then watched about, and went round to the back of the prosecutor's premises; I put on my coat and hat, and followed them - when they got to the bottom of the prosecutor's grounds they parted company; I went into a neighbour's, being certain that they intended something wrong - I should have stated, that when they first<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110135"/>joined company the prisoner put two or three pieces of sponge into the other's hand, that he might appear to be selling sponge; the prisoner himself had been offering some at my shop; when I got to my neighbours, I asked them to assist me, and we went up and saw the prisoner near the hedge - I went up to him, and saw his hat looked rather remarkable; I said, "What have you got here?" I took off his hat, and found this large nail in it - I said,"Where is your sponge?" he said, "I have got no sponge;" I said, "You have, here it is" - it was lying under the hedge; I then said, "Where is your companion?" he said, "I have no companion;" I said."Don't you know Layox?" - he said No; I said, "I will tell you how it is, he is at Mr. Powell's premises" - I gave him in charge, and went to the back of Mr. Powell's, and saw Layox come out; as soon as he saw me he put down this plate, and made his escape, as I was two fields off him - the prisoner, I suppose, was about two hundred yards from the premises; the prisoner was then taken and searched - I pursued Layox some distance, but I was not very well; I then went to Mr. Powell's and gave the alarm, and asked if they knew they had been robbed - I went up to the sideboard, and found these three pieces of sponge near it, which convinced me that they had belonged to the prisoner, because one of the pieces I had particularly noticed; I went to the watch-house and saw the prisoner searched, and these two keys were concealed at the bottom of his trousers.</p>

            . I am a constable of Tottenham. A man named Newsom brought the prisoner to me - I took him to the watch-house, and found these two latch-keys concealed at the bottom of his trousers: I asked what he did at the bottom of the field - he said he was picking up caterpillars, and his father was a bird-fancier.</p>
               <p>- STUKELY. Mr. Reynolds came to me, and we went and searched the premises; when I got near the green-house, I found this plate lying down under some scarlet-runners - I did not see the prisoner until he was at the watch-house; the way the person must have got in was - there was a chain and a rope on the gate at the bottom of the garden, the rope was cut and the chain forced, and then they must have come up the green, and got into the drawing-room window; I found this other large nail close by that place.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

The constable came on the 6th of August, and gave me information; I suppose this hammer might be mine, but there are many alike - I do not really think it is mine; I do not think these tips are mine - they are odd ones. The prisoner was in my shop on the 6th of August, and asked to look at a hammer and some bristles; I showed him some hammers pretty near like this, but the iron of this hammer is more straighter than mine - he paid me 1d. for the bristles, and then came in and asked if I had lost anything - I had shown him seven or eight hammers.</p>

Between eleven and twelve o'clock, on the night of the 23d of May I was coming from Duke-street across Smithfield to the East-side; I met two females near the Bear and Raggedstaff - they caught hold of each arm, and said "We have got you now, we will not let you go without you give us some gin;" I tried to get away, but could not - I then gave them a glass of gin each - I did not have any myself; we remained but a very short time in the house - they then turned into Smithfield - I remained a minute or two at the door, and said, "Now for Clerkenwell;" the prisoner and another man were there - the prisoner said to me, "You live in Clerkenwell;" I said, yes - he said, "You are not far from it;" I said, I know it - I looked at him, thinking he was a neighbour, and we went on together towards Bath-street, where I live - we crossed the way towards Cow-cross, and I turned up <placeName id="t18280911-251-crimeloc1290">Peter's-lane</placeName>

I seized my money out of my pocket into my hand - there were six sovereigns and twelve shillings; I tried to save myself, but could not- I was thrown down, and the prisoner seized my hand, and said, "You b-g-r let go;" I was obliged to let go, and he received the money into his left hand - he turned back my hand, and took it; I saw it as plain as I see you now - I never saw my hat afterwards; the prisoner went off to my right-hand: I called Watch! and at length one came from St. John's-lane - I told him I had been robbed - I did not go back the same way, as I thought it might be worse for me; we went up St. John's-lane - I am certain the prisoner is the person: my eyes were fixed on him several times in walking along, when we came to a gaslight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many gaslights did you pass? A. I do not know; the young ladies turned into Smithfield - I had not seen them before; I did not take any of the gin myself; I had been drinking two or three pints of beer, but no spirits; I was not considered tipsy when the watchman came up, nor I should think the worse for liquor; the prisoner was not taken up till the 1st of September; I gave information on the 31st of August - I did say that I had been treating two women, and I might be a little tipsy; Phillips asked me if I knew the person that robbed me, and I said I did not - he is not a particular friend of mine; I borrowed a hat of him, and called on him a fortnight afterwards and paid him for it - he asked me if I had had this person apprehended; I told him No, but I could have him apprehended at any time; the reason I did not have him apprehended was, he was a character so well known - he was out of the way; I was taken ill, and could not go through such a fatigue: I mean I had not got his name and place of abode. On Saturday, the 6th of September, I called again on Phillips; I told him I had been to Hatton-garden Office, and had parties apprehended for this robbery; I think he asked if they were the parties I had been speaking about before, but I did not say "No, it was a neighbour of mine" - I am quite sure I did not tell him they were not the same parties I was speaking about before; I said the watchman knew the prisones, and he gave me the first intimation, knowing the prisoner and one of the women passing his beat repeatedly, but he did not know the prisoner's name; I will not positively say whether I said it was upon the watchman's information that I took this man up.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Pancras. On the morning of the 3d of August, I was in Tottenham-court-road, about one o'clock; I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner entangled together - there were two persons standing not far off, who made off; I took the prisoner and prosecutor both to the watch-house, and the prosecutor charged him with robbing him of 1l. 15s. - he did not say it was a sovereign; he had been drinking, but he seemed sensible enough to know what he was about.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

On the 19th of August the prisoner was leaving work - I called him back; the constable was sent for, and this copper found on him; he is a smith in our employ, and had copper of this king entrusted to him- three of these pieces had been found in a particular place, and they were marked to see who would take them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where were they concealed? A. Under the ashes of the forge; if copper had been dropped there, it might have been covered with ashes, but that was not a place for it - it is not common for smiths to work at home; he was employed from six o'clock in the morning till six at night for my master, the other time he had for himself - I do not know that the prisoner had worked at home; when the constable came he acknowledged he had the property, and begged to be forgiven.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. On the Monday I took this copper to the shop for the purpose of cutting it; I have a small modelmachine making - I have some tools at home, but I have not a hammer, except a very small one; I came from Nottingham - I began making the machine there, and am going on with it; they went to my house, and found a small bench and some tools - I was going to the West London Theatre on Monday - as Mr. Lea's son was to perform: on the Tuesday, I went to work again; I was called out between three and four o'clock, to do a job, which I was not in the habit of doing (unloading some castiron) - I said "This is pretty work to set a tradesman to do labourer's work;" when I went in again, I was told some copper had been marked - I said whether it was or not, I should take it up; I took it from under my bench, and was putting into in my pocket, when a man ran and told Mr. Lea.</p>
               <p>LEA re-examined. Q. Did he say anything of this at the time? Q. No; he owned he had it, and begged Mr. Braithwaite to forgive him - he appeared very much confused.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He came to the counting-house door, and said "Have you some property of Mr. Braithwaite's?" he put his hand to my pocket, and said "Yes, here it is," and then he said "How many times have you taken copper of your master?" I said "Never before, and I hope you will forgive me."</p>

            . I am inspector of the parish of St. Ann's, Westminster. In the month of August I went with Clubb to Great Chapel-street, St. Ann's-court, Carlisle-street, and that neighbourhood - he pointed out places where lamp-irons had been taken from by him, and the prisoner; I had seen the irons there before, and I saw irons at Burrow's, which appeared to me to be the same.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that a man named Houghton of No. 6, Great Chesterfield-street, who represented himself as foreman of the gas works, had employed him to take down the irons and dispose of them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was deceived by my first wife; we lived together some time, when she absconded to live<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110143"/>with a man named Lacey; I was afterwards given to understand where they lived - I went and saw her, and proposed her return, but she rejected it; I then became acquainted with Mary Phillips, and she became my wife, and we lived comfortable for twelve months; I was then out of employ, which caused her to apply to the parish, and they made inquiries - it has been stated that I pawned her clothes, but they did not exceed 2l. in value; I was under age when I married my first wife, and my last wife was under age when I married her. I hope you will be as lenient as possible, as both the acts were committed without due consideration.</p>

On the 18th of August I saw the two prisoners near the coach-house gate, and a parcel of lead lay on the ground by them; I heard one of them say to the other, "D - n the fellow, why does not he come with a ladder?" I then walked across the road, and had a more full view of them; while I was there Bumstead sent her servant to ask if I thought they were Mr. Hankey's workmen - I said I thought not; I still watched them, and saw Adams pick up some slates; he marched off towards Hackney, and the other began to take up the lead; I walked up to him, and said, "What are you going to do with that lead?" he said, "What am I going to do? I am going after the slater to do a job in Hackney-road;" I said, "What are you going to take Mr. Hankey's lead? No, you shall not step a foot further;" he then threw the lead down, while I had hold of his collar; Mr. Hankey's servant then came out; Adams afterwards told me he lived in Bryan's-buildings, Kingsland-road - we have inquired since, and the address is correct.</p>

               <p>ADAM'S Defence. I was going to my work - I never touched any lead; I had a load of slates on my shoulder, and that gentleman came and detained me, and looked at my property; I told him where I lived.</p>
               <p>MRS. BUMSTEAD re-examined. Q. Are you sure you saw this man help the other? A. I could not swear to his person, but Prest got sight of them before I came down - I saw him get up to them before I lost sight of them; Adams went across the road and got the bag, and then Prest went up to them.</p>

No, but I told him they were going to sleep there, and he never said they were or they were not - he said he would send a woman to sleep there; I will swear I told Mr. Gull that I was going to let the prisoner and McKenzie sleep in the house - he made no answer, or if he did, he made such an answer as no one could understand; I told Mrs. Gull I was going to pay a bill with the notes, but I paid it with some other money - I told her I was going to pay 20l. to a person in Regent-street, but I did not pay it out of the notes; there was no other person in the house, but the prisoner and McKenzie, the landlady, four ladies, and a little girl; a man came to the door for some linen. but he did not come in - the washer-woman was not in the house that day; I never said so, that I recollect - if I did say so before the Magistrate, it was a mistake; a man came after the furniture, but he came no further than the hall - I gave no warning when I went into the room, where the prisoner was cutting his toe nails; he was preparing to dress himself - his trousers were on; he came down into the kitchen, a minute or two afterwards; before that day he had dressed in the butler's pantry - he had slept in the room till he took the money, and then he never came again: his boxes were left in the house with his clothes and all his things - they were searched, but nothing was found; Mc Kenzie was taken up - he was acquitted and died in three days afterwards; I always said he was innocent.</p>
               <p>MR. SHARPE. Q. On the morning of the robbery, the prisoner was in the house? A. Yes, at half-past eleven o'clock, in the room where the trunk and money were; no other person was in the room that day - he did not go out dressed - he left his shirt in the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he see you put the money into the trunk? A. He saw me with the book in my hand that day; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110145"/>knew the money was in one of the trunks - he saw me put it in on the 1st of August, in that same room; he had no further opportunity of knowing the money was in the trunk that morning, but seeing the pocket-book in my hand - when I was putting the trunks to rights, my keys were on a little table in the kitchen, and when he was gone, my trunks were still locked.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the office; he said he lived in York-street. which I found to be the case: I went into the room in York-street, he said he had been to the Leith and Berwick wharf - that he had been on board the Sir William Wallace packet to see if a letter had been brought up for McKenzie, and he had seen the steward and the cook - I was then sent out, and returned about two o'clock; the prisoner then stated that he had eleven shillings or twelve shillings in his pocket - he said he had got nineteen shillings for a Scotch not which he had exchanged near the Haymarket, and bought a bottle of whiskey, paid some money to a green grocer, and a score to a man who lived in the Edgware-road; I calculated the whole together, and it was twentyfour or twenty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You say he told you where he slept? A. Yes; the robbery was committed on the Monday; he was on the wharf on the Tuesday - I searched his trunk, but found nothing belonging to the prosecutrix.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Leith and Berwick Smack Company. On the 5th of August, the prisoner came with another man to enquire if they could get Scotch notes for gold - I said the clerk who had the Scotch notes were not in the way, but just then Mr. Thompson came in, and I referred to him; the prisoner's companion went to him - the prisoner said nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was not asking gold for notes? A. No; Scotch notes for gold.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw neither gold nor notes? A. No, I recommended them where they could get notes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. GULL. Q. Do you remember that woman telling you she was about to allow the prisoner and McKenzie to sleep in the house? A. She proposed to me that they should come to the house, and I said"That is a thing I by no means approve of;" I did not mumble that, she perfectly understood it, because the answer came immediately, "Very well, Sir," and on the same afternoon my house-maid went to ask whether the female servant whom I wanted to sleep with Jane Thompson, could not come - I expressed my disapprobation in a tone that she could not have avoided understanding, and she said, "Very well, Sir."</p>

Dorset-street - I watched them. and saw something pass into Rickwood's hands over the area rails, and they turned into a stable-yard which leads to Crawford-street; I pursued, and saw Rickwood throw down a piece of meat; I cried Stop thief! - they were stopped at the top of the mews by two men; I brought them back, and took up the meat, which was a leg of mutton and a small piece - I went to the area, and the person who had been there had made his escape - there was a ladder down the area.</p>

On the 17th of August, about two o'clock, he was leaving my shop with some dirty linen; I searched his bundle, and found a pair of child's double soled boots; I asked him how he came to put them there - he said he had an order for them on the Sunday before, from a neighbour, I think he said, next door to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had he not before that sold two pairs of boots and shoes to a gentleman? A. He never took but one pair from me, by coming and saying he wanted a pair for a gentleman. I did not want to get his indentures cancelled - it was not because he was an apprentice from a school, and the consent of the Trustees was wanting, that I did not have it done; I do not know Mr. Hudson; the prisoner said he had a pair of boots ordered from him, and he was taking them to him.</p>

I had one key in my pocket; I cannot tell why I left the other key in the door - there was a pane of glass broken; I had no other lodger - I did not leave the key near the broken pane, for him to put his hand in and take it; I met him in the street about half an hour afterwards, and gave charge of him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? A. Five years, as a customer - I have always had a very good opinion of her; my apprentice is not here - he served her while I was up stairs; I had gone for another shawl - she took away four or five parcels; I was not there when she went out, and do not know that she took them in her bag; I had sent to her house before - I sent there to ask if she had not by mistake got something that did not belong to her; I thought it was a mistake; the person I sent met her, and saw her before I did - it is generally the case, that when a person receives anything they wrap it in a wrapper.</p>

Yes - the prisoner had a bag, and took five parcels - I went to her house with the witness, after the man had been sent with the message - she had time to have put anything away; I asked if she had not taken a shawl in mistake - she brought down her pledges, and shewed them to me, and there was the wrapper of my shawl.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What relation are you to Jones? A. His mother is my first cousin - I known him from his infancy; he managed the business of that shop; but since March last I have declined taking in pledges - Mr. Goddard was my partner, but he died in January, 1827; his executors have no claim on the proceeds of the trade - I have a claim on them - the accounts are still open - I do not know of my own knowledge when this watch was pawned, but this is the duplicate of it - it was written by my foreman, who is not here - I have not made any exertion to get him here; the watch might have been pawned when Mr. Goddard was in partnership with me - I cannot of my own knowledge tell how long this ring has been in my shop, that might have been when Mr. Goddard was my partner - I told the prisoner he might use this carpet bag to put his clothes in; here are three books I charge him with stealing; they were pledges, but I did not take them in; they might have been there in Goddard's time - Jones had not pawned them himself, for they were there before he came into my service; I had seen them with other books, and I had taken these books down to look at; I attend at the shop sometimes - I had looked at these books in 1827 - it is Kenilworth; I do not know whether there is another edition of it in my shop - these were pawned for 5s. - I have not the duplicate here, it is only from recollection I speak - the copy I saw may have been redeemed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went to Baxter's lodging and found her at home? A Yes. I believe Jones was there, by seeing his clothes - the books were on the piano-forte. Mr. Cameron's shopman brought the watch; Jones lived in the house which these things were taken from - I was only there occasionally, but he slept there - he never gave orders; I directed an elderly woman who was there to provide for the house - I did not know till afterwards that Baxter used to come and dine there - it was not with my knowledge or consent - she told me that the watch should come home next day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever seen it in the shop before? A. Yes, he used to wear it; I saw him wear it about a month, and any one might see it - I should not have pawned it if I had not thought it had been his own - I have taken out this umbrella on a wet day - I lived at Mr. Cooper's nine months - he did not know much of the business - there was one man and a lad there; the foreman and I have had goods on trust, and entered them in the day-book, but not without Mr. Cooper's knowledge - I have bought articles of wearing apparel, or anything I wanted; I have seen this ring several times in the shop before Jones wore it - I have taken it in myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say you have seen this woman, and called her Thornton? A. I have heard Jones call her so; he told me her name was Thornton - that was not when she was pawning anything: she was in the parlour; Jones and the servant were there, but Mr. Cooper was not - I never saw her have any coffee or dinner - she had no acquaintance with Mr. Cooper; I did attend at Bow-street - the Magistrate said, at the first examination, that he thought the case could not he made out, without admitting Baxter as a witness; I do not know that I ever called her Thornton myself.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Cooper. I have seen Baxter at the shop; she used to pawn in the name of Thornton, but at home she went by the name of Baxter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is anything more common than for persons who come to pawn things, to give a name that does not belong to them? A. No - I knew her name was Baxter, and knew where she lived; she came to see Jones there - Jones used to be master in the shop; when Baxter came there she used to have tea sometimes, by his invitation, and sometimes by the servant's- we did not call Jones master; I have carried letters to her from him; if he trusted her with a gold watch, she could not know but that it was his own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Mr. Cooper occasionally lend him articles to were? A. No - he did wear them, but not by Mr. Cooper's knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. COOPER. After Jones had left, there were some duplicates found in a pocket-book in his box; I saw them found - they do not relate to any of these articles, but when people come to redeem an article, they bring a duplicate, and the two duplicates are pinned together; that shows me that a certain sum of money has been received, and these show me that he has not accounted for the money - I found this letter on the back counter, in his hand-writing - it is addressed to me, and signed by himself.</p>
               <p>Honoured Sir, - My conscience will not allow me to look my benefactor in the face, since I have behaved so villainous to one who has been a father to me; the reason for my absconding is, that I have worn a gold watch in the name of Steel, and I have had it stolen from me by a woman whom I have loved. Adien, dear Sir, I remain your unhappy and wretched slave R. Jones.</p>
               <p>N. B. By the time you receive this I shall be numbered with the dead; I have borrowed 2l. from the till, which my brother will pay for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then you got from this document the knowledge that he had borrowed a watch? A. Yes; I never lent him that or anything else to wear; I never saw him wear a watch or anything that was in pawn in the shop; he had a watch of his own, I believe - he said it was his; I did not see him with one when he came into my service - he might have one: I cannot tell how long it was before I saw him wear one; when he came into my service he was in humble circumstances - I think it was a common metal watch, a dirty yellow colour - I think I have seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it, when you have just sworn to the colour of it? A. I think I have seen it; I was not sure, but he might have had a watch of his brother's - he may have had a watch; I think I recollect his brother lending him a watch - I did not swear he told me the watch was his own; here is one gold watch-hook - it is one of a pair: I received it from his brother.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I went to No. 17, Craven-buildings, Drury-lane - I found Baxter in the drawing-room with Mr. Cooper who said he had sent for the officer on a charge of felony - he stated that a gold watch had been taken away from his premises, and he supposed Jones was there, and had got it; Baxter denied having anything to do with the watch, but, after a little conversation, she produced the duplicate- I told her I must search the bed-room; she refused me at first; I then heard the window go up - she then opened the door herself, but did not say anything at that time; that had been before I went, I suppose - she only said he was not on the premises; I searched, and found the bed-room window open - I looked out on the leads, but there was no person there; I went round Wych-street to stop the person from coming out, as he must have gone without a coat and hat, but I could not find him - Mr. Cooper then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110154"/>sent my brother officer to some other places, and he went on the adjoiniug houses, and at length found Jones in a cellar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How was he dressed? A. He had no coat or hat on - I have no doubt of his having been in bed there. Baxter at first denied it, but she gave us the duplicate soon after - in searching the premises the second time I found a pocket-book of Baxter's, and part of a gold watch-hook in it; I did not know whose book it was, but she asked me if I had found a pocket-book; I said Yes, and she said there was a watch-hook in it belonging to Mr. Cooper.</p>
               <p>MR. COOPER. I found the duplicate of a watch-hook in the drawer.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Matthews, on the 27th of July, to these premises; I saw Baxter - she denied having any knowledge of the watch, but afterwards gave up the ticket; we went in to the room, and found the window open, but Jones was gone - these two rings I found in a red box, in a chest of drawers in the front room, and this ring was in another part of the room - this carpet bag was in the back room and these boots; I found Jones in a cellar - I think he had shoes on; I found these rows of beads in the drawers - a scentbox and a thimble in different parts of Baxter's room; she said they were her own - I found this umbrella in the back room, against the fire-place.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Do you know these boots? A. Yes, Jones brought them from the shop - they were in pawn for 4s, and he had them repaired.</p>
               <p>JONES' Defence. My cousin having allowed me the privilege of drawing things from the warehouse, I took the liberty of wearing this watch; and I took the liberty of drawing money, provided I accounted for it; the cameo ring, I can assure you, I purchased of the person who used to pawn it, and I gave 12s. for it - Sarah Gibbs was in the shop at the time, and Smith came in soon afterwards; Mr. Gray can swear to seeing it on my finger - I told him what I gave for it; he doubted whether I had not given more, and he inquired of the housekeeper, who said I gave 12s. for it - the umbrella I have not paid for, but I was in the habit of having things, and entering them in the day-book; and, provided I accounted for them, Mr. Cooper never denied me anything; the boots are what Smith said just now, they were never Mr. Cooper's - I bought them in the shop; the watch I had worn I suppose five months- Mr. Cooper must have seen it, as he frequently asked me what it was o'clock, and I have taken it out.</p>

The Prisoner had been four or five months in her service; I missed a pair of stockings from the wash for about two months; I made repeated inquiries of the prisoner - she always denied any knowledge of them. On the 21st of July, in consequence of missing some other things, I went into her room, and I found my stockings in her box, which was unlocked; I called my sister - we both saw them, and knew them; they were marked and numbered - we came down, rang the bell, and called the prisoner, and asked how she came by my stockings in her box; she denied any knowledge of them - I said, "I will convince you they are there;" I took her up, but the box was then locked, and when she opened it the stockings were gone - in a few days they were found in a cistern.</p>

On the morning of the 29th of August, about half-past two o'clock, I was sitting in my box and received information of some persons robbing a house in Phoenix-street; I went there but saw no one - there was a ladder against one of the houses, I went up it, and went down the middle house of the three; I there found a door fastened, and broke it open but found no one; I went up stairs again and found in one room a coat, a hat, and a pair of shoes, with a quantity of lead.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110160"/>- this was in the middle house; I wentup the ladder again and heard some one say, "Here they are." I sprung my rattle, and saw the prisoners coming along the parapet. I took Harris, and two other persons took Coltney, he was without coat, hat, or shoes; he asked for them, and those in the house belonged to him; there was nothing found on the prisoners, but a knife was found in the room, and ten pieces of lead.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 22d of August, I was crying half-past twelve o'clock in Hackney-road - some one called me; the watchman said "This man has been robbed in the second court in Kingsland-road" - the prosecutor did not appear drunk - he spoke very well; when the Bow-street officer went, I saw the two prisoners - the prosecutor did not know them till they got up, and put their clothes on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Jefferies, the officer, say he would have nothing more to do with it? A. Yes, in coming out of the court he did say so; the prosecutor was there, and must have heard it; he was rambling on at a terrible rate - no property was found - not on any man; he said he had been robbed in the last house, and his property was brought and put into another house.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I went to the house about ten minutes past two o'clock - the prosecutor said he had been robbed of a suit of clothes - we knocked several times, but could get no admittance; when we got in, we found the two prisoners in bed with a young man; the prosecutor swore to Mears, but not to Hibbert till about half-past ten o'clock the next morning - they denied having anything to do with him: he appeared sober at two o'clock, when he spoke to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search both the houses? A. We searched two houses - there was a third house we did not go into.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not accuse a man named Williams? A. Yes, at Worship-street; I was in Williams' company, but did not drink; I drank a pint of beer or so at two or three houses; the prisoner was outside the office when Williams was there; he was about four yards off; he came and asked me for 3s. to pay for brandy and water which he had when we were drinking - I refused, and he said he would take me up for taking bakers' sacks; I had seen him before he came up to me; I had been looking for him for a fortnight: if I had not seen him he would not have spoken; it was Williams struck me, not the prisoner - he was with him - that was on the 19th.</p>
               <p>Q. The sack was taken on the 21st? A. Yes - I prosecuted two men here last November.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We drank together on the Tuesday; he said Williams had robbed him; we went to seven public-houses, and were drinking from two to eleven o'clock; there glasses of brandy and water were scored to us; I left him, and next morning the landlady called on me about it; I went to the office to ask him for it - he said he would not pay it.</p>

Yes, he came in with you, I am sure; I went into the parlour, and as I was coming out again the officer and the gentleman came in with you; he went away directly - my uncle had been in the shop before, and he came in again, and kept the people from the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were two gentlemen who saw me pick up the stockings, and they came in and said"You have got some property which a person stole and ran away with;" I said "I have picked it up;" they said"Come into the shop, and clear yourself;" I turned back, and went into the shop, and in five minutes the officer and a gentleman came in, and asked what was the matter, as there was a mob round the door - these two gentlemen are kept out of the way.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I produce two tea-spoons and a salt-spoon, pawned with me by Knight; he offered them - I rather suspected him, and he said he would fetch his mother; he went and fetched Hawkins, who said they had been left her by her brother - this was on the 2d of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>HAWKINS' Defence. I will tell the truth about them - I had been up Piccadilly to help a woman to a coach; she gave me a shilling, and I returned and met Knight, who said that young Sage had given him these spoons to get some money; and the gentleman would not take them without some one went to speak for them, and I went - I know nothing about them; Sage was outside the door, he sent him with the spoons, and said they were for his master; the spoons had been there two or three hours before I went.</p>
               <p>KNIGHT's Defence. I was at work, picking potatoes, and Sage said "I have three spoons of my masters;" I asked who his master was - he would not tell me, but he asked me to go and pawn them; I did so - they would not take them of me; I came out, and saw my aunt passing by - I asked her to go and speak for me, which she did.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 28th of June I was in South-street Bethnal-green at twenty minutes past two o'clock in the morning; and saw two persons go down Hart's-lane towards Bennett's-place; I could not see anything with them, but just as they had left me I saw a piece of lead lying near Mr. Watson's gates; I took that up; I then saw another piece in the kennel - I took them both to the watch-house: I came back and saw the two prisoners walking and talking. At past three o'clock I went again to the place and found two more pieces of lead among some timbers; I sprung my rattle; another watchman came, and we took the lead to the watch-house - I came back again and saw the two prisoners walking near the same place; I then looked about and found another piece of lead in a stone-mason's yard; I took that, came back again, and just before five I saw the two prisoners come to the place walking and talking, and looking towards where the lead had been; I said to a man, "I don't like those two lads, I have some suspicion of them;" we took them, but found nothing on them but three knives, a button book, and a handle of a door; one of the knives was sworn to.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. What part of Broad-street was this? A. A few yards from George-street; I was not accusing the girls of taking it; I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been up late settling some business - I was returning home, and saw the prosecutor pulling three girls about, and accusing them of taking his handkerchief - I passed on, and soon heard the cry of Stop thief! I turned round, he came up, and accused me of taking it; if I had, it must have been found on me or in the street.</p>

On the 8th of July, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I was at the door putting some goods into the cart, and when I returned I missed a piece of bacon - I saw it again in ten minutes under the prisoner's coat; I knew him before, but he was not in my employ; he had not left the shop; I took it from him; when I first asked him, he said he had not got it - I asked him again, he denied it; I opened his coat and took it from there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Did he not say anything about it? A. No; he said he wanted 1 oz. of tea, and he put down a shilling to pay for the tea - the bacon was not in his hand; his coat was buttoned, and his hand against it; he did not put the bacon on the counter and the money to pay for it - I did not put it under his coat again, and call my man to see where it was, and say,"Now you can swear you saw it under his coat;" my man came before the bacon was put down at all; I served him with the tea, and then charged him with the bacon - he did not say he had no notion of taking it without paying for it - but he said afterwards, he would do anything if I would forgive him, he did not offer to pay for it till I found it on him - he then said he did it for want.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the shop, and saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's parlour - I knew him, and said, "I am very sorry to see you here Lane;" he denied his name several times, but I knew him very well; I said to the prosecutor, "What is your intention;" he said, "I give you charge of him, take him to a Magistrate;" the prisoner then went on his knees and begged for mercy, and said, "You don't know my circumstances;" I found near 16l. on him.</p>

I saw a piece of bacon which I thought would suit my family; I took it up and put it under my arm; I then had some tea, and paid for it; the prosecutor said, "What have you got here?" I said, "A piece of bacon, which I intend to pay you for;" I put it on the counter and half a crown to pay for it - he then took it up, put it under my coat, and called the man, and said,"Now you can swear."</p>
               <p>MR. HENRY HAINES. I am an auctioneer and appraiser,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110179"/>and live in Fore-street. I have known the prisoner more than twenty years - I have had several transactions with him to a considerable amount, and during that time he has always conducted himself in an honest and proper manner; he has seven children, and his wife is now pregnant.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN to MR. SOFTLEY. Q. Did you say to Mr. Haines that it would be a great injury if you did not convict this man? A. No; I said it would be a great injury if I did not appear against him; he wrote to me, wanting me to make a flaw in the indictment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say, that in consequence of some letter written by somebody? A. Yes, because they wanted me not to appear; Mr. Haines came to my place, and began a conversation on the subject of this prosecution - the letter came by post from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN to MR. HAINES. Q. Do you remember going to the prosecutor's? A. Yes, and he said to me, that it would be a great injury, if he did not succeed in convicting the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure those were the words he used? A. Yes; I went to him and he said, it was his duty to prosecute, but in consequence of his family, I hoped he would be as lenient as he could; I was very cautious in my expression - this was about ten days ago.</p>

I was called at a quarter before ten o'clock to take the prisoner at a public-house in Ratcliff-highway; I asked if he had any silver, he said, Yes - I asked if he had any gold, he said, No; I took him to the watch-house, and found two sovereigns on him - a man named Hogg gave charge of him, but I do not know his Christian name; he said, he had lost two sovereigns, and he swore to the piece of paper they were in - he is not here.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the sovereigns from the prisoner in the piece of paper - the prosecutor said he had been out all day, and the prisoner took them from him; the prisoner said they were his own, and he had received them from his master by the Dog and Duck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came from Sunderland with one sovereign and eight shillings in my pocket, which was to pay the ship; instead of which, I worked my passage; the prosecutor came to my house at Deptford, and asked me to go out drinking with him; we went to several public-houses and drank, and then came to Ratcliff-highway - we went to a public-house, and I went to sleep, and so did Hogg - I was taken sick, and went out and came in again, and laid my head down to go to sleep; when I awoke, my hat was gone, and a handkerchief in it - Hogg then awoke up, and said he had lost two sovereigns; I said, "Charles, I know nothing about it."</p>

I asked to look at the corn in the bin, and told him I had seen the same thing done before, but he denied it; I went to the corn-binn - two men were sitting there; they got up, and the corn-bin was full of the same description of corn as this; I called my brother-officer to take charge of the sack and the prisoner Pratt - I went into the tap-room; Gigg and Ball were taking some refreshment. with two other men, who had come before; I said, "Who drove up the two last carts?" they said they did - I said, "The ostler is in custody, and I shall take you;" Gigg said he hoped I should overlook it this time, and it should never happen again; Ball said, "You never saw me." The sack was brought to the Police-office, and Mr. Dean saw it there.</p>

            . I am servant to James Scott and his son - they are in partnership; Gigg and Ball were in their service. I saw a sack with corn in it, which was in every respect like that belonging to Messrs. Scott's - there were oats, beans, clover and chaff in each; Gigg and Ball had their corn measured out to them every week, and they mix it themselves - it is not mixed in the bulk; each of them keeps his own corn, and each takes out corn to give his horses in the day: Gigg has been in the employ eight years, and had a good character.</p>
