I am a bootmaker, of 60, Burton Street, Ratcliffe—at 12.30 a in on May 19th, I went to bed after seeing my house and shop were locked up—I have a cellar-flap outside my shop, and one inside; a person could go through the cellar-flap outside and come up through the other one inside the shop, if the flaps were forced open—about three a.m. I heard a disturbance, as if someone was forcing the door—I got out of bed and looked out at the window, and saw Carey standing at the court opposite—I knew him before—he ran over to two other persons, whom I do not recognise, and then the three ran away; one of them was about the same size as Carey, and one was a bit shorter—I went downstairs, and found that the door was forced partly open, and the look broken; a bolt at the top of the door prevented it from being completely forced—the outside cellar-flap had been partly forced, and partly placed back—an iron shutter was broken off—I gave information to the police.</p>

I am a carman, employed by the Army and Navy Stores—on June 10th I was outside the Stores, and saw the three prisoners—John Sullivan opened one van door, and Daly the other—Daly pulled the box out, and he and J. Sullivan together carried it round to Regency Street—Charles Sullivan followed about a yard behind, keeping a look-out—he said to me, "Say nothing about it"—I took no notice, but when they got out of sight I gave information to the last witness—I did not know them before—I saw them next day at Rochester Row Police-station, in the yard—there were seven men in a row, out of whom I identified the three prisoners—I made a mistake about Daly at first, but I identified him afterwards—I said, "I can't see the third man"—the inspector told me to have another look; I did so, and identified Daly—he was not pointed out to me at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by C. Sullivan.</hi> I picked out the wrong man twice for Daly, but I identified him walking away to the cell.</p>

               <p>two, because it was a long way off; they went to a van, and took out a box like this—the other man walked by the side—they walked up the street with it, by the pawnbroker's—I next saw them at the Police-station with seven or eight other men in a row, and picked them out.</p>

Sullivan, and, to the best of his belief, Daly; but, after the three prisoners were separated, he said he had made a mistake, and Daly was the third man—I was present when Edith Wright identified them all three—when I first spoke to the prisoners about the charge, they made no answer, nor when they were formally charged—on Thursday, the 11th, I found the box—Sullivan lives at 39, High Street, which is about fifty yards from the spot—you come from No. 39, through a court, near which you pass a piece of waste land—Daly and J. Sullivan live in a common lodging-house fifty or a hundred yards from where the box was found—they are about together in the day—they are all three associates, but the two Sullivans are not brothers.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Sando, of Clapton Park—my sister named herself Mrs. Baker—I knew Mrs. Facey—I saw her during her last illness—I was never present when any writing was done during that illness—on Monday, July 1st, I was in the house all night—I left between 6.45 and 7 a.m.—Baker remained—he had been with her all night—I had stayed in the front room—Mrs. Facey's was the back room—Baker came in to me once—he afterwards came through my shop, between ten and eleven, into the parlour—he asked if I would sign my name on this piece of paper—he took it from his pocket—he said Mrs. Facey had asked him to write it—I believe he said it was a will and that Mrs. Facey had left everything to him, and he was not to forget Mrs. Large—I signed, as I did not know any better—I was quite ignorant of anything of that—we were alone in my shop parlour—he took it away—he said, and Mrs. Facey herself had told me, that she had money at the Birkbeck Bank—I saw the bag when he, went to Mr. George—I believe the prisoner was then told to go out of the house, and not to come into it again—I heard of Mrs. Facey's death on the same morning that she died—on July 9th Baker came and asked me to go to Mr. Crossfield's, and I was to say that I had witnessed the deceased sign her name, or else I should get into trouble—I told Mr. Crossfield, in the prisoner's presence, I had seen the deceased sign—that wasalie—I only knew Smith by his coming into my shop for Baker once or twice—I believe Smith worked with Baker—I had seen them together—Smith came in with Baker plenty of times—he came for Baker, because Baker was nearly always there in the daytime—Baker said I should be all right, I should not be punished.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting, practising at 59, Holborn Viaduct—I was directed by the Solicitor to the Treasury to examine documents in this case, including the letter signed "C. Baker," and the document purporting to be Mrs. Facey's will—I had in<lb/>formation that the body of the will was the defendant's writing—I also examined the three receipts signed by the deceased at the bank—the signature of the will bears no resemblance to the proved writing of Mary Deborah Facey, but strongly resembles the writing in the body of the will—the words "Will of" are in the same writing, but in a different ink—the signatures of Smith and Sando are in different ink—under the word "Mary" can be traced "Facey"—I see the outline of the "F," "a," part of the "c," and the "y"—in the signature the first portion of the word "Mary" is very shaky, and as far as the "D" in Deborah, but not naturally, because there is a regular kind of undulation all round the up-stroke of the "D"—that extends to the "e," but from the "b" to the end of the word there is no trembling—it is similar to the latter part of "Deborah" written above—there are strong points of similarity between "Mary Deborah Facey," as written in the body of the will, and the signature underneath—the "h" is rather different, because it is back-handed, but there is no loop to it in the body or in the signature—the signature is nothing like her proved writing—it is of a different character and touch—all these proved writings are of a very fine and light quality, while the others are exceedingly heavy, and correspond with the signature of, and the writing in the body of the will—there is no similarity in the two "Fs"—the deceased's capitals are elongated—the "F" in the will is short and stunted, occupying a greater width—it has a little stroke used across the "F"—it occupies the upper portion of the right-hand side of the letter, and terminates a little below the middle—in the proved "F" that is not so, but the cross starts about the middle of the letter and comes down almost to the bottom—the loop in the "F" in the will, and in the signature, is entirely different, and is an isolated stroke, while in the deceased's writing it is continued from the bottom of the "F"—I can point out other differences. (<hi rend="italic">Photographs and tracings were produced.</hi>) These are tracings from Nos. 3, 4, and 5 (<hi rend="italic">the receipts</hi>)—the words, "Will of" appear to be in the same ink as "Louisa Sando."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant, of 7 and 8, Railway Approach, London Bridge—I was appointed trustee on December 1st—I took possession of a ledger, day book and pass-book, showing the state of his account at the London and County Bank—I do not find the find the name of McCuddy in the ledger, but I do once in the day-book—I do not find in the ledger or day-book any record of the receipt of £4 13s. on July 18th, or £21 4s. 6d. on August 2nd, or £18 7s. 6d on July 30th—here is an entry in the day-book of £14 6s. for goods purchased by McCuddy—I find an account in the ledger headed "Darnell and Son," and on folio 215 there is a record of the payment of £40 on July 20th—I find no re<lb/>cord of any payment of £40 on July 23rd, or of £50 to Darnell and Son on July 27th, or of the receipt from Darnell and Son of £70 on August 3rd, so that in that one account there is an omission of £130 from July 22nd to August 3rd—there is no record of a payment of £24 6s. 8d. to Tyler on July 26th, but goods are credited to Tyler for £2 15s. on June. 15th, and £9 9s. on June 24th—I find no entry of £16 4s.—there is no record of the receipt of £21 4s. 6d. on August 20th—Glass's account and Darnell's accounts are balanced in the ledger; they exactly balance—£6 7s. 2d. is owing by Darnell to the estate, bat the debtor's ledger does not show that; it was never discovered to me by him—he never accounted to me as trustee for those sums, and the discovery was made on a sub<lb/>sequent investigation—the prisoner never handed me any documents purporting to be an account between his wife and himself—I find no mention of it in the books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The transactions with Darnell were somewhat numerous, £40, £30, £45, and so on—there is £35, less allowance, on June 30th, and on June 6th £8 and £160 15s. 3d., £153 in June and £103, less discount, and £173; on June 28th £70, and £6 1s. in July—upto July 13th, inclusive, there is £234, and between July 15th and August 1st £145, less discount; on August 3rd £21 19s. 8d., and on August 14th £25 9s., altogether £100 9s. 8d.—I did not see the prisoner in relation to this matter—the cash received would amount co £6,000 or £7,000 a year.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barmaid—I now live at 63, Gibbon Road, Nunhead—on May 18th I was engaged as barmaid at the Rising Sun for about four weeks—I was there for about three months; during that time the prisoner was manager of the house, and was living there with his wife—Miss Steele was also barmaid; Sherlock was cook, and Thomson was potman; he lived and slept on the premises—I slept on the second floor, in the same room as Miss Steele—the Allisons occupied a bedroom on the same floor—they appeared to live very happily together; the prisoner seemed very fond of his wife—she had been ill; she had broken a blood-vessel—it was the subject of a good deal of distress to him; he was very worried about it—she did not seem to get much better; she had been in bed for two months—she could scarcely eat anything, which worried him very much; he appeared very strange indeed at times—during the latter part of the time, about a fortnight before this happened, he drank some-times to excess—sometimes he would not drink at all for days together, and then he seemed very depressed and strange, more so than when he drank—he did not drink so much, I think, in the week before Mrs. Allison's death; he seemed very much depressed; he said he was going to be a teetotaler, and he did not drink much that week—I heard him say that he kept a pistol to shoot rats, and one night he shot a rat in the bar—I heard him say he would blow his brains out—that was, I think, about three weeks before Mrs. Allison's death—he did not seem to be drinking so very much then; he had been drinking before, but not so very much to speak of—I heard him tell a customer that he shot rats with the pistol; that was about three weeks, or a month, before Mrs. Allison's death—on Saturday, May 16th, I gave a week's notice to leave, to the prisoner—I said, "I wish to leave your employ this day week"—he said, "Very well"—I did not give him any reason, nor did he ask me for one; that was the whole of the interview—I had no conversation with Mrs. Allison in his presence about my leaving—I had been there about three months then—on the Friday, the 15th, as I came downstairs, the cook called me into the kitchen; the prisoner was not present then—on the Sunday after<lb/>noon I went out with Mrs. Allison—I was perfectly good friends with her, and she with me; we were always good friends—we went out at three, and I returned at ten minutes to six, before her; I left her at Buckthorne's—we had a drink together on a steamboat—she was all right when I left her; we each had a brandy and soda, not more while I was with her—she came back about a quarter-past eight; she seemed very strange then; I thought he had been drinking; she was different to what she was when I left her—the prisoner was at home that evening—a Mr. Davey looked in, and Mrs. Sharman, Mrs. Allison's sister—I was attending to my business in the bar—there was nothing strange about the prisoner that night; he seemed about the same that day; he had not been drinking; he was very much depressed in the afternoon, when I and Mrs. Allison went out together; in the evening he was still depressed—he went out with Mrs. Sharman just before closing time, and came back when the house closed, at 11.30—Mrs. Allison was then in the bar; she came home a few minutes after eleven—we were then all four in the bar together—Mrs. Allison asked Miss Steele to get four brandies and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189606220031"/>
               <p>a large, and we had it together; we all drank, including Mr. Allison—we stayed there together—I think it was about twelve when we went upstairs—we were talking about leaving—Mrs. Allison asked me why I left; he was present, and Miss Steele, who was also leaving—Mrs. Allison said we were all comfortable together, we all worked well together, and why not continue in the same way—we did not say we would stay or go then—I did not tell her why I was leaving; I did not make any answer at all, nor did Miss Steele—that would be all that passed, I think, nothing else of any consequence—the prisoner took no part in the conversation, not while we were downstairs—he only had that one drink—about twelve, or a little after, we went upstairs—we helped Mrs. Allison up; she was the worse for drink; of course, she could have got up, but we helped her; we took her into her bedroom—she sat down on the floor by the ward-robe—I took one arm, and Miss Steele the other, to help her, and she sat on the floor; she said she felt faint, and we bathed her face and hands with cold water—whilst we were doing this Mrs. Allison asked Mr. Allison to get four glasses of port; that would be a glass each—he went and got it—he had to go down two flights of stairs to get it—he brought it up, and some biscuits, and we drank it—I don't know whether he drank his, but I know Mrs. Allison, and Miss Steele, and I drank ours; he poured it out in glasses; he carried the glasses all in one hand, and the biscuits in the other—Mrs. Allison did not eat her biscuit; he asked her to—he said, "Try and eat it; it does worry me so to see you not eat, and not get better"—he seemed down-hearted and very miserable, and he sat down in a chair by the open window for a little while, and then Mrs. Allison made some re<lb/>mark; I cannot recollect what it was—I heard her speak, but I did not hear what she said—he made a response to her remark—he said, "I should think no more of it than this," and with that he threw his hat out of the window into the street—it was a felt hat; the hat that he always wore—Mrs. Allison saw him throw it out, and she laughed, and asked me to go downstairs and get it—I did so, and brought it back—at this time the house was locked up—I had to go down and unbolt the door, and run to the corner of the street where the hat lay, and then come back and bolt the door again, and bring it back—Mrs. Allison was sufficiently herself to notice this—I gave the hat to the prisoner when I brought it back, and he put it on—he was still sitting on the chair by the window—while we were in the bedroom, I think about one o'clock, something was said by the prisoner about my father having committed suicide, and that upset me, as it always does, and I began to cry—the prisoner said, "Don't cry; I knew poor Peter," that was my father—and Mrs. Allison kissed me and said, "There is always a home for you here"—that was just before the hat was thrown out, just before I left—on leaving them I said, "Good-night" to both—I left Mrs. Allison still sitting on the floor by the wardrobe, and Mr. Allison sitting on the chair by the window—Steele and I were both friendly, and so were Mr. and Mrs. Allison—I did not hear my name mentioned by them before I left the room, only about my leaving—Mrs. Allison said, "Miss Steele is going to stay on," and he said, "I think you had better go: I think you had all better go"—about ten minutes afterwards, when in my bedroom I heard the sound of a report; that was the first thing I heard; it was as if it came from the street, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189606220032"/>
               <p>I looked out of the window—directly after that Mr. Allison came to our bedroom door; it was shut; he did not open it—he said, "Good-night, girls"; and he said something after that, but I could not make out what it was; it sounded as if he said it hurriedly; I thought it was, "Now, I shall finish myself," but I am not sure—I have given evidence before the Coroner and before the Magistrate, and I then stated what it was, I heard him say; it sounded like, "I have finished one, and now I will finish myself," having said that, he ran back to his own room and locked the door—I did not see him at that time, but I recognised his voice—when I first heard it, I called "Police," and said, "Did you hear that?"—there was a policeman standing at the corner—Miss Steele and I then left our room, and threw ourselves against the door of his room, and broke the door open, and just as the door yielded, I heard a second report—when I got into the room I found Mrs. Allison lying by the wardrobe on her back, in about the same place as I had left her—there was a dead light in the room; the gas had been turned down a little—I noticed Mrs. Allison's forehead bleeding; he was lying on the hearth-rug by the fireplace, oppo<lb/>site to her, about two yards from her; I knelt down by him, and put my arm under his back, and raised him up a little—he suddenly jumped up to his feet, and ran across the room; I followed him; he went towards the dressing-table; I did not notice that he had the pistol in his hand, but, when he left the dressing-table, he had it in his hand; he turned towards me—I could not tell whether he loaded it or not; I did not notice him loading it; he turned it towards his head; I wrenched it out of his hand—he tried to get it away from me again, and he had got it up to his shoulder, and it went off and burnt my right cheek—he was standing in front of me; he was pointing it to his breast; I was wrestling with it, trying to get it away, and I knocked it, and it went off—it was pointed to himself at that time; he did not point it towards me, I was so near to him—I tried to get it from his hand when I saw he was going to shoot again—when I first came into the room I did not see anything in his hand, or when he jumped to his feet; he went towards she dressing-table; he might have taken it from the dressing-table; when he was by the dressing-table I saw it in his hand, and it was smoking from the barrel before the shot went off; I can't say if it was a single-barrelled pistol, I don't understand it—I don't recollect his reloading it; I did not see him reload it; the fire of the pistol just passed my cheek—I felt dizzy, as if I was going to faint, but I did not just then—I walked a little way across the room to the door, and then I fell, and I remember no more until I came to myself at the hospital—I did not see Miss Steele come into the room after me; I saw her when I had got my arms trying to raise him up; she was kneeling down by Mrs. Allison—I did not see Sherlock in the room—I do not remember the policeman coming into the room—I remember Thursday, May 14th; the prisoner and his wife were together in the bar, just about closing time, about twelve, and I heard him say he did not wish her to drink in the bar, and she said she would; I heard him call her a bad name—she cried, and said it was not right to call her by that name, and I went to him and said it was a shame to call her a name like that, and he said that was his busi<lb/>ness, I was not to interfere—that was the end of it, as far as I knew—I did not hear them make it up again—after that,</p>

               <p>Miss Steele and I heard them quarrelling in their bedroom; we heard them from our bedroom; they were quarrelling when we went to sleep—next day (Friday) they seemed to be on very good terms; they had a drink, I know—that was the week in which he was going to be a tee-totaler—I did not see him have any drink during the day, not till that night—he had not had much to drink—I saw him hare one drink—nothing was noticeable with Mrs. Allison with regard to drink that night—she had not had any drink to attract my attention; she did not seem the worse for drink on the Thursday night—on Friday I heard no refer<lb/>ence to the quarrel—Mr. Allison did not sleep at home on the Friday night—Mrs. Allison could not go to bed that night—she slept on the couch in the sitting-room the whole night—she opened the house at six next morning—I was not down—we came down at eight—Mr. Allison had then returned—he came in just as we got down—he came in at the same time—I saw him come in—he made no statement in my hearing as to where he had been, but in the morning he said he was going to Tilbury, to see a friend who was going to Australia—I heard him say that to Mrs. Allison, and that he had lost the last train from Tilbury the night before, and that was the reason he had not returned—he seemed in his ordinary senses on that Saturday morning—he had not taken any drink at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We had a customer who came to the house on Friday, who went away to South Africa—I am engaged to be married—the prisoner and my engaged went to Tilbury on Friday morning about nine, to see that man off, and when he came back on Saturday morning he said in my hearing that he had missed the last trail from Tilbury—my sweetheart was with him the whole time, as far as I knew—I had never seen the pistol before the night of the 18th; before the Magistrate I called it a revolver; I don't understand what it was; I don't know how it is loaded—on the Thursday night, when I heard the quarrel<lb/>ling, our door was shut, and their door also, as far as I knew—I could distinctly hear the quarrelling—I heard no quarrelling on the Sunday night—when I left the bedroom Mrs. Allison kissed me, and said, "Good-night"—when I left the bedroom, they appeared to be on the best of terms—I was very much upset when I found Mrs. Allison wounded—I have a distinct recollection of everything that took place—the pistol was not aimed at me—I was struggling with him when the third report went off—he was pointing it towards himself as I wrenched it away—there was no reason why he should try to injure me—the relation between him and me was simply that of master and servant, manager and barmaid—there was no foundation for jealousy on Mrs. Allison's part—she was anxious I should stop, and he was anxious I should go, because there was to be a clean sweep made—on May 14th, when the quarrel took place in the bar, he had lost his temper a good deal; he was sober; he had not been drinking that day—I saw him have drink in the evening, not beyond a pint of bitter; he had been drinking the day before—he was rather irritable the whole of the day, on the 14th—he had all kinds of drink on the 13th—the beginning of that quarrel was because he did not like his wife drink<lb/>ing in the public bar—I went to this house in consequence of an adver<lb/>tisement—she was then in the bar with Mr. Allison, and he engaged me to go en the Saturday, and when I went they told me she was very ill; she had suddenly broken a blood-vessel—I only stopped one day,</p>

               <p>and then went to the Shakespeare, a public-house in the neighbourhood—Mr. Allison sent to me there, and said it was very unkind of me to leave while his wife was ill, and would I come back; and I then went back—at that time and till the night of the 17th, Mrs. Allison was always in a deli<lb/>cate state of health, as far as I could see, that preyed a good deal on the prisoner's mind, it worried him very much; I heard him say, "I shall throw myself off the roof of the house if Mrs. Allison dies"—that was im<lb/>mediately after I went there, when she was lying seriously ill in bed—she did not eat anything, she could not eat her meals at all—a little drink very soon affected her—he frequently begged her to eat more—he tried to tempt her with little dainties, but she could not eat—he has often com<lb/>plained to me that he could not sleep at night—many a morning he would get up and go out in the pouring rain for two or three miles' walk in his shirt sleeves, and then go to bed again, in order to tire himself out, and make him go to sleep; I have seen him come in wringing wet, after tramp<lb/>ing out—if he was sober it would be just the same—he would be a teetotaler for days together, and then break out—he used to be very depressed, and he would take some brandy to enliven his spirits, because he got so miserable; sometimes it would be one glass, sometimes two, and sometimes he would continue drinking the whole day—I have heard him speak about his two dead brothers—I have heard him speak of his brother Robert, who committed suicide; I have heard him say that he felt tempted to do what Robert did; that was said when he was sober; I never heard him speak about it when he had been drinking; it was while he was discussing his wife's illness with me, and she did not appear to get better—Mrs. Allison has told me that she had tried to find this pistol, because he had threatened to take his own life—we tried together to find the pistol on Sunday morning, about a fortnight previously.</p>

Fetter and Galpin as a page; then he was at an hotel at Clapton, and ever since he has been engaged at public-houses—when he was about twelve he stopped away from school, and slept all night in an iron water pipe, where they were putting down the main pipes in Milford Road—I threatened to punish him for that—at that time my daughter Caroline was living at home—he got a knife, and threatened to cut his throat—I did not punish him, I chastised him—I gave him a good talking to—I was not present when he took the knife out—Caroline told me of it—as a boy, he was always very excitable—my wife's maiden name was Inglis—she had two brothers, Robert, who died in a lunatic asylum, and James, whom I lost sight of—he left his situation, and used to go wandering about, through a religious mania; he used to go about preaching; he was very religious—I did not see him when he was going about; beyond that, there was nothing extraordinary about him, as I saw—Inspector Digby called on me and gave me a full statement about him—I don't know whether, James is living or not—my wife has been attended by Dr. Burns, of Edmonton, fourteen or fifteen times, about eighteen months or two years ago—in consequence of what Dr. Burns said to me she was removed, from London, and I sent her to Clacton-on-Sea—she was there about fourteen months—I went there to see her—I had a sanitary job there, and went to see her—she was better there than at Edmonton—I understood she was suffering from religious mania; she did not recognise Dr. Burns—he asked her what was the matter with her, and she said she did not know—she is still living with me there—she is here to-day—I work in London, and go down to Clacton occasionally—she manages the house—one Sun<lb/>day she was quite raving; that was at Edmonton—before she went to Clacton she was very hysterical, and I thought it high time to go for a doctor—she was screaming, and very mysterious; I thought she was going out of her mind—she was walking from room to room, downstairs and up-stairs, and screaming out very loud, and using wild, stupid words; it seemed to me that she thought someone was coming after her.</p>

I am a Fellow of the London Royal College of Physicians, and Physician to the Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic in Queen Square—at the request of the Solicitor to the Treasury, I examined the prisoner in the gaol last Tuesday, with a view to his mental condition—I found no evidence of insanity at present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in court most of yesterday, and I have been in Court this morning—there is such a thing as hereditary insanity and recurrent insanity—I have heard the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution, and I have had furnished to me some documents containing the evidence that has been given to-day—a man may be subject to a fit of insanity at one time, and afterwards be sane—I think it quite possible that the prisoner may have had a sudden attack of homicidal man is on the night of May 17th, looking to his family history—it sometimes comes on with all the abruptness of an epileptic attack, without any premoni<lb/>tory warning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q. By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. What is homicidal mania? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A man having certain tendencies will occasionally, without warning or provocation, commit a certain act of violence, sometimes suicidal, sometimes homicidal; something comes over him abruptly, suddenly, without any apparent reason, leading him to commit some act of violence, he being absolutely unconscious of the act; he may know what the act is, but not the quality of it—a gust of impulse comes over him so suddenly that he is not in a position to weigh or balance whether such a thing is right or wrong—under a homicidal impulse of that kind, I think it is perfectly clear that he would not know the nature and quality of the act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. Deprived of reason, loss of will, and loss of con<lb/>trolling power; that would practically be his mental condition; bereft of reason and power of control.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I say it is possible; I cannot go further than that—in saying "I think it possible," I am influenced by this, the family history of the man, and his own personal habits being of such a nature as to make him a person who would be liable to an attack of homicidal mania; by habits I mean drinking habits; then I gather from the evidence that he was anxious and worried about his wife's condition, and even a few hours before the act was committed he seemed to bear her no ill-will, and was anxious about her condition generally; then we know that, up to within fifteen minutes of committing the act. he seemed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189606220044"/>
               <p>to be in the same sort of relation with his wife, there was no change; the barmaids, in an adjacent room, heard no sound of quarrel, although on a previous occasion they had heard quarrelling, with both doors shut; therefore it would appear that there could have been, at all events, no violent altercation between them; and that, with the, fact of the silence, makes it possible, as I have said, that the man may have committed the act under the influence of one of those sudden impulses—I do not think any of the other evidence is at all significant, except to show his unstable nervous system, his threatening suicide and talking of suicide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The family and personal history might also make it more probable that he would give way to violent gusts of passion; that comes very closely to irresponsibility—I find no evidence, before the act, of his having any ill-will towards his wife; and from that, I say, it is possible that this act may have been done without any feeling of ill-will—I also lay stress upon the absence of any sounds of quarrelling within the fifteen minutes; in fact, I think the whole question is whether he did this thing under a homicidal impulse, or whether it was done without it—we know nothing of what occurred to induce him to commit it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, how would it be consistent with not being conscious, that the man, an hour afterwards, says to the surgeon at the hospital, "Have I finished the job? is she dead? if not, I am sorry for it"?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a very difficult question for me to answer; but I have had facts in other cases showing that after the man had made known the cir<lb/>cumstance, he subsequently forgot everything about it—his saying he was sorry certainly looks as if he was sorry he had not killed her; it is a doubt<lb/>ful case in my mind; my explanation of that would be that we don't know the workings of his mind at the time; that sort of thing occurs again and again in these homicidal acts—we cannot know exactly what takes place in the man's mind; it may be some sudden thought that compels him irresistibly to do the act, and for some time the notion may linger in his mind—the only question is, whether the notion is a thing generated in his sane mind, or in the mind of a man who is insane—I feel the difficulty fully, and I go no further than saying, "It is possible"—I can<lb/>not affirm it any more distinctly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My examination was confined to his present condition—he did not seem to show so much anxiety as they frequently do in such cases—that led me to examine him more carefully—it did not appear to affect him in the same way—I have heard Dr. Bastian's evidence—I was present in Court yesterday and to-day—I furnished a report to the Treasury—I agree with Dr. Bastian that it is possible the man may have suffered from a sudden attack of homicidal mania at the time this act was committed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think his subsequent statement to the surgeon is consistent with some delusion leading him to suppose that he was justified in entertaining ill-will towards his wife—it looks as if he had an ex<lb/>aggerated idea of jealousy at the time he committed the act, which idea</p>

I am a clerk in Holy Orders, living at Monte Cristo Mansions, Green Lanes—about 11.50 p.m. on April 2nd, I was in Boiling Road, Dalston, returning home from Dalston Junction—I went into a urinal—as I was coming out the prisoner stood across my path, and looked up into my face—I thought he was going to speak to me; he took me off my guard—then a man behind him gave a signal with his hand to some men behind me, and I was immediately taken from behind by the throat and arms, and pulled down into a horizontal position inside the urinal—the prisoner then snatched at my watch—I had just time to put my thumb on the cord—a struggle went on between me and several of them, the prisoner principally; and then the cord broke, and they got my gold watch, of the value of about £2—meanwhile other men were rifling my pockets—they got off this ring in the scuffle; I heard it drop, and I and a policeman afterwards found it together with the other half of this locket—eight or nine other articles were taken from my pockets—the men then separated, and ran off as soon as I could about—most of them went up Boiling Road; it was too dark to follow them—Moore was afterwards arrested, and tried here for taking part in this robbery, and was sentenced—after the robbery, I went straight to the Police-station, and gave a description of some of the persons as far as I could, including the prisoner—I specially gave a description of him—I afterwards received a telegram, and went to Dalston Lane Police-station, and, after waiting in a room, I was called before eight or nine men, and from then a I picked out the prisoner immediately—I was very poorly for a week or fortnight afterwards, from shock and internal strain; I was treated by a doctor.</p>

On the night of June 4th I arrested the prisoner in the Crown public-house, at the corner of Shackle-well Lane—I said I should arrest him for being concerned with John Thomas Moore, already convicted, in a highway robbery, with violence—he said, "All right, governor"—on the morning of the 5th he was placed with nine other men, and Mr. Thelwall immediately identified him as one of the men who attacked him on the night of Thursday, April 2nd—when charged he made no reply—I had been looking for him from the date of the offence, and the first time I saw him was on the Whit-Sunday, but as I had my little child with me, and I could not get assistance, I did not arrest him—he was, with several others, standing outside the Lansdowne public-house, close to his home—on the night of the robbery I saw the prisoner in Dalston Lane, about 10.30—I have known him four or five years—the bottom of Dalston Lane is within twenty yards of Boiling Road—it is just across Kingsland Road—I saw him there with Moore, who was convicted here—no others were with them.</p>

I live at 10, Whitman Road, Mile End; the house is kept by Mrs. Nicholls; her two sons and her daughters live there, and I have three daughters—early on the morning of June 9th my door was opened, and then I saw it shut—I thought one of my daughters had brought some water in, but in about two seconds I heard the landlady scream out to her son and to me for help—I jumped out of bed, and saw the prisoner rushing across the landing and downstairs—I caught him at the bottom; he attempted to strike me, but I hit him and got him down—the door was opened, and the policeman, who was waiting outside, came in, and the prisoner was given in custody—the kitchen window was open; it was closed when I went to bed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). In consequence of information re<lb/>ceived from Mr. Newstead, I caused observation to be kept on No. 20, Bath Street, where William Wiede, the younger, lives, and on 58, Cottage Road, where Henry Wiede lives—on May 19th and 20th I received these two parcels from Detective Shepherd—I took them to Mr. Newstead's premises, and. showed them to Mr. Newstead—one contains a coat, vest, and trimmings, new; the other a coat, vest, and trimmings, and a coat made up—Mr. Newstead sent for William Wiede, the younger, who came into the room where Mr. Newstead, Shepherd, and I were—I told Wiede I was a police officer, and I had received these goods from Detective Shep-herd, which Mr. Newstead had identified as his property—he said, "Yes; quite right; there is no one else in the building knows about it except myself and Henry"—Henry was then called into the office—William said, "Henry knows nothing of the cloth, but he does the trimmings: we used to leave these premises with the cloth wrapped round us"—Henry said, "Quite right"—they were taken to the station and charged—I said, "I am going to your addresses"—William said, "You will find some cloth in the front-room cupboard"—that is 20, Bath Street, Poplar—Henry said, "You will find some on the chair beside the bed"—that would be 58, Cottage Road, High Street, Poplar—I went to 20, Bath Street, and searched the premises—in the room described I found four remnants of cloth, about 102 yards, and numerous other things which Mr. Newstead identified as his property—at 58, Cottage Road, I found a small piece of blue material—I searched the bedroom; I found nothing there—Constable</p>

               <p>Thomson, who was with me. made a communication to me—from there Shepherd, Newstead, Thomson, and I went to 149, High Street, Poplar, the address of Edward and of William Wiede, senior—I saw Edward standing behind the counter—I said, "We are police officers; I have called for the parcel that the little boy just brought round here"—Wil<lb/>liam, senior, came to the front—I said, "We are police officers, and have called for the parcel the little boy brought round here just now"—he said, "We have no parcel; I have seen no little boy; I have no time to attend to you; I must get on with my work"—he then returned into the rear of the workshop—he appeared to hear distinctly—I then went back to 58, Cottage Road, where I found the boy Cosgrove, and returned with him to 149, High Street—in the presence of Edward and William, senior, I said to the boy, "Repeat what you have already told me"—pointing to the elder prisoner, he said, "Mother told me to take the parcel round to you for you to keep, as the police were coming"—William, senior, appeared to hear the boy—he made no answer—the boy pointed and said, "That is the man I gave the parcel to"—I said, "I want the parcel; I must find it"—a younger brother, Frederick, not in custody, ran up the stair-case; I followed as quickly as I could, and he brought the parcel out of the front bedroom on the first floor, wrapped in a towel as it is now (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but not with this twine round it—it contains five pieces of calico and a boy's knicker suit—in the shop I showed the parcel to Newstead—he identified it as his property—I saw Newstead looking at this blue serge jacket and vest—William, senior, was agitated, and going in and out of the shop and the work-room at the back—Edward said, "That is sold to a customer, and the customer will call for it shortly; he will pay £3 10s. for it; that is your cloth, Mr. Newstead; cannot you let us have it? we will pay you for it now"—Newatead was looking round the shop, and saw a quantity of cloth on a shelf behind the counter—this is it—it has all been labelled, after identification, by Mr. Newstead—three or four of the pieces were exhibited in the window—Edward handed the various lengths on to the counter, and assisted Newstead, saying as he took them, "That is yours," "That is Venable's," and so on—amongst the goods on the shelf was this piece of wide check—Edward said, "That is Henry's"—I asked them if they had any receipts for the cloth—they said, "No," they had no receipts; they bought them from Henry and William Wiede—I said, "What have you paid for them?"—they said they paid on the Friday or Saturday—I said, "What did you pay for them?"—they said 4s. 6d. to 5s. 6d. a piece—that some-times Edward, and sometimes the father paid—I took them to Seething Lane Police-station, where I showed the whole of the cloth found at 20, Bath Street, to William, the younger—he said, "Yes, that is quite right"—they were all placed in the dock, and charged with being concerned together in stealing and receiving this cloth, and various other articles—William, the elder, replied, "I did not think you were going to keep us here," and that he had never seen the cloth—the other prisoners made no reply to the charge.</p>

Edward appears to be engaged by William, senior, as a servant—Shepherd was in the shop during part of the conversation—the City police only take notes of conversation in the more serious cases of arson or murder—I took no note of it—I trust my memory—if I notice a material omission in the depositions, I should call the attention of the clerk to it—that is my duty—I had a communication with Thomson, and had seen Cosgrove before going to Wiede, the elder—I had that communication in my mind at the time I was there—I omitted to say the elder Wiede said, "I have never seen a little boy"—I had no object in doing so—I also omitted that Edward said, "We will pay you for it now"—my memory is very clear—I do not think I told the Alderman that Edward said he had paid for the pieces of cloth sometimes—my memory does not improve with age—I did not tell the Magistrate that Edward said the check cloth "belonged to Henry—both Edward and William, the elder, were present—the statement was corro<lb/>borated by both—I have not said till to-day that Edward said he had paid for the cloth sometimes—they were in such agitation—I was calm—I am now—the elder Wiede was throwing himself about the shop in a very excitable manner—I cannot explain the failure in my recollection—the father kept walking from the rear of his shop to his workshop, to and fro.</p>

I have no occupation—I live at 64, Lordship Park, Stoke Newington—I have known the prisoner about ten years—about two months before June 3rd, when I was examined at the Police-court, I received a letter from the prisoner, signed "Phillips," and dated from 28, Brownawood Park, and asking me if I would buy a "Wraxall's Memoirs," in five volumes, for £1 5s., as he had bought two copies, and did not want one—I wrote and told him I had spent all the money I had to spend on books until some more came in, and I could not afford to buy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Twenty-five shillings was a fair price, and not under the value—the prisoner is a book collector; he has a fine library; I have been in it—he understands books thoroughly; he has been buying and selling books all his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> His room is full of books; I was introduced to him as a buyer of books—I cannot say if he has been selling books—he had this valuable library in February, 1895—it was his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, of 40, Brewer Street—on April 8th I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">From H. L. Phillips, F.G.S., asking for certain books to be sent if in good condition, and the cost of binding a fine large paper copy of Percy's MSS., which he possessed, or what they would allow him for it.</hi>) I sent two books—I received these letters from him. (<hi rend="italic">Asking him to send their copy of Percy's MSS., as, if it were nice and bright, he would take it in exchange for his: another letter said he would keep the small copy of Percy's MSS. sent, but returned the two other books sent as they were not up to description</hi>). I had sent my copy of Percy MSS. to him—the two books I sent were valuable first editions, for which there is great demand—I also sent Bishop Percy's "Ballads," at £5—I then received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">From Phillips, stating that the Percy <hi rend="largeCaps">MSS</hi>. did not contain the "Loose and Humorous Songs" and asking for three other books to be sent.</hi>) I sent those three books, which came to £15 15s.—on May 9th I received this letter, asking what I would allow for a large paper copy of Percy's <hi rend="largeCaps">MSS</hi>., which cost originally £13 8s.—I also received this letter.

Young and Co. for the two catalogues, and ordered three books, if nice copies with good bindings.</hi>) We sent one of those books, value 30s.; the other two had been sold previously—I received this letter of April 16th, ordering a number of books, including sixteen volumes of Bacon, carefully packed and carriage paid, if Messrs. Young would accept £18 for them—the price of them was £19 8s. 6d.; so that with the previous 30s., his total indebtedness would have been £20 18s. 6d.; but we only charged £18 for that lot of books, which we sent; that made the total indebtedness £19 10s.—we never got payment—we wrote on May 2nd, but got no answer—Mr. Young, a member of the firm, was in London on May 6th; in consequence of what he said on his return this letter—was written to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Trust love and Hanson, booksellers, of 143, Oxford Street—on January 19th, 1896, I received this letter from the prisoner ordering books—we sent them—we got another letter ordering other books—we got other letters from him) in consequence of which we parted with copies of "Pepy's Diary," the <hi rend="italic">Strand said Windsor Magazines</hi>, "The Portfolio" (three volumes), "The Year's Art," and other books—our account came to £12 4s. 6d. altogether—we had the prisoner on our register at that time as a previous dealer with us—we had no knowledge that he was an undischarged bankrupt—we gave discount for cash—we are supposed to be paid immediately after<lb/>wards—our accounts would go in at the end of each month in the ordinary course—we sent the account to the prisoner—we got no payment, and no answer to our application—I went to the prisoner's house on two occasions, and did not see him—on April 30th I went again, and after waiting for half an hour at the house I saw the prisoner—I said I had called twice previously, and had called a third time, because I was determined to have an interview with him, as I had written for the account, and had had no reply, and I wanted to come to some arrangement as to payment for the books—the prisoner said if I had come for the money he certainly could not pay, because he had not got a <hi rend="italic">mag</hi> in the world—I said it was very strange that he should have ordered books—"Will you pay for the books?"—he said he could not possibly pay anything, and I left on the understanding that be would look through his library, and return some of the books—before his arrest he called on us, and asked me who was making inquiries about him—I told him several people were, and that that morning I had had a letter from Phillips, of Liverpool, asking if I knew anything about him—the, prisoner asked me to write to Phillips, and say he had had dealings with me, and that they were satisfactory—I said, "I shall do nothing of the sort till you have paid my account"—he informed me on that occasion that he was an undischarged bankrupt, and that perhaps I did not know it before—I said I did not, or I should not have sent the books—when I called at his house he said that if I pressed him, my proper</p>

               <p>course was to go to the County Court, and if I went there I should probably have to pay the costs, because he had not any money to pay me, but he would pay me if I would wait—he asked me if I was invited into the house or not; I said I was not invited into the house, but I was invited into the room by Mrs. Phillips—he then said I had rendered myself liable as a trespasser by coming into his house—I said he could go on with that if he liked—he said he had not ordered goods to the amount of £20; that if he kept under £20 he could order goods from thousands of persons, and was not liable (I suppose he meant criminally liable) under the 31st Clause of the Bankruptcy Act, I understood him to say; I think he quoted that—I never got payment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did not read or repeat by heart the section of the Bankruptcy Act—he said he was not liable under that Act, for he kept tinder £20—I had not threatened to take legal proceedings against him—I said payment was very much overdue, and that I wanted it—I did not consider it a criminal act—I did not know then that it was an offence to get credit over £20—he did not say Messrs. Young had threatened him with criminal proceedings, or that he had gone for advice to know whether he had committed an offence—the gross value of the books we delivered to him was £12 4s. 6d., of which he returned books of the gross value of £2 10s. 6d.—when I first saw him he said that if I would give him time he would pay—he said he expected money which had not been paid—I can only trace one previous transaction with him, and that was some time before, for which we were paid or being paid—I was not a partner in the firm then—it was not a very large amount.</p>

The creditors knew of the settlement being made pend<lb/>ing the action, and were satisfied—the prisoner has given a large amount of time during two years to a cycle invention; he was a very ingenious person—he made several hundred pounds out of the tandem bicycle, and put the money into further experiments—I knew he possessed a very fine collec<lb/>tion of books—I did not appear for him in his bankruptcy proceedings last year—I heard the books in the house were sold by the Receiver, be<lb/>cause the prisoner asked me to go and purchase some of them—I defended one or two actions for disputed amounts, and the prisoner paid the debts.</p>

               <p>Adventurers' Exploration, Limited, was a promoting company who formed the British Sheba Company, and went to the trustees; it has not gone very far at present, but we have had applications for shares, and have held over the allotment—the directors will not take their qualification till the thing goes through—we have got the property—the contract to buy it is between the Adventurers Exploration, Limited, and the original trustees of the prisoner's wife's marriage settlement, I suppose—the mine is near Tavistock, on the Tamar—there is machinery there on which a very large sum of money has been spent—the tin got out has been sold for the last year or two; the mine was worked before the company took it over—our company has not worked any tin out of the mine; we have great prospect of doing so—there is a clause in the articles of association to the effect that a bankrupt may not be a director—I put that difficulty to the prisoner, and he said the article was drawn to apply to a member of the Board who became bankrupt, and that it was only future in its operation, and not retrospective; so that an undischarged bankrupt could be a director, but if a director became bankrupt, he would cease to be a director—I did not like it, but I took the solicitor's opinion who was advising us—it was against the spirit of the articles of association, and against the interest of the shareholders, that the chairman should be an undischarged bank-rupt, and yet I accepted the position of vice-chairman—there was one other director.</p>

Shall I fetch a policeman?"—he said, "Give me a coat, I am off"—he took my husband's coat from the hall; his own coat was upstairs, he did not stop to get that—I found lots of blood about the bedroom, and this knife was on the floor; it is bent now; it was straight and clean about half an hour before, when I used it.</p>

Hickling, Washington and Pasmore, solicitors, of 1, Trinity Square, Southwark—they are solicitors to the South Metropolitan Gas Company—on May 2nd, 1895, the prisoner commenced an action against that Gas Company in the Lam<lb/>beth County Court—I produce the summons and the particulars of the claim, showing that he claims damages for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained by him on February 1st, 1895, in consequence of an explosion on Southwark Bridge—on June 18th, 1895, I was present at the trial of the action before his Honour Judge Emden—I took a short-hand note of the evidence given by the prisoner—I produce this correct transcript of my notes—after he had given evidence, a witness was called for him, who gave the name of George Beard, and began to give evidence—Mr. Washington, who appeared for the Gas Company, then admitted that the explosion had taken place, and, in consequence, it was not necessary to proceed further with George Beard's evidence, the only question being as to liability and damages—in the result the Judge found a verdict of £12 for the prisoner—I produce a certified copy of the entry in the minute book of the County Court, containing a record of the judgment—the Gas Company appealed to the High Court on the ground that they were not legally liable—the appeal was heard on November 9th, 1895, and decided against the company, dismissing the appeal, and the damages and costs were paid to Mr. Roland Ward, who acted as the prisoner's solicitor—the prisoner was duly sworn in the County Court before he gave evi<lb/>dence—on April 17th, 1896, our firm received information which led to this prosecution—a warrant was applied for and granted about May 3rd. (<hi rend="italic">The transcript of the shorthand notes of the prisoner's evidence was read. In effect he stated that he was proceeding over Southwark Bridge on February 1st, when he was injured by the explosion; that he was taken to the Mansion House Station, and then went home, and that owing to the explosion he was prevented from working for about five weeks.</hi>) I took down his questions and answers—he said he had been working for the City Sewers, with a man in the court, and that he had been helping Mr. Duncan in that way.</p>

I live at 107, St. George's Street, East—I used to live at 26, Red Lion Street, Poplar—I am a waterman and lighter-man—in the winter time, last year, I saw you in a street leading off Can<lb/>non Street, in the afternoon—I was reading the newspaper—you told me you had been hurt on Southwark Bridge; you did not say how it happened—Sennett and Sullivan came to my house on several occasions for about three weeks in succession, in my absence, my people told me—on a Satur<lb/>day night Sennett came again, and saw my sister, and I walked in at the time—he said, "Mr. Washington wishes to see you"—I said, "What does he want to see me about?"—he said, "You recollect meeting Price on Southwark Bridge"—I said, "No, I did not meet him on Southwark Bridge; I met him coming in that direction"—he said, "If you come along with me, and find George Beard, I shall be over at your house to-morrow morning, at seven o'clock"—he came on the Sunday morn<lb/>ing, and asked me to go to the Club, to try and find Beard, which I did, but I did not find Beard—some few days after that I went reluctantly to Mr. Washington's, with Sennett and Hayter, and I saw Mr. Collier, Mr. Washington's clerk—he said, "Is your name Shannon?"—I said, "I believe so"—he said, "Do you recollect February last year?"—I said, "Yes, I recollect the very severe winter we had"—he said, "Did you see Price walking over Southwark Bridge?"—I said, "No; I met Price com<lb/>ing from that direction"—he put down that statement—I had been three or four nights with a float on the river, and had a little drop more than I ought to have had on the day I went to Mr. Washington's; it was cold weather—Mr. Collier wanted me to say you were not on the bridge; I would not do it—I could not recollect what he said—he wrote something on a sheet of blue paper, and I signed it—the Magistrate at Lambeth asked me, "Have not you read it?"—I told him I did not know what was down there—he said, "Is this your signature?"—I said, "That is partly</p>

               <p>my signature"—Sennett and Morrissy said I would get a ton of money—Sennett and Hayter were haunting my house; I was glad to get rid of them, because it is a respectable neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I met the prisoner I was going towards Thames Street, down Cannon Street, and down the turning leading to Southwark Bridge; I don't know the name of the street—he was coming up from the Surrey side of the river, and I was going towards it; he was coming from the bridge—I did not see the explosion—I did not say I did—I told him, if he was hurt, to go to the hospital—I did not tell him, "Jim, I saw that accident; why don't you go to the hospital?"—I did not tell him I saw the explosion—he had not got his arm in a sling when I met him—it was about four p.m., perhaps, when I met him; I could not swear to the time—I think I said to him, "It is a good job no one was blowed overboard," or something like that—I don't recollect what the prisoner said—I don't think he said, "I will have a go for it"; if he did, I don't remember it—I met the prisoner a day or two afterwards in the City—he did not say he should want me as a witness to say he had been blown up; I do not remember his ever saying that; he looked to me too ill—he did speak—I went by the County Court when the case was heard by accident—I did not go inside—I knew nothing of the action, or anything, when it was coming off—I saw the prisoner outside, and asked him to come and have something to drink, and I partly helped to carry him across the road to a public-house; when I saw the prisoner outside with two others, I knew the case was going on—I believe Jack Munro was one of the two, and I think Duncan was the other—I don't know that Munro gave his name in the witness-box as Beard—I signed every page of this statement when I was drunk; Mr. Washington, might have read it over first—I did not take any notice of what he read—I could not tell you how long that bout of drunkenness lasted, but I have been so, on and off, for some time, on account of a death in the family—I signed my deposition at the Lambeth Police-court, say, on May 5th; I was not then exactly in my proper senses; I was muddled like; I have a little drop extra now and again; I was not drunk—the account I gave to the Magistrate was true; as far as I can say, it was very nearly true—T saw the prisoner coming away from Southwark Bridge. (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition was to the effect that on February 1st he met Price at ten in the morning in Fenchurch Street, and again about four p.m. at the Skinner's Anns, Cannon Street; that he read an account of the explosion from the newspaper to Price, who said he would have a go for it, but did not say that he had been there, or was hurt.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner, in his defence, stated that he was coming over the bridge with Beard and Duncan when the explosion happened; that Seard picked him up, and brushed the mud off him; that lie afterwards met Shannon and Lander, and that some of the witnesses desired to get him convicted because he had taken a great part in the Free Labour Association.</hi>
