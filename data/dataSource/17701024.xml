               <p>Howson Edwards. I am servant to Mr. Labrow. The prisoner came to our house on the 21st of Sept. 1769, he said he had got a customer for some cassia and opium, and wanted my master to trust him, which he refused. My master said he would not send the goods without his man went with them, which, after a great many words, he agreed to; the goods were made up,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240003"/> and I was sent with them. My master gave me the bill of parcels, and ordered me not to part with it without the money. I went with him; when we came into Fore-street or Moorfields he said he had some more goods at his lodgings that was to go to the person that these goods were for, and that he must carry them at the same time; he said if I would go with him to his lodgings he would get a porter that should take them all. I went with him to his lodgings in Still-yard or Still-alley Houndsditch; the goods were put down, he went to fetch a porter, he came back in about half an hour, and said he could not get a porter; he asked me to go with him to get a porter. I asked him if the goods would be safe there; he said yes, so I went with him. He took me to several public houses to see for a porter; at last he bid me wait at the door of a public house for him, that he would be out in a minute. I waited about five minutes, and as he did not come out of the house, I began to suspect him; I went back to his lodgings, and the goods were gone.</p>

On the 28th of September, about ten in the morning, M'Daniel and Clinch, came into my shop and asked to see some lawns. I shewed them several pieces; they bid me less than they cost me, and that made me suspect them. In about three minutes time Brown came into the shop, she took no notice of the other two, not they of her, She asked to see some genting handkerchiefs; I shewed her some, then the other two prisoners went out of the shop, and Brown followed them; they were just gone out of the door when Mr. Lucas brought them back into my shop, and he brought a piece of lawn in his hand. (The lawn produced and deposed to.) I took down this piece of lawn to shew the prisoner. Here is my mark upon it. They all begged for mercy.</p>

I went into a shop opposite to Mrs. Viguers's; I saw them come out at the door, and before they had got any distance from the shop, I went and laid hold of M'Daniel. I took this piece of lawn from under her cloak. I took them all back into the shop. M'Daniel and Clinch begged for mercy, but Brown was very abusive, and threatened me for detaining her.</p>

            , where I supped and staid till about eleven o'clock. My landlord let me in when I came home; I went up stairs, and when I put the key into the lock I found it would not turn; upon trying the latch I found the door was unlocked. I am certain I locked it when I went out. As soon as I opened the door I observed that the inside shutters to one of the windows were opened, which I am sure was shut when I went out; this made me suspect somebody had been in my room. When I went a little farther into the room I trod upon some cloaths; this frightened me, and I ran down stairs to Mr. Hemmings for help. We got a candle and went up stairs; I found the lid of my trunk open, out of which were stolen four waistcoats, two pair of sheets, two scarlet cloth waistcoats, a silk waistcoat, mazarine blue, trimmed with silver, a sattin waistcoat with the lace taken off from the flap of the pocket, a linen waistcoat and a pair of leather breeches. I found a drawer open in my chest of drawers, out of which were taken eleven shirts and a pair of sheets; from the chimney-piece was taken a metal watch and a stand in which it stood; from my bed-room, which was an inner room that went out of this, I missed two gold watches that hung by the side of the window, and a hanger that hung near the watches. Henley is a shoemaker; he had been in my room, and seen me open my trunk; he made my shoes; I knew nothing of Conroy. I applied to Sir

            . On Sunday the 22d of July in the afternoon, as I was standing at my door in Duke's Place, the two prisoners came up to me and asked me if I knew one Solomans, a Jew; I told him there were a great many of that name. They proposed to go to an alehouse to drink, which I did. Henley asked me if I would buy a gold watch. I told him I should like to see it, and made as if I would buy it. They said they had not the watch with them, but they would bring it at nine o'clock to me at the Mitre in Duke's Place; they came accordingly at nine o'clock. We went from there to the Blue Boar, in Camomile-street; we went into a private room, and there Henley pulled out the plain gold watch, and offered it me for 7 l. I bid him six guineas for it. (I had no intention to buy them because I suspected they had stolen them ) they said they would take six guineas; then Conroy pulled the other watch out of his pocket, and offered it for sale; he asked me six guineas for it. I asked them how they came by them; they said they did not expect I should have asked them such a question. They said they had some laced cloaths at home to dispose of. I told them I had not money about me to pay for the watches, but I would go home and fetch the money. I went to one Pagett, a constable, for assistance; Pagett staid at the door while I went into the house. I asked them to let me look at the watches again; Henly gave me one of them; I said I would stop them and the watches. Paget came in and took the watch from Conroy.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live on Snow-hill; I took in the mazarine blue waistcoat, laced with silver, of Conroy, on the 14th of July, about ten at night. He spoke to me in very broken English, and asked me to let him have two guineas upon it. I supposed him to be a foreigner; I had a good deal of difficulty to understand him. I offered him a guinea and a half; he would not take that; I lent him 34 s. I asked him his name, he told me something like Dyane. I asked him where he lived; with some difficulty I understood it to be somewhere near the Seven Dials.</p>

             came into my house on the 27th of September, about seven in the morning and asked me after my wife (my wife was at Hampstead ). I was at Hampstead in the evening when a messenger came to inform me that I had been robbed. When I came home I missed out of a chest, which I left locked when I went out, a green purse, which continued ten crown piece, half a guinea, and a 3 s. 4 d. piece of gold; also a yellow purse, containing about 5 l. in silver. I lost a silver pint mug, a pair of silver salts, a silver cream jug, a pair of tea-tong, a silver tea-strainer, and a silver coral; they were all in the chest. There was a 6 s. 9 d. in the yellow purse that I am pretty certain I have seen since. The lock of the chest had been forced open; I did not see any mark of violence upon the chamber door. Upon the information I received when I got home, I suspected the prisoners; they lived together as man and wife. I got a warrant to search their lodgings; I did not find any of my things there. We took them up, and upon

            . I am housekeeper to Mr. Elliot. Reynolds came to Mr. Elliot's, about eleven in the morning, after he was gone to Hampstead; she went away soon; and came again at one; she had some beer and some shrub then; she went out again quickly. She came again about two, and then she entered into conversation about a woman that had robbed her lodgings. We were in the back kitchen; there is a door in the street opens into the passage; that passage leads to Wild Court; as soon as you come into the passage, on one side of the passage is a door into this back room; then farther is the back kitchen, which has connection another way with the tap-room; it was in this kitchen that she was with me at this time. While we were talking together, one of the lodgers came and asked me if I had opened the chamber door; I was afraid some robbery had been committed, and I was greatly frightened; I cried out that my master was robbed and ruined. I ran up stairs; the back of the chest was broke off, and the place and purses were taken away; I talked of having a warrant, and going to Sir John Fielding's; Mr. Reynolds endeavoured to persuade me not to be alarmed, for probably I should find the things again soon; the prisoner went away soon after.</p>

               <p>Henry Hall. I am servant to Mr. Blundell, who keeps a wine-vault in Duke-street. On the 22d of September, between one and two o'clock. Preston and another man came into Mr. Blundell's vaults in an a great hurry; he called for a pint of wine. Preston bolted the door after him as soon as he came in; he appeared to be a great deal confused; he laid down two sixpences instead of one; he did not stay above three minutes; they went out again in a great hurry; I am certain the prisoner was one of the men; both their pockets stuck out very much.</p>

We went through Mr. Elliot's house into Wild Court; he went to enquire for a man there.

I called for a pennyworth of beer. She called down a chair-woman to dinner that was at work in Mr. Elliot's bed chamber. When we had sat about ten minutes, a lodger came down and told Mrs. Tawney that Mr. Elliot's chamber door was open, and she went up and found the things gone; I paid for my beer and came home.</p>

               <p>Barnet. Yes; I was christened in 1766. On the 11th of September I went to Shadwell Dock; as I was coming home I met with the prisoner; he asked me where I was going; I said to Holborn. He asked me to go into a public-house and drink with him, Two men came in; one of them pretended to be a Squire's son. One of them asked the way to High Holborn. The prisoner said he was going there, and would shew him the way. We went from there to <placeName id="t17701024-22-crimeloc104">Holborn</placeName>

The 'Squire's son and another man came in there; the 'Squire's son proposed to toss up for some liquor; he said he would toss up for 50 l. The prisoner said he was a brewer's clerk, and he could not afford to toss up for so much money. They got tossing up for money. The prisoner asked to see my buckles; I took them out of my shoes; the prisoner laid them down upon his handkerchief. Soon after that the 'Squire's son said he wanted a watch for a girl of his. I took out my watch; the 'Squire's son asked me what I would take for it; I asked five guineas. The prisoner said let me alone. I will get you seven guineas for your watch and buckles. The prisoner and the 'Squire's son tossed up for 10 l. the prisoner lost, and borrowed some money to pay it; then he asked me to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240011"/> go over the way with him, to borrow some more money. Almost as soon as I had crossed the pavement. I began to think my watch and buckles might not be safe; so I went back again, and they and my watch and buckles were gone. The 'Squire's son was to buy buckles, so he gave me his buckles to put in my shoes, which he said were silver, but I find they are not; I believe they are pewter.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether he did not go halves with me when I tossed up and them?</p>
               <p>Barnet. No; I had no concern with the tossing up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>He staked his watch and buckles against the 'Squire's son; he lost them, and he went out as I thought contented.</p>

On the 24th of September I was coming home from my lodging, I met two women; I was in liquor, and I went with them. The people refused to let us in at two houses; we went to a third house, where we got admittance. We went up two pair of stairs; I fell asleep there; when I came down stairs again I was going to pick up another girl; I put my hand in my pocket and missed my money. I am sure I had the money in my pocket when I went up stairs. I don't know that any body else came into the room but the prisoner and the evidence, who is the other girl.</p>

I was much in liquor; She wanted me to go with her to her lodgings in Prince's-street; I refused to go with her, and proposed for us to go to my own lodgings. She went with me to my lodging. We went to bed together a little after twelve o'clock; about one o'clock a watchman found the door open, and alarmed us, and then I found the prisoner was gone, and I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment; they were the clothes I had on when she picked me up.</p>

I went up into the shop. I found the trap-door open, and all the windows open; then I thought the house had been robbed. I went to the drawer where my gold and silver work was, and missed the whole; and in my bed-chamber the drawer belonging to the glass was broke open, and the two gold rings and some other things were taken out. My maid-servant informed me that the prisoner went out about five o'clock; that made me suspect him. I made a proper search after him, and on Wednesday following he was taken in Whitechapel.</p>

            . The prisoner brought a horse to the Boar and Castle in Oxford Road, where I am hostler, between eight and nine on Wednesday morning; he desired me to take care of him. The horse had sweated, but the sweat seemed rather dried on. He said he came only from Barnet that morning, and that he had walked him all the way from Highgate. I gave the horse a food; he went to the farrier's to have him shod; when he came back, he asked me for a pair of scissars to cut the horse's tail; he had a switch tail, but the prisoner cut it shorter. He asked my advice, whether he should send him to grass; I said, it would hurt the price of him. He borrowed a halter of me, and had him taken to the Repository.</p>

            . I am a farrier. The prisoner came to me on Wednesday morning the third of October, and asked me to go and look at a horse he had got at the Boar and Castle. I went with him; his feet were ragged, and looked ugly. He asked me if it would not be right to send him to grass; I told him, I thought he had better sell him. He asked me to shoe him; I told him, we were so busy, we could not. He desired me to take him to Mr. Langhorne's Repository. He said, he had him in a chop, and he stood him in about six guineas; and that as he had him so cheap, he was afraid something was the matter with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Dow. He worked in our shop; that was the way I became acquainted with him. I know he had two horses before; I saw them stand at a stable in Bartholemew Close.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner deal in horses?</p>
               <p>Dow. Yes; he used to buy horses that were sick or lame; sometimes he brought them about again, and sometimes he lost money by them.</p>
               <p>Ibbetson. On the Friday following Mr. Jones came into our yard pretty early in the morning, and said he had lost a horse, which was in our yard. I desired him to make an affidavit of it, and let me have it; and I desired him to appear as little as possible, that I might detect the thief. After the sale, Dow came and asked after the horse; I took him into custody. Whilst we were asking him some questions, the prisoner was observed loitering about the gate, which caused as to suspect him; we desired the constable to take him into custody. When the constable brought him in, Dow said he was the man that delivered him the horse, and gave him the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Ibbetson. When he first came into the room, and Dow challenged him with having given him the horse, he said, What, do you say it was me delivered the horse? Dow said yes; then the prisoner sat down; he held down his head, and appeared as if he was much in liquor; he said he was very sick, and desired to go out; he came in again in about five minutes, and then talked very sensibly.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday morning, about eight o'clock, I met a man by Long-lane, near the Charter-house, upon a rough cart gelding; he asked me if I could help him to a customer for him; I said I would buy him myself, if he would let me get a guinea or two by him. When I examined the horse I found he had bad feet, and weak eyes; he asked me eight guineas for him; I asked him if he was found; he said he was to the best of his knowledge. I offered him six guineas, or three half guineas and a watch I had. We agreed for six guineas; I had not money enough, so I went and pawned my watch for two guineas and a half, and paid him six guineas. Here is a men here that saw me buy the horse; and I can bring proof where I was on the night the horse was stole. They have misrepresented what passed; they said to Dow, is this the man that delivered the horse to you? he said yes; I said no, it was the hostler. I said the horse is my property, I don't deny it. The man I bought the horse of said he came from Dartford in Kent, and that his name was Wood; he looked like a creditable countryman; I suspected the horse was not found; when his feet were shod I found he had good feet. I asked Dow's advice whether I should send him to grass; he said it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240016"/> would be expensive feeding him to grass, and advised me to sell him, I told him he should have half of what he sold for above six guineas. I made out a note in the name of Wood, that I bought it of. I have bought many horses in Smithfield, and paid for them, and put them up in that man's stable.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wood. Did he say at first that it was his horse?</p>
               <p>Wood. No; he denied the horse, and said he did not give it to Dow.</p>

On Wednesday, the 3d October, the prisoner bought a horse in Charter-house-lane, of a lusty country man, who was dressed in a dark brown coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Brown. Between nine and ten in the morning. It was a black cart gelding; he gave him six guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present during the whole time of making the bargain?</p>
               <p>Brown. No; I happened to come down the lane, and I saw Barton and the farmer together; I stopt to see whether they dealt or no. Barton asked the price; he said eight guineas; he bid him six; he went to pawn his watch for to make up the money, then I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the man say where he had brought the horse from?</p>
               <p>Brown. He said he brought him from Dartford in Kent; that he had been to Highgate for some cash; that he had been disappointed, and that made him sell his horse.</p>

I went to the White-horse, and there I saw the prisoner and Piggot, and some other people. I asked the prisoner how he came to be guilty of such a beastly action; he said he was in liquor, and did not know what he did.</p>

               <p>Henley. He did not appear to be so. I bid them stay till I acquainted Mrs. Lovell, whom the ass belonged to, of it, and had her opinion, (Mrs. Lovell is very ancient, and I manage her business) the prisoner said, For God's sake, let me make it up. I went and told Mrs. Lovell, my mistress; she said, the man must suffer the law: the prisoner desired to go in to speak to her, but I would not let him, as she had before desired me not to let her see him: he said he would give me any thing to make it up; I said he should go before a magistrate; I accordingly took him before the justice.</p>

             the brick-maker near Knight's-bridge. My brother and I were going from Knight's-bridge to Chelsea about ten in the morning; we went down a lane that is called <placeName id="t17701024-38-crimeloc178">Yeoman's Row</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17701024-38-crimeloc178" type="placeName" value="Yeoman's Row"/>

               <p>Q. Where was he with the ass?</p>
               <p>Pigott. It was in a little shed, where they give the asses hay; the shed is tiled at the top; the front part is open, the back part is pailed.</p>
               <p>Q. How far off was the brick kiln that you stood upon?</p>
               <p>Pigott. Forty, or fifty, or a hundred yards; the brick kiln fronts the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the ass stand?</p>
               <p>Pigott. Her head was to the manager; she had a foal by her side; she was in the farther corner of the shed, that I could see him sideways.</p>
               <p>Q. And are you positive that you really saw him in her?</p>
               <p>Pigott. Yes, he was in her; when I first went up, he was shoving at her as a man might be at a woman: I stood a minute or two till he withdrew, and then it was he turned about and saw us.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after he came to take his pails, that you took him?</p>
               <p>Pigott. About a quarter of an hour; he got off then; we took his pails to a public house, the Cow and Calves; the prisoner came there in about a quarter of an hour; he had been home and changed his cloaths; he had a red cap and hat on when we pursued him; when he came into the Cow and Calves he said, Pray was there not a man frightened away from the cow-house that was milking a she ass? I said you are the man that b - d the ass; he said, No, I am a man in credit; I have a wife and family; I said, You are the man; I said I would carry the pails home, and know if he was not the man that fetch'd the yeast; he said, No, he would rather carry them himself. We left him with the pails in the house; he took up the pails and was going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240018"/> towards the Bell at Brompton; he set out with a run; we ran across and met him; he put down his pails and wanted us to go into a house to drink; he said, You don't think it is me; I said I am sure you are the man; he still denied it; I said at last, I insist upon your going to Mr. Healey's; whilst I went to Mr. Healey's, my brother and another man came with the prisoner to Knight's-bridge; he put down his pails, and said he hoped we would not take him to Mr. Healey's; he said it was his brother, and he was very much like him; he offered me half a crown or half a guinea to let him go; when we had got a little farther, he said, Don't take any notice of it, I am the man, I was in liquor; he confessed the same when he was at Mr. Healey's; he said he would sooner give ten pounds than it should be known. I kept him in charge whilst my brother fetched Mr. Healey.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Pigott. Between nine and ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a cap had he on?</p>
               <p>Pigott. A red cap.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of cloaths?</p>
               <p>Pigott. She same coat he has on now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say the man had a great coat on?</p>
               <p>Pigott. It was long.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you describe it as a great coat?</p>
               <p>Pigott. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you declare that you was not certain who the man was?</p>
               <p>Pigott. No; never.</p>
               <p>Q. He came into the Cow and Calves himself?</p>
               <p>Pigott. Yes; he had changed his cloaths; he first said it was a man he employed, afterwards he said it was his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. When he first came into the Cow and Calves, did you charge him with being the man?</p>
               <p>Pigott. I did not at first, but I did before he went out of the house. I met him going for yeast about seven o'clock in the morning.</p>

            .

               <p>Q. What distance is the kiln from the place where the ass was?</p>
               <p>Piggot. A hundred yards more or less; my brother saw him draw it out, I did not: the ass fell back in his lap.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the ass stand to you upon the kiln?</p>
               <p>Piggot. The ass stood partly sideways; as soon as he had got off and wiped himself, he saw my brother and I getting down off the kiln; he buttoned his breeches and ran over the field going to Knightsbridge; we lost him at that time, we saw him afterwards creeping under the hedge, he was, I suppose, coming for his pails of yeast.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Piggot. In a long coat, a red cap, and a flapped hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face?</p>
               <p>Piggot. Yes, as he was coming up under the hedge. I knew him again, my father came up and we pursued him then, but could not catch him; my brother took the pails up to the Cow and Calves; after we had been there about a quarter of an hour he came in, in another dress, and said where is the pails of yeast you frightened my man away from? My brother said, I believe you are the man, and I am sure you are the man, He said, no, indeed I am not the man, it was my man, he was milking the ass and you frightened him away; I shall be obliged to you to let me have the pails of yeast: with a great deal of persuasion we, let him have the pails, and agreed to meet him at Knights-bridge; we drank our beer up, and went up the field; we saw him take up the pails and run; we ran too and met him at the end of the lane; he set down his pails and went in to drink at the Bunch of Grapes; my brother said, I am sure you are the man; he said, indeed I am not, my man that you frightened away is gone to London; we said, we were sure he was the man; we went and fetched

            ; he said, I am sure you are the man I met; did not I see you come back again in a different dress? My brother went from the Bunch of Grapes to seek for Mr. Healey, but could not find him; the other man and I brought on the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240019"/> with the pails of yeast; he wanted to slip away very often; my brother came back and met us facing the Fox, then the prisoner offered my brother half a guinea; he said he would not take any money, because if he did, he should lay himself under the same lash as he was; we took him to the White Horse, where we had a pot of beer; he took half a crown out of his pocket and wanted us to take it; he said there, that it was his brother, and he would make it up for him if he could. I heard him afterwards confess it; he said, I am the man, I am very sorry for it, I was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after you went for Mr. Healey?</p>
               <p>Piggot. Before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before this?</p>
               <p>Piggot. I have seen him go through the fields where we work in the summer, but did not take much notice of him.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was in the ass-house could you at that distance see his face?</p>
               <p>Piggot. Yes; the ass-house was side ways, so that we could see across between the ass and him. I saw his face more distinctly when he came under the lodge for his pails.</p>

            . I keep the Cow and Calves as was, it is now the Coach and Horses; the two Piggots came and brought two tubs with yeast; they said they would carry it down to Knights-bridge, and see if they could find an owner for them; just as they were going out at the door, the prisoner came in; he asked them what they were going to do with his tubs? they told him if he would stop, they would tell him the whole affair: he went in and sat down; they told him they saw a man in action with an ass, that he made off and they took the pails; he called for a pot of beer; they drank with him, and they parted good friends; he said his man was gone to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they accuse him with being the man?</p>
               <p>Cross. After they had changed a few words they looked in his face and said you look like the man; he said, no, it was John.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this John his journeyman?</p>
               <p>Cross. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner that morning?</p>
               <p>Cross. I might have seen him, but not to have any knowledge of him; I have known his friends many years; he has a wife and children; his wife is with child now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what bargain the prisoner and the Pigotts made about meeting any where?</p>
               <p>Cross. No; they asked him if he was the man's brother, for he was like him; he said, no, he was a journeyman baker that was out of place, and his name was John.</p>
               <p>Q. You have often seen the prisoner, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Cross. Yes, I have seen a person go by for yeast; I do not know him; I never took much notice of him.</p>

               <p>Laay Mayo. On the 18th of July, about nine o'clock, I left a box at Mr. Cartier's containing the things mentioned in the indictment; the box was locked and wrapped up in flannel, I have the key now in my pocket; I desired Mr. Cartier to bring me some pack thread to tie it, he did; I asked him for some wax; he helped me to seal the box; I gave it him, and begged he would take care of it; he asked me what it contained; I told him papers of consequence; he said, I suppose papers relative to your law suit; I replied, they are papers of consequence, and take care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where the box was deposited?</p>
               <p>L. Mayo. I cannot say; I think near the closet.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the contents?</p>
               <p>L. Mayo. There were twelve bank notes of 100 l. each, two bank notes of 50 l. each, and 200 l. in small notes, but of what sums I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any of 10 l.?</p>
               <p>L. Mayo. I believe there was, but how many I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your Ladyship lose besides?</p>
               <p>L. Mayo. A gold chased case to a watch; there was near twenty pounds in crowns, half crowns, shillings and sixpences of particular coins; there was near 300 guineas in guineas, about 20 l. in quarters and half guineas, and six thirty-six shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your Ladyship remember where you received any of the notes?</p>
               <p>L. Mayo. I received of Walpole and Co. four bank notes, value 100 l. each, on 21st of April, 1769, and six bank notes, 100 l. each, from Mr. Batson, on 15 March, 1769; there were two notes of 100 l. each, that I have forgot where I received; and there were two notes, 50 l. each, which I had from the bank, but they could not give me the numbers.</p>

            . On Wednesday, the 18th of July, Lady Mayo brought a box to me; I put it in a closet between my bed-chamber and a parlour on the ground floor, in the presence of her Ladyship.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it last, before you missed it?</p>
               <p>Cartier. I put it in the closet about nine o'clock; I saw it when I went to bed, about eleven; it was wrapped up seemingly in an old blanket; in the morning about six o'clock, or thereabouts, perhaps before, I heard my maid cry out; I started up and asked what was the matter? she said, You are ruined and undone!<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240024"/> You are robbed! I jumped up in my shirt and went to the parlour, there I found the cup board was broke open; at the bottom of the stair-case I found this quilt, which had been cut open; and there was a flannel petticoat (producing them) they were the quilt and piece of flannel the box was wrapped up in; and there was the sheath of a carving-knife with a fork in it, upon he quilt; the knife was not in it: I went down into the kitchen, and there I found the box broke open, and some papers, which I suppose the things had been wrapped in, were scattered about the kitchen; the contents, whatever they were, were gone; I suppose the box was forced open by running a knife, or some such thing into it; my house was broke open; the rails before the house were broke open, and the pin of the kitchen window was either broke or taken away; the shutter was forced open, and the help of my kitchen door was taken off.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you put the box in a closet between your bed-chamber and the parlour?</p>
               <p>Cartier. Yes; I lay in that bed-chamber; there is a little passage or closet between the parlour and the bed-chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the box was locked?</p>

               <p>Lyon Alexander. I live in Wormwood street, by Bishopsgate-church, near London-wall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg the favour of your Lordship to order Jones out of court, whilst this witness gives his evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly, if you request it.</p>
               <p>(Jones is ordered out of Court.)</p>
               <p>Council. Give an account to the court upon what occasion you first saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Alexander. About twelve or thirteen weeks ago, Jones came to my house on a Sunday; he said, how do you do, Mr. Alexander? I said, how do you do? he was dressed in mourning; he said he had an aunt lately died in Oxfordshire, that had left between three and four thousand pounds between him and his brother; he said he had took a public-house by Red-Lion-Square; I asked him to lend me five guineas to buy some things with; he said here is a guinea for you, and gave me a guinea; will you come down? my brother is standing at the corner, but don't take any notice of him, and he will take no notice of you; but walk up and down, said he, and take no notice, I will speak to my brother, and then I will give you a glass of wine; I saw his brother, the prisoner, waiting in the street; he went and spoke to him; then he came to me, and asked me to drink a glass of wine; I went with him to the White Hart Tavern; that was about eleven o'clock; it was near sermon-time, the door was just going to be shut; the waiter said we must make haste; we called for a bottle of red wine, and drank it up between us as fast as we could; he made me drink most of it; then we took a walk; he said, let us go and see the two men hanging in chains upon Bow Common; we went there; there was nothing more passed then. On the Sunday following he came to my house again; he said he had spoke to his brother about lending me five guineas, but he would not do it, but he would give me a moidore; he said, I keep a public house; don't make yourself strange; call now and then, and have a pint of beer, and eat a bit of bread and cheese: I called once or twice, and drank with him; some time after that, Jones came to me, and asked me if I would buy a parcel of bank notes; I said I would go and enquire for a purchaser; I went down to one Hart, one of our people, at Wapping, who kept a shop, half a silver-smith's, and half a shop shop; I asked him; he said he would buy all there was; I went and told Jones of it; I asked him how many there were; he said six hundred pounds, and a ten pound; he said, do you think the man has got money enough? I told him yes; he said he had not got them now, they were out of town; he asked me to go with him for them; when we had walked about two miles, we got a lift for seven or eight miles in a post-chaise; when we had walked about a mile and a half, we came to a field-gate about half a mile from Welling; Jones said, we will stop here; in about ten minutes a country dressed man came up and asked him how long he had been there; he told him ten minutes; he bid him come into the field under the hedge, and he would give him the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240025"/> things; they went and sat upon the grass; he took them out of different pockets; there were five or six small parcels done up in rags or paper nes gave me three parcels to put into my waistcoat pockets; the man did not stay three minutes; Jones and I came home together, and I gave him the parcels; he bid me call at his house in the morning; I did; and from there we went to Wapping; I asked Jones what I should have for my trouble, if he sold the bank notes; he said, let him tell them for what he would. I should have sixpence in the pound of what he sold. One Charles, a dyer, went in the coach with us; he did not know our business; we left him at a public house. When we came to the house, they desired us to go up stairs, which we did; Hart asked to see the bank notes; I can't be positive what Jones asked for them, but he said, I will give you three hundred pounds for the six hundred and ten; Jones refused that; then he offered 300 guineas, and Jones agreed to it: he went into a little room and brought the money to him out in bags, 100 l. at a time; then Jones offered him the diamond ear-rings, and asked twenty-four or twenty-five guineas for them; the man bid him ten; he said he would not take that, and he put them in his pocket again. I forgot to tell your Lordship, that when I went to ask the man if he would buy the notes, he bid me not tell him that he belonged to the shop, but that he was a Dutch captain. The next day I called upon Jones; he gave me 15 l. that is six hundred sixpences; the Jew that bought them gave me a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Jones give you that money openly before the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Alexander. No; he told me his brother said he gave me five pounds too much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing of that sort to you?</p>
               <p>Alexander. No; he bid me call again; I did, and there the prisoner and Jones were together; Jones gave me the ear-rings; he said, take them, and let the Jew have them; I carried him ten guineas for them; then he gave me a large piece of gold, foreign coin, he said he would have five guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what piece it was?</p>
               <p>Alexander. No; it was foreign money; I got six pounds for it; the Jew told me it was a six pound fifteen shilling piece, so we were to have fifteen shillings a piece. There was also a pinchbeck watch, and a gold case; the outside watch-case was gold, chased. I went to Jones's house, and whilst Jones was called away, the prisoner said, I have three or four hundred pounds worth of bank notes; I will give you the same for disposing of them as my brother has done; I said, very well; he bid me not mention it to his brother; he said, I know where you live, I saw you come by that day my brother was with you, I will call upon you; he called the next day, or the day after that, and brought three notes of 100 l. each; I asked him to go with me as his brother did; he said I don't care to be seen by the man; he went to the White Bear near the house, and waited for me; the man gave me 150 guineas for them; the prisoner bid me give him the money under the table, which I did; and then as we came over Tower Hill he gave me seven guineas; he said the money comes to seven pounds ten shillings, but we shall not stand for three shillings; he bid me meet him in a day or two at the Two Blue Posts in the Hay-market, about four o'clock; I went there in a coach from home; I was not five minutes in the house before the prisoner came in; he said he would take a coach, and give me the note in the coach; he bid me bring him the money in two or three days; we went into the coach, and he gave me the note; when we had rode about two hundred yards, he got out; I thought I could get more for the note; I went and asked another Jew if he knew any body that would buy a bank note; this was on Tuesday; he and another Jew brought a gentleman to buy the note; it was Mr. Maddox; he asked to see the note; I told him I had not got it then, I should have it on Friday; he said, don't he afraid, I have got money, and pulled out a purse of money; the two Jews came again; the name of one was Harry, the other Marks; I gave the gentleman the note, and he put down seventy pounds; he said he had no more money about him; I gave the two Jews three guineas each; the prisoner came to my house on Sunday, and said, I thought you would have brought me the money; I told him it had been ready ever since Friday; I gave him forty-seven guineas and a half, and half a crown, which made fifty pounds, the price the rest sold for; I had nothing then; he threw down half a guinea for the children; a relation of mine,

               <p>Jones. I will. On Thursday morning, about twelve weeks ago, when I was a-bed, the prisoner came and knocked at my window; I live in Hackney road; I lie upon the ground floor. I got up, and let him in; then he told me he had got a prize; he opened them in my room, to the amount of 1000 l. but not all in hundreds, and there was about 150 l. in guineas, 16 or 20 l. in 5 s. 3 d. piece, I can't positively say the number of them; there were also crowns, half crowns, and shillings; there was a chased gold case to a watch; a pinchbeek metal watch, some plate, and a pair of diamond ear-rings; he told me he got them somewhere by Leicester-fields, I think he said at a prisoner's. I went to Monmonth-street, and bought a suit of black, the prisoner bought nothing there; after that, at the bottom of the street we bought some shirts and silk stockings; then we went to Holborn; there we bought a hat and hatband a piece. I parted with him in Holborn, and went home; there were two or three, men at the door that I was rather dubious of. I went to the butcher's in Bishopsgate-street; I went to buy something for dinner; while I was in the butcher's shop I saw the men pass by; they turned back again; I was afraid of them; I went to my sister's, and sent home to know if any body had been there; I found there had not. On Thursday my brother and I dressed ourselves in mourning; we look a coach in Cheapside, and went to the General

             in Oxford Road; that was about three o'clock: we took a post chaise to the King's Arms at Uxbridge; we drank some coffee there, and then went to Hamersham; we lay there that night; when we got up in the morning we changed a 50 l. Bank note; we had 10 l. in cash, and a draught of about 32 l. 14 s. it was 12 l. odd money. From there we took a post-chaise to the George at Aylesbury; there we changed a 100 l. note. We took a post-chaise and four there to Thame; there we changed a 100 l. note. We took a chaise with four horses to the Crosses in the corn market Oxford, there we changed a 100 l. note; from there we went to Abingdon, I can't remember the inn; there we changed a 100 l. note; from there we went to Benson; they could not change a 100 l. note there; I asked them to give the post-chaise boy an order to change the note at the next inn, which he did, and we received the money. From there we went to Henly; we went to an inn on the left hand side of the bridge; I forget the sign.</p>
               <p>Court. It is the Red Lion.</p>
               <p>Jones. I believe it is the Red Lion; we changed a 100 l. note there. From there we went to Mr. Marsh's at Maidenhead; changed a 20 l. note; these were all the notes we had with us. From thence we came to London; that was on Friday night; we bid the post-chaise boy drive us to the first coach in Piccadilly: we took a coach to Shoreditch church. When we came through the bar at Shoreditch, we heard the mail was robbed; we had agreed to go out the next day to change the rest of the notes, but upon hearing this we thought it not safe; we lay that night at my house in Hackney-road. The next day we went to a brother-in-law's at Welling,

He came to my house on Sunday and took the things; they were locked up in a little box; he did not know what the contents were; the key was left with me. About a week or a fortnight after this I took a house in East-street Red-Lion-Square, the sign of the Burk's Head; I was appraised in there on Monday a week or a fortnight after this.

             came to town; he said he was uneasy, and should be glad if we would fetch the things away. On Monday Alexander and I went to fetch them; he brought us the things about half a mile this side Welling. I had agreed on the Sunday before to sell the notes to Alexander; I went with Alexander next Sunday to sell the notes; we had then to the value of 610 l. I sold them at Iron Gate to a silversmith, I believe the man was, for 300 guineas.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240027"/>Q. Was the silversmith a Jew or a Christian?</p>
               <p>Jones. Alexander told me he was a Holland merchant. Alexander was to have 15 l. I carried the notes and the pair of diamond ear-rings in my waistcoat pocket; the house was shut up so dark that I could hardly see my way up stairs. A woman at the bottom of the stairs spoke to the Jew, I suppose in Dutch; I went up stairs; the man was in a sailor's dress, with trowsers and a jacket on, and his hat flapped over his face; he spoke to Alexander in some foreign language. Alexander told me afterwards, he asked who I was; I gave him two 100 l. notes, and he fetched 100 guineas in a bag out of the next room. He fetched another 100 guineas, and I gave him two 100 l. notes. I gave him 210 l. for the last 100 guineas. I left Alexander with him, as he wanted to see if he could not get something more for his trouble. I told Alexander to come to me next morning for his 15 l. which he did; I gave him 15 l. and 6 s. over. The man offered me ten guineas for the ear-rings; but I would not take it. I asked him, I think, 30 l. I had 80 l. in draught notes; I asked him if he would buy them. He advised me to born them for fear of the consequence. I received one of the draughts at Lewisham, and all the rest, I believe, at Oxford, and on the road, in change out of the bank notes. Alexander asked me afterwards if I would sell the ear-rings. I told them to him for eleven guineas, but he paid me but ten for them. because he said he had but ten. I sold the gold and the metal watch to Alexander.</p>
               <p>Q. There were some guineas, moidores, half crowns, and some bank notes seized at your house; whose were they?</p>
               <p>Jones. Part of them were my own money, about 20 l. the rest was part of what my brother gave me for my trouble, about a fortnight before I was taken up. There was a 30 l. bank note I gave cash for to a neighbour; there were six or seven moidores and eighty guineas; there were some crowns and half crowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the numbers of any of the notes you changed upon the road?</p>
               <p>Jones. There was No. 117, 118, 119, and 120, or 200, that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what letters?</p>
               <p>Jones. I do not; I intended to set down every number, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the note you changed at Maidenhead Bridge a 20 l. or 100 l.</p>
               <p>Jones. A 20 l. I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jones. He was an apprentice to a barber; he used to follow smuggling with Mr. Mattison.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the things seized at your brother's house?</p>
               <p>Jones. Only some handkerchiefs, which he said he had bought.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the prisoner lived in service?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, three or four years; I married his sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose service he has lived in?</p>
               <p>Jones. He lived with Mr. Keene, the architect; he came there when I went away; it may be three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live afterwards?</p>
               <p>Jones. I did not see him for a year: I believe I have seen him at Mr. Mattison's.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know he was in partnership with him?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen them sell china, or the like?</p>

               <p>Clay. He said he did break the house open himself, and did commit the robbery himself. I then asked him if Jones was concerned with him; he said, No; not any other person.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr. Clay. Was any thing said to him about being admitted an evidence?</p>
               <p>Clay. It is not true, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Smith. I am a midwife; I was sent for to the prisoner on the 25th of August by the officers of the parish, on a suspicion of her having been delivered of a child. I found her in the kitchen; I asked her how she did; and told her I was come to examine her upon a suspicion of her having been delivered of a child. She first said, she had had no child; she at last confessed she had miscarried; and said she was three months gone. She said she was at the vault, and it dropped from her as she sat. I asked to examine her; she said I should not. I examined her breasts, and told her I was sure she was farther gone than she had said. I advised the officers of the parish to send for Dr. Underwood. He came and examined her; he said, she had had a child. The prisoner said it was down the vault; we went to see if there was any child in her room. There was a box locked; I asked her for the key; she would not let me have it till I threatned to break the box open. I opened the box, and found a parcel of dirty things. I found the after-birth in a leather pocket. I looked farther, and found the child wrapped up in one of the prisoner's shifts and petticoats, dead. It was a female child; there was no mark of violence upon it; it had a membrane over it down to its breech; the blood was then fresh in the navel-string.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it warm then?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240030"/>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge how long it had been born?</p>
               <p>Smith. I should think from the appearance, not many hours; she said she miscarried on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you infer from this membrane?</p>
               <p>Smith. It was owing to a very quick labour. I went into the kitchen to her, and asked her if she had any child-bed linen prepared; she said, No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the child was in a shift?</p>
               <p>Smith. That was the prisoner's shift.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child at its full time?</p>
               <p>Smith. I think it was: it was a very fine child, I saw her again the next day; I asked her how she found herself upon the child's coming into the world; she said, she helped it into the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell whether it was born dead or alive?</p>
               <p>Smith. I could not tell that.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she said she was about three months gone with child?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that I believe she said it might be four or five months?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; she might be four or five months gone; that was the most.</p>

               <p>Q. What condition of life was she in?</p>
               <p>Mole. I believe she had been a servant. I was acquainted with her sister, which was the reason I took her; she said she wanted a lodging for a fortnight or three weeks. She came down stairs on Tuesday, and had a pennyworth of twopenny; she looked very bad; I told her she looked very bad and very ghastly. I thought she was in labour; I sent my child up to her, to tell her I should be glad to speak with her, if she could come down. She came down, and sat upon a chair; when she got up, I thought something was the matter; I went up into her room and asked her; she said she had miscarried; I asked her where it was; she said, in the necessary; and that she was only three months gone. She came down stairs every morning to her breakfast. On Saturday morning she was very bad, the sweat ran down her face like rain; she appeared to be very weak; I suspected there was something more than a miscarriage. I went to Justice Wright's; he desired me to go to the overseers of the parish, and acquaint them with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell from what you observed, what day she might be delivered?</p>
               <p>Mole. I can't say; I thought on Thursday, because she told me then she had miscarried.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks of violence upon the child?</p>

               <p>Dr. Underwood. I was called to the prisoner. After a great deal of difficulty she was prevailed upon to go under an examination. I examined her, and was clear she had been delivered of a child at more than five months, a child at least six months grown. I did not see the child till the coroner's inquest sat, which was three or four days afterwards. There was a little circle round the neck, but no more than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240031"/> what might be in any part of a body that had lain some time. I believe it was a mark formed since the death of the child, by one part of the body falling over the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge either by the examination of the woman, or the size of the child, whether it was come to its full time?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I don't doubt it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you judge whether it was born dead or alive?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I made the experiment upon the lungs. It is usually supposed that if the child is still-born, and the lungs have not been inflated with air, that they will sink; and that if the child was born alive, and the lungs inflated with air, that then they will swim. I tried part of the lungs in a bason of water, and they swam; but I told them before the experiment, that as the child had probably been dead four or five days, that the general air would in that time be let loose from the body, and the lungs might swim. I thought if it turned out in favour of the woman, it would be a proof that the child was still-born.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't reckon that experiment to be decisive from the child's having been dead so long?</p>
               <p>Underwood. No, I don't. If the child had been born alive, it would infallibly have died. From no ligature being made upon the navel-string, it would bleed to death.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge whether the child died by the loss of blood from the navel-string?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I should not have supposed by the appearance of the body, that it had lost any great quantity of blood; the body was red.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had died from the not tying the navel-string, it would have lost a great quantity, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Underwood. Yes; I never saw a child that died by the more loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon would the child have died, if it had died by the loss of blood?</p>
               <p>Underwood. It would have died in a quarter of in hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How much blood do you suppose might come from the child in that quarter of an hour?</p>
               <p>Underwood. Five or six ounces, I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. So you can't form any opinion whether it was born dead or alive?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I own what the woman said to me had some weight. She was going to say something to me, and said she hoped I would be favourable to her. I begged her not to tell me any thing that would do her hurt. I told her she knew whether she was guilty or not; and if she was guilty, her best way would be to go away directly; she said, she would.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not go away?</p>
               <p>Underwood. She was guarded.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say that in your judgement the child was born alive?</p>
               <p>Underwood. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Smith says there was a membrane about the child; was it when you saw it?</p>
               <p>Underwood. No, it was taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cause of that membrane?</p>
               <p>Underwood. The labour must have been exceeding quick, or that membrane would have parted, and have turn off before the child was born.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the labour being quick?</p>
               <p>Underwood. That the actual birth succeeded the first pains very soon.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner tell you she was gone?</p>
               <p>Underwood. She said four or five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not quick labours often fatal to the child?</p>
               <p>Underwood. Long labours destroy a great number of children; but a great many more children are lost by exceeding quick labours; the safest labours are of seven or eight hours.</p>

               <p>- West. I lodged at Mrs. Mole's, the next room to the prisoner; there was only a this door between her room and mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise of a child's crying, or any noise whereby you might know that a person was in labour?</p>
               <p>- West. I have heard people speak in the room, but I did not hear any noise; I was not out of my room an hour from Thursday to Saturday.</p>
               <p>- West. I am husband to the last witness; I was at home between twelve and one that day; I did not hear a child cry.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen. I am overseer. I sent for the physician and midwife; I was with the midwife in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240032"/> the kitchen, when the prisoner seemed a good deal confused, and indeed she seemed to be in liquor; I asked her to let the midwife examine her; she said she did not chuse it.</p>

I saw the deceased crossing the street with a load upon his back; it appeared to me that either the pole or the horses threw him down; the fore near wheel went over him about the stomach, the hind-wheel went a little lower, and that turned his body over, I called out to stop the coach, and I ran as far as the church, I could run so farther; then I walked, and saw him turn down Threadneedle-street.</p>

            , who is a servant of Mrs. Poole, deposed, that the deceased came home from school very ill; that he was put to bed, and died about two next morning.</p>
               <p>Dr. Hunter. I saw the deceased after his death; I did not see him before. I went to see him on Wednesday the 10th; I opened the other parts of his body, but when I came to his head, I examined if there were any external marks of violence; I could not observe any: then I scalped it; I sawed the skull, and then I observed a large quantity of extravasated blood coagulated, lying between the skull and the first membrane of the brain, or that which immediately lines the skull. I then served the membrane from the skull, more than the breadth of my hand and fingers; the blood was of the thickness of about an inch and an half. I then examined the skull itself; upon its inter surface there appeared below where I had sawed, a piece of the skull projecting in wards, I suppose about the bigness of a sixpence in the whole. Then I observed the outside of the skull opposite to this piece of fractured bone, and still there was no marks of violence, till I came to the very skull itself. There were all the appearances: there was upon the outside of the skull a dent answerable to the inside appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. From these appearances do you or not believe that the blow you have heard described was the cause of this young gentleman's death?</p>

               <p>Dr. Hunter. Without a doubt the extravasated blood was the immediate cause of his death; the fracture there was the cause of that extravasation. Now I don't think an open hand would beat in a skull in that particular part; it must be done by some instrument that was angular, such as a knuckle, or the corner of a Chimney.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form a judgement with what degree of violence the blow might be given?</p>
               <p>Dr. Hunter. In a young skull the bone is thin; it was upon a part that was flat, a part that rather projects in wards; therefore a small blow is capable of taking in a piece of bone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have taken as much pains as was possible with the deceased, which is not unknown to Mrs. Poole. I have devoted my time to teach him, such as Thursdays and Saturdays in the afternoon, Sometimes Sunday not exempted. I have bore it with as much gentleness of temper as possible; I did not expect this would have had any worth effect then former corrections of the same kind. I have sat for hours instructing him with regard to the conjugating his French verbs, I have chalked them upon his desk, that he might remember them. He was dull by nature, I believe more so by inattention. I taught him longer than any of the other scholars, for I did expect, and I told Mrs. Poole so, that if I could gain the point to drive out his inattention, she would not be wanting to recommend me. She told me, I might depend upon it she would recommend me. He was a very valuable scholar to me. I had 45 l. a year for teaching him and giving him a dinner every day bot Sunday. Had he been my own son, I could not have taken more pains, with him, and should have given him a box on the ear with the same inadvertency. I used to read his lesson<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240035"/> for him, when I read them to him, he seemed to give no attention. I used to remonstrate with him; he would take the book and lay it down and do to play. He was frequently guilty of these things. I did the best I could for him; I loved him; I told Mrs. Poole, that if I was to have an estate left me after I had taught him, I could not take more pains than I did; she said she did not doubt it, and was very much obliged to me.</p>

I was sent out on the 31st of May to Newport-market for a pair of pumps for my young Lady, about ten minutes after six. I was a stranger to that part of the town; my fellow servants directed me over the fields by Battle-bridge. I had the pumps delivered to me about seven o'clock; I went to speak to a brother of mine, that lives in Water-lane. I saw the prisoner in Water-lane; I had seen him before walking about Islington, but I did not know where he lived; I never spoke to him to my knowledge; he spoke to me. From there I went to Carey-street, and then home.

               <p>Q. It was day-night then at that time?</p>
               <p>Waters. Yes; but it was a duskish evening. Just as I got over the ditch one of the brick-field, the prisoner laid hold of my collar, and swung me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner come from?</p>
               <p>Waters. I can't tell; I did not know that I had a foul behind me; I was crossing the fields for the nearest way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alone?</p>
               <p>Waters. I did not see any body with him. He damn'd me, and bid me deliver what I had got. I told him, I was a poor servant lad, that worked hard for what I got, and had nothing. He laid hold of the waistband of my breeches, tore the buttons off, and laid hold of me in an uncommon manner. I begged for mercy; he let his hand loose, and turned out both my pockets. I had 2 s. 6 d. of my own, and 4 s. 6 d. of my master's in my breeches pocket. He took a pair of buttons from my sleeves, and four pennyworth of halfpence out of my waistcoat pocket. He asked where my watch was; I told him I had not got a watch. I was getting up; he kicked me down with his foot, and said, Damn you, do you think you shall know me again if you see me? I said, No. Then he snatched my neckcloth off, and tore it in two, and threw it at me. This is the shirt I had on when he robbed me (producing a shirt with the collar very much torn.) Then he went off, and I saw not more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a pistol, or any weapon?</p>
               <p>Waters. I did not see any. I went over the ditch again, and returned to the house I had come by, and asked for assistance to go in pursuit of the prisoner. They advised me to go to Sir

               <p>Waters. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>- Wright. This day week I had been from Sir John Fielding's office to his county-house at Brompton; as I was returning to town along with another man, I met the prisoner on the road; I passed by him. The young man that was along with me said, Wright, don't you know that man? I turned round; he was not twenty yards from me. When I was turnkey at the Gatehouse. I have seen him come there.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240036"/> I ran after him and tapped him on the shoulder, and said he must go with me. He asked what was the matter? I told him an information was lodged at our office against him; he asked what it was for? I told him, and said, all our people have been after you at different times. He said, when does the sessions begin? I said, next week. A man was sent to the prosecutor; the prosecutor was gone to live with a gentleman in the city. The prisoner was put into a room among twenty people. One of the clerks said to him, look round, and ee if you can find the man that robbed you He went to the prisoner, and said, that is the man: we could not find any thing upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. From the prisoner to the prosecutor. Had not we conversation together at the Temple at that time you say I robbed you?</p>
               <p>Waters. No; I never spoke to him in my life before he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did you not immediately pursue me?</p>
               <p>Waters. I went for assistance, but could not get any.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you resist me if I robbed you?</p>
               <p>Waters. He had me upon the ground not two feet from the water, so that I could not resist him.</p>

            . The prisoner was brought to Sir John's for uttering bad money; he said he lived near Whitfield's Tabernacle, in Tottenham-court-road. Mr. Rainsford took Gedney to his lodgings, and I took Hodges in a coach to Tottenham-court-road. When we were in the coach, he said, he supposed I was taking him to prison. I put down the window of the coach, and shewed him I was going to Tottenham-court-road. He desired me to take him to prison, and refused to tell me where his house was. I got out of the coach and enquired for his house. A woman at a chandler's shop directed me to the house; it is a corner house in the fields, behind the Tabernacle. I knocked at the door; a woman out of the window asked who was there; I said, Mr. Hodges; she said, she was sure it was not his voice. I then said it was Mr. Gedney; she said it was not. Then I came out in sight (I had stood under the shed before) and I told her she must open the door, She refused it. I told her if she did not, I would break it open. She came down and opened the door; Hodges was with me at the door, concealed under the shed. I asked for Mrs. Hodges; the woman said she was Mrs. Hodges. Noakes, the constable, who was with me, searched her; in her pocket-book<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240037"/> there was half a crown's worth of silver which appeared to be bad; we went into the bed-chamber, and in a drawer there we found 18 s. worth of silver, that appeared to be bad; in the two pair of stairs we found that engine that is in court leaning against the wall, fixed in the block as it is not.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. The 18 s. have since appeared to be good money.</p>
               <p>Bond. There was a block in the room which seemed to me to be answerable for supporting this block and screw. From there we went into the garret; there was a turning lathe; I bid Mr. Noakes sweep off some of the dust, which lay upon the lathe, which appeared to be either brass or silver. I went up into the cock lost, and at the farther end I found this hat full of bad halfpence, (producing them) they are joined together just as they are cast. Hodges said he knew nothing about them. He said that he had a lodger some time before that, and that the engine was his; he said that it belonged to a man near Covent Garden. I went down stairs behind the kitchen; there was a forge with a fire lighted; there was a large trough with black sand in is under the window; there were several frames of wood with screws, which I apprehended were for the purpose of casting.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the name of the man the engine belonged to?</p>
               <p>Bond. He refused to tell me his name.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that an engine to cut round blanks with, by force of a screw, out of flatted metal?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes it is; they might coin with it I believe; but the engine is not quite complete for coining.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the money is coined is it first cut into round blanks?</p>
               <p>Sage. Yes. This engine is not quite complete for either cutting or coining; it want what we call a dab and a bolster at the bottom: the metal is laid between them; upon throwing round the fly it throws the metal through the bolster and cuts it; this is what we call the cutting engine, the other we call a dab and bolster.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that, in the condition it is now, without the dab and bolster, a cutting engine?</p>

               <p>Q. It will not now cut blanks?</p>

There was a dispute between the prisoner and the servant girl, who should draw some beer that was wanted; the deceased spoke in behalf of the girl. and said he thought the prisoner put upon her; the prisoner heard Davey speaking about it, and some words passed between them; Davey gave the prisoner a slap in the face, that was the first blow that passed; the prisoner had a pewter-pot in his hand, and he immediately struck him with it, over his left eye, upon his temple, the blood ran down his face; I cut his hair off about the wound, and tied it up with two handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was the wound?</p>

               <p>- Mills. I was fellow-servant with the prisoner. There was some beer ordered out; the prisoner went down to draw it; I was talking with my mistress at the bar, he came up to me, and said d - n you why don't you go out with the beer? the deceased said to my mistress that it was not right for one servant to d - n another; the prisoner came in and heard it, and he asked the deceased what he had to say about him; he said he did not think it right for one servant to d - n another; there were other words passed, but I don't know what; Davey collar'd the prisoner, and gave him a slap on the face. Flanaghan had the pot in his left hand, shifted it to his right hand, and struck him with it upon the head; he got it tied up with a handkerchief, and then wanted the prisoner to fight him; I saw them jostling, but I did not see any more blows struck. My mistress sent me for some Turlington's drops to wash his head, and Mr. Murrell cut his hair off, and tied two handkerchiefs upon his head; he used to come to our house after he had been at the hospital. He took a warrant out against the prisoner; the prisoner gave him half a guinea, and they made it up; I saw him give him the money; this was about a fortnight after he had given him the blow.</p>

Last Saturday morning the cook awaked me, and told me the house was broke open; I got up, and found the kitchen window was broke open. The kitchen window opens into an area in the street; the kitchen window had iron bars to it; the whole frame of the window was drove in, the wood and iron work together; we found a tinder-box upon a bench in the passage, a piece of candle, and a flint and steel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they belong to the house?</p>
               <p>Topham No. There was a bar outside the kitchen door, which was shattered all to pieces. We also found two chissels and a short crow in the kitchen. ( Producing them.) The pantry door, where the place was, was not broke open, but cut with a chissel, or some such thing. I saw all was safe over night; and there was stolen this plate. (Producing the several pieces mentioned in the indictment.) They got the plate out at the hole they cut in the door. There was another shelf above this that they could not get at; it was a narrow closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the plate you have now looked at is Mrs. Jeredore's property?</p>
               <p>Topham. I am. They were all in the closet the night before the robbery. My mistress ordered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177010240040"/> me to go to Sir

            's, I did; Sir John ordered me to bring the things I had found to him, and the cost of arms upon the plate, which I did; his men went out immediately, and the prisoners were soon taken. I was sent for to Justice Fielding's; he asked me if I could swear to the plate; I told him I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Topham. I knew Knight; I succeeded him in Mrs. Roberts's service at Hackney; and I was acquainted with him at Mr. Mackay's; he has been several times to see me and my fellow servants at Mrs. Jeredore's.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever been down stairs and seen the pantry where the plate is kept?</p>
               <p>Topham. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he give any account how he came by it?</p>
               <p>Halliburton. None. We took them before Sir John. Knight said the way he came there was, he went to buy an handkerchief there; but there is no shew of handkerchiefs; to be sold there.</p>

               <p>Halliburton. Underwood was coming down stairs as we went in. When I asked at the door they said Underwood was not at home. Payne had no hat on when I took him; he said he had sold it to buy a pair of shoes; the other two had their hats.</p>

We said we had an order from Sir John to search his house. He said I know what you are come about; the plate has been here, but it is gone; then he said the people were up stairs waiting for their wack, that is their money. We went up stairs; Bird and Payne were playing at all-fours; Wright was learning over the chair behind them, and the woman was sitting by the bed-side; when they saw us they looked thunder-struck; I said, Why don't you play the game out? Halliburton had by that time brought the plate down; then we searched them, and found this castor top is Knight's pocket. We tied them together; Halliburton and Wright took them to Sir
