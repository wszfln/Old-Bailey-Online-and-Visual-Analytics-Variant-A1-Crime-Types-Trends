               <p>Q. Did you know any of the three men? A. I discerned one with a green coat and yellow buttons on, and two boys with round jackets; I wrote down the particulars of the watch, and sent down to the Police, offering 5l. reward for the apprehension, and on Wednesday night Thomas came to me - I went next morning to Walter's, the pawnbroker, saw my watch, and knew it to be the one I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any of the three young men before? A. Frequently; I have seen the prisoner three or four times a week - I do not know whether he was one of the three, for his dress is changed since - he is just the same size; I know him from his passing, and being continually at my window - I cannot say whether he is one of those who stood at the oyster-stall; I described the dress like person had on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before on that day? A. Not before I saw him at the oyster-stand, if he was there -I gave 5l. for the watch; it is worth that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did you not take me instead of going for your hat? A. I went out to look for a Policeman to take them - I believe the oyster-man was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050004"/>concerned with you, for I have been robbed before, and found persons standing there.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner last Wednesday afternoon, in Holborn, on another charge - I took him to Covent-garden station-house, searched him, and found the duplicate produced in his trousers pocket; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL LEVY. This is the watch I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - My father was a respectable attorney, residing at Ludlow, Shropshire - I was committed to this prison last Thursday, with but a shilling and a few halfpence; my friends, if I have any, live at that distance from town - I have not had it in my power to send to them to come forward; I lived with Mr. Porter, No. 23, Lancaster-place, Burton-crescent, as clerk, and served him faithfully till nearly the time of his decease in 1829, and gave him 50l. security for the money he might have in my hands - I got none of that back; but when my father died he left me 300l., and his wife, who was not my mother, left me 400l.; I have had many expences to pay out of the money, and money was paid to me during my minority: my father died eight years ago - since I left Mr. Porter I lived with Mr. 
               <persName id="t18320705-2-person114">T. </persName>
            Burgess, of Curzon-street, May-fair, and had not left him more than six weeks, since that I had money from different friends in town, and have been in expectation of another situation. As to the charge of breaking the window, the prosecutor says quite wrong; I never had a green coat on, and never was seen at the oyster-stall opposite his shop in my life; if I had had money and time to bring witnesses to character, I could prove it is the first time I was ever arraigned at a bar of justice; I hope you will take it into your merciful consideration, that though the witness swears I pawned the watch, he says I had a brown coat or some such colour, but if I could have brought witnesses forward, they could prove what dress I have worn for twelve months; as to my pawning the watch, he must be quite under a mistake, and I am convinced Levy is totally wrong in his charge against me - I never, to my knowledge, was near his shop: knowing the consequence of such a crime, do you think I should commit myself in such a manner, for so trifling a thing? I have had watches of my own, but being reduced, have been compelled to sell them, and should have waited a little longer before I took to such means as this, having been brought up in quite a different manner.</p>

On the 28th of May, at eight o'clock, I found the dock gate locked when I went to it, and was going to Gold's house, in Dock-street; I met with a female, who asked if I wanted her; I went home with her - she desired me to sit down; she went out and got a light, and after that I gave her 3s. - she lighted a candle: I cannot say where she brought it from - as soon as I paid her 3s. she went down stairs; three men then came up, and I asked them what business they had with my woman - one of them lifted up the poker, and asked me what business I had there; I said, "Give me my money back, and I will go away directly;" one laid hold of me on one side, and the other on the other, and dragged me out of doors - the prisoner is the man who took my money out of my pocket and put it into his mouth.</p>

               <p>Q. When did he do that? A. When they got me outside the door; he took five shillings and a penny - I took hold of him, and held him till the watchman came up: as soon as I called for the watch the other two ran away - they had laid hold of me by each arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them a stick? A. No, the prisoner had the fire poker.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in his hand when the watchman came up? A. No, he had left it in the house - I had 9s. when I left my ship; I had spent all but 8s. 1d. when I met the girl.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. Have you more names than one? A. No; the girl addressed me in broken English; I understand a little English - I was not walking with the prisoner when I met the girl; she took me into a room alone with her - she went down, and up came these three men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call out to the prisoner, "See me down stairs - don't let me be thrown down?" A. No, all I said to him was, "Give me my money back, and I am willing to go;" all three of the men laid hold of me, and dragged me down by force.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Essex-street, Whitechapel, on the morning of the 29th of May, and heard a cry of watch - I went up, and saw the prisoner holding the prosecutor by the collar- they were scuffling; I took him: he made resistance, and tried to get away - I heard the footsteps of about two more men, but it is rather a dark place, and I could not see them: I searched the prisoner at the station-house, and found 2s. on him; I could not understand the prosecutor's language, but seeing the prisoner pulling him about I took him - I went up stairs in the house, and saw the girl the prisoner lives with is the girl the prosecutor gave the 3s. to; I took the prosecutor to the room, and there were four girls there - he could not point her out, but he tapped her on the hand, and she immediately gave me the 3s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. About four o'clock; I swear the prisoner was scuffling with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050005"/>prosecutor - it was not so dark but that I could see him; I found no money on the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where did you take me? A. In the court in Essex-street; you did not say "Don't ill-use me, and I will go quietly;" I did not take out my staff at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to IsMAEL. Q. Did you spend any money with the female? A. No - I bought some bread and beer with 1s., but spent nothing with the girl.</p>

I worked from morning till night to earn money for my father and mother.</p>

No, not in the kitchen, not to my knowledge; there never was while I was there - there was some kept in the vault adjoining: the kitchen is separated from the vault by a partition: I cannot say whether it is of wood or brick work; there is a kitchen door and a partition which separated the vault and wash-house from the kitchen, and the wash-house from the vault; some time before I left I purchased a penny worth of gunpowder, and used half of it to cleanse the copper flue - I put the other half into a tin flour dredger on the kitchen mantel-piece, and when I left the service it was in the same place as I had put it; I had not scattered the gunpowder about the place - I left on the Wednesday: the fire happened on the Monday morning following; I had bought the gunpowder, to the best of my recollection, about a fortnight before I left, but I am not certain - I know I left the dredger on the mantel-piece when I left, but I never opened it after I put the gunpowder in it - I observed no difference in the appearance of the box than when I placed it there; I believe I had half an ounce of gunpowder for 1d., but am not certain; there was a wine-bottle on the kitchen mantel-piece in the opposite corner to where the dredger-box was placed - I saw that some time before I left, and the prisoner told me the bottle contained torpentine; it was very seldom indeed that there was a fire in the kitchen - master used sometimes to bring home work from the cabinet-shop to dry - he used to dry it by the parlour fire; there was a ledge near the kitchen window; an old dirty tin canister used to stand there, but I do not know what it contained; I never knew the prisoner go out to shool while I was in his service - I never saw a gun there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is this model a correct representation of the house? A. Yes; the prisoner's wife kept a tobacconist's-shop, which was over the kitchen, and the place over the vault is Mr. Spier's, a stationer - the deceased occupied the second floor front room; a French gentleman, named Savory, lived on the first floor - Miss Twamley's rooms were over both the tobacconist's and stationer's shop; a French gentleman, named Giesmar, lived on the third floor - the prisoner and his wife slept in the lower back room; the fire place in the kitchen is against the brick wall - next to that was a copper, and next to that a large box; the staircase led up into the parlour, adjoining the shop - there was a door opening to the kitchen stairs, which led to the wash-house; that door was arched with a brick roof - there was another door leading from the wash-house into the vault; I think that back vault was arched with brick, but am not certain - the dust-hole was close to the vault door, on the left-hand- there was a coal place parted off at the further end of the vault; a person, named Davis, occupied the back room on the first floor, and to that room were some leads - Miss Twamley also occupied the back room on the second floor - they had three rooms; I slept in the back attic - Miss Twamley's rooms were not let furnished, the others were; the room, occupied by the prisoner and his wife, was furnished - not very long before I left some shavings were brought to the prisoner's house, by rather a short man; the prisoner was not at home when they came, but he came in soon after - there was but one sack of shavings; they were placed in the vault - when the prisoner came home he wished for another sack, which was brought, but his wife would not pay for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of their being put into the vault, and say they should have been carried to Dean-street? A. I did not hear him say so, nor that they ought to have been taken to the shop; I bought a pennyworth of gunpowder once before to clean the copper flue - to the best of my knowledge the shavings were in a sack, whether the sack was left with them I cannot be certain; I used a great part of them to light the fire - the prisoner said I ought not to have used them so fast; he was not particular in cautioning me about fire - he used to be very careful in putting the fire out at night; there was a lump of bees'-wax in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your master tell you the turpentine and bees'-wax were not to be touched by you, because it was got to polish a bedstead? A. Yes, a French bedstead, in the first floor front room - he told me not to upset it; before I left he had proposed to clean out the vault below.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the dirt, rubbish, and wood in the vault, and the communication between that and the kitchen, kept your kitchen very untidy? A. It did - I was desirous of keeping the kitchen decent; he told me it would be of no use to clean the kitchen till he had cleaned out the vault, and I delayed it from the Friday till the Monday; I dare say that was a week before I left: the vault was not cleaned out while I was there - I did not clean the kitchen on the Monday, to the best of my recollection; Davis very frequently came home late: master generally kept early hours; he used not to set up for Davis, but used to get up to let him in latterly, as the room he slept in was so very near the door; master and Davis were not on good terms:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050006"/>Davis once had a receipt for his rent on unstamped paper- the tobacconist's shop usually closed about eleven o'clock; the prisoner attended to his business in Dean-street himself, when he had work; I do not know what veneers are - he used to bring home wood in different shapes to dry, both thick and thin; they never kept but one fire while I was there, and that was always in the parlour; the cooking was done in the parlour - they had very few joints, and they were baked.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the work he brought home to dry finished or partly so? A. It appeared partly finished; the first gunpowder was all gone before I bought the second.</p>

            . I am light-porter at Mr. Applegarth's, No. 36, Oxford-street. On Monday morning, the 28th of May, about twenty minutes past six o'clock, while I was opening Mr. Applegarth's shop, which is exactly opposite the prisoner's, I heard a cry of fire and murder proceeding from the other side of the road; I saw a hand through the area grating of Mr. Smithie's house - I went over; it was the area grating under Mr. Spier's (the printer) shop; the eastern area - I saw the prisoner in the area under the printer's shop; he asked me, for God's sake, to open the grating and let him out, as the house was on fire; I endeavoured to do so, but could not get up the grating; it was solding down to the pavement - I called for assistance, and got Bolton, a Policeman, to help me; we broke the tobacconist's shop door open - it was fastened with a lock, but not bolted; we did not perceive any thing in the shop - there was no fire there, but when we got to the door, which leads to the kitchen stairs, the flames were coming up the kitchen stairs and proceeded up the stairs like wildfire, they proceeded so quick; the flames came from the bottom of the stairs, from the kitchen - I then retreated into the street; I did not see any flames on the stairs, but when I was at the front area I saw a kind-of flame through the place where Mr. Smithies was standing; it seemed to come from the part under the printer's shop, the back vault: that was when I first went to Smithies - he was at the area, (under Spier's) and in the vault I saw the fire, not in the kitchen, it was at the further part of the vault - that flame was quite distinct from that which came up the kitchen stairs; the fire from the kitchen changed its colour as it got more towards the door; the flames went right up the stairs of the house with more rapidity than before; they were not quite at the top of the stairs at first, but they proceeded right up the other stairs, right up to the top - they were coming out of the second floor and the garret windows in about ten minutes; I went into the street from the top of the kitchen stairs, and observed the females at the window; the servant was at the garret window - she jumped out of the second floor window, and was saved; I saw one young person at the second floor window, who was afterwards burnt to death - she came to the window to get herself out, but previous to that she put a little boy out; the child hung by the window ledge, but she pushed its hands away, it fell down and was caught by the people below; she then clasped her hands together, and fell back into the flames - she seemed overcome with smoke and suffocation; I did not know her before - I stopped at the fire about an hour; the prisoner came out of the tobacco-shop, which was on fire, as soon as the little boy was thrown out of the window: the flames had then communicated with the tobacco-shop; I observed that he was very much burnt on the face and hands - he said nothing that I heard; when I saw him in the area he had a greyish morning gown or coat on, and he had the same on when he came into the street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How many persons were before the house when you went up? A. None, I was the first there - there is a window leading from the area to the vault under Spier's shop; the area has pretty strong iron bars - I saw his face when he called out to be got out; it did not then appear to be burnt or scorched - I should think about three minutes, and not more, elapsed from that time till we broke into the house and reached the stair head; he did not beg of me to knock at the door or break it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you to alarm the house, as there were five or six females in it, who might be burnt? A. No, he did not; the Policeman went half-way into the shop with me, but he went out again - I was the only person at the head of the stairs; I could not venture down the stairs because it was all on fire at the bottom part; the fire continued to burn up the staircase - the prisoner made his way up the stairs into the shop; he could not have done so without being burnt in the face - his face presented the appearance of having been considerably burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. When standing outside the area, and the prisoner was calling out for help, you saw a flame at the back of the vault, how far back do you think the fire extended? A. I cannot say, but I suppose it was a good distance back, for I was on my knees - I should suppose it presented about a yard to my view; it appeared to be about a yard from the back of the vault - I have been down there since the fire; there is a partition between the front and back part of the vault, and a door, but the door was open- it was broad day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a door from the kitchen to the front area, where the prisoner was? A. I do not know; there is a little archway, but there was no door when I went down; when I looked from the area I could see right along the vault under Spier's shop - I only saw a flame at the end of the vault when I was kneeling down; I saw no candle there - when the prisoner came out of the house his neckcloth was burning; I did not see a box in the kitchen when I went down.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you went into the house at first was the flames coming up the kitchen stairs? A. Yes, but not in the shop; the shop was the last place that caught fire - the flames were out at the window before the shop caught fire; I should think I was there not quite a minute before the Policeman came - he was on the other side of the way, two or three doors lower down: the prisoner was then in the area, desiring me to get him out - if I had got him out that way he would have been totally unburnt; the fire in the vault could not communicate with the kitchen, nor could fire in the kitchen with the vault - when I went down there was an arch between the kitchen and vault, but there was no door.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Then, according to your observation, there were two distinct fires, one in the vault and the other one coming up the staircase? A. Yes.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Bryanstone-mews, west, Bryanstone-square. On the 21st of May I entered the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050007"/>soner's service in Oxford-street; I slept in the back attic for the first four nights - master and mistress slept in the little back room, half-way up the first flight of stairs. On the Friday and Saturday nights, before the fire, I slept with my mistress in her bed-room, and master slept in my room, the back attic - I do not know the reason for that change of beds; master and mistress were not on good terms - every time he came in they were quarrelling; they appeared on better terms on the Sunday: when I entered the service there were some old boxes or boards in the back vault.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether there were any in the wash-house or front vault? A. In the wash-house or kitchen there were none - I occasionally lighted the fire with the shavings: I used to get them out of the back vault - on the Sunday evening before the fire I observed two sacks of shavings placed in the front vault or washhouse - the coal-bin is in the back part of the back vault; I went to it on Sunday morning, about eight o'clock - I had no light with me; I am sure at that time there were no pieces of wood in my way to it; there was nothing but shavings - about three o'clock that Sunday afternoon I left the back attic, in which I sleep, and left the prisoner in the room; I went out, and returned about twenty minutes past five o'clock - I went down into the kitchen, in a few moments after I went down to the kitchen again, and saw the prisoner in the vaults - he was clearing out the old boards and boxes, and he had put the shavings into two sacks; he had on an old pair of trousers, an old coat, and a blue handkerchief tied about his head - he had no light at that time; the door between the vault and kitchen was shut then, I am sure - there had been a fire in the kitchen all day on Sunday, till seven o'clock in the evening; it then went out - there had been no fire in the kitchen the preceding week, except on Saturday afternoon- there had not been a fire there at any other time, while I was in the service.</p>
               <p>Q. After the fire was out on Sunday at seven o'clock, did you observe what remained in the grate? A. Dirt and cinders; there was no wood; I did not see the prisoner remove any thing into the kitchen, but I afterwards saw old boards and boxes removed out of the vault into the kitchen: they were on the copper and dresser, and on the large box, which stood between the copper and watercloset; nobody but the prisoner had been at work in the vault; I was in the kitchen for the last time at eleven o'clock; at night - I did not then observe any sack of shavings in front of the box between the copper and watercloset; if there had been one in that situation I could not have avoided seeing it: I observed over the kitchen mantel-piece a tin box - I did not meddle with it at all. On the Saturday afternoon before the fire there were two wine-bottles on that mantel-piece, one contained spirits of turpentine, and the other was empty; the turpentine was in a full sized wine-bottle, and was full - it stood on its bottom; I took it down and smelt it on the Saturday, and replaced it on its bottom, as it ought to be - it was corked; I do not recollect whether I saw it on the Sunday, but I saw it on the Saturday afternoon - I went to bed on Sunday night as near twelve o'clock as possible, and left master and mistress in their bed-room - he was then in the same dress as he had been working in in the morning; Davis had not come in when I went to bed; I had not seen him - I left a saucepan of clean water on the left hob of the kitchen grate, and the tea-kettle on the right hob, with some water in it, but not quite full - I left them so when I went to bed; there was a very strong smell of turpentine on the stairs between ten and eleven o'clock that evening, and I made a remark to my mistress about it.</p>
               <p>Q. After you corked the turpentine bottle on Saturday, and placed it on the shelf, did it give any smell that you could smell on the stairs? A. Oh no, I am quite sure of that - when I went to bed on Sunday night I am positive there was not a particle of fire either in the kitchen or parlour grate; there had been no fire in the parlour - I was awoke about six o'clock on Monday morning, by an alarm of fire; I got into Miss Twamley's front room, and there saw the Miss Twamley who has been burnt; she was then alive, and in perfect health - I flew to the window, and jumped out into the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. On the Sunday night you left your master and mistress in their bed-room, apparently good friends? A. Yes; there was a tin box and a dredger box on the mantel-piece - the former servant told me there was some gunpowder in the box, and cautioned me about it - I never touched it; I occasionally lighted the fire with shavings - they were loose in the vault then; when they were brought out they were in the wash-house in two sacks; I never saw the bees'-wax - when I came home at five o'clock on Sunday afternoon master had a light in the vault; he was in the further vault, where the coals are kept - there was no access for light but from the door leading from the wash-house to the kitchen: it was necessary for him to have a light to work in that vault, but in the morning he might have removed the rubbish without a candle, if the doors were open, because the front of the wash-house window faced the door - the kitchen window is under the tobacco-shop, and the wash-house window under the stationer's-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it not be done with greater facility with a light? A. Yes it could; the coals were at the further end of the vault.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing your master was at work on Monday morning in the back vault, and had a light, the door leading from the wash-house being open, would a person looking down the grating from the street see the light in the vault? A. He might just see the glimpse of the light in the wash-house, but not the candle from whence it came.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were the shavings brought into the house while you were there? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever know your master go to work in that vault in the dress in which he walked the street? A. I never knew him go down to the vault before the Sunday; he did not then wear the dress he wore in the street - I did not see him on Monday morning.</p>

             re-examined. Q. You say that looking through the area, through the place where the prisoner was, you saw a light - what sort of a light did it appear? A. It seemed to come along the floor; it was a light of a greater body than a candle.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Could you see the body of any light at all? A. No, only the end of the flame; it came along the floor part of the vault - I saw the light itself; it was a lightish flame - it was not the reflection; I suppose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050008"/>the grating is about three feet wide, and should think the bars were about an inch and a half a part.</p>

            . I was apprenticed to a cabinet-maker, but now carry on the business of an auctioneer - I lodged in the first floor back room in the prisoner's house from fifteen to eighteen months, and very frequently came home at late hours; the servant occasionally let me in, and sometimes Mrs. Smithies, and on some occasions the prisoner himself. On Sunday night, the 27th of May, I came home about half-past eleven o'clock, or it might be later; the prisoner let me in - he was dressed in a Bath morning coat, a kind of grey or drab colour - I never saw him at work; I have seen him walk about in that coat - when I came in I went down stairs; the prisoner gave me a candle - I merely said I required a light to go down stairs; he gave me one, and followed me down: I was going to the water-closet, which lays to the left at the bottom of the stairs as you go down; I did not observe any thing till he desired me to be careful of the light, as there was wood and shavings there, he having been clearing out the kitchen to put some veneers and other work there, as his workshops where he worked were considerably too hot for them - I remarked that was rather an unusual thing for a workshop to be too hot for cabinet-maker's wood.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it to the advantage of wood used in that work to be kept in a hot place? A. Decidedly so, the hotter the place the dryer it keeps - he did not reply to my observation that I remember; nothing more passed before I got to the water-closet: when I was in the water-closet he hurried me to come out, saying he wanted to come there himself, and when I came out he did not go there himself, but followed me up stairs; when I got up stairs I went to bed- I was awoke in the morning by the alarm of fire; I found my bed curtains on fire, and escaped on the leads of Mr. Spier's premises - about ten days or a fortnight before the fire the prisoner and his wife were quarrelling; he was asking her for something, which she refused to give him, and he said if she did not give him what he wanted by good means, he would have all, and she should have nothing left.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go when you descended from Spier's leads? A. When I got down into the yard off the leads, Mrs. Smithies was there with me; the prisoner came there while we were both there, and I think there were several persons in the yard, who probably might hear what took place - on the prisoner's coming she said to him, "You wretch, (or you rascal, I do not remember which) you have not been in bed all night; you have set the house on fire on purpose to murder me;" the prisoner replied,"Hold your tongue you foolish woman - don't you see how I am burnt." I follow the business of an appraiser; the furniture in my room all belonged to them, except a chest of drawers; I have occasionally been in the front room first floor, and in the room they themselves lived in; I have been in the kitchen, and in the room on the staircase between the first and second floors: I should estimate the furniture in all those rooms at 60l. or 70l., that includes the room the prisoner and his wife slept in - I never saw any watches or trinkets in his possession, nor china, glass, looking-glasses, or earthenware, except a few trifling articles belonging to domestic use; every thing I observed there was of the most common kind - there were one or two common paintings; I never saw any pictures worth 30l. nor 30s. - there were the common necessary house fixtures, and a few things in the shop, belonging to the business; I should think them altogether worth from 15l. to 20l. or 25l.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any possibility of their being worth 100l.? A. Decidedly not; when I saw the prisoner in the morning speaking to his wife, he had the same dress on as he let me in in the night before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you carry on business in Soho-square? A. Yes; the premises and business belong to my father - I am not a partner; I may be considered in his employ - I do not know that I am on bad terms with the prisoner: there has been occasionally a pique, owing to some expressions he used towards me, not that I used towards him - I had been in his debt for rent, but I paid him a week previous to the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. But had you not been in arrear for rent, and been asked for it? A. I may have been repeatedly in arrear -I have been asked for it, and named a day when I would pay - I may have been asked two or three times before I have paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time have you said, you had that in your possession, if you were pressed for the payment of rent, which would ruin the prisoner? A. No, I swear that - I can tell to what you allude; I paid my rent, and asked for an acknowledgment, and the prisoner gave me one on unstamped paper for 7l.; he asked me for the money again a few days after - I told him I had an acknowledgment; his remark to me was that what I had was of no earthly use - I never said I had that in my possession which would ruin him and his wife; I told him if he persisted in demanding the money, I had that in my possession which would not benefit him, but to show my principle of honor, to convince him I had no improper motive, if he would give me a stamped receipt I would burn the other; I did not pay the 7l. again; his wife gave me a stamped receipt after that, and before her face I burnt the unstamped one; I have more than once desired time of him for rent which was due; I never threatened to ruin him and his wife by exposing the circumstance of the unstamped paper.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you remain in the water-closet? A Some few minutes - I cannot say how long, not longer than was necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not there half or a quarter of an hour? A. Certainly not; I had a newspaper reading there - he did not complain when I came out that he was cold and chilled, and was going to bed; I was not there longer than I had occasion to be - I do not know Thomas Strong; I was examined before the Corner.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what any body said to you after the examination, did you say you had given your evidence in a prejudiced manner? A. They questioned me about my evidence; I said I had spoken nothing but the truth, and I was not answerable to them what evidence I gave before a person holding His Majesty's warrant; I said if there was prejudice, it was sufficient to prejudice a man to awake and find his bed-curtains on fire, and it did not matter whether a man cut your throat or burnt you, if he took your life, it was quite sufficient to prejudice any individual; I do not recollect saying I would not stir across<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050009"/>the road to save the prisoner's life, nor any thing like it; I was never examined before a Court of Justice before.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you found your curtains on fire, did you stay some little time in the room and secure some of your clothes? A. No, I got out on the leads, put my hand in again, drew a drawer out of the top chest, and threw it out of window; I cannot say whether Mrs. Smithies came out at the same window after me - I have asked her if she came out before or after me, but do not remember the answer she gave; some persons said she came out before, and some after, but I was so frightened I have no recollection whether it was before or after: I had not my senses about me sufficient to know - I had the presence of mind to get my drawer of clothes, but my senses after that immediately left me.</p>
               <p>Q. May you not have been in that state of alarm as to be mistaken about there being actually fire in your room? A. I was awoke out of a sound sleep by my bed being actually in flames, and it was visible outside the window, for I really did not stop to look till I got out of the window, and it was that frightened me more - I never particularly noticed, but should think the large box is about four feet from the water-closet, and beyond that is the copper; as the prisoner stood at the bottom of the stairs he held a light, and told me to be careful of the light with some shavings that were at the bottom of the stairs, and to mind I did not hit myself against some wood by the door of the closet; all the people did not leave the Inquest room before I left.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you burnt the unstamped paper was any rent due by you? A. I paid some more money at the same time, and took a stamped receipt for the whole, and burnt the unstamped receipt; I slept on the night of the fire with my bed-room door wide open, as I generally do - the window in my room opens into the back yard of a workshop; it was through that I made my escape.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. How many rooms in the house have you been into? A. The front room first floor, which is Savory's, and the small room behind, over the prisoner's bed-room; I have never been in his bed-room, but have looked in frequently as I was passing, when the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the fittings up of the shop mahogany? A. I think they were only painted to imitate mahogany, but will not be sure; the prisoner's wife attended to the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Repeat the expression his wife used to him after the fire? A. She said, "You wretch (or rascal) you have not been in bed all night; you have set fire to the house on purpose to murder me;" I am quite sure she said "on purpose to murder me" - other persons heard it as well as me; I am quite sure I stated the words "to murder me" to the Coroner - I remember stating them; when I mentioned the words at the Inquest I heard somebody start up and say, "We heard that expression as well as yourself;" Valentine heard the expression from that person - I have no doubt the Corner heard it as well as others.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was Mr. Allen, the vestry-clerk, present when you gave your evidence? A. Not that I remember - I do not remember speaking to him; the conversation with the prisoner's wife was four or five minutes after I had got down from the window; I had quite recovered myself, so as accurately to remember what passed- I suppose ten minutes had elapsed.</p>

            . I am fireman to the British Fire-office, and have been so thirty-seven years. I went to this fire I think between eight and nine o'clock on the morning in question; on the Wednesday, about eleven, I got down into the kitchen, by a fireman cutting a passage through one of the joists of the shop floor - I went down alone; I did not observe any veneers about the fire-place: there was a good deal of rubbish which had come down between the copper and the fire-place - that was the ruins of the fire; it had not come as far as the fire-place; a man named Wing handed me a light, and I went through the front vault into the back vault, and against the coal-bin I saw there had been a fire made on a short piece of board; the board was nearly two feet long, and eight inches broad.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you suppose there had been a fire on that piece of wood? A. There was the remains of wood which had been burned - I left it there; it was near the coal-bin- the bin is made of brick and mortar, and has two boards at the bulk head, and those boards were burnt, but not much- there was a partition to the coal-bin, and that was burnt, but not much; I discovered a wine-bottle on the top of some large stone bottles - it laid down without any cork, and the bottom upwards; it was empty - I smelt it, and it appeared to have contained turpentine; I then called Wing down, and he smelt it; I sent him for some of the neighbours to come and see the place; I stopped there, without disturbing any thing, and showed them round the place with a light - I went to the kitchen fire-place; there was a kettle with water in it on one hob, and water in a saucepan on the other - there was nothing particular in the fire-place; I found a card at the end of a board on which fire had been made; there was also a few shavings and a little gunpowder - some of the gunpowder was on the card, which was a little bent, and some on the wooden bench.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the card bent? A. Longways, and some of the gunpowder was scattered near the shavings, not a foot from them - the shavings and card were about four feet from the board on which the fire had been; I did not move the card at all - there is no fire-place nor grate in the back vault; it was impossible for fire in the kitchen grate to communicate with the board in the vault on which fire had been made; the vault is separated from the kitchen by a brick wall - I did not go towards the watercloset, but a man named Saunders did, and dug up some shavings beyond the copper - I took hold of them, and part of a sack was found; I felt the bottom of it myself - it was about two feet beyond the copper, between that and the water-closet; some of the shavings near the card appeared scorched, not as if they had been on fire, but as if there had been a flash, and they had gone out themselves; the shavings were not above a yard from the card.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The shavings that were scattered were between the copper and the water-closet? A. No, that was the sack; those shavings were in the back vault - there were a great many workmen on the premises; I left on Tuesday, and went again on Wednesday - I was not examined before the Coroner; I did not communicate to my superiors what I had discovered, only to the neighbours.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050010"/>Q. When was you first called on to give evidence? A. I was ordered by the beadle to go to Mr. Allen's office about a week after; I could not see in the vault without a light - there was no ruins of fire in the vault; it was entirely clear from ruins, and the wash-house was clear - the ruins had fallen through into the kitchen into which we dug; the back vault was arched, and all surrounded with brick.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a more unlikely place for a man to set fire to a house than to commence in a bricked vault? A. If he had put all the shavings and all the stuff together there he could not have set it on fire; it must have burnt itself out - it was impossible to set fire to a house there; I really believe if there had been two sacks of shavings there it would not have set the house on fire.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Could a person see from the outside into the back vault? A. No; they could not have seen fire in the vault if they had laid on the pavement - they might have seen the smoke or a particular light from the area by laying their head down to the curb.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. In your judgment, was it possible for a person to see a light from the area grating, or must it have been the reflection only? A. It must have been the reflection only - they could not have seen the light; by laying down they might have seen fire, but there was no fire there to see.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have said there was the appearance of there having been fire - if a person laid down with his head on the curb-stone could he see a fire if there was one? A. He might.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. The gunpowder in the vault was not ignited? A. No - I have not got it here; I took some of it up, held it over a lamp, and it ignited - that never could have been lighted before; there could not have been any thing like a large fire in the back vault - a person laying his head on the curb, and looking through the grating and the door of the vault, if there had been a candle, might have seen the reflection of it, but not the candle - if a fire had been attempted in the vault it must have extinguished itself immediately; it could not have burnt five minutes - my notion is, that if a fire had been attempted to be made in the vault, it had failed and gone out: there was a great deal of fire in the kitchen - the back vault is quite a dark cellar, and could not be cleaned out without a light; some of the boards which had been put up to the coal-hole were partly burnt but very trifling; the boards are three or four feet long, and seven inches wide - there were two of them, one above the other: I have not brought any of the shavings which were partly scorched; there were a good many stone bottles in the vault, but it was a wine-bottle I mentioned, and I only saw one - that was the only bottle which was free from dust; the kitchen was in a heap of ruins - they were above the flooring of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they must have been above the copper? A. Yes; I had to clear away all the ruins before I could discern any thing, and under the ruins I found some shavings- shavings would burn best loose; if stuffed into a bag they would be like a piece of timber almost, and would take twice the time to burn; I could only find one winebottle in the vault; I do not know whether the kitchen has been searched for bottles - one side of the copper was clear, and by the fire-place it was all clear when I got down through the rafters - there was no rubbish laying between the copper and the front of the street; not a soul had been clearing away the rubbish before I went - I looked at the fire-place; I believe there might be two or three sticks of what they light the fire with in the grate - I saw a few in the grate; it was such wood as is in bundles for lighting fires - I did not examine it, and cannot say whether it had been lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there six or seven pieces? A. I cannot say; I know there were three or four: it seemed as if there had been a fire in the grate, and it had gone out - the fire was not laid; the wood was not in the grate, it was at the top of the grate, by the side.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there was not wood between the bars of the fire-place? A. I do not know - I would not wish to say a word untrue; there might be two or three pieces, but I took no particular notice - to the best of my knowledge there were two or three pieces of wood in the fire-place, but not in the bars, to my knowledge; I will not swear none was in the bars - I did not go to look for it; no broken glass was found in the kitchen, to my knowledge - I saw no broken bottles among the ruins.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were the shavings in the sack? A. I only felt the sack - it was the bottom of a sack; the shavings lay on the top of it, as if they were in it, as if the sack had been burnt to the bottom with the shavings in it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were the stairs much burnt? A. They were all burnt; I cannot say whether shavings had been strewed about the stairs - the wine-bottle appeared to have been recently placed where I found it; it was quite clean - I found no door between the wash-house and back vault, nor any candle in the back vault.</p>
               <p>EDWARD SAUNDERS. I am a fireman of the British Fire-office. On Monday, the 28th of May, I attended at the prisoner's premises in Oxford-street - I was the first of our men who got there; the house was burning rapidly -I have been a fireman twenty-nine years; it was a brick built house - it was burning in the usual way a fire does, when once it gets ahead; when it was out I got up to the one pair back room; the second floor was consumed, and had fallen on the first on a slant, and I there saw the body of a woman very much disfigured; the legs and arms were burnt, some part off, every bit of the hair was burnt, and the head very much burnt - there was nothing but a mass of burnt flesh; I should think suffocation had caused the person to fall backwards - the body was burnt to a cinder; I have no doubt that body was burnt to death - I saw the same body before the Coroner's Jury; I went down to the kitchen with two or three others on the Wednesday, and observed all the kitchen utensils and chairs, and a quantity of kitchen furniture; it was all a mass of ruins - there were rubbishing boxes and old chairs, which I turned out of one arch into the other; after taking the shovel and clearing away the ruins, as I came to furniture I chacked it into the eastern arch - I went out of the kitchen into the vault; there is a door-way, but I do not think there is a door - I went on from there up to the end of the vault; there is no door between the two vaults - when I came to the end of the vault, near the coal-hole, I observed some embers of sticks in that corner; it was pointed out to me: I went up to it, and saw a fire had been made on there - there was about a hatfull of embers, and some pieces of wood, stuck up on end, had been burnt at the bottom; that was heavy hardish wood, about a yard long, and about as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050011"/>thick as my arm; they were set up end-ways against the brick wall of the arch, some of them near the coal-hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of them lean against the wood work of the coal-hole? A. I do not think they did; they stood more by the arch - some of the wood work of the coal-hole was burnt through, burnt in two; there was about half a chaldron of coals in the bin - the pieces of wood stood up as if they had been there for a length of time; they stood separate from each other.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from each other? A. Close together - a good many of them; there were two or three in one particular place - there might be four or five pieces of wood altogether, and there were some boxes all along the brick wall; I noticed a basket and some hay-bands; there was a bit of hay-band about the basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the fire in the vault and the fire in the kitchen any communication with each other? A. Not that I could see.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You was working under Moakes? A. Yes; he did not see all that I did - he was in the vault before me, and when I was there, but not all the time I was there; I was backwards and forwards several times - I was examined before the Coroner at the first inquest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Moakes see the boards which were burnt in two? A. He saw it before I did; I was turning the rubbish over with a shovel to make a thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you obliged to turn the rubbish over in the vault before you found the sticks? A. I turned over no rubbish in the arched vault - Monkes saw the burnt boards before me; he had a lamp handed down to him - it could not be seen without a light; it might be twelve or one o'clock in the day when I examined the vault; there appeared to have been very little burning in the vault - the boards were burnt in two, but they were not thicker than your thumb - they were small slips of wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to have been burnt by something which had been set fire to, or that they had been set fire to, as in the first instance you say they stood upright? A. Yes, leaning against the arch of the brick work - they were burnt at the bottom; none of those were burnt in two; that was pieces of wood which laid against a board which formed the coal-hole; they were about an inch and a half thick and about two feet long, pieces of sticks, not boards- it was I who found the bottom of the sack.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see a quart bottle in that place? A. Yes, and smelt it; it smelt apparently of turpentine, but it stood with its mouth downwards; I saw no other bottle there - I saw some rubbishing bottles, which generally lay in cellars; I did not examine them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the turpentine bottle clean or dirty outside? A. Clean; I found no glass bottles which smelt of wine - (

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find the bottom of the sack? A. Part of the sack I found at the very bottom of the rubbish, on the earth or floor, as I dug - the fire appeared to me to have began beyond the copper and beyond the window, because the most fire was there, near the bottom of the stairs; I found an old chair near the fire-place - I do not think that was burnt at all; the beams of the kitchen ceiling were most burnt right over the copper; they were falling down - the beams near the street were not burnt so much; the stairs were consumed - they were very near the copper; I had four or five feet of rubbish to clear away before I found the sack; there was a very small particle of shavings - they dug the sack out after I left; when I first found it it was a bit of a sack.</p>

            . I am an architect and surveyor to the County Fire-office. I drew this plan of the premises; it is correct, according to the best of my observation - Mr. Spiers had made an insurance at our office; I went to the premises to see what damage was sustained; I examined the prisoner's premises - the first day I went was on the Tuesday or Wednesday; the rubbish had not been cleared then, and I made no examination; I went again on the Wednesday afternoon, and examined - I went into the back vault, and near the coal-bin there was this block of wood; there were several other pieces of wood in a slanting direction against the block of wood, inclining towards the coal-bin, and other pieces of wood laying in the coal-bin; one of which was this angular piece - there had been a fire made on the block, and it had burnt the ends of these pieces of wood and also caught the side of the coal-bin, which it had burnt nearly through; it had also communicated with the pieces of wood which were thrust into the coals; there were short pieces of wood thrust into the coals, laying nearly horizontally, and connecting these upright pieces, as it were, with the coal-bin - one side of the coal-bin was formed at the upper part with loose old canvas - my attention was then directed to a shelf on the east side of this vault, and on that shelf I saw about a hatful of shavings, placed conically, and on removing them I found a piece of paper, which had been greased, and upon which gunpowder had exploded - the fire had partially caught the shavings, but want of air or the blast had put it out; the powder was not quite under the shavings, but a little on one side; there was about a drachm - it was two or three inches from the shavings, and partially connected by particles of gunpowder being loose as if it had been thrown down - I observed a card, the size of a common address card, doubled into the form of a trough and gunpowder on it; about a quarter of an ounce, I should think- it was fine shooting powder; I saw an ordinary sized wine-bottle, which smelt of turpentine - it was inverted and inclining in one corner; the outside was clean.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any injury whatever done to any place in the vault, except where these combustible things were found? A. None at all - there was no door from the kitchen to the vault; there was merely the doorcase - I saw no remains of a door; there was a door hung between the vault and the wash-house; that was not burnt at all - the top part of the kitchen mantel-shelf, over the chimney-piece, was burnt a little, but the shelf was not much injured: the under part of it, next the fire-place, was not burnt - the upper part was a little burnt; I should imagine that was done from the recoil of the flames from the ceiling; the fire must have originated beyond the copper, because the shop floor, between the copper and the street, was sufficiently sound after the fire to allow a number of people to stand on it - the floor remained, but it was scorched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050012"/>underneath; a few feet beyond the copper, towards the window, it was pretty firm, but the other way it was burnt, and would not bear standing on; the copper on the north side nearest the street was not much injured; the lead work was not melted away - the sashes and frames in the kitchen window were not cracked nor injured; the lead on the other side of the copper had melted - the dresser, which stood near the window on the east side of the kitchen, was not burnt - I saw in the back vault the tin top of a tobacco-box, and a little gunpowder in it; it stood about three feet from the shavings on the shelf - the joints of the kitchen ceiling, beyond the copper, were burnt away, nearly to charcoal, and those between the copper and the street were partially burnt but sound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. At what time on Wednesday did you go to the premises? A. About ten o'clock; I then gave orders for the ruins to be removed, which was done in my absence - I was present when the sack was found; I do not think much had been disturbed before that.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the ruins been near the door, going from the kitchen to the vault? A. They had dropped the ruins away to enable the firemen to get into the vault.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the ruins had fallen so as to prevent their getting from the kitchen to the vault? A. I imagine so - there was a quantity of rubbish and water in the front vault or wash-house, not black rubbish; I have heard Moakes and Saunders examined - the wood stood against the coal-bin; I have heard them state that it stood against the wall - I was not examined before the Coroner respecting Miss Twamley's death, but respecting the death of another person; I gave evidence of the state of the premises, and took the Jury to examine them - I gave a general description of it, and should think I stated about the wood being thrust into the coals, but I will not swear that, because I took the Jury to view the premises; the vault was certainly not a likely place to succeed in setting the house on fire - I think the fire took place at the bottom of the stairs, and finding the sack and shavings there also makes me think so; I should not think a man in his senses would think of setting fire to the house in the back vault - the canvas forms the eastern side of the coal-bin; there was wood about eighteen inches high, and above that a canvas partition; the burnt wood was about eighteen inches off it. I should think - the back vault was exceedingly damp; if there had been fire enough to dry the canvas, it would have caught - there is more turpentine in wood than in canvas, and when it once gets lighted it is more likely to get ahead; the canvas would certainly have been burnt if the fire had risen to its height - the card of gunpowder was about two feet nine inches from the shavings on the shelf in the back vault.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been a considerable fire in the back vault, so as to be seen from the front, do not you think the gunpowder must have ignited? A. I think not, it must have been a very strong fire to consume this wood, and if it was possible, by laying down, to see any fire, that fire might have existed a long time without burning the shavings; there must have been a considerable fire to produce this effect on this wood, but that had no connexion with the gunpowder.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were not some of these pieces of wood actually propping up the wood, and confining it? -A. They were; I did not go on my knees at the area, to see if I could have seen fire; I do not think it could have been the fire itself originating from this block which was seen; I think it must have been the reflection - no fire in the kitchen could have reflected in any way so as to be seen in the back part of this vault; I do not exactly swear that it must have been the reflection of fire in the vault, because I think it probable it might be the reflection of fire from the staircase - there is a brick wall between them but there is a door in it, and I think there might have been a body of fire near the door, the light of which might have reflected in the vault; if there was only fire in the kitchen, I cannot, in any way, account for the fire I found at the coal-bin; there was no connexion whatever between the two fires.</p>
               <p>Q. If the coals about the coal-bin had ignited, from the quantity of coals, would the smoke have been very considerable, supposing an ignorant man had thought he could set them on fire? A. Very considerable, and that would increase the difficulty of getting into the house to ascertain where the fire originated, but the draft would have carried it away up the staircase; the foot of the stairs was a very likely place to set fire to the rest of the house; it was the very place to begin at to burn the house down; I pointed out to the Coroner's Jury things exactly as I found them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You think there was fire on that block, would a person kneeling down and looking from the area see a light proceeding as reflection from that fire? A. They would certainly, but they must hold their heads close to the ground; I think it very possible to see a light.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it possible for the person to ascertain whether it was a light from a candle, or from any other substance? A. Yes; I should imagine a light from a candle would be very different; I should not suppose the light of a candle could be seen unless it was placed on the ground; I could not see from the vault into the street, unless close under the window, and then you must look up, as the area surrounds the window, with a close grating over it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing the fire to have originated where you think it did, would it, in your judgment, burn the house down before the whole of the shavings might have been consumed? A. After the shop door was opened the draft coming from the street, would cool the lower part of the house, and carry the great-body of fire up the house, and during that time I should think the fire in the kitchen would slacken a little - it is quite consistent with the fire originating there; by setting fire to the shavings that part of the shavings should not be burnt.</p>

            . I am inspector of the C division of the Police. On the morning of the 28th of May I was called to the house in question; I got there about twenty minutes past six o'clock - I heard some conversation between Miss Twamley and some other person, in consequence of which I directed my attention to the prisoner; I first saw him about twenty-five minutes past six - he was then in the back premises of an ironmonger's, at the back of the house; Miss Twamley was in an iron-foundry, and an elderly lady was laying down - I ascertained that the prisoner belonged to the house, and asked him if he knew in what way the fire had originated; he said he did not know - he desired me to look at his face, and said, "You see how I am burnt;" I said, "You have had a fortunate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050013"/>escape - your whiskers and eye-brows are all burnt off;" I left him to attend to other duties: in consequence of something I afterwards heard, I went to Middlesex-hospital, saw him there in bed, and asked him again if he knew in what way the fire originated, or where it originated - he said he believed it originated in the kitchen; he said he had placed some veneers near the fire-place to dry, and he supposed the fire from the grate must have communicated with the veneers - I asked if it was possible fire could fall from the grate and set fire to the veneers, without something being put to them to convey the fire, shavings or something of that kind - he said there was some shavings and dirt, which were swept up, which might have caught fire, and set the veneers on fire - I asked if there was a clothes-horse near the fire, or any linen; he said No- I then asked if he was insured; he hesitated, and said he did not know; I said it was very strange he did not know whether he was insured - he answered, "I am insured, and I am not insured, if you can make that out;" I said I did not understand him, and asked for an explanation - he then said he had insured, but had not received his policy, and did not know whether he should be considered as being insured; I asked if he had paid the premium, and said it was generally the case after thirty days if the policy was not sent to the house, to make application; I before that asked how long he had been insured - he hesitated, and said he did not exactly know; I asked if he had been insured twelve months - he said No, not twelve months, or not so long; I asked if he had been insured six months - he said, No, he did not think he had been insured so long; I said, "Can you tell me within a week or a fortnight? have you been insured three months?" he said it might be about that time, he was not certain, but he thought about six or seven weeks; I then asked for what sum he was insured - he said for about 620l. or 630l.; I asked what was his reason for getting up so early in the morning, having previously told me he got up at half-past five o'clock, for the purpose of making a fire and making himself some gruel, he not being very well - I then asked where he was at the time the fire first commenced, or howhe first found out there was a fire - he said he was in the vault, arranging something; I do not exactly recollect what, and he was alarmed by smoke coming into the vault, and made his escape afterwards through the fire - I asked the situation of the kitchen with the vault he was in; he said he had to run through the fire to make his escape - that he was obliged to come out of the vault into the kitchen, where he found a great blaze of fire, for the purpose of making his escape up the staircase.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have not given us the date of this conversation at the hospital? A. It was on the morning of the fire, about a quarter to eight o'clock; I went there to apprehend him on suspicion - nobody sent me there to question him: I do not think I told him he need not answer my questions unless he pleased -I was dressed as an officer; he was in bed, with his face and hands covered with plasters - whether he was suffering from pain I cannot say any thing about; he might certainly be in pain, but he answered my questions very readily; he was laying in bed, undressed - a nurse was there - I did not commit to writing what he said; I recollect perfectly well all that passed - I did not tell him he need not answer me, nor that I had come to apprehend him: I told him I was an officer, for I considered that he could not see me; I was not examined before the Coroner - I communicated to some of the Jurymen what I knew; I was ordered by Mr. Allen to attend the Inquest the second day, when it was adjourned - Mr. Clele was one of the Jurymen whom I communicated with - he lives opposite the watch-house; I did not call on him - it was while the female who was burnt was laying at the watch-house; Clele and another Juryman, who lives next door but one to the watch-house, was there; I was in the Inquest room part of the time on Friday - my superintendent told me to attend; I had told him what had passed the same morning, and also Colonel Rowan - the prisoner told me he believed the fire began in the kitchen; he said he was arranging something in the vault, but I cannot tell what, or where - he did not say he had been cleaning out the vault for the purpose of its being shown to a person who was coming to take the premises.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure he did not say he had been cleaning out the vault? A. I cannot say that he did; he said he had been arranging something in the vault, but what his answer was exactly I cannot say.</p>

            . At the time of the fire I lodged in the front garret of the house - I took it furnished; I should think the furniture in it worth 15l. or 18l. - Mr. Savory, who lodged in the first floor front room, was a friend of mine; he had left a few days before the fire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was your room completely furnished? A. Yes, there was a feather bed, mabogany drawers, a mahogany table, with a drawer in it, a small looking-glass, four-post mahogany bedstead, with common sort of curtains, a straw mattress, an old carpet, four cane chairs, a japanned wash-hand stand, a very small curtain to the window, tea things, and every thing necessary for tea - I at first paid 7s. a week, and as I gave notice to leave I was to pay only 5s.; I believe the chairs were japanned; I did not notice any gold on them - there was a round table between the windows; it had no doors under it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did they agree to let you all this for 5s. a week? A. Yes; I certainly would not give 15l. for the whole - I do not know the value of furniture, but think it not worth more.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Blunt, Roy, and Co., who are attornies for Mr. Nichols, the freeholder of this house; I collected his rents. About March I made several applications to the prisoner for 40l., half a year's rent, but could not get it from him; he said he was short of cash - I at last applied to Mr. Oxenham to distrain, and after the distress the prisoner paid me 20l. on account, and I gave him till the 10th of April to pay the remainder; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050014"/>received this paper from him - I applied for the other 20l. many times, personally; he did not pay, he pleaded shortness of cash, and at other times, that he was waiting to discount a hill; several applications were made to me shortly before the fire - the last was on the Saturday afternoon before the fire, and I gave him the whole of Monday to pay it, and no longer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was this a conversation with the prisoner? A. No; he paid 80l. per annum - the lease was originally granted to his wife; I think it was for twenty-one years - I should not think it a valuable lease at the present time, for rents have fallen lately.</p>

            . I am assistant to my father, an auctioneer and appraiser, in Oxford-street. In March last I levied a distress on the prisoner's goods for 40l.; I went over the house particularly, by order of Mr. Field, to ascertain the value of the goods; the prisoner was with me; I asked him to show me the furniture in the house, and went all over with him, except the kitchen - I suppose the fair value of all the furniture I saw in the house was 100l. - that is quite a fair value - (Miss Twamleys had not then come in;) I include the fixtures and every thing in the house, except the kitchen furniture, which I did not see -I saw no library of books, no plate, watches, nor trinkets; the crockery was very triffling - the looking-glasses and china were nothing like worth 35l.; I saw a few old glazed prints, worth about 10l.: 100l. is more than I would give for fixtures and every thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Then one-tenth of that amount was the pictures? A. Yes; I am not putting an auction price to them, it is more than they would fetch under the hammer - the shop fixtures were shelving with mahogany fronts, and a mahogany top counter; I saw no wine - I did not see all the cupboards in the house; I do not recollect how many rooms I went into -I examined all the fixtures; I cannot say what he had expended in fixtures.</p>
               <p>Q. Without reference to the valuable things, would you undertake to say they had not cost him 200l.? A. I would replace them for considerably less; 200l. would be the utmost altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the front of the shop mahogany? A. Deal, I believe; I did not notice the window front - I had nothing to do with that, and do not know whether it was plate-glass, as that would be the landlord's fixtures.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were there jars gilt and labelled? A. Yes, and I believe there was a portion of pipes, snuff-boxes, and such things as they sell; I do not know their value - I believe the top of the counter was mahogany.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the British Fire-office. A proposal was made to me on the 13th of April, for an insurance of the furniture and stock at No. 398, Oxford-street; I cannot say the prisoner is the person, but I have the proposal - I wrote down accurately the directions, and received the premium; the amount insured was 700l. - the policy has not been executed by the directions; the person who made the proposal had not come to me to know why he had not received the policy; we should send it when executed - in case of fire the party would receive his money, though he had not received his policy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have no recollection of the personal appearance of the person who came? A. I cannot swear to the prisoner, but from the faint recollection I have of the circumstance, he is like the person; he certainly resembles him, and I should think he is the person - I believe he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is your recollection of what took place very faint? A. It is, it was some time since; we have many applications in a month - I cannot speak with certainly to his identity.</p>

            . I am engineer of the British Fire-office. I saw the prisoner in the hospital on the morning of the fire, and asked if he was insured; he said he was; I asked at what office, and he said at the British.</p>
               <p>MR. BURROW. The proposal is in the prisoner's name; I am not aware of any other proposal for insurance of property in that house - the items are 280l. on household goods. &amp;c.; 160l. on stock and utensils in trade therein; 100l. for fixtures in the said house and shop; 35l. on china, glass, looking-glasses, and earthenware; 25l. on watches and trinkets; 30l. on pictures and prints, 70l. on household goods, &amp;c. in the said dwelling-house, in trust for Miss Tomlin - I took these instructions partly from paper and partly from verbal directions; the person paid the premium, and I produced a receipt for it, and the money would be paid, if there was no objection to the manner the fire happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know whether your office contributes towards the expences of this prosecution? A. I am not aware - this proposal is in the language we usually fill them up.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the applicant states the amount which he intends to insure, and you submit to him the amounts to which it is to be divided? A. Exactly so - china, trinkets, watches, &amp;c. are at a different rate, and we require specific sums for them; we send a surveyor to look at the house, but not at the property - I do not know whether he goes inside the house; it is not usual to tell persons the premises will be looked at.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has the surveyor more to do than to look at the house and report to the office about the building? A. That is all; I am not aware that any claim has been made on this insurance.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When a party wishes to insure for 700l. for instance, do you make the division of the amounts? A. No, it is impossible I can be aware of the value - I ask how much should be for such and such articles - we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050015"/>give the proposer a paper to divide the sums, but the paper does not state the rate of premiums.</p>

            . I live in Great Chapel-street, Soho, and am a baker. Smithies called on me about a fortnight before the fire, and asked if I could inform him where he could have any shavings; I told him I would send him a sack - I sent a man, named Casey, with a sack to him, a few days after; on the Sunday before the fire (the 27th of May), Smithies called on me, about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning, and wanted the loan of a sack -I said he could have one; he called about three in the afternoon, and took it away himself - his house is two or three hundred yards from mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did he tell you he had an order for some veneered tables? A. No, he said nothing about veneers; I have heard veneers require a sharp fire to champ and dry them - when he borrowed the sack he said he wanted to clear some rubbish out of the vault, and wanted to put some rubbish in the sack, which lay about.</p>

            . I deal in shavings. Some time before the fire in Oxford-street I took a sack of shavings to No. 398; Mr. Giles sent me there; I shot and emptied them just at the bottom of the kitchen stairs, and they sent the girl to put them on one side; when I went up stairs I saw the prisoner, and he told me to bring another sack of shavings; I agreed that the price of the two was to be 10d. - I took the other sack to the house in about half an hour; Mrs. Smithies would not take it in - she said one was enough; this was ten or twelve days before the fire, not on a Sunday.</p>

            . I am a house-surgeon at Middlesex-hospital. I remember the prisoner being admitted there on Monday, the 28th of May, about half-past six o'clock in the morning; his hands were very much burnt, and his face also - those on the hands appeared ordinary burns - those on the face appeared peculiar; they appeared to be blue - there was a case of burning from gunpowder in the hospital in November last, and from the observation I made of this case, there was a similarity in some respects: the eye-brows and lashes were completely burnt off, and the colour was very similar to that case - each of the prisoner's knees were burnt; he wore trousers, which were not at all burnt about the knees - there was a small hole on one knee, but not a burn; there was no hole in the other knee - he wore long stockings, and neither of the stockings had any burn about the knee; the hospital is three or four hundred yards from his house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What experience have you had in burning from gunpowder? A. I have not had much; I never saw the features of a person after an explosion, except the one in November - I have read on the subject; gunpowder will generally leave grains or marks in the face for some time after -Mr. Harris did not apply to see the prisoner in the hospital, to my knowledge - no medical man was refused admission, to my knowledge; there was not any remains of gunpowder in the prisoner's face - I cannot say the burning was produced by gunpowder; his face was generally burnt - his trousers were loose.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it at all extraordinary for a man, ascending up a staircase, to have his face and hands burnt? A. Not without his clothes being burnt - I did not see his coat; he had not got it on when he was brought - I am not a medical student; I am the house-surgeon - I had a particular reason for inspecting his clothes, as I knew I should have to be examined at the Inquest; I was not told of the charge till after I had examined his face - I examined his clothes the day I went to the Inquest, the first of June - I was at the hospital when he came in; I saw him first in bed, but have every reason to believe the clothes were the same as he wore; they were given to the nurse, and on the first of June I asked her to fetch his clothes; she brought them, and I examined them - ointment, composed of chalk, was applied to his knees the day after he came in, but on his admission the burns on the knees were not pointed out - he was seriously burnt, and in a dangerous state for some time - he was in very severe pain on the 28th, but was worse after, owing to a fever coming on; I should think that on the 28th he was not cool and collected, so as to give a clear account to the officer; I did not know he had been there till to-day - persons get into the hospital by application to me; I have no recollection of a Policeman applying to me; I did not give the fireman permission to see him that day.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If an officer comes to apprehend a man for felony, you have no means of bindering him? A. No - the prisoner showed no signs of insanity or dele<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050016"/>rium, nothing but pain and its ordinary effects - no clothes were brought to him at the hospital, to my knowledge; I should think the explosion of a small quantity of gunpowder might discolour the face without leaving grains, so as to make a permanent discolouration, but I know very little about it - I should think it depends on the manner in which the explosion took place.</p>

            . I am vestry-clerk of St. Anne, Westminster. The house is in that parish.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I have lived at No. 398, Oxford Street, nearly three years, where I kept a tobacconist's shop, but am by trade a cabinet and chair maker, which business I carried on at No. 101, Dean-street, at the back of the above-mentioned premises, About three weeks prior to my late house in Oxford-street being burnt down, my wife found fault with purchasing fire-wood, when, at the same time, there was plenty of spare wood in the vault, which might be chopped up; on the Sunday following, being a fortnight before the fire, I set too and looked cut a quantity of wood that was in the vault, but found that much of it was too good for that purpose, and which I could use for a better account in my own business, and having a quantity of rosewood veneers in the shop, and the heat of the shop having made them crack, I resolved to clear out the vault, and deposit the veneers in it, to keep them from injury. About ten days previous to the above-mentioned time, I was in want of shavings to lay down veneers, it being necessary to prepare them by frequent heating and cooling, so as to render them fit for use, the fires for which purpose being commonly made of shavings; and as, in my small business, I did not make a quantity sufficient for my own use, I applied to a baker, (Mr. Giles,) requesting that if any one came hawking shavings to send them to me, as I wanted some; in consequence of which, Mr. Giles sent a man with some to my house in Oxford-street - I was not at home at the time, but my wife purchased a sack full of him, which by mistake was taken down stairs and put into the vault, instead of being sent round to my workshop, as I had left orders. I one morning found

            , my former servant, going into the vault with a lighted candle in her hand, upon which I called her back, and told her never to take a candle into that vault again so long as those shavings were there, but to put the candle upon the sink, which is opposite the door, and she could see anything she wanted to do in the vault, for if they caught light, they were red deal turpentine shavings, and would burn like wildfire, and nothing would stop them. Being in treaty for letting my shop and other apartments, part of the vault and kitchen, on the Friday before the fire; I began, on the Sunday afternoon, to clear out the vault to make it ready, so as to have its contents finally removed away early on the Monday morning (the day of the fire) into my workshop, in order that the parties who were in treaty mightview the premises on that day. Having a quantity of shavings as well as wood in the vault, I borrowed a sack and filled it, as also a bag which I had, with the wood and shavings, the more easily to remove them to my workshop where they would be useful to me; and having cleared the vault of those shavings, the wood and other things, I placed them in the kitchen to be removed away the following morning, and the dust and dirt was scraped up and put in a box for the same purpose. If I had collected the shavings for any bad purpose, I should have left them loose, and not forced and pent them up into bags, where the want of air was likely to prevent them burning, as it must be evident to every one who knows the nature of shavings, that the more they are exposed to the air, the more furiously they will burn - with respect to turpentine being found in my kitchen; I use it continually, every cabinet-maker does so, as well as bees-wax, and without both, I could not carry on my business. On the Sunday night previous to the fire, I took a calomel pill, (being unwell,) as indeed I had been the whole week, and went to bed a little before twelve o'clock which was about my usual time, as my shop was never closed until half-past eleven o'clock on a Sunday night; I was not quite undressed when Mr. Davis, one of our lodgers knocked at the door; I went to the street-door, let him in, and gave him a light; when I had so done, he asked me for my Sunday's newspaper, saying he wished to go to the watercloset - he took the newspaper, and first went up to his bed-room, and I went to the kitchen to draw some water from the boiler, to drink, which I always do at night; while I was so doing Davis came down to go to the water-closet, and using a joking expression, intimating that he should be detained a long time, went into it - I took the warm water and went up stairs into my bed-room, and waited I thought a sufficient time for him to come out; I then went down again, having occasion to go to the water-closet myself, and asked him if he was coming out, when he said, "I shall be half an hour yet" - he had the newspaper with him, and I suppose he was reading it; I went up stairs into my bed-room, being so unwell that I could not stand still and then came down again and walked about the kitchen, and he was still in the water-closet - by waiting so long, and walking about the kitchen and stairs without my shoes, I got chilled, in consequence of which, the inclination I had had to go to the water-closet ceased, and I was about returning up stairs, when Mr. Davis came out and went up stairs; I immediately followed him and went to bed, and in a short time after I became warm in bed - I was then compelled to get up and go down stairs to the water-closet - I did so, and immediately afterwards again returned to bed, which I did not leave until between five and six o'clock the next morning, being Monday the 28th of May, when feeling myself unwell, I asked my wife if she had any oatmeal in the house, for I would take some salts, and make myself some water gruel, before I began to move the things to the workshop, the greatest part of which I had already moved from out of the vault into the kitchen; I accordingly put on an old pair of trousers my waistcoat and morning coat, and a pair of slippers, went down into the kitchen, and lighted the fire - I then went into the vault for the purpose of clearing away the remainder of the things; I returned to look at the kitchen fire, and found it was gone out - I took some more shavings out of the bag, (into which I had put them overnight, and which was close by) and lighted it again, when shortly after it again went out; I then took a larger quantity of both wood and shaving, lighted it a third time, and it burnt briskly - I then again went into the vault, and remained there busy for a quarter of an hour, (having closed the kitchen door, which led to the wash-house, after me, for the purpose of causing the fire to draw, as the kitchen fire smoked when that door was left open) and when I returned to look after the fire, I found that the shavings I had let fall in drawing them from the bag, by some means or other had ignited, and the kitchen was in flames; I tried to extinguish the flames by pulling one bag from the other, and pressing them down, when some shavings coming from out of it, caused a still greater blaze- the flames were becoming too strong for me, and were ascending the stairs, and I flew to the kitchen window, as the flames were then blazing up to the ceiling, and called out, Fire! Fire! and begged of the passengers to break in the iron grating and let me out, or I should be burnt to death. At the time two persons came up, one with a hammer in his hand, and the other with a spade, and tried to break the railings, but found they were wrought iron, and would not snap -I begged of them to knock at the shop-door, or break it open and alarm the house, as there were five or six females in the house, and they might be burnt - I continued to call for them to break the railings, but the attraction of the house being on fire, I suppose, prevented them from hearing me; at the time the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050017"/>shop-door was broken in, I was in the area of the wash-house window, under the iron grating; the gust of wind that came in at the shop door, when it was burst open, forced the flames back momentarily, and the loose burning shavings were driven from the kitchen into the wash-house and vault, which I trampled upon and put out, to prevent the fire from communicating to the other loose shavings which it contained - finding that no one came to break in the railings for me to make my escape, my feelings worked upon me for my wife and lodgers; I resolved to make my escape, if possible, through the flames - I went into the coal vault to get a hat which was there, in order to protect my head from the flames, and my apron caught fire and set light to some chips that I had made that morning in chopping up some old wood for the use of the house; I then tore off my apron, ran to the sink to draw some water to throw upon it, and while the water was running, I looked into the front kitchen, and found the flames less furious, and thought there was a good opportunity for my escape; I threw the pan of water into the vault, and shut the door, knowing that nothing could take harm there - I ran through the fire into the street, whereby my hands and face were dreadfully burnt, my handkerchief was in a blaze, and my clothes very much burnt; seeing a fireman at the door, I begged of him to play in on the staircase, from the shop floor to the ceiling of the first floor, and it would put out the fire in a few minutes, as it was no where but in the staircase - I then ran about, inquiring for my wife and the lodgers, to know if they were out, in my then burnt state; some said they were all out and safe, and begged, for God's sake, I would go to the hospital, saying, "You are shockingly burnt" - I then ran round to the back of the house, which are Mr. Spier's premises; I there met my wife in a state of nakedness, and put her in Spier's workshop, and went out to assist Miss Twamley and her mother, whom I saw on the leads - I assisted the mother first, and then Miss Twamley I took in my arms as she came off the leads; I then made every inquiry for my servant and others, and was told they were all out and safe - I begged of the people at the top of the pawnbroker's house, to throw something into the back attic window, to see if the servant was out of it, when they answered me they were all out and safe; finding my agony increasing, and numbers of persons persuading me so to do, I consented to go to the Middlesex-hospital, thinking it would only he necessary to have some application to the burns; I put my coat on my wife, and left her waiting at the cook-shop, in Dean-street, till I came back, but the injuries I had sustained were of so serious a nature, that it was necessary I should remain at the hospital; I was put to bed, and there remained a fortnight and a day, when I was removed to Newgate in a very weak state, and many sores not healed. It has been asserted that angry expressions were used by my wife towards me when we met; so far from it, seeing her in a state of nakedness, I immediately said to Mr. Davis,"Pray, Davis, lend her a pair of your trousers, which you have in your hand, and I will put my coat upon her," which I did; in clearing out the vault, I had scraped up as well and as clean as possible, all the dirt that was there. All these matters have been magnified and made subjects of accusation against me, and God knows I am ignorant why they should be so, for I have no enmity or ill-will to any person - I had no motive for setting fire to the house, for I verily believed at the time I was not insured; I now am ignorant whether I am legally so or not - I had paid some money at the insurance office to effect an insurance, partly for Mrs. Twamley's furniture, which I had agreed to do, and partly for my own, but I had not given the full particulars for the policy to be filled, nor was any policy ever delivered to me, but even if it had, I could not have benefitted, as my goods and fixtures were of value considerably greater than the amount of the insurance; and in which I had not included the interest I have in the lease of the house, which, at a rent of 80l. per annum for twenty-one years, is, in Oxford-street, worth a considerable sum - besides which, it was my intention to have let the shop and upper apartments, including the coal vault and use of the kitchen; and for the purpose of the person who was in treaty seeing them to the best advantage, I was preparing to clear, clean, and make them look as well as possible, although it was Sunday, and although I was very unwell at the time; the shop, as a tobacconist's, was a good established shop, and doing a good trade, and the sum I should have obtained for good-will would have been considerable. If I had had the diabolical intention of setting fire to my house, I should hardly have entered into treaty to let part of it, and then abandoned that opportunity of making money; I have concealed no property - I am wretched and friendless, scarcely being able to find means for my defence; had gain been my object I should not now have been thus destitute. - But, my Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I will not offer any argument. I will rest upon the facts, and leave the matter to your judgment and impartiality. Certain expressions have been attributed to my wife, as used to me in an angry tone, charging me with setting fire to the house for the purpose of destroying her. - Gentlemen, it is not only untrue, but I begged of Mr. Davis to lend her a pair of trousers from the clothes he had preserved, which he did, and I took off the coat from my own back, and placed it on my wife. I am unfortunately, not permitted by law to call my wife to prove this: if I were, she would state that all she said, was, "Oh, Smithies, what a dreadful fire this is," to which I replied, "Aye, see how I am burnt" - and she could also prove the property I possessed, and that I was in bed the whole night, so that which, I am informed, will most prejudice me is, that which by law I have not the power of answering by her evidence.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Stephen-street, Tottenham-court-road. The prisoner called at my house a few days before the fire, and stated that he was inclined to dispose of his shop - he asked if I knew any one who would take it; I said I thought I knew a person it would suit, and named Mrs. Cobb, an acquaintance of mine - he said, respecting the vault, it was in a very untidy state (this was on Saturday), and although to-morrow was the Lord's-day, he must do it on Sunday, as he was to meet Mrs. Cobb the following day; this was the Saturday before the fire - I had spoken to Mrs. Cobb a few days before; I think it was on the Friday immediately before the fire or Thursday, that he told me he wanted to get rid of the shop, and I informed Mrs. Cobb - I saw the prisoner on Saturday evening, about half-past nine o'clock, by appointment, and told him I had seen Mrs. Cobb that afternoon, that I had seen her on Friday also; the prisoner said on Saturday night, that he would clear out the vault, which was in a very untidy state, and would meet me on Monday morning, at ten o'clock, to know from Mrs. Cobb what time it would be convenient for her to go over the premises; the prisoner complained that Saturday night of ill-health, and looked ill; he said he should go home, and go to bed directly.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he seem very ill on Saturday night? A. He complained of his head a good deal, and appeared ill and low - I had not gone on any commission for him that Saturday night, except Mrs. Cobb's, not that I recollect; I do not know that gentleman (Mr. Field) -I never saw him before, to my knowledge; I cannot swear to the gentleman.</p>

I saw him about a week be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050018"/>fore; I did not call on him that Saturday night, that I know of; I cannot swear whether I did or not - I called to get time for payment of the rent, but cannot swear whether it was that Saturday night or not; I swear the prisoner told me it was for the purpose of having the place tidy for to show to Mrs. Cobb that he was clearing out the vault; he never told me it was to have a cool place for his veneers - I first spoke to Mrs. Cobb about the place about Friday, I believe, but cannot be positive it was not Thursday, and it was on Thursday or Friday the prisoner told me he wished to let the shop; I have known him about two months - I heard of the fire on the Monday morning, about eight o'clock, and heard there was an Inquest to be held that morning, before it took place; I did not go to give evidence - I was down there, but was not called; I went, expecting to be called - I did not send in my name; I did not attend the second Inquest - I do not know why; I heard the result of the first Inquest - I did not go to the second, because I was not asked; I have known Mrs. Cobb three or four months - I first became acquainted with her by calling at her lodgings in Ely-court, with a friend of mine of the name of Curtis; he introduced me to her - he merely asked me to call there with him; it was for no purpose - I saw her again a week or a fortnight after this - I think I met her in Holborn; I walked a few steps with her, and then parted - I suppose I have been to her apartments half a dozen times since; I think I have drank tea there about half a dozen times - I never dined there; I was not particularly intimate with her - she is married; her husband was not there - he is in an asylum, being insane- Curtis has drank tea with me at her apartments about three times; he is a baker - I did not often visit the prisoner: I visited at his house a week or ten days before the fire, and was in the little parlour - I was never down stairs; I saw Mr. and Mrs. Smithies when I called - the servant was in the shop; I think her name is Eliza -Smithies was ill on the Saturday night; I did not call next day to ask how he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you first tell this story to about getting a person to take the shop? A. I told Mr. Curtis and one Langdon, a carver and gilder; I do not know that I mentioned it to any body else - I do not recollect stating it to any body who wrote it down; Curtis gave me a subpoena to attend here - I went to Mr. Davidson, the solicitor, to give my evidence, and he took it down, but I thought you asked me whether I put it down respecting Smithies' shop being to let; I misunderstood you respecting the evidence - I was about an hour with the solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you had totally forgotten that? A. Certainly not, it was a misunderstanding; he took down my evidence at his office up a court in the Strand, near Temple-bar; I went there with Mrs. Smithies about a fortnight ago - I went at her request for him to take down my evidence.</p>

I was acquainted with Baylis before the fire in Oxford-street; I had heard from him that Mr. Smithies' shop was to let - this was on the Thursday previous to the fire; he at first told me there was the shop and the parlour adjoining to let, and on the Friday Baylis asked if I required a sleeping-room; I was to have the use of the kitchen, if I wished to wash at home, or clean my knives, and also a place where I could put my coals; I went on Saturday morning to look at the premises, but Smithies was not at home, and I did not see them - I went on Saturday to ascertain what it would cost to take the stock and fixtures, not the goodwill, that was not named; I saw Baylis on Saturday, after I had been to the house; an appointment was made for me to see the premises at eleven o'clock on the following Monday - I never saw the prisoner till I saw him in Court to-day; after the fire I heard of an Inquest being held; I was fetched to the second Inquest on the female, in case my evidence should be required - that was on a Wednesday; I think it was an adjourned inquest, and was held at the Golden Lion, in Dean-street; I saw Samuel Davis - the witnesses were in a back parlour: Davis came into that room after I had understood he had been examined; Mrs. Smithies was there and her daughter, and eight or nine other persons, Curtis, Baylis, and Mr. Blackford - Mrs. Smithies' feelings appeared very much wounded, and she was very agitated; I do not know whether she was examined before the Coroner; when Davis came out of the Inquest room; his conduct was violent in the extreme - he said, among other things, that he would not go across the road if it were to save Smithies' life; he asked Mrs. Smithies whether she or himself got out of the back room window first - she said,"You, Sir;" after that he resumed his observation about Smithies, and the persons left the room in consequence of his observations, which were very unnatural on the part of any gentleman.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long has your husband been in his present unfortunate situation? A. Twelve months- we lived together till then, in White-street, Cripplegate, and kept a house there; he was a solicitor - I went from there to Kirby-street, Hatton-garden, and from there to Ely-court, Holborn - I have lived there since Christmas, at the house of an intimate acquaintance; the last time my husband practised as a solicitor was in 1814; I was a respectable servant when he married me: I have known Baylis four or five months - he was introduced by Curtis, the godfather of my friend's child, Mr. Marven: Curtis casually brought Baylis with him - we did not become particularly intimate; he called occasionally, and had drank tea with us about three times - he heard me say I intended to take a little shop and open as a tobacconist, and he came down to me in Ely-court on the Friday; he did not tell me the probable value of the fixtures - I did not understand the tobacconists' trade, but fancied I should like it better than any other; I had applied to nobody else about such a business - I had just got it in agitation, and named it in Baylis' presence, about a fortnight or three weeks before: he said if he heard of any thing likely to suit me he would let me know - I may have seen him a dozen times within four or five months; he has looked in when he passed - I have met him in the street, but not by appointment: I saw him once or twice in Holborn before the fire - I met him on my return from Smithies' shop on Saturday, coming up Holborn; I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050019"/>taken nobody with me to Smithies', to look at the shop and fixtures - I am not a judge of such things: I only went to see if it was to be let - I asked Mrs. Smithies if it was to be let; I did not see the prisoner near the premises - Baylis and Curtis had come to my place together about twice; I do not know whether Curtis knew of my intention to take a shop - I became acquainted with Curtis about September.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose desire did you attend the Inquest? A. Baylis came to ask me to attend, in case I should be required.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was any price stated at which you were to take the premises? A. No price was fixed; I was to ascertain the price, nothing was said about the good-will - my friends were to advance me some money; all the information Baylis gave me was that it was to be let - I saw Mrs. Smithies on Saturday morning.</p>

            . I am not related to the prisoner, but am his wife's son-in-law - I am a dyer, and live at No. 4, Bloomsbury-court, High Holborn. I knew the house in Oxford-street, and very frequently went over it; I knew the cock-loft which was at the top of the house, between the attics and the tiles - I never saw any furniture there, for I never saw into it; I have been into every other place in the house; it was furnished very well indeed - it was very good furniture indeed, as good as I have seen in most houses; that was the case from the top to the bottom - the shop was beautifully fitted up with mahogany shelves and counter, and cigar-boxes, and all fancy work about the glass-cases, &amp;c.; the furniture was a middling pattern - it had been some years in wear, and some was new; I had an opportunity of observing the stock in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you suppose to be a fair estimate of the furniture, stock, and every thing in the house? A. I should consider, from what I have seen at other places, it would not be less than 800l., setting it at the lowest - that is all I have seen in the house; I was in the back room on the third floor - there was a mahogany chest of drawers there worth about 5l.; there was a bed and bedstead - I suppose the value of the furniture in that room to be 30l. or 40l., as far as I can recollect, and that in the front room third floor, I should think near 50l.; it was fitted up much more handsome - it is some time since I was in the back room first floor; I recollect a bed and bedstead there, and some chairs - I suppose them to be worth 30l. or 40l., or more; the front room first floor was the most expensively fitted up in the house - I should suppose the furniture there to be worth upwards of 100l.; when I was last in the room behind the shop, there was a chest of drawers, looking-glasses, china, pictures, and other things, and if the drawers were there I should think the value about 20l.; the kitchen, wash-house, and vault contained mostly kitchen utensils, every thing proper for a respectable house, such as dishes, kettles, and dressers - there seemed a great quantity of plates and dishes - I have not noticed glass particularly; there were wine bottles and such like - I should think there could not be less than 50l. value in the kitchen and vault; I think the fixtures in the house were of not less value than 150l., including them all: the value I put is what it would cost to replace them - there were pictures and prints framed and glazed; I am not much of a judge of pictures, and could not give you the value - Mrs. Smithies used to have three watches - I have seen a gold chain about her neck frequently, and bracelets on her hands - I never saw the prisoner with a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity lately of seeing the stock in trade? A. Yes; as far as I could understand, I should think it could not be worth less than 100l., including the snuff-boxes, cigars, and tubes; there were some very valuable hookahs - one large hookah I always understood to be very expensive; they ask as much as five or ten guineas, I believe, for some of them.</p>

               <p>Q. In your judgment, was 630l. an exorbitant sum for the owner to insure? A. Far different; it was beneath the value of the property on the premises.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you happen to be in the front attic? A. Yes; that was handsomely fitted up, fit for the reception of a gentleman - I do not particularly remember it; I can only describe the generality of the things; I do not recollet a pier-glass there - there was a dressing-glass; I should think the furniture of that room could not be worth much less than 50l. at the time I saw it; Mr. Giesmar lived in it - I should think 7s. or 8s. a week a fair rent for it; 5s. would be far below the value - I am not an appraiser; I have bought articles - I have bought articles and re-sold them - I am a dyer: I never kept an appraiser's shop.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first tender yourself as a witness? A. As soon as I felt convinced what property was on the premises; that was about a week after the fire, when I came to recollect what was there, I recollected the different articles - that is the way I made up my mind as to the value.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, without consulting any body, you set to, to value the things? A. No, I do not mean to say it was without consulting - because it was talked about before other people; my wife talked about it - I had no necessity to try to recollect the value; I recollected it without trial - I suppose I have been over the rooms a dozen or twenty times, but not in the front attic; I will swear I had been there more than once - the last time I was there was when my child lay dead in Mr. Smithie's back attic last August twelve months; I cannot tell what change may have taken place in the furniture since that - I was not very intimate with Mr. or Mrs. Smithies; I will not swear that I have dined there within the last twelve months - I have drank tea there; I was in the first floor front room about three months ago - I will not swear I have been there more than twice within twelve months; I noticed the furniture so as to estimate the value - my wife showed them to me, and said, "Look what a beautiful thing this is, and how beautiful that is;" my wife is somewhere about the Court - we did not come here together; I have not been on friendly terms with Mr. Smithies - I was not at all friendly with him at the time of the fire; I had not quarrelled with him lately, I had about twelve months ago; I have visited at his house since, but we had not made up the quarrel; I had drank ten there once or or twice, but not with him alone; he was present once.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever express an opinion as to how the house took fire? A. I certainly did at one time, at the time it was burning.</p>
               <p>Q. According to your observation, was there always both of stock, furniture, pictures, plate, and other articles of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050020"/>comfort and an appearance of wealth? A. I know nothing about plate; there was every appearance of respectability and comfort - I never knew of any want of money on the part of his wife; as to him I do not know - his wife always had a purse to pull out full of gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you not be surprised to hear of a distress being in the house on this valuable furniture for 20l.? A. Yes, the distress was for a debt which Mr. Smithies was bound for - a debt of a man named Garnet, whom he was bail for; as far as I could understand, it was for 60l.; three of them were bail for 20l. each - this was a month or six weeks before the fire; I knew nothing of any other distress; what I am speaking of is Smithies being at the lock-up house - he was there for about a fortnight: I never knew of a distress at the suit of Mr. Nichols for rent - that would have surprised me much; I have known the prisoner about a year and a half, and his wife about five years.</p>
               <p>Q. If she always had this money at her command, did you observe any thing to give you reason to suppose why she did not pay 20l. to get him out of the lock-up house? A. It was an unjust debt; she did not pay it - it has never been paid; it was rather a false imprisonment - for which he was to have brought an action.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. He never paid it? A. No; it was a bad bill or something - I speak to the value of the furniture to the best of my judgment; my wife pointed out the articles one after the other, to admire them - I never saw Mr. Smithies without money.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Oxford-street. I know Mr. Baylis, and have seen Mrs. Cobb three or four times; I knew the prisoner as a neighbour -I called on him the Sunday evening before the fire, about seven o'clock, at his own house; I asked if he would take a walk along with me - he said he was not well; he said he had been cleaning up the kitchen, cellar, and so forth: he had a dirty blue handkerchief tied round his head - he said he was going to take five or six drops of calomel and a dose of salts in the morning; I did not know exactly the term he had on his premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing he had a term of eighteen or twenty years, at 80l. a year, what is the value of it? A. I never went over the whole of the house - but if I were about to take such a house in that situation; I would not mind giving 200l. or 300l. premium for it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You are a baker; were you ever any other trade? A. I was a plumber, at Oxford -I left there, and came to be a baker in London, about two years ago - I never was over the the whole of the prisoner's house; I should say it was worth 80l. a year, according to the rent of my own house - I have been in the shop, the parlour, and the first floor - I should consider it worth one hundred guineas a year, if you were not obliged to purchase the lease - I have been a baker the whole two years I have been in London; I have lived in Moor-street, Soho, the shop I have now - I have not been a plumber and glazier at Horselydown; I do not know Horselydown; I purchased a shop and premises in Tooley-street, but I was laid up for ten days with the influenza, and was obliged to give it up - I was not six weeks there; I did not carry on the business of a plumber and glazier there - my son-in-law did - it was carried on in my name; after I got better, I carried on the business of a baker in Moor-street, but I had a rheumatic fever, and did nothing for thirteen weeks - I certainly was not much acquainted with Mrs. Cobb; I might see her three or four times - I saw her at Mr. and Mrs. Marven's carver and gilder, in Ely-court; I called there, I think, some time before last Christmas, and I saw her in the house - I was going out one day with Mr. Baylis, and I took him in to inquire after a child; he is a baker, and lives in Store-street, Tottenham-court-road - I have known him fourteen years; I knew him in Oxford-street - his father was a master baker, and served me with bread; I am not related to Marven's family - I stood godfather to the child; I never have been with Baylis at Mrs. Cobb's above two or three times - I have gone there, and they have asked me to have tea; Baylis went with me once or twice, but not always - I was never consulted about Mrs. Cobb taking a tobacconist's shop; I never knew Smithies' shop was to let - he called in at times as he went by, but never spoke to me about his shop; he called two or three days before the fire - I did not see him; I was not consulted about the value of the fixtures - I was told by Field about a distress being in the house, and I understood he was locked up in Newman-street about ten days; Mrs. Smithies called on me to give bail, but I did not -Smithies desired me to call on Field, to ask him to wait a few days for the rent; I think it was on the Friday week before the fire, or on a Monday - I knew it was on a market day; I went to Field, and told him I understood that Smithies had got a very good bill, but I did not make money of it to pay the rent; I never had it in my possession - I saw it; I went down to the Lion, in Dean-street, to see if my evidence would be required, and when I got there, I saw a solicitor, Mr. Blackford - he said if I was wanted, he would call me up; I do not know whose solicitor he was - I suppose he attended for Mrs. Smithies.</p>

            . I am an apothecary, and carry on business in Tottenham-court-road. I have known the prisoner about three months; I remember his being in Middlesex-hospital with the burns he received - I applied at the hospital to see him, but was told I could not; I have been accustomed to treat patients under the effects of injuries occasioned by explosions of gunpowder, and have always found we could not get rid of the marks of the gunpowder, more or less, they would appear on the skin - we could not get rid of the blueness; there is not the least appearance in the prisoner's features to warrant an opinion that he has been burnt by an explosion of gunpowder; I have resided in the neighbourhood of mines, and had great experience of such injuries - they always present themselves between the skin and flesh; I cannot see any such effects on the prisoner.</p>

I have never seen a case where the skin has been broken, but it has always remained; if the skin was not broken, I suppose it would come off - where the skin was burnt to a wound, I always found more or less blueness remain; particles of gunpowder are deposited under the skin - if it got in in the form of gunpowder it would show; if the powder gets into a blister, more or less, it will be seen when it gets well.</p>
               <p>MR. LONSDALE re-examined. Q. The skin was not ruptured? A. It blistered during the afternoon; I applied lime-water and linseed oil to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the skin come entirely off his face? A. In most parts it did.</p>
               <p>MR. HARRIS. From the description given by Mr. Lonsdale, if the burns had been from gunpowder, there would have been the remains of gunpowder in his face, more or less; I see none.</p>
               <p>MR. LONSDALE. When he came to the hospital, his face was discoloured; it was a grey blue colour - the lotion and ointments I used were not calculated to make it blister, but it did blister, and then the skin came off, and the blueness was gone.</p>

            . I am a journeyman pianoforte-maker, and live in Buckingham-place, Fitzroy-square. I was in a room at the Golden Lion, where the inquest was held, with Mrs. Smithies; Davis said, in my presence, that he would not cross the street to save the prisoner's life - I told him I thought he had given his evidence in a very prejudiced manner.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you in the room when Davis gave his evidence? A. Yes, by his side; the Jury had the same opportunity of judging of his evidence as I had- they were on their oaths, and so was he.</p>
               <p>HENRY CADDEL re-examined. Q. Did you observe, when you looked through the area, whether the prisoner had an apron on? A.

            . There was a door opposite the kitchen fire-place, between the kitchen and the front vault, or wash-house; it was necessary to shut that door in order to make the kitchen fire burn; it was usually kept open, unless there was a fire there - there might have been a fire once or twice in the kitchen while I was there, and then the door was shut or the fire would not burn.</p>

               <p>SARAH SMITH.

There was nothing in our room belonging to the prisoner - there were no pier-tables; there were two cupboards belonging to the house - the fixtures belonged to the house; they were not ours - the prisoner never saw my mother till I rushed out of the house that morning, with her in my arms on the leads - she could not, at any time, have given him authority to insure for her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The mother did not take the rooms; it was her and her sister - there was another lady, whom I do not see, and who I understand is the one that was burnt; a more amiable creature never lived in the world, and I told her, to induce them to come to lodge with me, that I would insure for them as I was about insuring.</p>

            . Q. Was not the distress you put in for half a year's rent, which was hanging back, and which all the row thought we ought not to pay, as the premises were not finished in proper time? A. So far from that I allowed his wife, before he married her, 5l. for any loss they might have been at in drying the premises; that was in 1829 - the prisoner said, a year and a half ago, they thought they had no right to pay the half-year's rent; I said it was useless to talk to me on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050022"/>the subject, that Nichols' address was either at Bunting, in Surrey, or at Richmond, and I left the address a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MR. OXENHAM. Q. When you first came in with the distress, did I not take you up to the first floor? A. You did - I made no inventory, but I looked over the house to see the value of the goods; I said I supposed you would settle it that day - there were bedsteads, bedding, and common sort of articles; in the second floor there were two rosewood loo-tables, quite new.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not in the back room a reclining-chair, that I told you was worth 200l., and that I was applying to get a patent for it? A. No, I saw no such chair; I thought there was sufficient in the house to pay the 40l.; there was a French sofa-bedstead in the front room first floor, and some painted chairs - there was not a set of dining-tables; there was a Pembroke table, and an old sofa.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Supposing all the property you saw had been agreed to be taken at a fair valuation, what would have been the value, in your estimation? A. A hundred pounds would have been a fair value between a person coming in and another going out; it would have fetched about 60l. by the hammer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you think there were six chests of drawers in the house? A. I cannot exactly tell now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not every room full of furniture, so that you could hardly get into them? A. No, the second floor was very empty; I cannot tell the number of beds - I made the valuation in the usual way; the beds were very small, worth, I should say, 5l. or 6l.; they were three feet six inches French bedsteads.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. For me to be in the area I must be crumpled up, and was it possible to be seen in the area whether I had an apron on - it is only sixteen inches wide; I had nothing to fear from a distress, I had a 30l. bill in my pocket, and Curtis not getting it discounted at the market as he thought he should have done; my wife gave me two 10l. notes on the Sunday, and said, "Take this and pay a quarter;" I said, "It is of no use to-day, I will see Field to-morrow;" the copper was loaded up with wood and boxes, and the boxes came out too far for me to set the shavings apart - one bag laid flat on the other, not standing upright; they laid down, and the ends came halfway over the copper, and it was there I

               <p>The front of the house was towards the north - the kitchen occupied the whole of the western side; the stairs, watercloset, and copper being at the back or southern end of it - the eastern side consisted in front of a vault (called by some witnesses a wash-house), and at the back of which was another vault, separated from the front by a wooden partition, and in this vault was the coal-bin; the shelf on which was the card with gunpowder, shavings, &amp;c. and in one corner the turpentine-bottle inverted - both vaults were separated from the kitchen by a brick wall, there being a door-way in the said wall between the front vault and kitchen, and another between the front and back vaults.</p>

             lived with him -On Friday morning, the 15th of June, about twenty minutes or half-past five o'clock, I heard the deceased give a dreadful groan, and heard like a rumbling noise at the same time; it was in her room no doubt - I did not see her, but the noise came out of the back parlour, where she slept; I heard nothing more till the prisoner came along the passage, up to my bed-room door, crying "Oh, Mrs. Bayley, Mrs. Bayley, get up, get up - she is dead, she is dead;" this was not exceeding twenty minutes or half an hour after I heard the groan - I got out of bed, opened the door, and he was there naked, in his shirt; I ran down stairs as I was, and he came down after me - when I saw the deceased I said, "Oh, Reilly, you have murdered your wife;" he said, "I have not;" and said had I any money - I told him I had not; he said he wanted something to drink, for he must cut, he must cut- I then went up stairs, and put on my clothes, leaving him in the room - the deceased was laying on her back on the bed, with her clothes on; I left nobody in the room with the prisoner; I gave an alarm to the people in the house - I went down stairs again, for he still kept in a loud cry, "I must cut, I must cut" - when I came down I found him dressing himself; he said he must cut, he must cut, for off he must be - I said, "For God's sake, Mr. Reilly, don't cut and leave us all in the house, for we shall all he taken up, so cruelly murdered as this poor creature is;" he put a bag on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. On your saying "Don't go, Rielly," &amp;c. what did he say? A. He said, "Hold your tongue, you bl-y fool, I am only going to get something to drink;" he ran outside the door, with the bag on his shoulder, and ran off when I first went down he kissed the body, and said, "Oh, Kitty, Kitty, what shall I do? What shall I do? my God, what shall I do?" in that dreadful tone; and I said, "Oh, you ought to have thought of that before;" when he went to the door I looked after him, and he ran away; I saw a Policeman standing, and said, "For God's sake, Policeman, do you see that man running with a bag?" I sent the Policeman after him, and he brought him back; I had seen the deceased alive at half-past two o'clock the afternoon before - she came up to my room; I saw the prisoner after she had been to me, and delivered to him the message she had left, which was, that she had shut her shop door, had locked her parlour door, left the key outside, and was gone out to seek some remedy, for he had got some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050023"/>money, and was swearing at her; I told him this - he seemed agitated and vexed at her going out, and said,"Good God, where is she gone? so comfortable as we have been;" they were always quarrelling ever since I have been in the house; this was as near three o'clock in the afternoon as possible; I saw him again at ten, in the street - I had not seen his wife; I went to bed between ten and eleven, and heard no more of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where were you from three o'clock in the afternoon till between nine and ten? A. In my own room, about my business; I have seen the prisoner drunk - I have certainly at times seen the deceased have a drop with her husband: I have seen her drunk - I have lived there nearly two years.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you had seen her drunk? A. I cannot tell - she had been bad a fortnight, laid up in bed, through his brutish usage.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday fortnight before this occurrence, did she not come home so drunk as to fall over the things and hurt herself? A. No, I never saw her quite drunk; I cannot say I do not drink occasionally myself - I had some gin with my husband about half-past nine o'clock, on the Thursday night; the prisoner was one of the party and paid for it - there was a quartern among a woman named Fleetwood, him and me; we had it in Aylesbury-street - my husband had some gin in Reilly's room that night, but I had not; that must have been after ten o'clock; when I met the prisoner in Aylesbury-street, I did not want to drink with him, but he would make me; he was perfectly sober, and had been at work that afternoon - he had some work, and said he was taking it home; the deceased has slept out many a time for safety - I do not know of her pledging his things; they kept their secrets to themselves - I do not think I have drank with her half a dozen times in my life; I never went to a pawnbroker's shop with her, nor drank with her after she had been pawning things - a Mr. and Mrs. Darnford lived in the street; there was a great quarrel between them about eleven o'clock that night - they live right opposite our place; I was in bed at the time, but could hear them quarrelling - our street door was not left ajar, but with a bolt and a string to pull it; any body outside could open it: I never saw Mrs. Reilly intoxicated - I have seen her fly out of the house, and be glad to sleep any where, even in a shed, to hide herself from him; I think I told the Coroner that I told the prisoner not to cut, or we should all be taken up, but you must make a little allowance for the fright and trouble I have had; I cannot recollect every word that happened - I do not know that the Coroner asked me about that; I cannot say whether I told him of the prisoner's saying, "Hold your tongue you b - y fool," &amp;c.: I only answered the questions I was asked - I mentioned about hearing a rumbling noise before I saw Reilly; I did not, to my knowledge, mention to the Coroner that, I told Reilly he should have thought of that before, when he kissed her; I was not asked it - you must excuse me, for the fright I have had in seeing the state of the deceased and the way I have been put about; I have been the only one who has been at the head of it - I took her part all the time I was in the house; the last time I rescued her from the prisoner, he swore he would murder me.</p>

               <p>MR. DONNE. Q. Where does Darnford live? A. Exactly opposite; it is rather a wide street - they were quarrelling outside their house; I got out of bed to see what it was - Daruford's wife was in the street, and he was calling to the Policeman to take her; I suppose she was taken to the station.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you saw the deceased dead in the morning, had she bonnet or shawl on? A. She had no bonnet, as to her shawl I cannot say - she had her other clothes on; she had a bonnet and shawl on when I saw her at half-past two o'clock - I do not know whether any bonnet was found in her room; I never said to a Mrs. Briant, or in her presence, that if the prisoner had twenty-five necks, I would hang him - I do not know her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you never said that? A. Not to my knowledge; I have said it to many people, but I do not know her, and he ought to have been hung years ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How had they lived together for the last fortnight? A. She was very ill, being laid up through his brutishness; after he had beat her he was more kind to her - there were no words between them after that, to my knowledge; when the prisoner returned on the Thursday, and I gave him the message, he asked which way she went, and I said, "The last time I saw her, she was at Mr. Chickles door;" and he said he would go after her.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her dead in the morning, and he kissed her, did he say any thing to you about the way it had happened? A. No, he did not; he said he knew nothing of it - he was naked in his shirt, when he came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about what happened when he awoke? A. He said that he had never seen her - that he had just awoke, and found her on the bed; that was when I charged him with killing her - when she went out in the afternoon, she told me to tell him she had left the key for him, and I took it out of the back parlour door myself.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. On Friday morning, the 15th of June, I was awoke by the prisoner; as near as I can ascertain, it was about six o'clock; before that (it might be an hour or two) I heard a rumbling noise, as if a chair or table was being moved, but what it was I cannot say - whether I went to sleep afterwards I cannot say; I was not asleep when the prisoner came up; the noise proceeded from the bottom part, which they occupied - I cannot say whether it was in the front or back room I did not hear any sound besides the rumbling noise; when the prisoner came up in his shirt, my wife went down first -I immediately put on my trousers, and went down as quick as possible - before I went into the room the deceased was in, I saw the street door open, also an inner door, which was in the centre of the passage - I went into the back parlour, and found the deceased laying on the bed; she had her clothes on, but whether she had a shawl or bonnet I cannot say, but I do not think she had - she was on her back, and to the best of my knowledge some of her clothes were covered over her; I cannot be certain - I felt her - her hands were warm, but she was quite dead - I looked at the prisoner, and said, "Reilly, I am afraid you have committed, or done murder, "I do not know which; he said, "I have done nothing, and I know nothing till I awoke this morning, and she was laying here by the side;" I understood him to mean the side of the bed: the body laid on the bed, on one side - I understood him to mean the floor, for he pointed to the floor, and I saw a great deal of blood on the floor, at the foot of the bed, by the fireplace.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050024"/>Q. Was the blood in the place where he pointed to? A. Yes; there was a great deal of blood all over the floor by the bed-side.</p>
               <p>Q. Then was there blood at the side of the bed as well as the foot? A. I did not see it; I say it was on the floor; the prisoner came into my room, and said, "What shall I do? what shall I do? I must cut, I must cut" - he had then dressed himself; that was before he was brought back by the Policeman - I had gone up stairs after going down and seeing his wife, and he dressed and came up; he went down after saying this, and my wife, who was then up stairs, went down after him - I did not see him again till the Policeman brought him back; the Policeman went into the inner room, where the deceased lay, leaving him in possession of me and Gibson, another lodger - he attempted to get away from me - I took him by the collar, and said, "Reilly, you shall not go."</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did he attempt to go? A. I will not be sure whether he said, "You d-d fool," or "You b-y fool, I only want to go and get something to drink;" he was going towards the door - I took him by the collar, and said, "You shall not go," and we detained him; I had seen him the night before, going in and out - it might be about half-past ten or eleven o'clock; I drank with him about eleven o'clock, and went to bed directly after, leaving him in the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you heard a rumbling noise about an hour before you were alarmed - are you quite sure you heard no noise in the prisoner's room between that time and when the prisoner came up? A. No, I heard no voices nor groans.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you seized him by the collar, and he said he was going to get something to drink, was he not very much agitated and distressed? A. Very likely he might be; he had told my wife before, that he must have something to drink, and he wanted her to get him something, but she would not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he come into your room about five o'clock on the Thursday afternoon? A. Yes, to ask for some water for his tea; he was sober then, and said he had been to several places looking for his wife, and could not find her - there was a noise before Darnford's house about half-past ten o'clock, but I did not see Reilly there; I lifted my window up to see what the noise was, and Reilly called out to me, "Bayley come down" - he was at his own door; I went down, and partook of the gin in the shop - he was certainly tipsy then, but I have seen him more so; his wife certainly had been in the habit of drinking.</p>

            . I lodge in the second floor, at No. 5, Compton-street; I was the prisoner's lodger - it is his house. On Thursday, the 14th of June, I went to bed about nine o'clock, and was disturbed a little before half-past one, by a great noise, as if something heavy had fallen; it came from the ground-floor, and I supposed it to be from the back parlour, for it shook the partition of my room, which is a back room - I heard a continual noise, which appeared to me as if the goods were being removed, and after that, I heard the prisoner's voice; he said, "You b-y, b-y whore, what have you done with that gold?" and there was another word, which I could not distinctly hear - I knew the deceased's voice very well, and heard her say, "O Lord, O Lord;" I heard the rumbling both before and after that, and till past three o'clock- I got up, and opened my room door when I heard the deceased say, "O Lord," and remained there about a minute; I heard nothing else - I heard the front door bolt and unbolt three or four times, and heard footsteps from the back parlour to the street door; I kept awake till after three o'clock, and then went to sleep - I am certain about the time, for after I awoke, the chimes went half-past one, and I heard the clock strike two and three, and after that went to sleep; I was awoke again about six, and the house was alarmed - I went down, and saw the prisoner brought in; he was left in charge of me and Bayley - he tried to escape between me and Bayley, but did not succeed, and he said, "You b-y fool, I only wanted to get something to drink."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you and the prisoner disagreed about rent at any time? A. Yes, I am in his debt for rent now - the disagreement was three or four weeks ago from this time; it was because I did not pay him - I owed him 7s. or 8s., or it might be 9s.; I cannot tell on what day we had the quarrel - I have not been with Mrs. Bayley when she said if he had twenty-five necks she would hang him, nor have I joined her in saying so; I and my wife both awoke together - it was not on the Wednesday or Thursday previous to this that I quarrelled with him about rent - it was a long time before that; I paid part of it a week before - I believe the deceased was in the habit of drinking; I never saw her and Bayley drunk together - I had none of the gin on Thursday night.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What business are you? A. A tailor; I have lodged there six months, and paid 2s. 3d. a week - I owed him for about four weeks; the room was not furnished - I told him I would pay him as soon as I could; I had paid him for five months before - I had no quarrel with him.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness - we went to bed about nine o'clock, and were awoke when the chimes struck half an hour, and the clock afterwards struck two - it must have been half-past one: the noise appeared as if the partition of our room was shaken, and we started up together in a fright; I do not know what it was, but I considered that Reilly was moving his goods - it appeared to proceed from his back parlour; our partition is wainscot, and the same sort of partition continues down to his back parlour; I heard a continual noise going in and out at the street door - it kept being bolted and unbolted, and footsteps going along the assage to the back parlour; I heard Mr. Reilly's voice (if ever I heard it before), saying "What have you done with that gold ring, you bl-y whore?" that was repeated three times, and on one occasion the word bl - y was used twice; I heard Mrs. Reilly say "Oh Lord, oh Lord," in a very mournful tone; I went to sleep about four o'clock - I heard a continual noise going in and out of the street door, and what appeared to me like kicking against some hard substance, and then soft - my husband got out of bed, and opened the door; I flew to him, to prevent his going down stairs; we got into bed again - I do not recollect which went to sleep first: the noise ceased at different intervals before I went to sleep - I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050025"/>not think it ceased more than half an hour before I went to sleep; I continually heard going in and out at the street door; I was not disturbed again till the house was alarmed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Is it usual to leave the door on the latch? A. There is a string with a hole through the door, which will remove the bolt, for any of the lodgers to get in any time they think proper; the bolting and unbolting made a great noise on this occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had been unbolted before half-past one o'clock, would you not probably have heard it? A. I suppose so- I was awoke by the partition being shook; we live at the back of the house, and do not hear waggons pass.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is the string at the top or the middle of the door? A. Nearest to the middle; the lodgers in the house knew how to pull the string - it was a thickish piece of twine, with the knot outside; it had no handle.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 15th of June I saw Mrs. Bayley, and from what she said I looked and saw the prisoner crossing St. John-street, at a very quick pace; I overtook him, and asked where he lived; he said in Compton-street - I asked where his wife was; he said at home - I said he must go with me, and took him into custody, to No. 5, Compton-street, and left him in the front room ground floor; he had a bag, containing new leather; I went into the back room; the deceased was on the bed, laying on her back, and the head rather inclining to the inner part of the bed - the face was very much swollen, and the eyes black; she had a severe cut on the head; her clothes were on - I observed a great quantity of blood on the floor, at the foot of the bed, and one spot of blood on the second drawer of a small chest, near the foot of the bed; on the fire-place was a shovel, with some human hair on it, and blood on the hair - that is in the constable's possession; I saw an iron stew-pan standing close to the fire-place, at the foot of the bed, and spots of blood on that - I did not examine the deceased's clothes; I took the prisoner to the station-house, searched him there, and in his coat pocket I found this silk pocket-handkerchief, with wet blood on it - it appeared much wetter than it is now; his left shoe was much stained with blood, and had hair on it on the same part as the blood, there is one or two hairs on it now, but having been taken out so many times some of it has got off; it was then damp, and had apparently been wiped - I was confident it was blood, from the smell; his trousers were spotted with blood - both his hands had a great deal of blood on them, and particularly the back part of his right hand; the blood on his trousers was wet</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You smelt the blood on his shoe? A. Yes, the moment I took it from Mr. Whitmore's hand; I could see it was blood, as well as smell it - Hall, the constable, has his trousers; the Magistrate ordered him to be stripped in prison - the blood on the floor appeared fresh; it appeared to be wiped, but I did not feel it to see if it was wet - I took the shoes from the prisoner's feet, and the trousers were on his person; the bed-side comes close to the fire-place - I suppose there is not above two feet distance; a stew-pan stood on the floor, with its bottom downwards, as if it had laid there some time- the blood on the floor was between the drawers and the bedstead, against the foot-post; the drawers were on the right-hand side, against the wall; the blood was mostly between the drawers and the foot of the bed - the prisoner, before the Magistrate, accounted for the blood on the handkerchief as being from a cut in his finger; there was a small cut on his finger - he told the Magistrate the blood on his hands arose from his lifting the deceased from the floor to the bed; I took him about two hundred yards from his house - I was not two minutes talking to Mrs. Bayley; he was walking, but certainly at a quick pace.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. About seven o'clock in the morning of the 15th of June I was sent to the prisoner's house, and searched the ground floor back room -I found an apron stained with blood in one corner of the room - it appeared like a woman's apron; one end of it was in the bottom drawer of a chest, which stood at the foot of the bed; the drawer was partly open - this is the apron (looking at it); this corner of it was in the drawer, and this, which is now mouldy, rested on the floor, and was stained with blood - there was no blood on the part which was in the drawer; the apron joined together with the blood which was on the floor - there was a curtain on the drawers stained with blood and dirt together - there was a small portion of flesh, about as large as a pen, on the cdge of the drawer, which was not closed; it might be half an inch from the extreme corner of the drawer; it appeared to me to be caused by the head or some part of the body knocking against the door, and being grazed, so that the edge cut part off - I found this shift (looking at it); there were marks of blood on it, but that appeared to have been standing about two days - it was in the corner behind the drawer, near to where the blood laid on the floor - it was folded up; there was a small quantity of human hair in the shift; the blood on it was not fresh - here is a paper containing the hair found on the apron, and that in the shift; I compared it with the hair of the deceased, and it corresponded; also that found on the shovel - the shift was about eighteen inches from the shovel - the drawers are eighteen inches from the fire-place, and the foot of the bedstead is fifteen inches from the fire-place - the shovel was on the top of the stove, where the fire is made; it is a sifting shovel, with holes in it, and without a handle; I found some duplicates in a case in the drawers, and here is one among them for a wedding-ring, pawned on the 2nd of April, 1832; I examined the shop and the passage, but found not the least appearance of blood whatever there, either in the shop or passage.</p>

On the 14th of June I went to bed about eleven o'clock; I rose again, and went to the door about twelve; I went to bed again, and about two was awoke by a noise, like stamping on the floor, and something as though it was against the wainscot; I heard no talking, nor voices - it was dark; I was awoke two or three times, but the noise did not continue; I heard it three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after twelve that you heard it the first time? A. Yes - it was a disturbance in the street that led me to my door; I found it was a tipsy woman at her own door, opposite - she was taken to the station; I had heard none of this noise before that - I do not know when I heard it first, for I was asleep, and it awoke me, but the last noise was about two o'clock, I think - I knew the deceased very well; I had seen her the morning before, and last, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, she came for halfpenny worth of snuff; she was sober then, but was very poorly, and had been so for two or three days - I asked how she was - she said a little better.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was it soon after you went to bed that you heard the noise? A. I had fallen asleep, but it was certainly a very short time, because I was awoke three or four times, and the last time was before day-light - I have a clock, but did not notice the time; I spoke to the prisoner about five minutes before twelve o'clock that night; he was in the street, looking at the noise - he was in the habit of dealing in toys.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate woman. On Thursday, the 14th of June, about one o'clock in the night, I was with Sarah Ryan at the corner of Aylesbury and St. John-street, and met the prisoner; I did not know him before - we asked him to go and have a drop of something to drink; we spoke to him first - he said he had a drop of gin at home, if we liked to go home for it, we went home with him to his house in Compton-street - we went into the passage, just inside the street door, and he took the bottle off a shelf in the shop - the shop door is close to the street door; he said if we liked to stop a little while he would go and fetch some more - he just went to the corner of Compton-street, but could get none, and came back without any; we were not there five minutes altogether - he then asked one of us to stop with him all night; I asked where his wife was - he said she was gone into the country, and he knew she would not be at home that night; we rather doubted that, and neither of us would stop - he gave us two or three toys, and knowing the landlord of the White Hart, we went, and wanted to leave the toys there for a quartern of gin - that was a little after one o'clock; we went there directly from the prisoner's house; I saw nothing more of the prisoner; but just before we had the White Hart to treat her, and we were there - it is four or five doors down Aylesbury street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I suppose you were sober? A. Yes; we went with him, and sent him in doors first, as I thought his wife might be at home; he opened the door, but I do not know how - I know it was shut when we came away; we left him at the house - he did not seem the least out of temper; we did not go further than the passage, but we could not stand there without seeing into the shop door - we stood outside in the street while he went to the corner for more gin; we left the door open - he came back, went in, and shut the door; I did not take notice whether the bolt fastened - I supped at home, but was at the public-house on and off all the evening; the landlord happened to be up, doing something to his cellar - we heard him knocking, and got him to let us in; I do not know what became of the woman, who came into the White Hart with the prisoner - I think that was about one o'clock; it was getting on for two when we left him - I told the Magistrate it was between one and two, that we saw him at the White Hart; that was the time, as near as I can tell.</p>

            . I keep the White Hart, in Aylesbury-street. Cottrel and Ryan brought some toys to my house on the night of the 14th of June; to the best of my recollection, it was nearer one o'clock than twelve - they asked me to let them have some gin for them: and said they had been home with old Reilly (who was at my house a quarter of an hour before, with another woman, whom I knew by the name of Betsy) - I believe Reilly to be the man - I refused to give the gin for the toys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long was Reilly there before the woman came with the toys? A. I should think half an hour; my shutters were up, but the door merely closed; I cannot speak to the time for ten minutes; the woman I believe called him old Reilly - she knew him, because she told me she had asked him if his wife was at home - they did not talk to him at my house; I took but little notice of him.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Cottrell called him by name? A. I think so; she told me after she had been to his house, that she asked him about his wife - that is my only reason for thinking she knew him before; I think this was about one o'clock.</p>

            . I am a private watchman. I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Compton-street, on Thursday night the 14th of June, between one and two o'clock - I cannot fix the time nearer than that; as I passed the prisoner's house I heard a rumbling in the house, which caused me to stop there and listen for a minute or two - I knew the prisoner and heard him call Mrs. Reilly a b-y whore; he said he would break her b-y neck- I heard her answer, "O dear me!" and heard what appeared to me to be her head hitting against a board, but whether it was so, I cannot say; I knew his wife; she said,"O dear me!" after I heard the knocking against the board; it was said in a mournful tone, as if he had been ill-using her - as soon as that was over the prisoner opened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050027"/>the door, came out and, asked what I wanted there; I said, "What is that to you?" he was dressed at that time: he sat on the cill of the door while I went about one hundred yards up the street; I then returned, and he was still sitting at the door - nothing passed between us; I went on leaving him sitting there, and I saw him in about a quarter of an hour, which was about a quarter before two o'clock, sitting down at the door, but did not speak to him; I did not see him again till a quarter after four - he was then between his own door and the next house; I did not notice whether his own door was open; I did not speak to him - he was dressed then, the same as he was at other times, as near as I can judge; I did not see him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. At what time did you first come into Compton-street? A. About ten o'clock; I cannot tell whether I was there at half-past twelve, as my beat is in St. John-street - I cried half-past twelve in Compton-street; I do not know whether the clock had struck the half-hour - I was in Compton-street between one and two o'clock, and left it between one and two; I did not see Reilly with two women - when I saw him at the door, I said nothing to him about the noise, for I had heard noises so frequently between him and his wife, that I took no notice of it; they were continually quarrelling - I never quarrelled with the prisoner about a Christmas-box, or any thing else; I never applied for one at any house on his side of the way - I never had a dispute with him; but in discharge of my duty I have been obliged to go into his place, but I have been ordered out; he told me to trouble my head with my own business, but I had no dispute with him - I do not apply to people in his situation for Christmas-boxes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you hear a man and his wife quarrelling at half-past one o'clock in the morning, why not go in and ask what it was about? A. I had no business in his house; I am only a private watchman - the Police are in the neighbourhood.</p>

            . I am a surgeon and apothecary, and live in Coldbath-square, Clerkenwell. I was called in, on the 15th of June, by the parish officers, and saw the deceased about eight o'clock in the morning; she was laying on the bed, in a natural position, on her back, with some clothes on - with the assistance of my apprentice, I moved the clothes, and observed many integumental marks of bruises and contusious, more particularly about the face, head, and upper parts of the body - she had no cap on; her hair was matted with blood - there was a wound on the superior part of the head, extending through the scalp and pericranium, and exposing the crauium; it was of a triangular form, about an inch each way - there was another wound on the posterior part of the scalp, of a rounded form, and not extending through the pericranium; on making the usual incision to examine the head, which extends across it, from ear to ear, over the top, I found that the scalp, to a greater size than the palm of my hand, was already separated from the pericranium, and on my separating the integuments, black blood escaped, so that it was not perfectly coagulated; on removing the super or part of the cranium, I found a red blush on the dura mater, corresponding with the triangular wound on the intogument, which had denuded the cranium; the mark corresponds with the wound in situation and size, one being under the bone, and the other over it; I should think the wound must have been as recent as a few hours, the blood not having coagulated - there was a mark on the right hemisphere of the brain, corresponding with the triangular wound; there was some disease - the membranes covering the brain were thickened; the brain itself was very healthy and firm, and the cranium not fractured any where - on proceeding to examine the thorax, I could feel through the integuments, that many ribs were broken on each side, and ascertained that five superior ribs on the right side were fractured, about two inches from their termination, towards the front; these short broken ends of the bone were pressing on the lungs below - a quantity of coagulated blood was in the thorax on that side; it had effused from the lungs - there were about ten or twelve ounces, and about four ounces of it were in a coagulated state; on the left side nine ribs were broken, much more posterially than on the right, numbering from the second to the tenth, both inclusive; the broken part of the spinal ends of one or two of them had perforated the lung, and wounded it; blood had effused to something like the same extent as on the other side. I have no doubt, that although the fluid was then coloured with blood, that there was a deposition of water there before the injury; that is an evidence of some by-gone disease; I think it was on both sides, but certainly on the left; the quantity was not material, not to interfere with life - there was some adhesions on both sides passing from the lining of the ribs to the covering of the lungs; it is right to mention that, as they are evidence of discuse having existed some time or other, though, perhaps, not at the time of death; although this evidence of disease might interfere with enjoyment of the higher order of life, it could not cause death - on examining the left arm, the bone above the wrist was fractured - the end of the outer bone was considerably pressed from its situation; the outer bone of the leg was fractured three or four inches above the ancle - the scapulse on the right side was broken into many pieces; one other bone of the left hand was fractured about the centre; it appeared to me that the fracture of the ribs must have been inflicted by some large body; a poker, or any thing small would have left a corresponding mark; it must have been some larger body; as I could find nothing in the room to do it, I looked at the prisoner's shoes, which the Policeman showed me; I saw some blood on them, and fancy I can see some now, but it was more crimson then - there were a few hairs, which corresponded with the hair of the deceased's head, which I took with me for the purpose of comparing; they were very few in number; the prisoner had a slight cut on his fore finger; it was recent, and might have been inflicted with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Would kicking. or trampling on the body of the deceased, have produced the effects you have described in the trunk of the body? A. I consider so; the broken fragments of the ribs had perforated the lungs, and on the eft side that was particularly manifest - I attribute the death<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050028"/>to the pressure on the lungs, causing them to ooze out the blood which I found in the thorax; the ribs being broken, the least pressure would cause death - there was no protection for the lungs; the same act of violence which fractured the ribs would instantly cause them to perforate the lungs, which would cause instantaneous death - I saw a shovel with holes in it; I have no reason to think that had inflicted the wounds on the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The hair on the shoe and on the shovel had nothing to do with the mortal injury? A. I think not; the injury to the wrist and to the head had nothing to do with the death.</p>
               <p>Q. In short, your evidence is, that the injuries received by the deceased, on the ribs, were remotely the cause of death? A. They were the cause of death; the fracture of the ribs, and the perforation of the lungs, would be simultaneous; the great displacement of the parts convinces me that the lungs must have been perforated the instant the ribs were fractured.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain the ribs had not been broken some days before? A. Certainly; life could not have endured many minutes after such displacement had taken place, it must have been instantaneous, the broken ribs had overlaped, and the lung itself was so displaced as to be carried over the spinal rib, which pressed into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in your judgment, she died from no fracture of the ribs, but in consequence of their perforating the lungs? A. One was the consequence of the other, the fourteen ribs being broken would certainly have caused death; she died from the fracture of the ribs, which caused the rupture of the lungs; if fractured ribs ever caused death, it certainly did in this case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Could a person, having received the injury you have described, have come into the house alone? A. It is impossible; she never could have respired.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you suppose caused the wound on the head? A. I see no reason why kicks might not do it or trampling, that would also break the bone of the leg - there was no mark of any shoe nails; there are some nails in one shoe, but not in the bloody one - both have an iron tip at the heel - the deceased hadher clothes on.</p>
               <p>MR. MALLETT. I am clerk to the Justices at Hatton-garden. I was present at the examination of the prisoner on this charge; this examination is my hand-writing, and has the Magistrate's signature to it - it was taken down from the prisoner's mouth; I read it over to him - he did not sign it, but stated it to be correct, he first made the statement on the 15th - at the last examination the original statement was read over to him, and he said he had nothing to add to it; that was on the 22nd of June - he was called on by the Magistrate, to know what he had to say; I read over slowly to him what he had said, and he approved of it - no inducement was held out to him; he was not asked to sign it - (reads.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner says, "When I awoke she was laying in that state; the front door leading into the shop was wide open: I took her up in my arms, and that is the way I got that blood on my shoulder; I went up to my lodgers; I do not know at what time she came home; when I awoke at six o'clock she was laying there. I have nothing more to say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I consider myself entirely innocent of the charge - I have nothing more to say, but leave it to the Jury.</p>

            . I live at Messingham, in Lincolnshire, near Brigg; it is fifty miles from Grantham - the prisoner was in my service as a drover off and on for nearly five years.

               <p>Q. Were you in his debt at that time? A. There might be some little settlement - I do not fancy that I owed him 5l.; I am sure I did not owe him 10l.; I used to give him money, and he paid the expences on the road - I gave him no authority to sell the sheep; I went to the Spread Eagle at half-past four o'clock on Sunday, and waited there till five o'clock; I then got a boy to show me the way to Smithfield; I met Shelton at the Red Bull, Islington; and, in consequence of a conversation with him, I got Turner, the officer, that Sunday evening, and on Monday morning, the 16th, I found the whole one hundred and eighteen sheep at Smithfield market, in possession of different salesmen - Shelton saw them afterwards; I was offered a guinea each for the sheep at Grantham - on the 21st of April I received a letter from the Mayor of Colchester, and found the prisoner in custody there on Monday, the 23rd; I had no warrant for him, and they refused to deliver him up; I afterwards got a warrant from Hatton-garden, and he was brought to London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. The prisoner had been employed by you for four or five years. A. Yes, off and on, as a drover, not as a regular servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear before the Magistrate, you never in your life authorized the prisoner to sell any sheep or beasts, unless you were present at the time, or else somebody to take the money? A. I stated that before the Magistrate; I say the same now; I left a note at Newark for him to sell some beasts, if I did not come - I expected to send George Taylor to meet him, but when I got home, he was not at home; the prisoner sold three beasts there; I did not recollect that before the Magistrate; I do not recollect his selling two hundred and sixty sheep at Stamford fair in November, 1829, but I know he never had sheep to sell for me, unless he had a man with him to take the money; I do not recollect his receiving 200l., and giving a receipt for the money - he received no money whatever for those sheep, for I now recollect it, and I sold them myself, and received the money; I forget how much it was, or who bought them - it was not money, but a bill - I received it afterwards; I think they were sold to Skill, a farmer, at Bicknell, sixty miles from me; I did not at first recollect he had bought them - I received the bill myself, and believe it is now laying at Jones', in Smithfield; I passed the prisoner returning from Stamford fair, when I was on a coach, between Sleaford and Lincoln, and then re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050030"/>ceived a letter from him which he brought from Skill, but no money; the letter contained a draft of Skill's for the two hundred and sixty sheep - I left him at Norwich in May, 1830, in charge of one hundred and twenty beasts - I did not desire him to take sixty of them any where to sell them; he was to wait till I came there, and not to sell any of them - I went there to him the week following; I never told him to sell sixty-eight sheep at Market Dereham - I sent him to different places, but he never had authority to sell at any place; I do not remember any thing about meeting him at Doncaster, and his paying me for beasts sold at Lyan; he never sold beasts without somebody being present; I know a man named Dan - I have frequently trusted him to sell; I do not recollect sending the prisoner to Spalding with ten beasts which Dan had not sold - I have sent him with different lots to Welburn, and other people - I did not, in November, find that Welburn had thirty-three sheep more than had been left; I do not recollect thirty-three sheep being over at all - I swear I never, on any occasion, gave him permission to sell beasts; he sold these for less than what I was bid for them - after recovering them, I put them with four different salesmen, and they sold them for 82l. odd - some of them made about three halfpence per 1b. - no respectable person would buy them, because they would have to attend here.

               <p>Q. Did you not give the prisoner orders to dispose of these sheep at all events? A. I did not; I was to be here myself to sell them - the prisoner gave me no account of them at Colchester; I did not see any money produced from him there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you dispose of many thousand cattle in a month? A. About one thousand; I farm about six hundred acres, part of which is my own - I employ several drovers; I never in my life employed the prisoner to sell, except when another person was present to receive the money: I had a particular reason for that, from the first time he came to me - the sheep were worth about 24s. each, which would be about 150l. - I was obliged to make something of them; I am sure my appointment with the prisoner was to meet at the Spread Eagle, on Sunday, at half-past four o'clock.</p>

            . I live at Edenham, near Bourne, Lincolnshire - On Saturday, the 14th of April, I saw the prisoner coming from Whetstone; he was coming out of the country, towards London, and had one hundred and 18 Scotch sheep- I asked him where he was going with them; he said to Smithfield - I asked if he would sell the sheep: he said Yes - I asked him whose they were: he said they were his own - I did not know him before - I asked what he wanted for them: he said 28s a piece - I said he asked a great deal too much, but if he could set them at a sovereign a piece I would give him a bid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say why he sold them on the road? A. Yes; he said he should like to sell them there, because he must go back to St. lves market, to meet his brother, who was to sell some beasts there - St. lves is in Huntingdonshire, not Colchester way; after handling the sheep over he put them into the stable, and then we went to a public-house: this was Saturday night - I bid him 16s. each for them that evening, but he wanted 26s., and on Sunday morning, at half-past four o'clock, when I came down, he stood against the public-house door, and said "Good morning;" I asked if he was ready to go; he said "No, he was not going yet; I said very well, I must go" - I went on five or six yards; be then came to me to know where the man's house was at which he had put his one hundred and eighteen sheep - I showed him the house; I then bargained with him for them, and he agreed to take 16s. a piece - I took the sheep to town, and placed them in the hands of different salesmen at Smithfield - I kept twenty of them for myself - I saw Sowerby on the Sunday evening, at the Red Bull, Islington, and on the Monday morning he found the sheep out in the market himself, in the hands of the different salesmen, who I had placed them with - he got a Policeman and took them; they were afterwards sold on his account.</p>
               <p>Q. You applied to the prisoner first to sell the sheep? A. Yes, I asked if he would sell them: he said Yes - he said in the morning "What do you say about these sheep:" I said "What I told you last night" - he endeavoured to get as much for them as he could, and I tried to buy them as cheap as I could - it wanted about a quarter to five o'clock on Sunday when we concluded the bargain; I left Whetstone about that time - none of them were sold before Sowerby claimed them; the salesmen were to sell them for what they could fetch - I believe fourteen were finally sold alive, and the rest dead - Sowerby ordered them to be killed- I consider I bought them at a fair price; they came to 94l. 8s.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were they fit to kill? A. Most of them were - some, I thought, more fit for store; I did not consider it any bargain - there was more chance of losing by them than winning.</p>

            . I am sergeant-at-mace for Colchester. On the 18th of April the prisoner was at Colchester - that is not the way to Huntingdonshire; I first saw him on Wednesday, the 18th of April - he was detained by a constable, from information I had received; he was taken at a lodging-house for travelling beggars there; I went myself to take him - the constable (Betts) had detained him by my direction; when I apprehended him he said nothing -Betts said, in his presence and hearing, "Is this the man you want?" I said it was - he appeared very much agitated - I then took him before Mr. Spurling, the Mayor, who took down in writing what passed, and ordered him to be detained; at that time we knew nothing about any sheep; he had in his possession 50l. in notes, 41l. in gold, and 10s. in silver, which I took from him, in the presence of the Mayor - I asked him, as we went along, how he came in possession of so much money - he made no answer; he said nothing that I recollect, except before the Mayor; there is a sailing packet from Colchester to Hull, and I have heard there is a passage from Hull to Canada; the prisoner had booked himself to go to Hull - that was mentioned at the Mayor's room; after we took the prisoner we went to the captain to inquire if there was any luggage; there was none at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Perhaps you know that Hull is the cheapest way to Brigg, in Lincolnshire, where the prosecutor lives? A. I know nothing of that; he did not tell me he was going the nearest way to Mr. Sowerby's, when I took him - he admitted, before the Magistrate, that he had received the money for the sheep; I found he had agreed to pay 10s. for his passage to Hull,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050031"/>if he found his own provision; he had no luggage - I never heard him say he was going home with the money to his master.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hatton-garden. I went to Colchester, and received the prisoner in charge on the 3rd of May, and on the road to town, on the coach, he told me his master owed him 28l. or 29l., and if he had not done as he had he never should have got the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you he was going to Hull, as the nearest point to Brigg? A. No; I do not know of any vessel going from there to Brigg.</p>

               <p>MR. SOWERBY. There is a packet goes from Brigg to Hull.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you pay the prisoner? A. I give him money when he wants to pay it away on the road - he agreed with me for 3s. a day - that is what I regularly give drovers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Here is a book with an account where I have been selling for him these five years for him - when he started me with these sheep he ordered me not to return till I had sold them; I gave him at Grantham what money I had received; he never confined me to any price, as some of them were dying every day, and they were getting worse, he said I must go, and not return till I sold them; if I could not sell them at London to sell them at Romford, or any market I could; I sold them, and was returning home the cheapest way. to give him the money - I could get from Hull to within four miles of where he was for 6d., and if I had gone by coach it would have cost 2l. and more.</p>

               <p>Q. Who received the money? A. The last sheep he sold, was in Linconshire; he employed me to take some beasts from Lincolushire to Newell - the prisoner received the money for them next morning; Mr. Sowerby had gone home the day before; the butcher at Lincoln paid the prisoner before my eyes - I do not remember how much it was, and at Stamford fair I saw him sell a lot of beasts, and receive the money, which he put into his pocket; Sowerby was in the fair, but the prisoner put the money in his pocket - I was at Boston when he sold nineteen or twenty of Sowerby's sheep, and took the money; Sowerby was at Boston, but was not present, and at different fairs he was always entrusted to buy and sell any thing - I have known him go out with sheep or beasts to sell where he could.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You know nothing about these hundred and nineteen sheep? A.

            . I am the prisoner's brother. I lived with Mr. Sowerby myself three years; I first went to him on the 24th of April, 1829, and have been with him occasionally since - I was last in his employ in February; my brother was sent to different places to sell sheep and beasts; I can relate many instances in which he sold, when Mr. Sowerby has not been present - the last was at Peterborough fair, which is held on the 10th or 11th of July, but last year Sunday intervened, and on Monday we had sixty-seven beasts left.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean? A. My brother and me; they were Mr. Sowerby's; Sowerby came up to the Blackmoor's Head, where we stopped - he took us a little aside, and desired us to take the sixty-seven beasts to Norfolk; we came to Wisbeach market on the Saturday, and the prisoner took twenty beasts, and left me grazing, with the forty-seven in the lanes; they were not sold - we went to Norwich, and sold some there; I do not recollect how many - Sowerby was there himself; we left Norwich on Saturday, and he allowed the prisoner to take twenty-four which were left, to sell at Lynn, as he was himself going to the Northern fair; he came to Lynn with them - I went to fetch more, and understand he sold fifteen; Sowerby did not say where he was going - he had gone home; I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you know of Mr. Sowerby appointing any body to receive the money? A. Nobody; his sheep<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050032"/>had private marks on them, so that I knew when his sheep were sold.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. I ask do you know any instance of his selling sheep and receiving the money when Sowerby was not there? A. Yes, at Market-Weighton; the prisoner took the money home for three bullocks he sold there - I did not see them sold, nor the money paid; he had ninety cheviot ewes, and two hundred and eighty lambs last harvest, at Weighton-market; they were not sold, but left to grass - the prisoner and I met Sowerby next day, and he ordered us to bring them to Maldon fair, to ask 23s. each for the ewes, and if we could get a sovereign to take it, and to offer the lambs at 9s. 6d. each; my brother left us to go there - nobody went with him: he said if he could not get 9s. 6d. for the lambs that he knew how they were brought, and if he could get 1s. on each, to do it, for if in a fortnight he could sell a thousand, a shilling profit would be 50l., the prisoner was to receive the money; last harvest I heard him send him to Boston, and tell him to sell as many beasts as he could, and what he could not sell to take to Spalding; nothing was said about who who was to receive the money; I understand my brother went - I have been present when he has received money for Mr. Sowerby's cattle, when neither Sowerby nor any body from him was present; this was at Market-Weighton and Newark; I cannot mention any other particular place, I have seen it at so many.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you in Mr. Sowerby's service as a drover? A. Yes - I used to go one way and the prisoner another, and sometimes we went together; I never had authority to sell, unless the sheep got lame, and even then I had no authority, but if I could not get on with them I sold them; Mr. Welburn was occasionally in the habit of acting for Mr. Sowerby - Taylor was only a drover; he never allowed him to sell; I have heard him say Taylor was not qualified to sell - the prisoner has no other brother; I think I was at Mr. Element's last April - he lives about fourteen miles from Sowerby's, in Nottinghamshire; I was not in Huntingdonshire on the 14th of April, nor at St. Ives - I did not see Welburn at Market-Weighton, when the beasts were sold, and do not know whether my brother delivered the money for the lambs to him, he might; I was not at Spalding, and cannot say whether he paid Taylor for what was sold there - I do not know the price of Scotch sheep in April; I saw them in the fold in February; a good many of them died, and Mr. Sowerby said, "There are so many dying, take them away, and sell them where the devil you can."</p>
               <p>MR. SOWERBY. The last witness has been several times in my employ as a drover; I remember some sheep being sent to Weighton-market - Welburn was there, and received the money for them, and so he did for the ninety ewes and two hundred and eighty lambs; Taylor was always with the prisoner, if he went to sell any thing at Spalding and at other places; when I was not there Welburn or Taylor were for me.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. They told you so, but you was not there yourself? A. No; Welburn is now in Yorkshire: I saw these sheep in the field - there was not one dead to the best of my knowledge; I had them up from another farm, where six or seven died - I did not tell the prisoner to take and sell them where the devil he could; I told him nothing of the kind - I may owe the prisoner a little - he has paid expences when he has been out, and may have spent more than I gave him; I think I have seen that book before - there was never any receipts passed between us for expences paid; he has paid me for lame sheep which he sold, but I gave him no acknowledgment for it - Taylor was always with him at sales.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you on any occasion authorize him to sell sheep or beasts, except when yourself or somebody has been present to take the money? A. No, except when I left the beasts at Newark, and then I expected Taylor would be there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he ever apply to you for money and you refused to give it him? A. Never; he paid me for the lame sheep at Grantham - he did not then say I was in his debt, or ask for money; I gave him money when he left Grantham - there was an Irishman with him, and I said, "Mind that fellow don't rob you."</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had two more witnesses, but have not seen them since they were seen talking to the prosecutor at the corn fair - Taylor never received a shilling of the money: I have worked for the prosecutor two years, and though he knew I was starving, he would not give me money to subpoena witnesses and get counsel.</p>

He was at Mr. Sowerby's at work the winter before last, and he desired me to add up his book, which I did and furnished Mr. Sowerby with the bill - he said he would settle it some time, but did not, and last winter I gave him the account again; he refused to settle with any body, and we said we never would dirt our hands with his work till he did - then his mother died, and that put an end to it; he said he would settle with me first, and he paid me here last Thursday.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the morning of the 7th of May, at the King's Head, Orchard-street, Westminster - he was drinking with some girls, and nearly tipsy; he came to me as I stood at the bar, and said, "Policeman, will you take a drink of beer?" I said I had no objection, and drank with him - he said, "I have a jacket here, I will sell you for 2s., if you like to buy it;" I declined - I looked at him, and having a bill in my pocket respecting Mr. Gregorie's mare, I saw he answered the description of the man, and asked if he had been in the country lately - he said he had - I asked if he had been to turn his master's hunters out; he said, "Yes: but Mr. Policeman I am going to answer no more question; I suppose you think you have a case against me?" I then requested him to go down to the station-house with me; he said he would, but afterwards swore he would not - I then took him to Queen-square office; the Magistrate desired me to take him to Bond-street, for Davis to see him; I left him in custody of another person at a public-house in Avery-row, and went to Davis - he went with me to the public-house, and pointed him out directly.</p>
               <p>MR. GREGORIE.

            . I live with Dr. Addison, in New-street, Spring-gardens; the prisoner was my helper at Dr. Addison's stables, in Rams'-mews, King-street, Westminster. On the 27th of April the prisoner was at the stables, at twelve and four o'clock, and at six and nine o'clock - he has been there every day, from about Christmas, till he was apprehended; I had discharged him the morning he was taken - he sometimes slept in the coach-house, and sometimes away, if he had a lodging - my wife lives at the stables; I have only one room and a loft - I was out with the carriage on the 27th, from twelve till four o'clock - I found him there when I came home; I went out again about six, and left him there; in the first instance I went to Prescot-street, Goodman's-fields, which was out of our usual ride; it was on a Friday - he was taken up on the Monday week following; I went before Mr. Gregorie, and was asked several questions, but could not call to my recollection the several facts as to the time, being taken unawares - they asked me about four o'clock, and I could not recollect it, but I have since called to memory certain circumstances, which have corresponded; I took him into my employ after he was discharged, as he was destitute and without friends - he was with me till he was taken again; I have known him about three years, and have heard he was rather dissipated, and that I experienced myself.</p>
               <p>- GOODRICK. I am the wife of the last witness; the prisoner used to clean the horses and help in the stable - he slept in the coach-house till the last fortnight of his being with us; he then took a lodging in Windmill-street, but not having money to pay for his lodging, my husband allowed him to sleep in the coach-house; on Friday, the 27th, he was with us all day, till after dinner time - we dine between one and two o'clock - he never left; I sent him on an errand between three and four, and I gave him his tea in the loft, a little before four; he remained in the yard till a few minutes to half-past six, when he had to get the horses ready for my husband, and after that he was playing with my child in the yard - he was not absent all day.</p>
               <p>Q. What enables you to remember that it was the 27th of April? A. I was called up to Marlborough-street a fortnight after; I heard from the officers on what day the robbery was committed, and we recollected among us, (my neighbours and myself), that was the day, I had sent him for some raddishes; a person in the yard reminded me of it- he wore in the yard a dark fustian working jacket; he only wore a coat when out - I only sent him across the road for the raddishes.</p>

            . I live at Plumstead, in Herefordshire, and am a calf-dealer. On Thursday afternoon, the 10th of May, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the top of the Archway-hill; I was coming to Smithfield, to buy a lot of calves - I knew him; he asked if I was coming for a lot of calves - I said Yes; he said he was going across to Highgate to buy one, and asked if I would like to buy it - I said Yes, if he brought it to the Coach and Horses that night, or to market next morning, I would look at it; he said he did not know that he could get it as far as the Coach and Horses, and would bring it to the Half Moon, Holloway - I left word with the ostler, that I would come there at six or seven o'clock, and look at it if he brought it; he told me he was going to buy it - I went the next morning, between six and seven; the ostler showed it to me - Hughes came in about half an hour; I agreed to give him 25s. for it -I had a sovereign in my pocket, which I gave him, and said if he would come to market, I would give him the 5s., or I would give it him next week; I saw the calf at Hatton-garden afterwards - I saw Pack at Smithfield, about four o'clock on Friday morning, and said something to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time heard the calf was supposed to be stolen? A. Yes; I have dealt in calves about a year and a half before that - I was servant to Mr. Welch, of Hockley, and bought a lot of calves at Smithfield, after I saw the prisoner; I do not always pay ready money - I had nine sovereigns, but no silver - I told the ostler I expected the prisoner was going to bring me a calf or two to look at.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send the prisoner to Meredith afterwards, to tell him to turn the calf into the field? A. No; I sent a man to tell him to lock it up, and let nobody have it till I came; I saw Dixon in Smithfield, but I never told him the prisoner was not the man who sold me the calf; I have bought calves of the prisoner's father and brother before, but never of him.</p>

down towards the prosecutor - it went close to his jacket, but whether it went into his pocket I do not know; the prosecutor turned round and took Bryant - I said, "I think this is the man, for I saw him at your pocket;" I do not think Harris was near enough for Bryant to hand the money over to him - when it was found on Harris, he said it was his own, and that he had changed a sovereign the night before; Bryant said he had come there to buy mackarel - I have seen them in the market with fish before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was there any straw at the bottom of the coach? A. I cannot say; there was a mat - the front seat was full of luggage; the purse might have been drawn down - the prisoner had not been paid; he offered to be searched, and unbuttoned his waistcoat, but I told him I had no power to search him - he made no opposition to my searching the coach, but he did not look into the coach after I went to him; the coach was taken to the station-house, and there the purse was found - I think we had four or five parcels.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he search the coach himself? A. No, he did not; he did not get into the coach - he said,"Search me;" I looked into the coach, but did not make a minute search.</p>

            . I am a superintendent of Police. The coach and the prisoner were brought to our station; I turned all out, and found this purse concealed under the hind seat, behind some nose-bags - it was completely behind every thing; it evidently appeared to me, that it must have been put there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That is your opinion? A. Yes, there is a board goes along the coach under the seat, but there is an open space between the seat and that; I do not think the purse could have been thrown there by taking out the luggage, or by pulling the mat up.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look on the seat first? A. Yes, then turned up the cushions, and then felt in the pockets: I then found it under the seat, and under the nose-bags - some of them had corn in them, and some were empty; it appeared to me that the purse had been thrown there - it could not have jolted there, as it is up hill.</p>

            , No.74, Compton-street - I went out to go there with him, but he would not go there, he turned in another direction; I then took him back to Mr. Harrison's shop, and on the way back, I asked him to whom they really did belong - he then said they belonged to his master, who was gone to Portugal, and had given him power to make use of them, if he should be short of money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I should receive my money in a short time, and I would release it; I had not seen my prosecutor for some days. Witness. He did not say that till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>MR. FITZPATRICK. I am clerk to the Magistrates at Marlborough-street. I heard the prisoner admit, at the office, that he took them, and it was written down; he said he intended to redeem them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I intended to take them out, and I wrote to my prosecutor to come and take me out of custody, which he did; I had not seen him for three weeks - I intended to release them in a day or two.</p>

               <p>MR. CHURCH. He took out articles, but he was not to keep them till they were disposed of; these are not articles which he was allowed to take out at any time - they are not entered in his book at all; they were in his trunk in his bed-room - I have only a lad who used to go out with the prisoner, my wife, and myself; he never sold any velvet for me - if he had come and brought an order for it, I should have sent it out, but it is not likely to sell at this time of the year; I received this note, which is the prisoner's writing - (read).</p>

On the 26th of May, about half-past six o'clock, Mrs. Brown was at my stall, buying fish - she had a basket on her arm, and one in her hand; I saw Ward run from behind her to the other two prisoners, who were in the road and they all ran off together; I asked Mrs. Brown if she had lost any thing - she looked in her basket, and said she had lost her purse, with 18s. in it; I immediately ran after them, and they were all taken in William-street - this purse and money was found in Chatterton's trousers - I had seen Ward give something to Chatterton.</p>

             (Police-constable G 216.) I saw the prisoners running in William-street, and concluded they had something - I stopped them; Ranson called out to me that Ward had taken a purse, and I found this purse in a place like a false pocket, at the bottom of Chatterton's trousers; Mrs. Brown came up, and said, "That is my purse, and it contains 18s.," which it does.</p>

I said, "You know I want that money which you took out of the till;" he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and took out two sixpences - he said one of them was his master's, and if there was any more money it was in his coat pocket - I took his coat, and found in the pocket of it eight shillings, and six sixpences; at the station-house he said it belonged to the landlady, and asked if they would transport him.</p>

            . I was servant to Miss Ward - I went on Tuesday and the prisoner left on Wednesday - the prisoner and I were sent on Wednesday to the Horse and Groom, and we had to go again on Friday - the prisoner then told me to take the two silver coins into the silver-smith's shop - he gave me 8d. for them - I had taken the ear-ring before - she paid three pence for that being mended; and then she bought some nuts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any one present when you received them? A. No; she told me not to be afraid to go in, as they were her own - she said so when I asked why she did not take them herself - she went in, took the money, and paid for the ear-ring.</p>

I lost a purse, a pair of sleeves, and a habit-shirt - I did not miss them till they were found - the sleeves were taken from a box which I allowed the prisoner to leave at my house, but she had the key of it - the other articles were found in the box brought by the officer - when I last saw the sleeves they were in my drawer; I know them to be mine - they were made for a lady, and returned, because they were too small - the prisoner said they were her own.</p>

In consequence of what Butters said I was on the watch, and in the evening saw the prisoner go to the premises, enter a side door, and come out with this saw, secreted under his arm, with his apron covered over it; I followed, and stopped him - he said he found it in the back premises, and was taking it home for protection; he had no business there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had there been any workmen on the premises? A. Yes, till six o'clock; this door was barricadoed on the inside; the house was not finished - a person could have got in at a window, but they would have been seen; the place was not left unprotected.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw the prisoner go out with the saw? A. Yes, but it is possible the saw might have been placed outside the premises; the door was out of sight: I cannot tell whether he entered the house.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I live in Plumtree-street, Bloomsbury, and am a basket-maker. I have a slight knowledge of the prisoner; he came to my father's house in Quaker-street on the 20th of May: I was there, and he asked me if I would purchase two bundles of rods - I asked where they were; he said if I could go with him, he would show me - he took me to a court near my father's, where I saw Keetch and these two bundles of rods; I asked what they wanted for them; they both said 8s.: I did not particularly examine them, as I had no suspicion - I offered them 6s., which they agreed to take; I gave them 1s. deposit: they then asked if I would buy six more - I then had some suspicion and said I did not want them, but, as they pressed it, I said I would see, and told them to bring these two bundles to my father's in the course of the day - the prisoner said he would take them with me, and he and the other brought them to my father's door directly; I asked the prisoner his name; he said Ingram or Ingham, and that he had the rods of his father in the Borough: I looked at them, then went to the officer, and gave him information - I then went to the prisoner, and again asked about them; he said, "It is all right, I will fetch them back again:" but I said that would not do for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you pay the 1s. to the prisoner? A. I believe it was to Keetch, but I cannot exactly say which; they both held out their hands, and as it was rather a dark place I cannot be certain, but I have no doubt it was to Keetch - when I knew the prisoner he lived at the corner of the court, about two hundred yards from where I purchased the rods; I did not know the other.</p>

The prisoners applied to me for a lodging on the 17th of May; they slept up stairs, and the next morning went out about eight o'clock; I had heard them open the window of their room to see if my shutters were shut, and they then went out - I looked after them, and saw them going the back way; I followed, and called to them to stop, but they would not - I saw the quilt and blanket about Norwood's middle; I did not see any thing on Calaghan.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you find the blanket and quilt? A. They were sent by a little boy: there was no person there that night, but the prisoner; my husband has left me thirteen years - I do not know where he went; his name was James.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where were you married? A. At Winchester - he was a soldier; he left me in Poplar - I have no reason to believe he is dead; he was born in Sligo -I have never looked much after him.</p>

             (Police-constable G 158). I took the prisoner on the 19th of May, in consequence of an alarm from the boy - the prisoner said she knew nothing about it; but in going to the station she said, "I will take you to where the girl lives, who took the cheese;" we went to a house in Bethnal-green, but the girl was not there.</p>

On the 31st of May a little girl named Taylor came to offer a counterpane and a shirt - I placed them on the counter, and went to the other side, to attend to a customer; soon after the little girl left the spot - the prisoner came in, and went to where the parcels were; she went out in two or three minutes, and I missed the shirt; the prisoner returned in five minutes, and I charged her with having taken the shirt - she denied it, and said she was a very honest woman, and seemed surprised that I should suspect her; I asked where she had been - she said to purchase a penny worth of tea, and afterwards a penny worth of gin; I asked if she would object to be searched - she said No: the servant then searched her, but did not find it. On the Saturday after, I was sent for by Mr. Russell, a pawnbroker, and found the prisoner there, with this shirt; I told her this was the shirt she had stolen from my counter - she denied it, and said it was her husband's; I gave her into custody - I do not positively identify the shirt, but this is the one I found there; Mr. Cotton is answerable for the shirt, and has paid for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not her husband attend at the office? A. Yes, and produced a shirt there, but it was seven inches wider than this - there was only the little girl in the shop when the prisoner came in - I saw her leave the shop, and did not see her take any thing; I might be three or four yards from her - I had seen her come to our shop.</p>

On the 31st of May I went by Mrs. Hart's direction to Mr. Cotton's, with a shirt and a counterpane which she gave me; the pawnbroker placed them on the counter - the prisoner came in while I was there: I did not see her do any thing, but she went away, and the shirt was missing in three or four minutes.</p>

The prosecutor asked me to go to London; in going along he asked if I had any money - I said No; he said no more had he, and he would give me his daughter's watch to pawn, which I did, and we spent the money together - in going home, we had a few words, and he said, "I will fix you for it;" he then went and stopped it - he has been convicted here himself.</p>

            . There is not a word of truth in it; I had three or four shillings in my pocket; I could have taken the pigs myself, but the prisoner had nothing to do, and I asked him to go with me - I gave him plenty of victuals and drink; he lives next door to me, but hardly ever comes into my house - I was here about two years ago, but I never was tried; it was about a horse I had sold to a young man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You was convicted of stealing a bag of nails, and had six months in the House of Correction, and your son is there now. Witness. No I was not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you partake of any of the money? A. No, I did not - he said he had no money, but he left me in Smithfield, and came again in about an hour; he then said he had seen his sister, who gave him 1s., and a cousin of his, who gave him 1s. 6d.</p>

            . I live opposite Mr. Harris. On the 21st of May I was standing in my shop, with Sandell - I could see into the prosecutor's shop; I saw Bishop, and another person, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, go to the prosecutor's shop, and I saw the waistcoat go off - Bishop either concealed it in his apron, or under his apron, and they went away; I sent Sandell, who ran, and collared Bishop - I went over; we took him into the prosecutor's shop - the other person got away; I cannot swear that it was Berry.</p>
               <p>Bishop. Q. What time was it? A. Between nine and ten o'clock; I was in our shop, near a little room we have there.</p>

On the 29th of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, the three prisoners came in together - Earle called for a quartern of gin; I had seen him before, but not the others - they all partook of the gin: Earle tendered me half a crown to pay for it - I had no silver in the till, and I told the maid to mind the bar while I went to get my purse, which contained a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and 6s. 6d. in silver - I gave change of the half-crown to Earle, put the half-crown in the purse, and put the purse on the table in the bar, but any one could take it by reaching over; I then turned to draw some porter, and when I turned round all the prisoners and the purse were gone - I did not like to call my uncle, but in about two hours he got up, and then I told him, and described Earle's person; the prisoners were all taken in about two hours and a half - a strap of the purse has been found, but not the purse.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had your masters any of that litharge that day? A. Yes, a great deal; I never said we had not so much as this in the house that day - I do not remember saying so; I did not say we wanted some of it.</p>

I was watching the premises; I had seen the prisoner in the evening, and about ten o'clock, when we were near the premises, we heard a whistle - I heard something fall heavy from the fence; I went and saw the prisoner come from the fence - he ran about thirty yards, and we took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him come over the fence? A. I heard him jump from the fence, and saw him on the bank under the fence.</p>

I stood still, and saw the prisoner come over the pales with a can in his hand - he ran into a tile-shed - he dropped the can, and I fell over it - he had dropped one can when I saw him come over the pales.</p>

I should think five or six feet - it was light enough at that place, but he ran down into a tile-shed, which was dark - he made his escape then, and was taken by another officer the next morning - I had known him before, and I knew his house - I was waiting round his house all night, to see if he came in or out, but he did not - I never had any quarrel with him - I remember the Saturday night previous to this - I was on duty the whole night, but I did not go into any beer-shop.</p>

I heard a rattle spring, and saw Stevens come over the wall of No. 1, Devonshire-street, with this pair of shoes in his hand; he put them on the ground and put them on his feet: I caught him in my arms as he came on the ground, and asked what he did over there - he denied having been over, but I saw him come over; I took him to the station, returned, and found a cloak and centre-bit on the premises No. 6 - and these keys where Wright was taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say hit or kick? A. Both; I was so frightened, I thought the place would fall in; they appeared up in arms together; she was screaming and begging for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any sounds proceeding from blows? A. Yes; I should think he was hitting her, or she would not scream like that; I heard her get out into the passage, and begged my husband to get up and get a Policeman; I heard her say in the passage "You b - y w - 's son, you had better come out, and finish me; and murder me, as you did your first wife, and honest little girl;" upon which Sullivan said, "Did I;" I do not know whether he hit her or not, but her screams were then dreadful; she then ran down as if the stairs would fall from under her: she screamed violently at the foot of the stairs, and I saw no more of her till the following day, after dinner - she then complained of being ill - I went into their room about halfpast ten o'clock on Sunday morning, and perceived a good deal of blood about the floor - I saw none about the wall; the deceased was not there then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you known her long? A. Several years; at times both the prisoner and her used to get very tipsy - I did not see her on the night in question; I only knew her voice - she did not fall down the stairs - for I heard her run down every stair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, on a subsequent day, carry her bedstead and bedding to Sheehy's house? A. I did not see her.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did Sullivan run down stairs after her? A. I think so, but cannot be certain; when she got to the foot of the stairs she screamed dreadfully - there never was a more quiet man than the prisoner, when sober; he was kind and affectionate.</p>

             - I live at No. 1, Union-yard, on the first floor; Sullivan and his wife came in to my lodging between one and two o'clock - he came first, and his wife about five minutes after; they were both the worse for liquor - but he appeared the most sober; they got their living by selling things in the street - they appeared comfortable for some time, and then she seemed to say he had gone into his sister's house, and spent the money there; he said he had not - she used very bad language - called him a wh - 's son, and said he went into his sister's house and spent the money they wanted at home - he did not answer her much, but said he would not live with her any longer; she said he need not live with her, while he could go and live with his sister, as he had done before - we then saw it was jealousy; he stood up and struck her with his open hand on both sides of the head - he hit her two blows, and her tooth went into her lip; she held her head down, and let the blood drop from her upon the floor - she was sitting on a market sieve; she crawled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050060"/>under the bed, to get out of his sight, and I told him she was gone home; I told him to stop a moment and sit down - he then sat on the sieve, and laid his hand on one of her legs; he then pulled her from under the bed -I came up, took her leg out of his hands, and made her set on the sieve; he did nothing to her - he did not kick her at any time; my husband then jumped out of bed, dressed himself, and took him away with him to have something to drink, to get him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state, that from the time he pulled her from under the bed, till he went away with your husband, he did not strike or kick her? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she call murder? A. She hallooed murder, and every thing which come to her mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she call murder about? A. She did not halloo murder - I took no particular notice of it, if she did; I heard her say nothing about his hitting or kicking her - she did not leave the room while the prisoner was there, nor go down stairs till she went with me; Carter sleeps in the next room - there is a small thin partition between them, and we can hear what passes in their room; my husband took the prisoner away - but he was doing nothing to the woman; we wished to have our place clear - after my husband and the prisoner were gone, the deceased went and sat on my stairs, and began to cry; I said, "Mary, don't kick up a row at this time of night - the neighbours will think it is me; but let us go out and meet him, and you can both go home together;" we went into Broad-street, and met the prisoner coming out of an eating-house - this was about four o'clock in the morning; she said she would not speak to him, nor see him: she wished me good night, and went along home; she lived in the Old Bailey - on the Sunday morning, she came to me about twelve o'clock; I gave her permission to move her things to my place till she could get a place of her own - she took a place in Milford-place, Tottenham-court-road, and moved her things there herself on the Monday; and on the following Friday she was taken ill, and sent for me - when I got there, she could not speak, but she made signs of having a pain in her chest; I afterwards saw her at St. Pancras workhouse, dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What furniture did she bring to your place? A. Two beds, a table, chair, bed-clothes, and two kettles - she brought a bedstead on the Tuesday; they were very weighty, and as much as a man could carry - she was quite exhausted; she had been unwell last winter, and complained of a complaint in her said - she had been troubled with a liver and a bowel complaint; I have known the prisoner three years - he was the most affectionate husband I ever knew; if ever he had a sixpence, he always brought it her - she called his sister a wh-e, and told him to go and spend his money among his wh - es; I do not recollect her falling in the room.</p>
               <p>MORGAN SHEEHY. The prisoner came to my house, as near as I can guess, between twelve and one o'clock, on Saturday night; I was sitting up in bed with my two children - the deceased came in about four or five minutes after the prisoner; they seemed quite peaceable at first, but afterwards great words occurred from her, saying that he spent his money at his sisters - she began the words; she sat by the side of my bed, on a sieve - he got up, and gave her two slaps on both sides of the head; I cannot say whether his hand was open or shut - I did not see any blood at that time, but I did soon afterwards; after receiving the slaps she turned herself off her seat, and got under the bed- the prisoner sat on the other side by the fire; he was not drunk, but had had something - he knew what he was doing; she was worse than him - he moved from where he sat, and saw her under the bed, he got up, and pulled her out by the leg.</p>
               <p>Q. After she crawled under the bed, had she said or done any thing to him? A. I never heard her speak a word- when he pulled her out, my wife ran between them; I jumped out of bed, and cannot say what my wife did, but I pulled him on the bed - I did not see him give her any blow nor kicks; I saw nothing but the two slaps - she was crying out, but I cannot say what she screamed, if I was to die this moment; I heard no cry of Murder! nor a word about his hitting or kicking her - she did not leave the room at any time; there were no cries of Murder! in the passage - I cannot hear in my room what passes in Carter's; the rooms are separated by thin boards - I saw the deceased spit blood as she sat on the sieve near my bed, but cannot say whether it was before or after he drew her from under the bed, as she sat on the sieve again when my wife separated them; she called him names, and used shameful language about his sleeping with his sister - I cannot say whether that was before or after he pulled her from under the bed; I left the room with the prisoner, leaving the deceased and my wife there; this was about half-past two o'clock - I went to Broad-street, St. Giles', with the prisoner; he lived somewhere in the City.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been long in bed before they came to your room? A. Three or four minutes; it was the deceased that used the provoking language - I heard the prisoner use none, except about his leaving her; he appeared desirous of being peaceable and kind to her- they always seemed very comfortable together.</p>

            . I live at No. 19, Pancras-street, Tottenham-court-road, I was called in to nurse the deceased on Friday, the 11th of May, at her lodgings, in Milford-place; she was laying in the corner of the room, in a very bad state - there was a lump on her left side, near the hip; it did not appear very black - it was swollen about the size of an egg; she said she was a gone woman on the Friday evening, when I went - she asked me on Saturday to go to the workhouse for a doctor, and said she never should recover, she thought she should die.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you judge from her conversation, that she expected to die almost immediately? A. Yes, she said so twice; she was removed to St. Pancras workhouse on the Monday following - I did not attend her afterwards; I saw her dead on the Thursday following - I saw her on the Sunday at her lodgings, about one o'clock; she was worse then than on Saturday, and said if I had got her into the workhouse on the Saturday, she should not have been alive then, and she never should recover, and I thought that probable; she was considerably worse than on Friday.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On the 14th of May, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the deceased at the infirmary of St. Pancras workhouse; she was exceedingly ill - I thought her not very far removed from death; she told me she was done for - she said, "You<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050061"/>cannot do much for me, ease my pain if you can, I am done for;" she said the pain was in her bowels - I placed my hand on her bowels, and she said she was in very acute pain - I have not a doubt she was suffering from inflammation of the bowels; her pulse was very low - she told me she had received a blow in her belly from a man's shoe; she did not say who the man was - I examined her after death, but there was no external mark on the abdomen.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she be seriously injured by a blow or kick in the belly, without the appearance of external injury? A. I think undoubtedly she might; she died the next day, and I opened her body; I found very extensive inflammation of the pertoneal cord of the bowels - the liver presented an appearance of long standing disease; it had evidently been affected by chronic inflammation - there was a collection of serum in the abdomen, and an enlargement of the uteras; some degree of inflammation on the pertorneal coat of the uteras, and a tumor in the womb, about the size of a large orange - it was a chronic disease of the uteras, which I think would predispose the subject to inflammation, which would undoubtedly be excited by external injury; I attribute her death to inflammation of the bowels- I cannot say how it was produced; a kick in the belly might create the inflammation; it depends entirely on the degree of force - it might have arisen from many other causes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you form any judgment how long the inflammation had continued? A. I should think it must have existed a week or more - it is very uncertain; I should think inflammation might have arisen from a blow which caused the lump Donoghue describes.</p>
               <p>ELLEN DONOGHUE. On the Sunday after she told me that if she had been in the workhouse she should have been dead, she laid in the corner of the room; I said, "Mary, you had better let me put you on the bed, and let your son lay on that bed;" I lifted her up - she screamed out, and said I had laid her on her side; I asked her to let me see her side, which she did, and I saw the lump; I asked what had caused it; she said at the time Sullivan pulled her from under the bed, he gave her a kick, and that was the cause of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you married? A. No, I live with my father - he maintains me; I never went by the name of Lake; I had known the deceased about three years, and knew the prisoner - I never quarrelled with him - I have no ill-will towards him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. EASTCOTT. Q. From the post mortem examination, I take it for granted there was considerable disease? A. There was chronic inflammation and acute inflammation - I cannot swear of what standing the acute inflammation was, but suppose it must be within ten days or a fortnight - I could swear it had existed less than a month; drinking ardent spirits would render her exceedingly susceptible of inflammation, and a slight injury would produce it - I saw no external mark of injury; if she had fallen against a projecting substance, in a state of intoxication, it might produce inflammation, particularly as the chronic inflammation existed before - I should expect if the external injury had been of a very violent nature, there would have been some contusion, but I do not think it absolutely necessary - the belly of all parts is the least likely to show inflammation; it might have been caused by a comparatively slight injury; kicks and blows generally leave marks; the tumor was on the middle of the belly - I saw no external tumor.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Is it possible that an external tumor should have existed on Friday, and you see no trace of it on Monday? A. I should think it quite impossible - there would have been some marks; I should think the tumor on the uteras was of three or four years standing - I think that predisposed her to inflammation.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then would a slighter injury produce fatal effects than if the body had been perfectly healthy? A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine with a view to find an external tumor? A. I looked at her body generally, but had received no information as to any tumor - I pointed out the body to Dr. Roots.</p>

            , ESQ., M. D. I live in Guildford-street. I went in accidentally to the dead-house, and saw body, which Mr. Eastcott pointed out - I watched the progress of the post mortem examination; there was a very active inflammation of the whole of the membrane, covering the bowels and the different viscera - there was a considerable effusion of watery fluid, mixed with flakes of lymph; the liver was obscured, and changed in its structure; what is called a nutmeg liver, which is very common with drunkards; the uteras was enlarged, and was just rising above the pelvis; it was about the size of a cricket-ball, or large orange - the external seat of the uterus was inflamed, and the kidney; I attribute her death to the inflammation covering the bowels and the whole of the viscera.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment would a kick in the belly from the shoe of a man, about a week before, be likely to produce the inflammation in the bowels? A. I conceive it possible; but having so frequently seen the same appearance arising without any injury, and not knowing of any injury at the time, I was perfectly satisfied her death took place from natural causes; a kick on the 6th of May would be very likely to produce the inflammation - I conceive she must have been suffering under inflammation for a long time, more particularly the part covering the uteras and liver - dram-drinking, or exposure to cold, is very likely to produce the same effect.</p>

             (Police-constable E 61.) I apprehended the prisoner on the 15th of May, at No. 18, Pancras-street - I told him his wife was laying dead at the hospital; he asked what I was going to do with him - I said he was going to Hatton-garden; he said he should be sure to go to Newgate, for he always thought he should be hung for it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 13th of June I was at Hackney, and saw the prisoner with a silver toothpick: I asked where he got it - he said he found it opposite the Black Boy, at seven o'clock in the morning - that is just opposite Fletcher's-row; he asked 6d. for it -I saw the ink-bottle sticking out of his trousers pocket; I took it out, and asked where he got it - he said he gave 2d. for it to a charity-school boy; I asked if he could produce the boy - he said Yes, but afterwards said he was gone into the country, hay-making; I asked if he had any thing else in his possession - he said No: I put my hand into his pocket, and found this brass cock - he said he found that on the 12th of June, in the back lane, Hackney- I found a mother-o'-pearl button in his pocket, which he said was given to him.</p>

Not while speaking to my brother, but he saw a roasting-jack on the other side of the room, and went to look at it - he asked if my father repaired such things; he went close against the bench where the watch was, and must have taken it then.</p>

No; I do not know whether she is near her confinement - she has told me she was in the family way; I do not know whether, when I told her she had killed the child, she said, "Oh, dear," or not - she said something; she pretended to be sorry, but whether she was I cannot say.</p>

             for what I knew; there may be more Harry Child's than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe that his name was Harry Child? A. I had my doubts.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for doubting it? A. This man (Harry Child) requested me to write a note to Mr. Throp - it is not directed to any particular place; it was left for him at the White Hart, in Farringdon-street, for a Mr. Throp: I never knew where he lived - I saw him in consequence of this note.</p>
               <p>Q. As whom did you see this man? A. As the man; I did not ask if his name was Throp - I did not know what his name was.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Is this the note you wrote? Yes -(read).</p>
               <p>"Mr. Rose wishes Mr. Throp to meet him at Mr. Lay's, at a quarter before twelve o'clock this morning, on the Commons and bail business, and wait there till you see him; without fail"</p>
               <p>"To Mr. John Throp - May 30, 1832."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now did you not believe his name to be Throp when you wrote to him in that name, and he appeared in that name? A. I never met with the man in my life; he did not come to me - I think the note says, "Farringdon-street;" I went to Lay's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inquire for Mr. Throp? A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when he appeared, did you not believe his name to be Throp, and not Harry Child? A. I did not know that this was the man; he never came in consequence of that letter.</p>
               <p>Q. What business on Commons and bail business had you but this? A. I forget; Mr. Lay keeps the White Hart public-house, where I sent the letter - I went there at a quarter before twelve o'clock, and inquired for a person of the name of Throp, but I did not see any person.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to write a letter to a man you knew nothing off, and had not seen, to meet you respecting the Commons and bail business? A. There was a gentleman wished me to call at Mr. Lays respecting bail; his name is Saunders - I do not know where he has moved to; I think he then lived in Symond's Inn; I also lived there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what occasion had you to go to Farringdon-street to meet him; you had no business in Farringdon-street, but for Mr. Saunder's? A. I will not be positive -Saunders is an attorney or an attorney's clerk: I have seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how Mr. Throp failed to come about the business in Commons and bail? A. I did not- I told Saunders I did not see him, not this man Throp; I went to meet Throp at Saunders' request.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me that this man (Child) desired you to send? A. I will not be certain whether I sent more than one note for a person of the name of Throp - I think this must be the note I sent to Lay's; I am not certain whether this is it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever write two notes to Lay for a person of the name of Throp? A. I cannot challenge my memory; Saunders has asked me if I knew any person that would bail a friend of his; he did not tell me his name, and I never inquired of him afterwards - I was not to meet Saunders at Lay's - the note was sent on Child's account more than Saunders'; Child did not want me to find bail for any friend of his - I cannot swear whether I saw Throp the next day; it might have been the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me that you did not know the name of Throp till after the 6th of June - when did you see him next after the 30th of May? A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not believe his name to be Throp when he went to make the deposition? A. I will not be certain, my Lord; you might direct a letter to a person in that name, without his being of that name; he might have gone in that name - I did not expect that to be his name; I thought he might have gone in other names.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, in what name did you think he might go, had he not, on the 6th of June, come to you in consequence of the letter you addressed to Throp? A. He came to me on account of my writing in that name -I could not tell what his name might be; I thought that Harry Child had that name directed on it there, for another person to call for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you wrote this name by direction of Child? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you believe the man's name to be Throp that you wrote the letter to? A. Yes, but I thought another man might call for it.</p>
               <p>Q. I rather think he was to be a witness for you in the Ecclesiastical Court? A. Not without Child's consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent that he should go and swear his name was Child? A. I had no alternative.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD to MR. ROBERTS. Q. It appears, by the proceeding, that this deposition is dated on the 6th of June? A. Yes, but he was sworn on the 4th of June before the surrogate, and again on the 6th, and he stated his name to be Harry Child.</p>

On the 19th of June I returned from a journey, about two o'clock in the morning - I put my horse into the stable, took off the harness, and went into the house; I went up stairs, and pulled off my coat and waistcoat; I then heard a cart come along; I looked out at the side door, and saw Hedge go along with a horse and cart - I thought he had no business that way, and I put on my jacket, and went out at the back gate; I followed the cart about forty yards behind it - I then saw the two prisoners go into the stack-yard; they turned the cart round, and began to load it - there was one field on the farm which had been reserved by Mr. Brewster when he parted with the farm to Mr. Richards - they began to load with the hay which had been cut from the stack which came from that field, and which had been cut from the stack in the afternoon, and put into the shed - it was Mr. Brewater's hay; I then looked over the hedge and saw Gobey in the cart, loading the hay; I knew he had been employed in cutting hay for Mr. Brewster -Hedge was giving up the hay to Gobey from the shed; I watched them for four or five minutes; I then went and locked the lane gate, and then the other gate, so that they could not get out of the lane - I then called up some of our people; we went through our yard again, and still saw them loading - we waited till they were loaded, and ready to start; we then went down the lane, and Hedge came out with the cart, about twenty yards from the gate into the lane; as soon as he saw us he turned to the hind part of his cart, and one of our people collared him - I made up to Gobey, who ran towards a pond; I then called to another person to stop him; when he heard that, he turned back towards me, and I collared him - I asked what business he had there; he gave me no answer, that I recollect - there were eighteen trusses of hay in the cart, and a little bit.</p>

I had a farm at East-end, which I parted with at Michaelmas last to Mr. Richards, but reserved one field for the purpose of stacking hay - I had three stacks there, and part of another; I had sold it to Mr. Chaplin; I was doubtful whether there was enough in my stacks to furnish him, if not, I must have got ten trusses from another stack - I had particularly explained to Gobey, three days before, that it had been contracted for by Mr. Chaplin; I understood he had cut some of it, but I had not ordered him to do it, as I had lost so much that I ordered none to be cut, till just before it was to be delivered - I certainly was not aware of his going to take hay at two o'clock in the morning - I had no business with Hedge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Did you know Hedge? A. Yes, I knew his person, but I never had any transaction with him; I have sold some things to his father-in-law, who keeps a shop - Gobey had never sold hay for me, nor had authority to sell it; he was not in the habit of being on my premises so early as two o'clock in the morning - there were several quantities of hay in that place, but no other stack cut; if they had cut another stack I should have seen it - I did not say before the Magistrate that Gobey had been commissioned to receive money for me, and to the best of my knowledge he never did receive any.</p>

I worked for Mr. Brewster five years ago; I used to bind hay one day, and bring it to town the next day - he allowed me to sell it if I could get a good price, and likewise the salesman, Mr. Gardner; I sometimes took the money to him, and sometimes to Mr. Brewster, when he has told me to have my load ready by six o'clock in the morning, I have gone at two o'clock to get ready.</p>
               <p>Hedge's Defence. I was coming from Barnet, and met one of Mr. Brewster's men; I asked him if his master had any hay to sell - he said he did not know; I then went to have a pint of beer, and saw Gobey - I asked if he had any hay to sell; he said he did not know, but he dared to say I might have half a load - I said I would pay Mr. Brewster the money; I went for it, and was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. BREWSTER. Gobey never had any authority from me to sell any hay; Hedge has bought wood for his father before - I distinctly told Gobey this hay was for Mr. Chaplin, and I was doubtful whether there was enough; I am not aware that Hedge deals in hay.</p>

On the 11th of June, the prisoner came in; I had known her for three years - she asked for a piece of calico, and while my young man turned his back to get it, I distinctly saw her steal two handkerchiefs from my counter, and put them in her cloak; she bought the calico, paid for it, and then walked out of the shop - she got about a quarter of a mile, into a lane; I pursued her with the officer -(I had suspected her before, and lay wait for her in the passage) I said to her, when we came up to her, "You have some handkerchiefs, I saw you take them" - she said she had not; the officer then took her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the officer present in the lane? A. Yes, I spread out the handker<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050067"/>chiefs on my counter, and counted them; they were laid there to see whether the prisoner was a thief or not - I had allowed her to take some things home for her sisters to look at, but they were entered in a book, and she used to return them - she did not say that she had taken these to show her sister; her family is respectable.</p>

On the 9th of June, between two and three o'clock, I saw the prisoners near his house; I had seen the servant come out just before, and leave the key in the door - the prisoners walked past; Mills then went, turned the key, and pushed the door a little way open: he then walked away a short distance; Davis then walked in, and was there, I suppose, two minutes: Mills then went in, and they staid about two minutes more; they then came out with the desk and umbrella: I went and overtook them in Bulstrode-street; I asked Davis whose desk and umbrella these were: he was about tying the desk up: he said they were some gentleman's in St. James'-street, I took hold of his arm: he threw them out of his hand, and tried to get away; but I took him again, and brought him back - neither of them had any thing when they went into the house; Mills was taken next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. What are you? A. A carver and gilder; I was in a two pair of stair room when I saw the prisoners go into the prosecutor's house: neither of them had any thing when they entered the house, I am sure - it rained at the time; I lost sight of Mills then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they together in Bulstrode-street? Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SAUNDERSON. This desk is mine and this seal I can swear to; they were in my back parlour - I cannot swear to the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Mills' Defence. I know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Davis' Defence. I was going along, and a gentleman asked me to carry the desk, and said he would give me 1s. - I had before that one shilling and two penny pieces in my pocket; I stopped to tie the desk up, that it should not get wet, and this gentleman came and asked, whose it was; I said it was at Mr. Sams', and asked him to go with me to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you mean you gave him into custody on the Sunday morning? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. How many pots of beer had he? A. He drank one in my presence, and the man who came and spoke to him paid for a quartern of gin - I had seen that man once before; the prisoner was not there from nine o'clock till a quarter before twelve, at which time I left - he was not there at all, nor did he drink with the prosecutor while I was there; if he had been there I must have seen him - I had not left the house when the prosecutor was carried out; I lodge in that house, and have done so for fourteen months.</p>

I brought him back into Long-alley, with this parcel, which he had with him - the prosecutor was there, and said, "That is my parcel:" in the scuffle, the prisoner tore off the direction - the prosecutor said, "The direction is Elkington;" I took a part of it out of the prisoner's hand, and with that and the other part which was picked up, I can make out that name: the prisoner said a man was to give him 1s. to take it to Moore's-gardens - I opened the parcel and found the pork in it, with the money stated, and a note to send down again in a month's time.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Could this boy see me at the time? A. I did not see him open his eyes; I consider there was something the matter with his eyes - the watchman who brought the prisoner, is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard a cry of Stop thief! near Mitre-street, and I met a man running, who knocked me down; ten or twelve men then ran up the street, and while I was on the ground, the prosecutor gave me in charge - it was half-past eleven o'clock at night.</p>

            . I am clerk to Sir Richard Carr Glyn and others, and am employed in the country-office; it is my duty to superintend all payments for country correspondents. On the 21st of June we received a letter from Lovell, and Co., bankers of Birmingham, in consequence of which, Mr. Feltham filled up a cheque, and handed to me - this is it (looking at it) - I know his handwriting; on the 22nd of June, a person applied for that cheque, in the name of Allen; it was in the morning, and I should say before two o'clock - when we receive letters to pay money to a particular person, Feltham draws a cheque, corresponding with the order, and gives it to me to deliver to the party to whom the money is to be paid, and that party signs it; it then requires my initials on it, as an authority to the cashier to pay it, and on the 22nd, it was presented to me - I put my initials on it; it was about four o'clock, to the best of my knowledge, because I was preparing for the clearing at the time - I cannot say whether when I put my initials on it, it was in the same condition as it is now, as I did it in the usual course of business; the cheque was brought to me again about a quarter to five o'clock, by Thomas, the cashier.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you recollect who presented the cheque for your initials? A. I do not - I have not the least recollection of the prisoner's person; I cannot say whether the 6l. was altered to 60l. at the time it was presented to me - it might have been altered before it got into the prisoner's hands for what I know; it was brought back to me full three-quarters of an hour after I put my initials on it - I should call this figure a bad six.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might any person present it for your initials? A. I gave it to

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any knowledge of who presented it to be initialled? A. I have not, nor whether it was altered then; I have nothing to do with that department.</p>

            . I am cashier at Messrs. Glyns', and attended at the counter. On the 22nd of June, about ten minutes to five o'clock, the prisoner presented this cheque to me for payment, drawn for 60l. 3s.; I asked how he would have it - he said three 20l. notes; I cancelled the signature, and on looking at it again, it struck me the letters ty. had been added - I then took it to Mr. Pargiter, in the country office, then returned to the prisoner, and told him he must go with me to Mr. Butcher, the solicitor to the bankers; but before that I asked him how he became possessed of the cheque - he said a person at the Post-office had given it to him to present for payment; that the person was a stranger - I then went with him to the solicitor's office, in St. Mildred's-court, and from there to the Post-office; I saw a City Policeman, and desired him to follow us - I followed the prisoner into the Post-office, and the officer afterwards; the prisoner could not recognize any person there, as having given him the cheque- I returned with him to the solicitor's, and gave him into custody; on Mr. Butcher asking him at what time he received the cheque, he said, "About half-past two o'clock"- that was on our return from the Post-office; he was asked where be lived, and I think he said he was in the Chartered Gas Company's service, at Westminster.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many clerks initial cheques? A. Two are regularly employed to do it, but in their absence, others do so; four o'clock is about the busiest time with us - I left the prisoner alone at the counter, while I went to Pargiter, but had my eyes on him now and then; there were other clerks there - there was a glass door between us; the Policeman was in uniform - I think he kept ten or twenty yards behind the prisoner; I think a person waiting there, might see the Policeman.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is it your custom, if there is any thing objectionable in a cheque, to state it before you cancel it? A. Yes, if we discover it; the prisoner could see me cancel it - I did not express any doubt to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you perceive any body make any haste from the Post-office when you went? A. Not any; the prisoner looked round, and said he could not see the person who gave it to him - a person might have gone off without my seeing him.</p>

            . I am a City Policeman. I took the prisoner into custody at the Mansion-house about twenty minutes past five o'clock - I found nothing on him but this cover of a book - I asked where he got the cheque; he said a man against the New Post-office gave it to him in that book-cover, and asked him to go to Glyn's and get it cashed, and he would give him a sovereign for his trouble; that he told the man he would return in an hour - he said he received the cheque from half-past two o'clock, to a little before three; I said,"Why, you have been a long time - it is a good deal more than an hour; why have you not returned?" he said because he had been into Wood-street, Milk-street, and various streets in Cheapside, seeking for a situation at different warehouses - I said, perhaps he could tell me some of the names or the numbers of the houses where he went; he said he could not recollect them - I asked if I went with him whether he could show me any person he had inquired of that afternoon for a situation; he hesitated, and said he did not think he could, and he thought he had given me quite satisfaction enough - I said, "If you do not give me more I must lock you up;" he said, "Well, I cannot help it, you must then" - he said he had had the cheque in his possession from half-past two or three o'clock till he was apprehended, and it had not been out of his possession at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Do you know where he lived? A. I asked if he had been at work lately - he said he had, at the Gas-works, in the Horseferry-road - I found no money on him.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. He said he worked at the Gasworks? A. Yes, that was true - I think he said, he had not been at work for a day or two, as the work was so laborious he wanted to get something else.</p>

            . I am time and gatekeeper at the Westminster gas-works. The prisoner was in the company's employ up to the 22nd of June, but was absent on the 18th, 19th, and 20th; without leave, he would not receive pay for that time - he was at work on the 21st, and half a day on the 22nd.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was absent for three days before the Birmingham letter is dated? A. Yes - he has worked for us one or two years; he had a bad hand a week or a fortnight before this: he worked a full week before the three days' absence - his hand might have got worse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I feel convinced you will plainly see I have been led innocently into this; I had not the slightest knowledge the cheque was bad; having a wife and two children, I was anxious to procure a situation of about 20s. a week, having but 15s. at the gas-works - I was looking for a situation, when a gentleman accosted me at the Post-office, and asked me to take the cheque, and bring him three 20l. notes for it, and he would give me a sovereign; I said I was looking for a situation, that I would make inquiries as I went along, and return in an hour; I admit a sovereign was a large sum, but I suppose it was thought I should go directly, before the fraud was discovered.</p>

The prisoner was in his employ from sixteen to twenty years; if he got any wood of any tradesman, he was to give my father an account of it, either at the time, or on the Saturday afterwards, at the farthest; Mr. Sykes, a timber-merchant, gave us in an account after the prisoner had been taken, which is about a fortnight ago; there were some veneers in the account, of which the prisoner had given us no invoice.</p>
               <p>RICHARD LOADER. I was out of town at the time the prisoner had this timber - he never delivered any invoice to me; I paid him his wages weekly - if he got goods of any tradesman, he was to give an account immediately, or at latest on the Saturday following; he was taken up some time in June - he heard the charge made against him; I made him no promise, but he said, "I stand as a felon before you. I hope you don't mean to hurt me;" I searched his father-in-law's house, and found some mahogany veneers, and some table-tops.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Has your son any concern in your business? A. No Sir; I had not had any conversation with the prisoner about assisting him to set up in business - I did not allow him to get goods of the persons who supplied me; the timber in question was never brought into my possession - I never saw it, nor the veneers, either to my knowledge; we have no materials on our premises - I can swear that the wood in this invoice has not been manufactured into articles, and brought to my premises; for nothing has come in there for some months - I cannot tell what had been worked up for three months; I did not return to town till the latter end of May.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. As he was an old servant, has he ever got wood and worked it up for you, and afterwards acquainted you with it? A. He generally used to say,"I want such and such articles" - I do not know whether he ever got any without saying that.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. To your knowledge have any articles made of this wood been brought in by the prisoner? A. Never - and he never gave me any invoice of this timber.</p>

             re-examined. Q. During your father's absence did the prisoner ever bring you any articles made out of Mr. Sykes' timber? A. Not of this timber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Can you swear to timber, you have not seen? A. No - he has not brought any work in since he received this timber; it could not come in without my knowledge - I am always in the house; he may have brought in articles in my absence, but if he had I should have seen them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he give you any reason for not bringing in the articles? A. Yes - he said Mr. Sykes had not got the wood.</p>
               <p>MR. SYKES. I am a timber-merchant. I have supplied the prosecutor; I supplied the prisoner with some wood in March, for Mr. Loader - I gave him the invoice at the time the goods were sold; since the prisoner left his service, Mr. Loader applied to me for his account - I furnished the prisoner with mahogany and veneers on the 8th of March, 14th of March, 28th of April, and 17th of May, for which I debited the prosecutor; I saw some veneers at Hatton-garden, but they are not what I supplied to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You served the prisoner with veneers and other things? Yes; I do not know that he ever had articles from me on his own account - I was most likely in the yard when these goods were furnished to him; I did not deliver them myself - some of these might be deliverd by my servants; this bill is only a copy from my ledger: I speak to the fact by refreshing my memory by my books, which I keep myself - I suppose the entry was made on the day the goods were furnished.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you deliver the goods to the prisoner? A. I am pretty confident he took some of them; he generally took some away with him at the time of making the purchase - he always bargained, and sometimes took the goods and sometimes sent a man; sometimes we sent them: I am sure he bargained for all the goods stated in this invoice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you state that you were present on the 8th of March, when the veneers were delivered? A. I cannot state that: I have no doubt they were sold to him; I cannot recollect that he bargained about any veneers about that time - he has come and bespoken wood on one day, and taken it away on another; I can speak positively to his bargaining with me on all the dates in this invoice; I suppose I was in the way: I must have been in the way, or he could not have bargained - I can speak positively to all of them; I believe I was present when they were taken from the yard: I can swear they were taken from the yard by the prisoner, or by his servant - I cannot take upon myself to state that I delivered any of them to him.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my father's service - a person named Hoar used to supply us with goods; the prisoner furnished us with an invoice of the goods stated in this indictment, two or three days after the date, but he never brought the goods to the premises - I asked him about some tables which ought to have been made of Mr. Hoar's wood, and he said they were not quite finished, because he was waiting for some goods from Mr. Sykes' - he never delivered any invoice of two double-table catches and two screws, and I was not aware of his having them: they ought to have been in the tables made of Mr. Hoar's wood, and they never came in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the invoice of the articles, furnished by Mr. Hoar, was given to you? A. Yes; the prisoner had permission to procure materials, and manufacture goods on our account only, but he did not manufacture these articles; if he had wanted a few articles from the ironmonger's, he would have gone for them, but they would have been entered in the ironmonger's book; they were entered in the ironmonger's book, but not in ours - he might have got those things without telling us, but he ought to have come for our book and had them entered; it has happened perhaps half a dozen times, that he has got goods and not taken our book, or told us of it, but we have reprimanded him for it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you go? A. Near ten o'clock at night - a person passing by the premises could not see them; I saw them by the light of a candle; the skins have the marks on them - there is one house to the left on entering his premises, and one on the right - there are a number of houses about it; the rails on which the skins hung, might be seen from some of the houses in the day time - they hung with the flesh side outwards.</p>

I purchased some one year old South-down wether tegs in April, and gave them to the care of my shepherd; they were not fit to kill - they were poor tegs; the prisoner's house is nearly seven miles from my farm - sheep can be driven two miles or two miles and a half in an hour - I saw the skins, and firmly believe they are the skins of my sheep; these are them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Did you ever deal with ticket butchers? A. No; I know there are such persons - I bought these sheep to fatten; they are not mutton till they are two years old - this mark might have been cut off, but it goes down to the skin.</p>

On the 10th of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, I was standing at my own door, and saw three persons standing in front of a flock of fifty or sixty sheep - I thought I knew the prisoner to be one of them by his jacket, and when he made a snatch at one of the sheep it ran towards me, and then I was confident it was him - there are not many houses about the place; I suppose about fifty - I then went into my house; I gave the same evidence on the last trial before the Judge.(See page 623).</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you not then say your house was opposite? A. No; it is between forty and fifty yards from it - I will swear it is not one hundred yards; I have had a surveyor to measure it - I was spoken to to come as a witness last Wednesday - I had not said any thing about it before; I heard of the prisoner's being taken on the 11th of May, but I did not mention this; I should have gone to Hicks'-hall, but I did not think it was so serious a charge - I did not hear that the prisoner was in gaol for stealing sheep till last week, when I saw it in the newspaper; I heard, in the course of a week after, that he was in gaol for buying stolen sheep, but I did not mention it till last week to Mr. McDuff - I went to him voluntarily; I had no communication from any one.</p>

             (Police-constable K 222). I was told that morning that three suspicious persons were gone down Three Colt-lane - I followed, and saw the prisoner and two others; the prisoner had this bundle in his hand: he threw it down and ran; I took him - he was close by the prosecutor's garden wall when I took him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met two lads, who asked where I was going - I said birds'-nesting; they asked me to wait, and they would go with me - I waited, and the officer took me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was you not going out of the house when your friend called you back? A. Yes; but there were two or three men cleaning my friend's coat, and I thought you belonged to them - I asked you to drink; I had seen the watch in the prosecutor's pocket before.</p>

I was at Somers'-town on the 5th of June, and saw the prisoner put his right hand within his waistcoat - I went and asked what he had got; he said a pair of shoes he brought from home - I said, "Are you sure of that?" he said, Yes; I said, "You must go and prove it" - I took him to the station, and went to his mother's and asked if she had lost a pair of shoes; she said Yes - I asked her to describe them, and she described another pair; I afterwards found the prosecutor.</p>

Bank note from Serjeant Brooks' to get change -I went to Mr. Pitt's, but he had not the sort of change I wanted; the note was then given to the prisoner to get change at the next house, Mr. Morrison's, a baker: he went there, returned, and said he could not get it there, but they had referred him to a place at the top of the street, where by making use of their name, he might get it - I believe he mentioned the person's name, and said he could have as much change as he liked; Mr. Pitt sent him there to get it, and he never returned - this was on a Wednesday, and on the Saturday afterwards I saw him in custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you remember what I said when I came back? A. Yes - nothing was said about leaving the note and calling again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any authority given him to leave that note in pessession of any other person? A. No; I waited ten minutes, and then I left word with Mr. Pitt, that if he came he was to leave word at the barracks gate, as I had to attend parade - I went afterwards to Mr. Pitt, and found he had not returned.</p>

            . I live with my father, John Morrison, in Castle-street, Leicester-square, next door to Mr. Pitt. On the 30th of May such a man as the prisoner came for change for a note - I cannot be positive that he was the person; I said I could not give change, but I did not direct him to go any where for change - I was there the whole of that day, and saw but one man come for change.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DISMORE. As I was taking the prisoner to the station, he said he should not attempt to deny it; and when before the Magistrate he said he had received the note from Mr. Pitt, and had met some person to whom he owed some money, who had threatened that if he did not pay them they would hand him over to the Police, and not knowing what to do, he had absconded with the remainder of the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Pitt stated before the Magistrate that I had offered to leave the note, and I considered that a superior point in my favour; as to my making the statement the officer represents, I deny it altogether - I know I received it, but without any intention to steal; I met a man to whom I owed a sum of money, for which he demanded payment; I requested him to take a part of the money, which he did, but I told Mr. Pitt that there was a person or two coming from Manchester who would be of service to me, and I should he able to repay it - after I had paid the money I went to Knightsbridge, feeling conscious that I should be able to make up the money on Sunday.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. PITT. Q. When the prisoner came from Morrison did he return the note? A. Yes; he put it on the counter, and said Miss Morrison could not change it, but he might use their name at the hotel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I might possibly do it by making use of their names? A. No; you said if you made use of their names you could get it, and I woundered why my name was not as good as their's.</p>

Bank of England notes, in the same mutilated state in which I cut it out of a hammock belonging to my brother, who died in the West Indies," and that the notes had been taken to the Bank and exchanged; he presented another share, at the same time, belonging to Bish.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the left-hand corner of this half-share, and tell me what number it is? A. E 2158; that is what is called a check number, put on by the lottery-office keeper, and is the only check we have - there never was so high a number put on a half-share in our office, not of that lottery, nor for many before; I have examined the books, and find the No. 2158, refers to a ticket which was drawn a blank - I am certain this ticket is a forgery, and that it is a madeshare of several pieces; the number of the share is 7839, and under the figure 7, on looking with a glass, I think their appears the round part of a 5 - there was a ticket of that letter, No. 7839, which was drawn a prize of 10l., and being the first drawn prize on the second day, was entitled to 20,000l. more; that was shared into a half, one-eighth, and two sixteenths, which shares were duly paid, about a month after the drawing, ten years ago - I sent for Mr. Durrant, who came in, and spoke to the prisoner, in my presence; I was also present the following day, when the prisoner came with what he termed a professional geteleman, and a third person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The prisoner not only came with a clerk from the Stamp-office, but brought you a glass to discover what the ticket was? A. He did.</p>
               <p>MR. DURRANT. On the 8th of June I received a message, and went to my office, and saw the prisoner - I looked at the paper, and said, "Who has been at work at this?" he said, "I don't know, it is as I received it," or "as I found it, in a hammock, which came from my brother, who died in the West Indies; he worked his passage out, and is supposed to have made property there - he died there, and all I have received from him was this hammock;" I observed that the thread the share was sewed together with, appeared newer than the share - he said he did not know, it was just as he received it; I asked what he did with the hammock - he said he had no occasion for it, and sold it; I asked to whom - he said, "I don't know," or "I cannot tell;" I said, "I will give you an opportunity of doing youself justice, you shall seal up the share, and bring any person you please to advise with you on it;" he sealed it with a key, and asked me at what time he should come again - it was agreed he should come between eleven and twelve o'clock the next day, which he did, with a person named Oakley, who demanded the share, which I refused; I agreed that it should be sealed again by a gentleman present, and that Bloice should write his name on it - I offered to go before a Magistrate with him, if he chose; he declined - he said he presented the share to know what it was, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050085"/>if there was any good belonging to it, that he might receive it; he and I met, with our attornies, afterwards at the Mansion-house, and I determined, under legal advice, to prefer this indictment; every share of the ticket has been paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you remember stating at the Mansion-house, that there was a great deal of hesitation in the prisoner's manner, when he spoke of its coming in a hammock, &amp; c.? A. There was some hesitation; I had not told him it was a prize - he never told me he should summon me to the Mansion-house; he went there by appointment of my solicitor-Mr. Hobler has told me I was not entitled to hold the ticket.</p>

            . I hold a situation in the Stamp-office, Somerset-house. On Monday, the 18th of June, the prisoner came to the office, to have two lottery-shares examined, which is in the course of my business - it was a half and one-sixteenth; I examined them attentively with a magnifying-glass, and said I thought that one was a prize; that I had doubts as to the number, but if it was the number, it was a prize of 20,010l. - he did not express so much surprise at this as I should have expected; I went with him to Hazard's office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. The numbers, I believe, are scarcely legible? A. Scarcely; our's is the proper office for persons to apply at respecting tickets - if it had been a whole ticket, I should have discovered the fraud; the prisoner brought the magnifying-glass with him - I told him the number was doubtful; the secretary came in while he was there - I showed it to him; I rather think the prisoner did not see me do that, as I was at my desk, and we were rather separated; I told the secretary that a most delapidated share had come in, and I thought it better to accompany the bearer to the office; the prisoner agreed to go with me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If it had not been paid, the holder could not have recovered any thing at your office? A. No, we only pay whole tickets.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say something about going to be hung? A.

            . I keep a public-house, in Somerset-street, Aldgate. The prisoner came to my house ten weeks or two months ago, and said he had been burying a corpse, and, among other things, he had a chest of drawers and two lottery-tickets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you a little hard of hearing? A. A little - the conversation was not with me, it was said in the tap-room; I paid no particular attention to it - there were nine or ten people there.</p>
               <p>MR. DURRANT. This apparent share is not as it was issued, it has another paper pasted on the back, and the paper is broken or torn, exactly in the same place as the share appears broken or torn - the thread appears newer than the paper; that, and more particularly the check number, induced me to suspect it was forged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. - I am a man in very humble circumstances of life, and I am quite incapable of committing the act charged on me; the evidence for the prosecution has diclosed to you that this lottery-ticket was in my possession - and I have much to regret<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050086"/>that I was led to make a mis-statement of the mode by which I had obtained it; it is quite true I fond it - I found it in an old flock mattress, which, with some few other triffing effects, I had received for burying their late owner, who was a cooper, employed at Chester-quay, and this can be proved to you - the reason I stated it was a relative of my own who had died, was to prevent any unnecessary inquiries, whereby any one could make a claim - or the representatives of the deceased (if any), could molest me; and solely to avoid litigation, that I was induced to represent the deceased as a relative of my own - it is this mis-statement which has caused the present inquiry, and I hope that when my witnesses have been heard, you will be satisfied I had no participation whatever in a fraud; and that I shall receive your verdict - for I most solemnly ever to you, I am innocent of the charge alleged against me; for whether it be or not a forgery, I am as ignorant of as any one of you whom I now address.</p>

            . I am nephew to Mr. Barber of Chester-quay - he had a man in his employ whom they called Will, the cooper; I have since as certained his name was Banks - he died in April, 1831; the prisoner was employed to bury him - I did not myself make any agreement with him: I sent him a message, in consequence of which, he possessed himself of Banks' furniture.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know of his having the furniture except from what you have been told by others? A. I was not present at the original bargain, but was afterwards - Day said he had a friend an undertaker; I wished him to enter into an agreement about it - I saw the prisoner myself afterwards; Banks lived somewhere near Ratcliffe - he had been in our service nearly nine years; be could read and write - he had 18s. a week at the time; we did not board nor lodge him; I never saw him with so much as 14l., nor with a lottery ticket.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What arrangement was made with the prisoner? A. That he should take the furniture and other trifling articles, and receive 30s. to bury the man decently.</p>

            . I lodge in Leman-row, Goodman's-fields. Banks lodged in my house; he worked for Mr. Barber, and died in April - he had some little furniture, which I delivered to the prisoner, who buried him; there was a mattress, and he had that.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had Banks lodged with you? A. Nearly two years - he brought the mattress with him; I heard nothing about a lottery-ticket being in it.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Harman, undertaker, Shoreditch - we furnish for Blois. In April, 1831, I took a coffin for Blois to Leman-street, Goodman's-fields, for Banks; I understood from Blois that he was to have the furniture - I heard from him, about ten months ago, of his finding two lottery-tickets; I have known him four years.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where has he been living during the four years you have known him? A. He lived in Little Somerset-street, Aldgate, part of the time; I was intimate with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he be four months in Whitecross-street prison for debt, within the last ten months, without your knowledge? A. He possibly might, or within three months - I think I was never more than a month without seeing him; I have not been so intimate with him till latterly; I will not say that I saw him in May.</p>

            . I live at Derby-row, Kingaland, and am an auctioneer. I saw these lottery-tickets in the prisoner's possession about nine months ago; he showed them to me, and asked what was to be done, to ascertain whether they were prizes or not; I told him the best way was to apply at Somerset-house - he told me how they came into his possession; I went with him to Somerset house, and was informed the books belonging to the Lottery-office were gone (I think to the Treasury-office), and in all probability it might be a fortnight, three weeks, a month, or two months, before they would be returned; I have not been to Somerset-house with him since - I met him six weeks or two months ago, and he asked when I would go again with him; I said at any time that was convenient to us both - I have not seen him since; I have known him seven or eight years - he bore a respectable character.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was nine or ten months ago that he showed you the ticket, did you then go with him to Somerset-house? A. It was on the road there he showed it to me - I did not examine them, and cannot say whether Hazard's name was on them; I do not know whether I saw him in May; when I saw him, about five weeks ago, he did not tell me he had just come out of Whitecross-street; I never heard it before - he did not tell me he found them in a hammock of his brother's, which came from the West Indies; I did not take them in my hands - I saw they were stitched with thread; I consider these are the same, from the state they are in - he read no part of them to me.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What did he tell you about finding them? A. he said be buried a young man, who was clerk to some respectable house, and that the master had given him the furniture and some trifle of money in payment, and on opening the mattress he discovered a paper parcel, containing these notes; I cannot pledge myself to his precise words - I was at the Mansion-house when he was committed.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you tell him it was his duty to go to his employer, and show him the papers? A. I did not.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and live in Three Crown-square, Southwark; I have known the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050087"/>about three years. About twelve months ago he showed me some lottery-tickets - these are the same; he explained how he came by them; I gave him advice what to do with them - I saw him while the ticket was at Durrant's; I had seen him between those times, but not particularly on that subject, but it was mentioned - on the 19th of June I accompanied him to Mr. Durrant's, who showed me the tickets; I recognized them as the same I had seen twelve months ago, and knowing the genuineness of the tickets - Mr. Durrant said one was forged; I said I differed with him in opinion, because I considered they were good, and at all events the prisoner had not forged them, giving him as a reason that I had seen them before; Mr. Durrant asked Bloice for what purpose he presented them - he said to know whether they were good, or something of that sort; I immediately demanded the money or tickets - they were rolled up and left at the office; Mr. Durrant offered to go before a Magistrate; I said I did not know that I should adopt that course, but I would take care proceedings should be taken to compel him to do what was right; I did not afterwards go with the prisoner to the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I will be obliged to you to fix, as near as you can, about what time you saw these tickets? A. About the latter end of May, or beginning of June; I had them in my hand - I merely saw the name of Hazard on one, and Biah on the other; I did not go to Hazard's; he did not state how he came by them at Durrant's, in my presence - Mr. Durrant told me he had said he found them in his brother's hammock - Bloice was there, talking to somebody; I do not suppose he heard that; I was surprised, and I think I told Mr. Durrant that was not the correct story - I have been Bloice's attorney about three years; he is a carpenter, and worked for us - I had a suit pending for him in May last, and which is still pending; he was at my office repeatedly about that period; I cannot be certain to the month of May, it might be May or June - I saw him about that period; I am speaking of last year - I do not think I saw him last May, and do not know where he was; I had seen him about three months before the 19th of June - the law-suit is still pending, but I had no occasion to see him - he was very poor; he never told me he had come out of Whitecross-street on the 25th of May, this is the first I have heard of it - I had no affairs to settle for him there; the tickets were exactly in the state they are now - I observed no difference in the colour of the thread and the paper; I looked at that particularly at Hazard's - I cannot form an opinion on the subject - the thread does appear whiter and newer than the paper - I advised the prisoner to go to Somerset-house when he passed that way, and not to go to the office; I do not know of his having a brother in the West Indies.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Your acquaintance began by employing him as a carpenter? A. No, he employed me first.</p>

I did; I think it was about the middle of May - I did not see the name of Hazard on them; he was on one side of his work-bench - he merely took out his pocket-book, and said, "These are what I have taken from an old mattress;" he did not ask me to go with him to the lottery-office - I am sure this was not in March; he had his pocket-book in his hand, and they were laying in the book - I saw them, but cannot say whether they were in the pocket of the book or not; I saw there were two of them; they appeared to lay flat, and to be very old - I said, "They appear to be like old country Bank notes, and I would advise you to look after them;" he told me something about a funeral the latter end of April, and in May he first spoke about the tickets.</p>

            " to this deposition is not my writing - I did not swear to this deposition - (looking at a note), with the exception of "Sunday, 1831, and 9 tomorrow, Mr. Rose;" this is in the hand-writing of the prisoner - he gave it to me before the 6th of June; he handed it to me with a statement, requesting me to attend before the Proctor in the Ecclesiastical Court, and swear to the contents, agreeable to that paper - I knew his hand-writing well - (read).</p>
               <p>"I saw Mrs. S. Lewis in St. Martin's-lane, near St. Martin's church, Charing-cross, on Sunday morning, the 25th of September, 1831, just before church-service; I knew her by seeing her two or three times at Mr. Rose's, Symond's Inn - I said,"You are in a hurry, Mrs. Lewis; "she said she was going to see her niece married - I asked who to; she said to Mr. Rose, but she was fearful she should be too late - I returned with her, and we both went in at the great entrance; Mr. and Mrs. Rose were then being married - Mrs. Lewis said she would not go up to the altar, as she was too late; I think the ceremony was over in about five minutes - Mrs. Lewis is about forty or fifty, of middling stature, and thin, dark, and pale; I do not know her further than seeing her frequently at Rose's, in Symond's Inn."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of these circumstances? A. No, and I did not swear to them; I informed Mr. Knight's proctor of what was going on - this letter is in the prisoner's handwriting - (this was the letter produced on the trial of Throp;) before the 6th of June the prisoner stated to me that he had procured a d-d good fellow to go in and win, and it had cost him 4l.</p>
               <p>Q. To go in where? A. In the cause of Rose against Knight, and he said, "When the thing is over we will have a d-d good tuck out," by which I understood a dinner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How do you get your living? A. By doing what I can;" I am an accountant - I am employed by many persons in difficulties, and think it improper to mention their names; I now live at No. 130, Holborn - I do not keep the house: I have an apartment, but there are so many rooms in it, I cannot say whether it is on the first, second, or third floor - I have been there five or six weeks; I may have slept on the first, second, or third floor - the person who keeps the house is in the Fleet prison; his name is Norris - I am perfoming some business for him, and the rent is a set off; I was to pay 7s. a week, and have the range of the house - I do not know on what floor I sleep; if you were in the house, you could not find you way out of it - it would puzzle you to say what floor it is; it is one of the oldest houses in London, and is curiously built - I will say it is the second floor; I was very intimate with the prisoner - I know Mrs. Rose, who lives in Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury; I was not present at their marriage, which I understand was in 1815 or 1816 - she lived with the prisoner till within these twelve months.</p>

               <p>Q. The suit against Knight was for defaming the character of Rose's wife? A. Not of his wife, but of a female representing herself as Mrs. Rose; not the Mrs. Rose I mentioned - I never spoke to the female in question, in my life - I am personally acquainted with Mrs. Rose - I never justified bail in my life, or proposed myself, or provided other persons for bail; I had a conversation with the prisoner before he gave me the paper - he requested me to go with him to Mrs. Lewis, the mother of the person he represented as his wife - I did so, and she was out; he then requested me to go next morning to St. Martin's church, to swear to the particular situation of the church, and to see Mrs. Lewis, to identify her if she should be brought before me; I did not go to the church - I went to Mrs. Lewis' house, somewhere at the back of Queen-street, Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention to you his object? A. He did; he said he meant to fix Mr. Knight and ruin him - I immediately furnished the party with the information; this conversation was before I went to Strond, which was on the 23rd of June: the first conversation with him was at the commencement of the suit, about sixteen months ago - I returned from Stroud on the Sunday after the 23rd, and I think on a Monday I furnished Mr. Robart's with that document; my first conversation with him was many months before that - he then wanted this deposition made: I did not see Mr. Knight before I made the communication to Mr. Robart's, nor any person from him - I considered it my duty, as an honest man, to give information; I had no other motive: I was never accused of forgery or fraud - I was in custody for one night on a charge of felony; it was decided the following morning by the Magistrate: I have been accused of many things, and been many nights in custody.</p>

            . I am in the employ of a wharfinger, at Stone-stairs wharf, Ratcliff. On the 8th of April, 1831, the prisoner came to my master's wharf, a little after six o'clock in the morning, and said he wanted a piece of timber landed; a man named Baxter came there afterwards, and joined the prisoner up the wharf: they asked me to get the handle on the crane to land the timber, but I saw no timber and wanted them to come in out of the wet - I opened the shed for them to come in; the prisoner then said he wanted a piece of timber landed very bad, for the sawyers was standing still, and so was the building - in about half an hour I saw a stick of timber brought by Foreman: I did not notice in what direction it came, as I was busy getting the handles on the crane and the dogs - it seemed to me to come up as the tide was coming up; they then asked me to lower the crane for the timber - I said they had better wait till there was a little more water, but they were in a hurry, and they got the dogs out to land it- if they had waited a quarter of an hour, they could have landed it without the crane; when they had got it on the cart, the prisoner asked what the wharfage was - I asked if he was the gentleman who had been with my master the night before; he said Yes, and that he had more timber coming - he then paid me a 1s., and took it away; I noticed the mark 34 rased on the timber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe the prisoner got the 1s. from Baxter? A. Yes he did - I do not know what the prisoner is; I gave evidence against Boxter and Foreman - one was tried for stealing, and the other for receiving this timber.</p>

            . I am a carman. On the 8th of April, 1831, the prisoner came to my master, about seven o'clock in the morning; he asked me to take a piece of timber to Poplar - I was to take a cart to Stone-stairs wharf, to fetch it; I agreed to do it - he then went away, and came again in about twenty minutes; he blowed me up because I was not ready, and said his men were standing still - I said it was such a wet morning, it was impossible for them to work; he said if I did not be quick, he would get a truck and take it, for down it must go - I went with him, and the timber was loaded; I took it to Baxter's yard, at Poplar.</p>

            . I am a blacksmith. On the 8th of April in last year, I saw the prisoner and Baxter in the East India-road, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, near the turupike - they were in discourse together, and went away in the direction of Limehouse; I returned soon after, and saw the prisoner and Baxter, and a piece of timber near Baxter's premises - I heard the prisoner tell him he had got the timber cheap enough, but it came by this, holding up his finger in a bent direction; Baxter made some observation on the premises, and said he had neither axe nor adze there - he then rubbed his foot on the ground, and rubbed it on the timber, in the prisoner's presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was done, was done in the prisoner's presence and in yours? A. Yes - the prisoner knew me; Baxter and he did not whisper together - the dogs are things that lay hold of timber in a grasping way.</p>

            . I live at a coffee-shop in the Commercial-road. On a Thursday in April, 1831, Baxter came in and sat down in the parlour - the prisoner then came and said he wanted to speak to him; I called him to him, and I heard the prisoner say, as he was going out of the passage, "You will meet me at five o'clock tomorrow morning" - next morning they came to our house again, to breakfast, and while they were at breakfast, I gave the prisoner a second cup of coffee; Baxter said he could very well afford to pay for it, as he had given him 5s. more for the timber than he had agreed for; and the prisoner said, had he not been distressed for money, he could not have afforded to sell it to him, or to his own father for that, and he could not have sold it at that rate had he not had it in liea of some laths of a man and his son, who had set up a new timber yard in the Commercial-road - Baxter said, "I am perfectly satisfied, if it is all right;" and the prisoner answered, "You don't suppose Bill that I would deceive you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is this the first time of your appearance here? A. Yes; I am housekeeper to the person who keeps the coffee-shop - he was game-keeper to a gentleman for many years, named Mason; I am married, but I do not know where my husband is - I have been parted from him for ten years; Baxter was particular in inquiring if the timber was all right, and the prisoner said so help him God it was - Baxter was taken up on the Saturday morning, and his parents thought that it was essential that Mr. Mason should come, but I did not come; I went to Baxter when he was in prison, to know how Mr. Mason was to be paid, but I did not speak to him, because his mother came with me - Mason was not paid; I understand that Baxter was innocent, but I did not come on his behalf - I had not been to see Baxter or Foreman after they were convicted; I only went to Baxter to know how he had arranged for Mr. Mason to be paid - it is my duty to collect his debts; I have seen Mr. Dixon several times, but have not talked this matter over with him.</p>

At the time this happened the prisoner and Foreman were in my employ - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050090"/>knew nothing of Baxter till I found the timber in his yard; there was my mark R. D. on it, but it was partly obliterated with road dirt, as if by a shoe, with nails in it - there was the mark of the measure of the timber and the name of the ship; the prisoner was my lath-render, but he did not come to his work after this - I did not see him till the officer took him twelve months afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was the prisoner paid? A. Weekly; he was with me mine or ten months - he was subject to ill-health, and did not work the whole week; sometimes he had other masters, and used sometimes to work for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you find the timber? A. On Saturday morning, the 9th of April; it was on the water at my premises on the 7th, and fastened by a chain and staples.</p>

On the 15th of June the prisoners came running into my house, which is about half a mile from the prosecutor's - my door was open, and it rained very hard; I went out to see who was there, and found them there, pursued by Graves and a Police-constable - I heard them say, "You have stolen something;" they both strongly denied it, and the persons who pursued them felt down, but could find nothing - Roberts walked away, but Jones stopped; Ingley looked behind the street door, and took up this property.</p>

The prisoner gave me this watch-movement on the Thursday night after the fire; I had spoken to him, in consequence of having heard that some things had been taken, and he brought this watch-movement, and stated it was all he had got, except a ring, which appeared more like a brass ring than any thing else - I had employed him to remove the rubbish of the fire, and what was found he was to give to me, as I was in possession for the Westminster Fire-office.</p>

I saw the prisoner with this gold chain, a silver chain, and this watch, which he took out of his pocket in Mr. Smart's shop: I work for Mr. Burgess, but I was not at this job - the prisoner told me he had picked up these things in Soho-square, where Mr. Burgess' cart shot the rubbish; Mr. Smart objected to buy the watch, and he took that and some other things to Mr. Sharp's, and delivered them at the bar.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 10th of June, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was going up the back of Cromer-street, and saw the prisoners; Isaacs had this cheese under his arm - I said "What have you there?" Bryan ran off - Isaacs threw the cheese over some rails, but I made him fetch it back again - he then said "It is Mrs. White's - Bryan got it out, and then went and got the snuff" - I then went and took Bryan.</p>

             (Police-constable C 78.) I saw the prosecutor asleep on the step, and the prisoner standing by him - he said he knew him, that he was a friend of his, and he wished to take him home; I tried to arouse the prosecutor - he said he had lost a hat and a handkerchief, but his hat was by his side - I asked if he had lost any thing else; he said a watch - the prisoner then took this watch out of his pocket, and said it belonged to him; I asked the prosecutor if he could swear to it - he said Yes, it was a silver watch, and had a pinchback chain and a key, but no seal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Was no one else near the prosecutor? A. There was a watchman on the opposite side, and some girls were near the prosecutor, but they went away - the prisoner took the watch from his fob, and said it was his own; he did not put it into the prosecutor's hand - he gave it into my hand - he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>ANDREW MILLER. The prisoner was no friend of mine- I had not seen him before; I was drunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember any girls there? A. No-when I awoke the officer was by; I do not recollect that I saw the prisoner give up the watch - this is my watch; I had not trusted the prisoner with it, to my knowledge - I suppose I went to sleep at twelve or one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the prosecutor on the step of a door, with three girls, and one of them had this watch in her hand; I said, "That is not your watch;" she gave it to me, and they ran down a court - I was ten minutes trying to arouse the prosecutor, and then the officer came; the prosecutor said he had lost his watch; I pulled it from my trousers pocket, and said, "Here it is."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050100"/>go to the house after Christmas? A. I went past it many times, but did not enter it till the 10th of May, when I went to take possession; my sister was going to remain there for the summer - I saw the curtains up at the window as I passed, but I did not go in - I never employed Potter or his wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know Hill's husband? A. No - I cannot find him; I have eight children - I have a son in trouble: he is the first person I went to when I lost the property; to the best of my knowledge, he is now in prison; I was told yesterday he had been convicted of an offence - he is twenty-two years old; he was at liberty from December to May, and certainly had access to the house; I saw him sometimes - he has been convicted before.</p>
               <p>MR. WALESBY. Q. Did you go by your house from time to time? A. Yes - I did not try the door; there are outer gates, which fasten as well - I found the curtains Iorn down on the 10th of May; I had seen them up about six weeks before.</p>

            . I am a gardener, and live at Godalming now. In December last I lived at Mr. Russen's, Enfield-highway - Evans' house is next door to his; I recollect being at work with John Potter, in Mr. Russen's garden, in March last, and we had occasion to go into Evans' garden: we went close by the house - Jackson, Comfort, and Potter were with me - we went up to the house, and looked in at the back window; we were taking night-soil from Russen's premises, and having some ale; I was leaning against the shutter, and took hold of the pin accidentally, and turned it round - to the best of my knowledge the inner pin fell out; I took out the bolt, opened the shutter half way, looked in, and saw some crockery-ware in the kitchen, and think I saw two gridirons, but it was dark in the kitchen; I saw Potter look in at the same time, but he said nothing - I left Mr. Russen on the 9th of April.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you sure there was an inner pin to fall out? A. Not certain. I put the bolt in as I found it; the window was not open.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 11th of May the prosecutor gave me information of this robbery, and on Sunday morning, the 20th, about five o'clock, I went with him to Potter's cottage, in Swins' - buildings, Enfield; I found a pair of trousers, a pair of tongs, poker, and shovel - I went to Evans' house, examined it, and found no marks of breaking outside, but the door of a room up stairs had been forced with a chisel apparently - I went about seven o'clock the next morning to Hill's house, and found up stairs a bed, a mattress, nine chairs, a mahogany wash-hand stand, basin, a jug, a knife-box, three pieces of carpet, a dish, a bonnet, a tea-board, two knives, two forks, a grid-iron, some white bed-furniture, and other articles, which Evans claimed - I saw Potter in the cage at Enfield, on Friday, the 20th of May; he made no confession to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who told you it was Potter's house? A. I saw Mrs. Potter there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The chairs and beds must be some weight? A. Yes, Hill's wife appears near her confinement.</p>

            . I live in the same house; my husband is a groom. On the 2nd of July I was in the kitchen, and saw the prisoner go up the area-steps - I followed and overtook her, about two hundred yards off, with a bundle - I asked her to return with me, to No. 105, Piccadilly - she said she was going a little further, and would return bye-and-bye- I said I wished her to return immediately; she said she could not think what the housekeeper wanted with her -I said she would tell her when she got there; when we got to the corner of Dover-street, she said, "Take the bundle, let me go," but did not offer to give it to me - she went and towards Hyde-park - I pulled her back, and got a Policeman, who took her with the bundle - she said she had come and there for a person named Bennet, who she washed for, who owed her some money - nobody of that name lives there - the bundle contained these articles.</p>

On the 30th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050102"/>of June the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to match a piece of gros-de-naples, which I informed her we had not got; she returned in twenty minutes, to match some ribbon - I showed her the box - she took a piece from the box and looked at it - a customer came in at that time, for when I cut off four yards of ribbon, and on turning back to the prisoner I missed a piece of Petersham ribbon, it being the only piece we had of the colour and quality - I did not like to accuse her of it, but went to the top of the shop, and told Bauer that I missed it; he came forward to look for it- we had a general search for it - I moved the box off the counter, and made the counter clear; the prisoner was then accused of stealing it, and on Bauer's touching her pocket-handkerchief the ribbon fell from it: but previous to that I saw her take the ribbon from her pocket in front, and wrap it up in her handkerchief, which she put on the counter - she had her pocket-handkerchief out when she was looking at the ribbons, and had looked at that Petersham ribbon, and taken it in her hand, having her handkerchief in her hand at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a pocket in front? A. She had; I observed her take something from that pocket into her handkerchief - it must have been the ribbon; and then she placed her hands, with the handkerchief, on the counter, and when her handkerchief was touched the ribbon fell out - she then said she had taken it by mistake - we did not accuse her of stealing it, till after I saw her take something out of her pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not, at first, say you saw her take the ribbon out of her pocket? A. I did, that was a mistake - she took something, and it must have been that; she had her handkerchief in her hand when bargaining for the ribbon, and put it down before her- we did not search for the ribbon above a minute or two after I saw her take her handkerchief from her pocket - she had said, before I went to the other customer, that that Petersham ribbon was not exactly what she wanted, but as I had no other, that must do - our shop may be about forty feet long; I left her at the counter while I went to the end of the shop, to tell Bauer - she was about three yards from the door - there was nothing to prevent her leaving, as far as she knew.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it before you spoke to the young man that you saw her take something out with the handkerchief? A. After; she had taken that ribbon in her hand once to look at - I do not know whether she returned it to the box; I am sure she took something, out of the pocket, put it into her handkerchief, and held the handkerchief before her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she say she would take that ribbon, as you had no other? A. I said I had a piece in reserve, which I would go and get (as an excuse to go to the young man), and then she said if there was no other, that would do - she had her handkerchief in her hand before she put it into the pocket - I cannot tell whether one or two hands went into the pocket; the handkerchief was in both hands - I moved them both down to the pocket.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the pocket tied round her, or in an apron? A. It was under her dress; there was an opening in her dress in front - it is such a pocket as is worn at the side.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's service. I was at the other end of the shop; Hunt spoke to me - I came forward to notice the prisoner - she was sitting down before the counter; I watched her movements, and told Hunt to search the ribbon-box behind the counter -I saw her pocket rather fuller than is usual in front of a ladies' dress, and saw her moving her hand about in her pocket, but whether she took any thing out I cannot say; I saw her take her handkerchief from her knees, where she had laid it, and put it on the counter, still keeping it in her hand - I touched the handkerchief, and the ribbon dropped out; I charged her with taking it - she said she had taken it by mistake; I sent for an officer; she requested me to let her go, but as my employer was not present, I was obliged to act as I thought proper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say the handkerchief was on her knees? A. Yes, she sat with it in her hand on her knees - there were two young men between her and the door, but perhaps she might have gone out without difficulty; the ribbon is a good size; I saw her put her hand into her pocket, but will not swear she took any thing out - there was an opening in front of her gown, and the pocket went down to her side - there were more valuable ribbons in the box.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received the prisoner in charge, and took her to the station; a woman searched her there, and found this piece of silk, one or two shillings, and a few halfpence in her pocket - she said she had taken the ribbon from there, and was very sorry, but it was done quite by mistake, and if money would make it up she would get money, and if I would let her speak to the prosecutor, she had no doubt he would make it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The ribbon does not match that silk? A. No.</p>

On the 23rd of June the prisoner came and offered to sell me three young rabbits, and an old one; I bought them of Maycock, and paid him for them - I cannot say who brought them; I gave 4s. for the four - Jennings took no part in the bargain; they both came in, and Maycock spoke first.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 23rd of June, I took the prisoner's at Fulham-bridge; I turned them out of a yard; Jennings had 4d.: there was a boy named Perryman with them - after they got to the watch-house, Jennings told me they had sold the rabbits in Stingo-lane, and divided the money between the three, which was 1s. 4d. each.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. Where is Perryman? A. He was not committed; he had no basket - Jennings did not say, in his presence, that he had a share of the money.(Property produced and sworn to)</p>
               <p>Maycock's Defence. Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning I met this young man and Perryman together; Perryman asked me to buy a rabbit; I said No, but I would tell him where to sell them - we all three went together; I went in to ask the man if he bought rabbits - he said Yes; we took them in, and sold them.</p>
               <p>Jennings' Defence. I met the prisoner in Queen-street; he asked me to buy a rabbit - I said No.</p>
               <p>Jennings received a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I called upon the prosecutor's son - he asked me to sell the harness; the prosecutor himself gave me the articles laid in the indictment, to show to hackneymen, to see if I could dispose of them, but being extremely old, although I had tried to sell them, I could not succeed; being very much distressed and fatigued, I called at Mr. Aldous, in Berwick-street, Soho, and pledged them for 1s. 6d., fully intending to redeem them, and return them to the owner - after I had received them from the prosecutor he wished me good-day, saying, that he had no money to treat me, and I said neither had I any.</p>
               <p>- WILLIE. The prisoner sent for me the evening he was taken, and I saw Mr. James, who said to me,"God bless my soul! I don't think the man has taken it with intent to steal it;" I said, "I believe he has not;" he said, "Will you call on me?" I called that evening at his place - he then said he did not think he took it with intent to steal it and not bring it back, but he did not bring it back for a week, and he was afraid his son would make him pay for it; I said I would make a bridle and pad to match rather than he should be taken - he said, "Well, I think I would take 8s. and drop it, if my expenses are paid;" I said as I had known Charters so long I did not mind that.</p>

            . I live in Joseph-street, St. George's East: Thomas lost a good deal of money which he had left with a publican; I heard the prisoner say he was an Excise-officer, and would forfeit 500l. if he did not get him the money from Ross: that was three or four months ago; he said he could not get it without going to different lawyers in the City, and every time he went he wanted money from Thomas - I saw Thomas give him some money in my room; I then kept the house in Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written) I was an English prisoner in France, and belonged to the ship Prosenjine - I took a lodging in the same house as the prosecutor; I paid some money to him off the debt I owed him - when the officer took me to the Thames Police-office, he stated that he heard the prosecutor say I had paid him part of the money back; when the clerks heard this, they discharged the Policeman, and gave me into the charge of a Thames Police-officer.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor, and had been with him about three months - I secreted these books of gold in his shop, and took them away without his knowledge: I took them on Monday evening, the 26th of June, to the prisoner, Mrs. Solomons (I had been there once before with a gold ring) - when I got to the shop I saw a boy there; I asked for Mrs. Solomons, and the prisoner came down stairs, preceded by another lady - I asked if they would buy the gold; they made no answer, but the other lady took the books of gold from me, and began rubbing it out of the books into the scale with her finger - Mrs. Solomons either asked the boy for a knife, or took a desert knife and scraped it into the scale - two young men then came to inquire about a brooch - they made some remark, and left the door open; Mrs. Solomons then called out,"Shut the door;" when they were gone the other lady asked if it was not half a crown a penny weight they gave for the gold - Mrs. Solomons made no answer, but sent the boy out for change; I do not know what I was to get for the gold - I was taken into custody at the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How old are you? A. About sixteen; I was at Mr. Wace's before I was turned over to my uncle, Mr. Davison - I had never stolen any thing before this; my uncle had not told me he had missed property before this; Mrs. Solomons' is a refiners shop - I had been there before, and sold some rags for Mr. Wace,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050109"/>and gave him the money; I assisted in turning out these books of leaf gold - some of it did fall about; I had not turned any out before Mrs. Solomons came down - Mrs. Solomons took a knife or a spatula, and turned it into a bit of paper, and then put it into the scale; there was no price asked for it - if there is a wind, leaf gold will blow away; she desired the door to be shut - I did not hear the boy say that; I did not hear the prisoner say that Mr. Solomons must be sent for - when the boy came back with the change, she the officer was in the shop, and then the prioner said "Is Mr. Solomons coming;" I was then taken up.</p>

I was on duty, and met Green and McLeod; I went to the prisoner's shop - I saw her and another woman there, and the witness; I asked how he got that gold - he said he had been sent with it by his master, or an errand boy had been sent for it, who had crumpled it up, and they could not use it, and his master sent him to sell it; Mrs. Solomons had a spoon or a knife scraping it out - it is not all out now - it was nearly nine o'clock at night.</p>

I saw the prisoner in Shoe-lane at a quarter before nine o'clock, on the 11th of June; she had received a very bad cut from a fall, and being in liquor, I was taking her to the watch-house - a tea-spoon dropped from her; I set her down, and saw a bundle in her bosom - I took it out, found an old purse, these silver-tongs, and a gold chain; I then thought I heard something drop, and picked up this gold ring; I found three sovereigns on her person.</p>

            . I live in Princes-street, Soho. On the 16th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was standing at my door to tell the Policeman to call me up in the morning, and saw the two prisoners coming from Leicester-square towards my shop; Nunn had a bundle, with a white cloth covered over it; he said to the other, "You go and beef, and I will go and lumber them" - he gave to him what appeared to me to be a waistcoat; Pridham then crossed the road, and Nunn went on to a pawnbroker's - I, knowing they were bad characters, went to lay hold of Pridham, but he ran down a street, and I thought if I followed him I should lose the other - I then went back to the pawnbroker; I just heard the pawnbroker say, "I can't take them in, it is too late," meaning a pair of trousers - I laid hold of Nunn, and said I should detain him, for having stolen these trousers - he said, "Where did I steal them?" I said, "No matter;" I took him out - I cannot be mistaken in Pridham's person, because I was in Clerkenwell prison at the time he was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You never saw a pair of trousers with Pridham? A. No - I think I was eight days in Clerkenwell prison; I have not been in any other prison - I am a pencil-maker by trade; I was in the Police for thirteen months, and had several prisoners here - I never had any charge against me; I was reported for being too late, and was fined 1s. - I was dismissed for taking a placard from a person with the word "Reform" on it, near the House of Lords; the Commissioners thought I ought not to have interfered with it; that was the only reason why I was dismissed - I was fined twice; I was in prison for having some drugs without the stamp on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How often have you given evidence in this Court? A. Six or seven times.</p>

             (Police-constable C 42). I was in the office when the trousers were first brought in -Stroud came, and said they were her husband's; Nunn was liberated - I afterwards received information; I went, and took Nunn again - I asked where the woman was; he said he did not know - I locked him up, and went with Hobbs to Stroud's, and got the trousers again; I afterwards got information, and took Pridham.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I was sitting in the Globe public-house, and a man called me out at a quarter-past eight o'clock - he said he had a pair of trousers for sale; he owed me 6s., and I gave him 16s. more for them - I took them to Stroud's, and wanted her to lend me a sovereign; she said she could not, but she would pawn the trousers for me and a black silk waistcoat of my own; she took them, but did not get enough - I told her if she could lend me the rest of the money I wanted, I would pay her, but she could not; I then went, and got them out again - I went to the other pawnbroker's, where I was taken; the man I had them of is a tailor.</p>

I assisted to take the prisoner - she objected to be searched by a man, and I was going to send for a woman; at last she said a married man should search her - I then untied the string of her apron, and this box fell on the ground; I took it up, and said, "What is in this?" she said, "Only a shilling;" I opened it, and found two half-sovereigns: she said, "Take one of them, and say no more;" I said,"We don't do business in that way;" I then untied the string of her flannel petticoat, and this watch fell down.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

No, she had a blue apron; I do not know whether I said she had a black gown, and a black bonnet - I think I did, and I think she had them on; I told the Magistrate so: I said she had a white bonnet on, because the last witness said so.</p>

The prosecutor sent for me; the prisoner went up stairs and consented to have her boxes searched - she then made some objection, but when she was given into my custody she opened a cupboard, and gave the key of her box, in which were these articles, which have been in my care ever since- she said these dusters and the napkin were her master's, but the tea, sugar, and other things were not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She acknowledge these dusters and napkin belonged to her master? A. Yes, and the glass and basin, but not the other things, nor the spoons; she said she could produce others like them.</p>
               <p>MR. MIVART. I believe these to be my property - the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050114"/>prisoner was my housemaid; she could not have any of the silver spoons properly, nor this breakfast napkin, nor this cut glass, which was sent up with tea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I waited on the nurse, morning and evening, and she gave me a small portion of tea and sugar, which I put into my bonnet-box; there was a lady who had her breakfast carried up to her - I put the napkin into my box, to use in mixing the tea, the black and green together; I had bought a great part of the tea to send to my mother, and the sugar also - the silver spoons are my own- my master knows that the lady was in No. 17 room, who had her breakfast in bed.</p>
               <p>MR. MIVART. Her mistress was to take the breakfast to that lady, and these things were found in the floor over the one that lady was on - there were 20 lbs. or 30 lbs. of tea found in her box; the tea and sugar nearly filled a large clothes-basket.</p>
               <p>- ROGERS. I am the prisoner's mother. I gave her two spoons, ten or eleven years ago - there was an S. on them, and I believe these are the spoons; I had another daughter - on her marriage the prisoner gave her these spoons; her husband died, and then I took my daughter home, and all she had - she died, and I gave the spoons a second time to the prisoner; I live at Wetherford, forty miles from London; at chance times the prisoner has sent me a little tea and sugar, or thread or cotton - for my own use, I do not sell them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Upon your oath, do you believe these to be the spoons which, eleven years ago, you gave to your daughter? A. Yes, I do - the prisoner gives me tea and sugar sometimes, and sometimes I send her a trifle of money for it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the name of your daughter who died? A. Mary Selwin - she died three or four years ago; the prisoner has sent me a pound or a pound and a half of tea, not more.</p>

            . I am a waiter. I called on the prisoner about three years ago, and drank tea with her, in company with a female; it was at a broker's shop in Gray's Inn-lane, where the prisoner then lodged - my friend asked the prisoner if the spoons were what her sister had; I saw two silver spoons there of a plain make, and they had an S. on them in rather a large cypher - they were much worn.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How came you, three years ago, to take particular notice of two silver spoons? A. It was in consequence of my friend's remark - my friend's name is

I was in the prosecutor's employ twelve months ago - the prisoner lived there at the time; I saw her have two silver spoons with an S. on the handle - I remarked them, because Mr. Mivart had some spoons belonging to the housekeeper's room, with the same mark on them, and I told the prisoner if Mr. Mivart saw them he would say they were his, as they were exactly like them; I said that because the prisoner brought them down for us to have tea, and they might be mixed with others.</p>

            . I live in White Lion-street, Pentonville - the prisoner called on me in March, and brought a parcel of sugar with her; I went out with her, and bought 3lbs. or 4lbs. of tea in the City.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was she living at that time? A. She said she was in the service of Mr. Mivart - I was going to Farringdon-street myself, and I said I would go as far as the tea-warehouse with her; I went with her to Twining's - she then went with me to Farringdon-street, and I paid the interest on a bed; we then went to my house in Chiswell-street, and had tea - she then gave me something less than 1 oz. of tea, and took the rest home; I do not know where she had bought the sugar -I think there were 6lbs. or 7lbs. of that; she paid for 3lbs. or 4lbs. of tea - she put down a sovereign; I do not know what change she had.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Was the sugar tied up? A. Yes, in a white handkerchief - she said it was sugar; the tea was in two papers - I am not sure whether she had any change.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What priced tea did she ask for? A. I think 7s. green - I am not sure what the black was; I paid attention to the change - I think she had about 3 lbs. of tea.</p>

            's Defence. I am innocent of all these pawnings - I did not know of the bed being pawned until after I was in custody; we had bed and bedding of our own besides - I had a daughter going to service, and to get her some things, I said I would pawn our bed, but my wife took this bed - I did not know the difference - I could not miss the other things, as we had things of every description; I belonged to the Police, in which I remained till 1831 - I then got a situation as a flax-dresser, and in October last I went to the prosecutor's.</p>

I went to bed about eleven o'clock at night - the prisoner slept in another bed in the same room; I slept alone - when I went to bed, I had 15s. in shillings, and two sixpences in my pocket; I took it out, put it into a bit of paper, and put it into my right-hand breeches pocket, and a letter with it - I put my clothes in a chair by my bed-side - I awoke between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was then getting up - he seemed in a great hurry to dress; when he had left the room, I got out of bed, and found my clothes, which I had left in the chair, on the prisoner's bed - I felt in my breeches pocket, and my money and letter were gone; I could not tell the money, but I know the paper it was in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not take a hand-bill in Oxford-street? A. No, it was given to me in Holborn - it was the only paper I had; I did not put my clothes on yours when I went to bed - I put them on the chair - there was nothing else there; I awoke while you were dressing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find the letter or the money? A. I apprehended the prisoner myself, in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, and a Police-officer, who is not here, searched him in my room; he found on him this paper, in which my money had been, and 13s. 6d. - I found this letter, which had been in my pocket, in his bed; he afterwards said he gave 2s. 6d. for this new waistcoat - he made some resistance when the officer searched him.</p>
