                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Tattersall's—we are auc tioneers, and carry on business at Knightsbridge—we are largely engaged. I in selling horses by auction—on Monday, 12th July, we had a sale—catalogues were issued in the ordinary way and the horses lotted—at that sale I saw the prisoner; he bid for some of the lots—lots 31 and 48, I believe were the first two horses he bought, and afterwards lots 105 and 122—a clerk, Mr. Evans, checked the lots as they were sold; he was by my side—it is 9 the practice afterwards for the customer to arrange with one of the clerks I for payment, and then a memorandum. is given so that he may get the horses—as auctioneers we sell for ready money—we got a cheque for 186<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the price of the four horses—I think I saw the cheque—it was on plain paper on Barker &amp; Company, and signed "John James Parland "—that was paid into my bankers in the ordinary way, and afterwards on the Wednesday it was returned unpaid and marked "signature not correct"—upon that I wrote to the bankers, and in answer got the letter produced, dated 20th July—I saw the prisoner afterwards on the Thursday—we had a sale on then—I called him into my private office and told him that his cheque had been returned, and he said "Oh! yes, it's all right; I have given another in place of it"—he said "It was very stupid of my bankers to put. me in this position, and I assure you upon my honour it will be all right—I said it was very unpleasant for a gentleman to be placed in that position, and "I hope for your own sake it will be all right"—he said "It will, and the amount will be placed with my bankers"—he said he used to sign "John James," and now he signs "John Parland" only—I called his attention to the letter from Messrs. Barker. (<hi rend="italic">Letter of</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">th July, Barker &amp; Co., to Tattersall's, read stating</hi>" The only reason. we have for refusing payment of Mr. Parland's cheque is that the signature differs."</p>

Dear Sirs,—Your favour of this day's date to hand; having received orders from the gentleman you mention to pay no cheques, we should not have been able to pay yours even if the signature had been correct.") The second cheque was paid into my account in the ordinary way and was returned marked "Orders not to pay "—on the day of the conversation with the prisoner about the first cheque, when he gave a second he bought two more horses at the auction—I consulted ray solicitors, and on the 14th August, I took out a summons at the Westminster police-court—before I took it I had not seen the prisoner, except I think in the street—he did not appear in answer to the summons—I then obtained a warrant on the 21st, which was put into the hands of a police-officer—in the meantime I had received notice of bankruptcy, dated 28th July—I was not aware what had become of the horses.</p>

                  </hi>.

Sold to Mr. Calisher this day the five horses now standing in my stables, in Ebury Street, for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., receipt of which I hereby acknowledge and which I authorise my groom to deliver to him or his order John Parland." "July 25th Ealeigh Club. Deliver to Mr. Calisher or his order, my five horses. Send with them clothing. John Parland"—I had seen the prisoner about those horses, I think the day before the 24th—he told me he had five horses in his stables at Ebury Street—I think that was all he said then—on the 25th I had been trying to induce him to go to Russia with his solicitor, to raise money to pay his creditors—he has pro<lb/>perty there, and he wanted some more money to pay his hotel bill and other things, and asked me to make him further advances—I did so on consideration that he made those horses over to me—I advanced altogether I think 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., partly that day and partly the day before—besides that I had to pay his groom during his absence—I simply promised I would not sell the horses until his return—I wrote out the memorandum "Sold"—I did it to protect myself in case he should not come back—I did sell them about three weeks or a month afterwards—I could <hi rend="italic">give</hi> you the date from my book—I think 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>of that sort—I intended to pay Tattersall's cheque, only I heard something afterwards—on that Tuesday when he left to go to Russia I did convey to him that I would provide for the cheque—I did not look upon the horses as security for that; they were—he having this property in Russia I was my way to a tangible security, and ventured to promise to do that for him, and such was my intention on the Tuesday, but I heard of the notice in bankruptcy, and then I would not pay—I offered to let Tattersall's have the horses back, when I found out that these horses were the subject matter of the cheque, I at once instructed Messrs.

John James Parland would be incorrect—all the cheques produced were all presented—he had a pass-book in the ordinary way and a cheque-book—he had passed a considerable sum of money through his account from August, 1875—I do not know that he came of age in 1875—after May 25th we paid four cheques of his—I knew an application had been made as to an advance upon his Russian property, and that they were con<lb/>sidering it; I never saw it in writing—I knew the prisoner and Mr. Bradford left for Russia about the 25th.</p>

               <p>be a little over 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is with the policy—I introduced Mr. Parland to Messrs.

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated llth October</hi>, 1875.) On 19th April I gave another guarantee myself, personally—I have a copy of the letter in my book—I also saw Messrs.

Barker—that advance was proposed on the Russian property, subject to my report to them as to the title—I advised them that I did not think he could execute a legal Russian mortgage in this country; and, further, I knew that he had not perfected his title, because, according to the Russian law he must be put in possession personally—it was arranged that I was to go out with him—those arrangements were pending at the time this very cheque was given—it was on Friday, 21st July that Mr. Parland first communicated to me with reference to this cheque for 186<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on that day I wrote to Messrs.

Dear Sirs,—I am sorry you Should have taken steps 'in this matter; I have arranged that the, amount of Mr. Parland's dis<lb/>honoured cheque; shall be taken up tomorrow. I trust in the meantime you will not proceed further.") I had arranged with Mr. Parland on the Monday to leave for St. Petersburg on the Tuesday night—I was present at the interview with Mr. Calisher on the Tuesday—I have heard Mr. Calisher's account of the transaction; it is correct—Mr. Parland said he would not leave England unless he was assured that provision would be secured for Messrs. Tattersall's cheque, he repeated that several times, in fact, Mr. Parland was very reluctant to go to St. Petersburg until that <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been settled—Calisher was simply to have a lien upon the horses for the money he was to pay for Tattersall's, because we did not know what the amount was; there was a question of costs—I was prepared to settle whatever costs Tattersall's had been put to—he was not to part with them—I was not aware that he had the document that was produced to-day—we left on the Tuesday night by the tidal train and travelled to St. Petersburg, and got. there on Saturday night—on the Monday I set about inquiring into this property, it is in the centre of St. Petersburg, in the best part of the city, and it consists of a very large piece of land, on which there are wooden</p>

Barker's in reference to the non-payment of the 186<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,. cheque, but then it was in other hands—I know this, that if it had been presented again and the stop had been taken oft, Messrs.

Bailey to present the cheque again, but they said they could not, they considered it a fraud—that was on the 22nd. July—on the 25th I arrauged it to be-taken up to-morrow, that was an arrangement with Mr. Calisher—I left on the 25th, the day I wrote that: letter—I had arranged to go to Russia with the defendant either on the Friday or Saturday before I started on the Tuesday—I had been consider<lb/>ing a journey to Russia before that, in. the December previous—I did not know of the other cheques that were outstanding—I knew nothing of Mr. Olivier's cheque, or the other cheques for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not aware they were outstanding till I was at the Westminster police-court—I think the defendant owes me about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I paid 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash to him—I have no-security for that—the prisoner's mother and sister are interested in the Russian property; according to the Russian law his share is 11-14ths of the 1 whole amount, the mother's 2-14ths, and the sister's 1-14ths.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). I have been in the service between seven and eight years—I was directed by my superiors to watch. Mr. Wicken's premises, in Glaucus Street, Bow Common, a glue and size dealer, and bone boiler, and on 6th October I was stationed with Sergeant Roots in the laboratory, where there was some green baize before the window—this sketch correctly describes the relative "positions of the window and the scale—I went there about 3.30 a.m. and remained till 10.30 p.m.—the window is 12 or 13 ft. from the ground, and the upright of the, scale is 9 or 10 ft. from the wall—business commenced about 6 a.m.—I received a signal when Seaborn and Sambridge came to the scale, and made these notes at the time—at about 6.5 Sambridge and Seaborn came to the scale together, bones were brought in, Seaborn weighed them, and they called out the weights, and Sambridge and Garlick made notes—two baskets were weighed at a time, and sometimes three—there were twelve weighings that day—Mr. Wickens was there, he left directly Sambridge and Seaborn came with their loads—he gave us the information, and then left the pre<lb/>mises by my direction before the weighing took place—on 13th October I placed myself in the same room with Manton—we went about 3.30 a.m. and remained there till the close of the afternoon—they commenced weigh<lb/>ing at 6 a.m.—Seaborn, Sambridge and Garlick were present—there were twenty-five weighings, which were called out by Seaborn—I could not distinctly hear the" weights as the laboratory window was shut; I could see everything, but could not bear—we made a report of the number of weigh-. ings before we saw Seaborn's book—on the Saturday Roots and I went to the Tenterden Arms to watch Eddington, that is opposite Glaucus Street, and we saw Seaborn and Eddington in Glaucus Street, walking from the factory towards the public-house, and as they entered Seaborn said "It is all right now, it is level this time," or "it is. eleven this time," I do not know which, as he speakes in a peculiar way—they had some drink, which Eddington paid for—Seaborn said "When it was put on the scale he was up and down all the time," and he made a motion with hishand—another</p>

               <p>man then joined them, and they went outside, where they stopped talkin under Eddington's umbrella for five or six minutes, and then parted—befor leaving, Eddington gave the landlady money for a glass of ale for somebody—they went into the Widow's Son public-house for about three minutes, then to the Bank in the Bow Road, and then to the railway station, and I lost sight of them for about half an hour—on Friday, the 20th I was in the counting-house, but not all day; Garlick and Sambridge came in, I had seen that they were unloading bones—Sinclair said to Garlick "Harry, what do you make yours?"—he said "27-2-4 marrows," and I think he said "15 cwt. of waste "—he then called to Sambridge and said "What do you make your weights?"—he called out his weights but I do not remember what they all were—Sinclair called to Seaborne who had brought his weighing book with him, and Sinclair compared the weights and the weighing book and then wrote them each out, these two tickets, one is "27-2-4 marrow," and the other "15 waste"—warrants were afterwards delivered to me against the four prisoners and on 26th October I took Seaborne and read the warrant to him, which was for conspiring to obtain 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Samuel Wickens by false pretences—he said "You seem to know more about it than I do, I have never robbed Mr. Wickens, I have always acted fairly by him, and I think he must say so "—I then took Garlick and Sambridge, who were there, and read the warrant to them; they both said "I know nothing at all about it"—Garlick said to me "How can this have been done then?"—I said "You have been charging for more bones than came in, by increasing the number of weighings "—he said "I know nothing about it, I never had a pound off Seaborne and I never robbed Wickens, only when I put a bit of meat in the basket"—four or five hours afterwards I went to Eddington's house—he opened the door—I said "Can I see Mr. Eddington?"—he said "I am he, what have you got my two men for?"—I told him they were in custody for robbing Mr. Wickens and that I had a warrant for his arrest—he said "Good God! you don't say so, who can have done this; Mr. Wickens?"—I said "Yes"—I read the warrant to him—he said "Well, I cannot be responsible for what my men do, I thought I had two of the most honest fellows in the trade "—I asked if he kept any books—he said "No "—I asked him if he supplied the carmen with books to go on their rounds—he said "No, I give them so much money in the morning, they go round and collect the bones and stuff and take it to Mr. Wickens. and bring me back a ticket of the total weight and give me the change, if there is any, that is the only record I have "—I said "Don't you reckon up with your men in, the morning or the change they give you?"—he said "No, I make up my, account every night and I trust to my men as to the amount—I searched his place and found these books and memoranda (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are entries in the books of the transactions of the 6th, 13th, and 20th October—on the 6th here is <hi rend="italic">"Harry</hi>, 24-1-7, 21-1-0, and cash 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; also <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, 17-2-4 marrows, 6-2-10 waste, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—on 13th October here is <hi rend="italic">"Harry</hi>, 34-0-2 and 26-2-4,15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., total 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, 19-10-25 and 10-3-15, total 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—on 20th here is <hi rend="italic">"Harry</hi> 27-2-4 and 15-0-0, carried out, total 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,"and <hi rend="italic">Torn</hi>, 20-0-24 and 10 cwt, carried out 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—those are the only entries referring to those dates—there is no entry of money by Eddington to the men, but here are entries of balances which I donot understand—there is no entry with regard to Wickens—there is an entry on Wednesday, 10th October, "Seaborne &amp; Sons," as if he was doing</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. The tickets would be rightly in his possession, there was no harm in that, supposing the weighings were correct—this is where Eddington's load commences and it goes on at the back—I do not remember seeing three baskets in one weighing, the baskets came in generally two by two—I have noted where there are two and where there are three—I have not counted the number of baskets, but there were a good many, more than 12—when I thought I understood the weight* I put it down, but I could not hear distinctly—Seaborn, who was weighing, took a note of each weighing and called out to Garlick and Sambridge, who made entries in their books—at some of the weighings, they both made notes and at others only one of them did—two baskets were weighed together, but the weight was only called once—I have no notion why <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Torn</hi>, both entered them—the green baize over the window was very thick, but I had two holes made through it as big as a sixpence, or larger, one for me, and one for Roots—I told the Magistrate that there was nothing between me and the window, we were looking from the dark into the light—I could not bring both eyes to bear, one eye relieved guard with the other—we were there from 3.30 a.m., we had something to eat and drink—the copper was in use on the 13th, but not on the 6th; when it is boiling a great deal of effluvia and vapour rises when the lid is up and it was up many times, in a day; the vapour then came up pretty freely and I could not see at all; there was no vapour while the load on the 13th was being weighed; I made arrangements for that—Wickens' men brought the baskets in, I know them by sight, but not their names—if it had struck me to get them in afterwards to tally the baskets from the cart I should not have done it—this is my note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this "3-3 "means 3 cwt. 3 qrs., which was the weight I understood to be called out by Seaborn—I have never added up the weights to. see how far they agreed with the tickets, we took them down to make ourselves more positive as to the weighings—I think the two glasses of ale at the public-house would only come to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I will not swear that Eddington did not put down 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—Seaborn did not take out a sixpence, nor did Eddington say. "Put your money back, this makes it even "—he stutters.</p>

On 6th October I was watching in the laboratory with Andrews—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my notes—the first weigh<lb/>ing was two baskets of bones—Seaborn called out 3 1/2 for the first, for the second I have no weight, for the third I have 3-2-22—there were twelve weighings, not twenty-one—I was also there on 20th October, and these are my notes—there were twenty-six weighings, I am sure there were not twenty-seven—Robson was with me—Mr. Wickens, in my presence, compared the weighings of other bone dealers and Seaborn's book and they were correct—on Saturday, 14th, I went with Andrews to the Ten-terden Arms, and saw Seaborn and Eddington—on coming in Seaborn said "Well, that is all right now, it is level this time," or "eleven," I think it was eleven—they had some drink and Seaborn said that while it was on the scale he was up and down all the time—Eddington then left 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a glass of beer for another of the men, and they left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Metcalfe. I cannot say whether it was a sixpence that Eddington put down, I could see plainly, but I was listening rather than looking—two glasses of ale were drunk, I am sure it was ale—the words "That will make it level," or "even," were said before they had the beer, as they were coming in—they came in at the same door as we did, but we went into another compartment—we went in just before them, we saw them coming—I could not see Eddington where he stood at the bar—Andrews cut the holes in the baize and we both looked through and saw the weighing—he said "There is two more," and I put down two more—the time between the weighings gave us time to do that—I consulted him about everything—I put down and read it as I wrote it—the whole of this is my writing, but it has nothing to do with those weighings—there is something in this memorandum in Andrews' writing, but the generality of it is mine, the whole of it as far as October 6th is concerned—Sergeant Robson was my companion on 20th October—we went to the same chinks then and I wrote the whole of this, calling out to him "There are two more baskets "in the same way.

Eddington spoke in a low tone in the public-house, and I think there was a little more conversation, but Eddington spoke in a low tone—they could see us, we were standing at the bar—I will not undertake to say that when he said "He has been up and down the whole morning," it was not as to where Wickens was.</p>

I am acting as manager to Mr. John Wyman who has warehouses at 15, Lower Whitecross Street—Hudson was, in his employ, but left about a week before this happened—neither of the prisoners had any authority to remove anything from the premises—I saw the truck belonging to Mr. Wyman outside the police-court, it had previously to that been missing from the warehouse—we missed a quantity of gum, about 500 lbs. weight or a little more, on the Tuesday morning following the Saturday, the 17th—the truck had pieces of gum sticking to it, the same sort as that which we missed, only it had been a rainy night and it had got soft—Lord was in the employ of Mr. Wyman, but ceased to be so a fortnight before the 14th October—I saw the remains of some bales on the floor, partly cut open, and gum strewed down the warehouse steps.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SAMUEL</hi>; Behrexd I am a solicitor of Bucklersbury—I knew the prisoner intimately in business when I was an articledclerk—my engage ment necessitated my seeing him from day to day—I was admitted in 1812 <hi rend="italic">from May</hi>, 1868, to July,1870, I saw him continually—when I first joined him—his practice was small. but he developed it by his own efforts and energy, and when our connection terminated it was an exceed ingly good one—possibly over 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he was remarkably fond of his children—he used to bring them to the office on satruday mornings continualy, and frequently took them out with his wife on the satruday afternoon after business hours—up to the time of his going abroad I belive he lived on the best trems with his wife—in those days my experience of him was eminently favourable—I ceased to see him in july 1870, and hardly saw him again till the spring of 1874—I cannot say I noticed then any tokens of his indulgence in situlants—Inoticed a very great change indeed, and was very much grive to observe it—I was staying with him in the country for a couple of days in the spring of 1874 and noticed a very great change—I do not know that I saw him tipsy, but there was something strange about him—he was not what he used to be—his mental capacity was very much inferior to what it had been—at the time of his wife's judicial separation he asked me to look after his interests, which I thought had been much neglected by him—I did so—after the decree had been pronounced he called upon me occasionally—he continually referred to his children—whenever they were spoken of he seemed to get into a state of frenzy, and in conversion on other subjects he seemed unable to pursue a correct train of thought and said all sorts of extra-ordinary things not at all likely to be true—I do not think he was capable of understanding matters of business—as to the particular act for which he is charged I cannot say very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew him intimately from 1868 to 1870 daily—his intellect was then perfectly right-he—must have been elever to develop his business—I do not recollect in 1874 how often I saw him;. in the Spring I saw him for a short time, about a month, frequently; he was altogether changed—he did not seem to be as acute" or clever——altogether a changed man; changed in his notions on morality for one thing—when I knew him before in 1868, I considered him. a particularly moral man—his ideas on morality seemed to have changed—to some extent, he understood matters of business—I believe he was doing business; he was in-partnership with another gentleman; he perfectly understood what I said to him and also, I should say, what he read——if in 1874 he read a letter from the manager of a bank telling him to draw no—more cheques he could have understood that—in the condition he called at my office shortly before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200035"/>
               <p>being arrested he could not have understood anything—shortly before his arrest he used to come to me in the evenings——I never had' occasion: to discuss with him matters of right and wrong—I am quite aware he did not understand the difference between moral right and: moral wrong—he did not seem in his right mind, within a week of his apprehension—he called several times, within three weeks of his apprehension—I have heard the case to-day; I should hardly like to say he was not aware he was doing wrong at the. particular time of the offence, but I am quite sure that at the interviews he had with me about that time he was not capable of understanding, the difference between moral right and moral wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="largeCaps">JABEZ SPENCER BALFOUR</hi> I first knew the prisoner in business matters about nine years ago—I was manager of two large joint stock undertaking to which he acted as solicitor—he was therefore under my personal super-vision as to his ability, and in direct communication with me almost hourly—his business as solicitor was highly profitable to himself and satisfactory to his clients—he was a srticly honourable man; a man who was scrupulous on matters apperataining to his personal honour—his business comprised matters of hundreds of thousand of pounds—instead of being 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a half year it would probably be 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I distinctly remember the affliction which befell him; I have been told it was English leprosy, I belive it was—up to the time of that affliction I always noticed he was particulary fond of his Children both then and since, especially fond of them, he was a doting father; I think he thought a good deal of his personal appearence before his affliction—the disease affected his personal appearance very painfully—it produced depression of spirits and affected him mentally; he seemed to feel it most acutely—I noticed from that time a change in him—about May or April 1874, when we were all busy I began to notice considerable inatten<lb/>tion to business on his part—I had to complain to his father and brother-in-law and others, but I could never get him for two mintutes to the same point—he woulds come into my room to see me upon matters pending; I would commence, sometimes, a very long list and in about five minutes I observed it was hopeless, I could not get, him to attend consecutively—I suggested to him that the least he could do was to get a competent solicitor to act as his clerk—Mr. Barrow was that gentleman—I think it was my instance that subsequently in consequence of the state of his health, an arrangement was made by which Mr. Wright,. a solicitor, undertook the solicitor's department bad to worse, till it was impossible to talk to him on matters of business; to run counter to him caused him to get considerably excited—a change of air was recom<lb/>mended, and he went to Aix-la-Chapelle, and I thought he would never return—I thought he was a dying "man—I heard, subsequently that his wife had taken away the children and had proceeded in the Divorce Court—two or three weeks after his wife had left him, he came to my room after office hours and I was glad when I got him out of the room; he was in such a state of frenzy, I thought he would have a fit or do something violent—I. did all in my power to soothe him, and offered to do anything I could to make up matters with his wife; and to restore him, if possible, to his previous position—he continued to exclaim "They have taken my children from me "—I have known generally of his falling under the influence of a female at that time—I have never seen the person and do not know any<lb/>thing about her—from that time he certainly was not in my judgment,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200036"/>
               <p>capable of exercising discretion as to right and wrong in reference to commercial affairs—that would he in March, 1876—I have had corres<lb/>pondence with him since but do not think I have seen him—his correspon<lb/>dence was most incoherent—he made appointments to meet me at places he knew I never went to, and which he knew I could not keep—at considerable inconvenience I have been to meet him at places, and he never kept the appointments he had made, and when I have mentioned it to him he seemed to have forgotten it—I offered to pay the expense of sending him out to New Zealand and of bringing him back, for the purpose of restoring him to health—I persuaded his wife's friends to agree to suspend the Divorce pro<lb/>ceedings during his absence—when I made this offer to 'him he appeared deeply affected, and I hoped it would have had the effect we wished—he led me so to understand and I told his wife—when I saw him again, in two or three days he appeared to have forgotten that I had ever made the offer and I had to recall it to him——for more than twelve months I never could get him to a decision on any subject—I saw him in Newgate once, after he had been under the care of the doctors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Before then I saw him probably two or three months previously—at the time he was drawing these cheques I was in correspon<lb/>dence. with him, but did not see him—I have heard the trial and have heard the letters read—I have heard the letter he wrote about the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—it is intelligible—I should say if I had not known the man it was the letter of a man who knew what he was about—I think he has not been responsi<lb/>ble for his actions—my judgment is that he was not aware he was doing wrong, and that in the many similar instances that have come to my knowledge he has had no consciousness a few hours afterwards of acts he has per<lb/>formed—in May, 1874, I insisted he should have a managing clerk with full control—in October, 1874 I thought that not a desirable arrangment; because bis name appeared—in May, 1874, I thought he was no longer capable of conducting business and I insisted on having a clerk—in October I sent for him and endeavoured, knowing a solicitor of eminence in his profession, to get him to make some arrangement; but it was absolutely impossible to get him to any terms or to discuss terms—I' therefore, upon my own responsibility asked a solicitor to act as his representative—he did so until February, 1876, when I found that the prisoner had got into such a state he was no longer a credit to anybody, and I then desired him to cease his connection with us altogether, which he did—I must have seen him about April or May, 1876, and had one very long interview—I did not see Mm frequently since we corresponded—two years ago, October, 1874,1 went to his father and begged him to put him under restraint—I have seen in the papers that he has passed in the name of "Colonel Scudamore "—I did not know it in any other way.</p>

I am a widow and live at 46, Rawlins Street, Chelsea—I occupy the two parlours—I have been there rather more than three years—the prisoner and his wife occupied the front kitchen, and nobody but them—they came in on 14th October together—I showed them the place, and they resided there up to the time of her death—I last saw her alive on Thurs<lb/>day, 26th October, about 9.40—I was sitting reading in my room, and heard her call two or three times loudly "Mrs. Wheeler "—I went to the top of the kitchen stairs, and Mrs. O'Donnell was standing at the foot of the stairs in her nightshirt—she gave me a small parcel pinned up in a piece of calico, and this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was on the outside of it—she said "For the honour of God take care of this for me"—I took it, and she made a motion for me to run, and we heard the area gate shut together—that gate leads down into the Kitchen—I heard him come in and shut the door leading to his own room—his wife had got. back into her room before that, and I had got back to mine—I put the parcel-in paper, tied a string round it, and put it into a drawer in my room—I gave it just as it was to Inspector Marsh—I heard no more of them that night after I sup<lb/>posed he had come in—I then went to bed—on that same Thursday I had heard them differing and having angry words—I heard both their voices there was no one else there—I heard that two or three times during that day at different intervals—I had heard it about 7 o'clock in the evening—it was not to call it a quarrel; they were jangling and quarrelling between themselves, but anybody outside the house could not have heard it—at a little before 11 o'clock next morning I knocked at the prisoner's door—he came out, and I asked him if he would do a little job for me to the coal cellar—he said he would when he got his hat, and went back again into the room—he did not come to do the job, and I did not see him again after that at all, but between then and Sunday I heard him walking about down<lb/>stairs—I did not see him on Friday or Saturday, but I heard him go out of his room—he had his own key, and could get in and out by the area—he was walking in the passage and in and out of his room, and he appeared to me as though he was talking to his wife—I heard him talking, and I fancied so—I heard no other voice than his—next saw him on Sunday afternoon at a little before 3 o'clock—the bells were going for church—he was in the hack passage—I said "How is your wife; I have not seen her these two or three days?"—he said "Oh, no; she is right enough, but she is delicate,. very delicate; she never goes about the house much, and I think' I shall get a doctor this afternoon "—I said "Pray do if she is not well—he then went into his room, and I never saw him afterwards—they only had one room—I do not know what he did to get a living or whether his wife did anything—I think I" am right in saying that 14th October was the day they came there—they had been there one week before this occurrence; it was the second week they were in the house that this occurrence took place—the house belongs to Mr. Grant, and Mr. Hardy collects the rents.</p>

I do not practice generally—to the, best of my knowledge the prisoner was in the workhouse three or four days—I do not know whether he had been a pensioner at Chelsea Hospital—I always look at the order. which describes what they are—I have certified the cause of insanity, and I certified intemperate habits, but that is no part of my duty—I certify the cause to the best of my ability, but I do not think I certified it in this case—the cause of insanity was filled up by the relieving offieer—I formed the opinion that the cause of insanity was in<lb/>temperate habits and sunstroke—I have not been to, see him in prison—there is a clause in the certificate which is filled up by the relieving officer I do not mean to say that if a person inserted that, he was insane by reason of intemperate habits that I should sign that—we are not called upon to give the cause, but I form the opinion that the cause of insanity was intemperate habits—I have no doubt that a person so suffering would recover, under proper treatment and absence from drink—I say that the drink and excitement would have a teridency to cause the insanity to recur—I should certainly call it insanity if he had been suffering from insanity for a time, and then have led on ordinary life, and broken out into violence again and committed a crime—he might be insane two or three hours or two or three days—whether I should call it passion is a very difficult ques<lb/>tion to answer—if a man only broke out and committed an act of violence I should not consider that a sufficient cause to send him to the asylum—I should want some strong evidence; but looking at the man's antecedents,' and knowing what I do know, that would guide me—I should not judge from the act alone that it was, an insane act; I should look at his ante<lb/>cedents and his general course of life to see whether he was a sane or an insane man.</p>

He was in a depressed state in May, 187-5, and very melancholy—he had a self-inflicted wound on his arm and was suicidal—those things and the sunstroke led me to the conclusion that he was unfit to be at large—I do not distinctly recollect where I got the information from about the sunstroke, but I understood that he had had it in India—I saw him almost every day and conversed with him—at times he was wan<lb/>dering and incoherent, and at other times, he was rational—the self-inflicted</p>

               <p>wound, coupled with the melancholy and despair he "was in led me to call it a suicidal mania—it was feared that if he had the opportunity he would commit suicide—the period in which I should anticipate, his recovery, would depend upon what took place in the asylum—he would perhaps recover in three or four months, or less—from what I saw when he went to the asylum, I believe three or four months quiet there, with proper treat<lb/>ment, would restore him—I have not seen him since that period—if a man was in the habit of getting intoxicated and losing all control over his actions I should not consider that temporary. insanity—I confine my evidence to the insanity which is produced by the constant habit of drink—that species of insanity would be intermittent.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 1, Westbourne. Street—on 8th May, 1875, I attended the prisoner—he was very desponding, and had a tendency to commit suicide—he was suffering from disease of the brain, and in my judgment he was unfit to be at large, and I directed them to get the parish surgeon to see him and send him off to the work-house, and I believe Mr. Webb,. the parish surgeon, saw him. and sent him to Mount Street workhouse—I saw the wound on his arm and. put the ligatures in' and took out the blood vessel it was in the fore arm—it was a large incised wound about four inches long—I. had some conversation with him about it,; he said that he wished to die, and he wanted to go to heaven, and that some spirit came down and told him to do it, pointing to the ceiling as far as I recollect, but it is so long ago.</p>

I did nor form the opinion that it was Delirium tremens, his tongue was clean—I enquired into the came of it, and Had, a conversation with his wife—I formed the opinion that it was partially Caused by excessive drinking, but not wholly—I am informed by the wife That he had sun stroke—I did not learn that he continued in the Army After that for his full term—it was a case of insanity from which, in my Judgement he might recover for a time hut I should not say that he Would be safe—he would most decidedly be a dangerous man if he got Drunk—I only saw him on that one occasion—i have not seen him on this Case to see his present state. Re-examined. His wife told me that he had gone on in a very ex<lb/>raordinary manner, called her very bad names, and said she was a very Bad woman, and that she thought he was mad. The Jury after having consulted for an hour, sent a letter to <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON HAWKINS</hi>, who sent for them and said, "Gentlemen, I have had a communica<lb/>tion from you and I understand your question, to be this that having no evidence of the actual state of mind of the prisoner at the time he committed the act, you wish to know whether you may entertain a presumption of insanity: it is my duty to tell you that, the law presumes that every man is responsible for his action, and if you have no evidence at all as to the state of mind of the prisoner at the time he caused this catastrophe, you are bound to say he is guilty, if you believe that he caused the act of death. A man who wants to shift from himself the responsibility he incurs by causing the death of another, is bound by affirmative evidence to satisfy the Jury that, at the time he com<lb/>mitted the acct, he did not know the character of the act he was doing, and did not lnow he was doing a wrong act; it is for him to prove it, and if he fails to prove it to your satisfaction, you have no alsernative but to find him guilty of the offence, that is the law on the subject." THE JURY. "Failing the evidence of the actual state of his mind, we follow your Lordship's ruling, and find him.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 74 cheapaide, City, and am buyer to Edward George Wood, of the same place an option—I has not seen the prisioner to my knowledge until he was arresed—on 14th August, I received this letter by post. (This inquired the price of magic lanterns, and the terms for hiring slides, and was signed William Clarke master of the British School at ware and honorary secretary to the managers) I replied to that letter and on 16th september I received this letter from the prisioner (This oredered a pair of lanterns and other articles and two coureses of slides for hire) I replied, and I then received a further letter from the prisioner dated 19th september, and also a further one dated 25th September—the first parcel of goods was sent off to the prisoner on 22nd September, a second lot on the best of my recollection the lanterns and screen form<lb/>ing part of the present charge, and the third lot a screw frame and slides, not included in the indictment—the goods were sent under the belief that they were ordered with thier uasual business transactions—the value of the goods in the indictment is about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the value of the whole about 35l—an invoice was sent with the goods presumed to be sold, and a loan ticket with those hired—the illustrations which we expected to receive back have been recovered—those sent as sold are in the hands of the police—on the Monday subsequently shut up and the porisoner nowhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-exmained.</hi> Some of the goods are now in our possession, and the others are in the hands of the police; none are missing—when I went down to ware, I did not ascertained where the prisioner had gone, or the reason he had left—a portion of the goods we has sent were found at the railway station "To be left till called for"—I came up to town and obtained the assistance of an officer, and I ultimately ascertained that the prisoner had gone to Bury.</p>

Teep, 10, Aldgate "—Wiggins &amp; Teep is the name of the firm; they carry on business in the name of Downing Carter"—Hart gave his address, 76, Prescott Street, and said he carried on the trade of a bookbinder at Ford Street, Spitalfields—I afterwards went with Wright to Ford Street, and found a quantity of leather cut up for use, apparently for bookbinding—it resembles the kind of leather found in the parcel—I found four and half reams of paper in his room in Prescott Street—Bright's address was correct.</p>

"—he said "Leather "—I said "Where did you get it from? "—he said "I bought it of a man"—"I said "What man?"—he said "I don't know "—I took him to the station and took the leather out of the parcel—I said to Bright, who was in custody, "How do you account for this?"—he said "I took it from my employers, Messrs. Wiggins &amp; Co, 10, Aldgate "—Wolsey was present when he said that and the inspector in the room—Hart was at the station when that was said—the address he gave at Prescott Street was correct—I said to Hart "Don't you go by the name of Skid-more" is not your right name Skidmore?"—Ke said "Yes, I cany on business at 6, Ford Street, Spitalfields, as a bookbinder"—I found some more leather there corresponding with this produced—the other constable—searched the other place.</p>

He said that he could not swear that the word "sale "was in his writing—the Judge said that it was clear that "sale "was in the same hand writing, and called his attention to that receipt—he still continued in his former state<lb/>ment without giving the slightest explanation—he said that he received 28,000 bricks from Mr. Newell, of Southall, and the rest he had from Waring Brothers, of Southall—he produced an invoice with no heading to it—the Judge said "I cannot tell where they came from, where is the heading to it?"—he said "They came from Waring Brothers, of Southall "—the Judge called his attention to a date in the invoice show<lb/>ing the bricks delivered to me under this trans<lb/>action with me and the trans<lb/>action to be subsequent to the delivery to me—he was asked whether he had paid for Waring Brothers' bricks—he said "Yes, I have the receipt at home on the file "—he was asked what he paid for them, and he said 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in gold and notes, which he paid to Messrs.'

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After the sale I saw that the prisoner was bankrupt, and I expected an application for the money in my hands from the trustees—I never heard of the bankruptcy being annulled—I took the usual means of ascertaining whether I could pay the money over safely, and I was referred to Mr. Newell, the judgment creditor—the questions about pay<lb/>ment were put by the judge—he said "You see there is 'unreserved' on the outside of the catalogue."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, I have a considerable practice in the Marylebone County Court—I was the solicitor for the prisoner in the case of Goodwin v. Gill—before the plaint was issued, I wrote a letter to the defendant asking for payment, I received the letter before you from the the present prosecutor, stating "I have no balance in hand in the above bankruptcy case;" dated 24th June, signed by the prosecutor—I obtained an order for inspection, and inspected the documents in Mr. Simpson's possession, where I, for the first time, saw this receipt containing the word* "unreserved sale "—that was a day or two before the action came on to be heard, and having seen that I gave up claim for 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and asked for a verdict for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I opened the case and said that, I had that difficulty to get over, viz., the receipt for "unreserved sale "—I had no receipts and Mr. Serjeant Wheeler said the defendant had behaved very badly in not giving us receipts, and the case must be adjourned for receipts as an auc<lb/>tioner should give receipts for goods received for sale—I asked in respect of the bricks for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether, in the plaintiff's presence and it was adjourned for the usual auctioneer's accounts, and when it came on on the adjourned hearing it proceeded on that footing, and when I only pressed for a verdict for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd the 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. claim was struck out so far as I know—I admitted the mistake in the affidavit, I distinctly referred the Judge to it—you know Serjeant Wheeler—he was very angry—it was after</p>

               <p>the Judge had addressed the prisoner, and after I had produced the receipt that, he was pressed whether he had given those directions for a reserved sale, for 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Mr. Serjeant Wheeler lost his temper—when he pressed the prisoner on this he still abided by what he had said—the prisoner was at that time very much excited—he had Mr. Serjeant Wheeler pitching into him, and Mr. Simpson too—he appeared extremely frightened and nervous like a witness who had rarely, or never been in a witness box, what he was doing—I was present at the police-court when Mr. Simpson made an applica<lb/>tion for a warrant, the. day after the trial, when it was refused by Mr. D'Eyncourt—he subsequently made an application to the Judge of the County Court, Mr. Serjeant Wheeler, in ray presence, to direct a prosecution and Mr. Serjeant Wheeler said—"Mr. Simpson, if you have that amount of experience which I credit you with, you will drop this matter. I have sat for fourteen years as the judge of a County Court, and I have never directed a prosecution, and I hope I never may do so, and I do not consider this a case," and he advised Mr. Simpson to go no further in the matter but to drop it—the summons was obtained the day after that before Mr. Mansfield.</p>

We had a few words and then he struck me first and went outside and said he would fight me for a sovereign. My father and young woman pulled me away and put me against the wall Then prosecutor turned round and struck Fisher and knocked him down, and was atop of him, and the policeman came up and took me in custody, This is an old spite he has against me.

Samuel Groome says:</hi>"On October 17th, I went home to bed, the prisoner came in afterwards and took hold of my trowsers to take some money, and began to hit me on the head and private parts, and blew the light out. I could not see if she hit me with any instrument, and I bled—I was in bed and it was after I got out that she struck me. The prisoner has threatened me before: <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. When she came in I was in bed. I did not get out of bed with a broom to strike her. Some halfpence dropped out of my trowsers when she took hold of them. I did not use a rake to strike her; I did not knock her teeth out; I had had a quarrel with her in the course of the day."</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live with my father at 18, Hinton Street, Pimlico—I have for some little time past been engaged to be married to a Mr. Henry Newman, who assists his brother in a hosier's shop in Chapel Street, about opposite to the Castle public-house—no female lives in the house, and on that account I am in the habit of walking outside the shop and meeting him—this is with my father's knowledge and Mr. Newman's parents' too—on Wednesday, 18th October, I went to meet Mr. Newman as usual—it was 9.35 when I left home—I got into an omnibus at Victoria Station and rode to the Marylebone Road—I went to the end of the Marylebone Road into the Edgware Road, and walked to the corner of Chapel Street, where I stood quite still—I was standing on the path, near the Castle public-house, which is in Chapel Street—I had turned the corner, and was waiting for Mr. Newman—I had been standing there for about two minutes, and had not spoken to anyone since I left home—the prisoner came up in uniform and said "What do you want?" or "Move on;" I am not certain of the words—I told him I was waiting for a friend—he said "What are you? you are only a common prostitute"—I told him that he</p>

               <p>was mistaken; that I was no such thing—I walked away in the direction of the Marylebone Road, the same way I had come—I caught sight of Mr. Schwenck and Mr. Bramhall before I went away, a few yards off, behind me—no disturbance of any sort had taken place up to that time in Chapel Street that I saw, nor had I been engaged in any—the policeman came be<lb/>hind me and took hold of the back of my neck with both hands—I began to scream and struggled to get away from him—my shawl was torn off and my hat knocked off—I did not know who it was when he first seized, me—I was not aware of his being behind-me—some other constables came up, and one of them took me to the station—I think I said "I have done nothing"—they were in uniform—I did not see anything of Mr. Schwenck at that time, but Mr. Bramhall put my hat on my head—I saw it was the same young man I had seen with Mr. Schwenck—I did not notice anything about the prisoner's helmet—at the police-station Inspector Scriven was on duty—I was put in the police-yard, and was then put into the dock with Mr. Schwenck—I never knew Mr. Schwenck before, nor had I seen him to my knowledge, or Mr. Bramhall—the prisoner then charged me with being a disorderly person and fighting with a woman in Chapel Street that was in answer to the inspector I believe—the inspector then read the charge over—I did not say anything—I did not know I might speak—I was very frightened—the inspector-asked—the prisoner where the other woman was, and he said she had gone away or he could not find her, I don't know which—I think the inspector said "Why did you bring her here then?" meaning me, and he said "Because she would not go away—I saw Mr. Bramhall there—I believe he spoke to the inspector, and the inspector told him to sit down—I was then locked up in a cell—when I got to the cell door I told the inspector I had done nothing, and he said "You should have told me that when I charged you; you must tell that before the Magistrate in the morning"—I believe he asked me if the address 1 had given him was correct—subsequently my father came and bailed me out, about 12.45 in the morning—on the following morning I surrendered at the police-court, when I was charged with being a disorderly person and creating a disturbance in Chapel Street—Mr. Schwenck was charged with me—he was charged with assaulting the police in the execution of duty—we were both put in the dock together, and the two charges were heard together—the prisoner was called and sworn as a witness—I believe I saw him sworn on the Testament by the usher—I heard him give his ervidence on this charge—he said that I was fighting with another woman in Chapel Street, and "When I told her to go away she said she would bring a better man than me to fight me," and, speaking of Schwenck, he said he struck him on the back of the head and "knocked my helmet off," I think—Bramhill was afterwards examined as a witness—the Magistrate said "Was she fighting?" and the prisoner said "Yes, she was"—I gave my account of the occurrence and was discharged—I was not riotous or disorderly in Chapel Street, or quarelling or fighting with any other woman, nor did I say to the prisoner I would bring a better man than him to fight him—I do not know anything about what Mr. Schwenck did.</p>

               <p>before I came up—he said "What do you want?" or "Movo on," I cannot say which—I told him I was waiting for a friend, and intended walking away—he then said "Why, what are you? you are only a common prosti<lb/>tute"—he did not say "Although you are waiting for a friend, you must move on"—I did not call him a "thing"—I did not say "I will not move on for a thing like you "—I was not excited until he insulted me; when he called me a prostitute I was not excited—I told him he was mistaken—I did not refuse to move on or threaten to slap his face, I am quite sure of that—I did not say "I shall go no further, and I will smack your face if you do not go away," or anything of the sort—he did not then say "I must take you into custody"—when I was walking away several persons came along passing by—he did not take hold of my left arm—he did not touch me until I turned into the Marylebone Road and then he caught me by the neck—I did not then drop down—I did not see Schwenck in the crowd, not till I was put in the dock at the station—I saw him with Bramhall when the policeman first spoke to me—I did not see Schwenck strike him on the back of his head and knock his helmet off; I do not know whether his helmet was knocked off—I did not complain at the station or make any charge against the prisoner of having assaulted me—I heard another policeman say that he saw Schwenck strike the prisoner—I was not dressed the same as now, I had a gray cross-over on—I have seen an advertisement in "The Daily Telegraph," which my father put into my hands—I believe the society authorised it to be put in.

I am a baker, of 75, Crauford Street, and work for my brother—I am twenty-one years of age—about 10 o'clock on Wednesday night, 18th October, I was with my friend, William Arthur Bramhall, passing down Chapel Street towards home and the Marylebone Road—I saw a policeman in uniform and I also noticed two young men and a young woman on the Lisson Street side of the railway-station—Lisson Street intersects Chapel Street and goes into the Marylebone Road—there was no fighting between women going on at that time—I afterwards ascertained that the prisoner was the man my attention was directed to—the persons I noticed were standing still—I heard one of the young men say to the prisoner that he did not like such nasty snacks as that and they walked away on the opposite side of Lisson Street; the station end, away from the Marylebone Road—the prisoner went on the opposite side, following them down Lisson Street—in consequence of what I had observed I watched him narrowly from that moment—he returned on the opposite side into Chapel</p>

               <p>Street, towards the Marylebone Road—he had to cross the road—he walked on the pavement on the same side as the Castle public house, at the corner of the junction between Chapel Street and the Marylebone Road—there was no disturbance of any kind going on in the street at that time—up to that time, as far as I know, I had never seen Miss Brown in my life—I first noticed her standing on the kerb opposite the Castle, going the opposite side of the road on which Mr. Newman's shop is—there—were no women near her—the prisoner went up to her and began talking to her, and presently I heard her say "I will let you know who I am "—I did not hear what he said to her—she spoke in a very indignant manner—two or three people began to get round and some young man advised her to go away, and she was doing so—she had just turned into the Marylebone Road when the prisoner went behind her and caught her by the back of the neck forcing her along for about 10 yards with his hands—she screamed very loudly and I went up to the policeman and said "Don't handle the girl so roughly as that"—he would not let go so T. took hold of bis arm and pulled it off her neck—I did not notice her hat and shawl—more constables off duty came across the road and the prisoner said "Hold that man; he has struck me on the back of the neck"—I did not strike a blow from first to last—I was carried off to the police-station leaving Miss Brown in. the constable's hands—she was kept in the yard—nearly a quarter of an hour before she was put in the dock with me—Inspector Soriven was engaged with some other parties in the yard at the time—when I was in the dock with her I heard the Inspector ask the prisoner whose charge it was—he said that it was his—that she had been disorderly and fighting with another woman in Chapel Street, and that I had struck him on the back of the neck, knocking his helmet off—I was" locked up and was let out on bail ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after—I surrended the following morning before Mr. Mansfield and was put in the dock on the case coming on—I saw the prisoner go "into the witness box—he was sworn—he said that Miss Brown was disorderly and fighting another woman in Chapel Street, and that when he told her to move on she said she would bring a better man than him to do for him, or some such words as that, and that I had struck him on the back of the neck—I made my statement and Miss Brown hers—Mr. Bramhall was then called as a witness—I think Mr. Mansfield asked the prisoner where the other woman was—I was discharged—his statements that Miss Brown was disorderly and quarrelling or fighting with another woman and that I struck him were all untrue.</p>

I went to the police-station with them—the inspector asked me what I wanted, in the prisoner's hearing, and I said "I have come to see my friend righted "—he pointed to a chair and told me to sit down, in a very surly manner—I sat down as he told me—I had never seen Miss Brown before—I went to the police-court the next day and I gave my evidence as I have given it to-day, and the charge was dismissed—I heard the prisoner say in his evidence at the police-court that, Miss Brown was fighting and riotous and disorderly, with another woman, and that she said she would find a better man than him to fight him, and that Schwenck had struck him on. the back of the neck—none of which was true—I was not near enough to hear her say she would "find a better man "—I was under the impression then, that she said something about smacking his face as we walked by her—I do not know exactly what she said.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Harris.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector D</hi>). On the evening in question I was on duty at the Marlborough Street police-station—at 10.20 Sarah Brown and Henry Schwenck were brought in by defendant, <hi rend="italic">D</hi> 171, and <hi rend="italic">D</hi> 141—he said he charged her with being disorderly and creating a disturbance in Chapel Street, and fighting with another woman—I asked him where the other woman was and he said she had got away. (<hi rend="italic">The witness deposition was read to him, and confirmed</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. Not a single word of complaint was made by either Miss Brown, Schwenck, or his friend Bramhall, of any ill-treatment on the part of the constable—I remember Schwenck's mother coming to bail him out; Bramhall was in my office—I said to him "It is a great pity that young men should go and get themselves into these disgraceful quarrels?"—he said "We have done nothing"—I said "What do you mean, done nothing? "and he said "The young woman did nothing, only threatened to slap the constable's face, and all Schwenck did was to give him a bit of a shove "—Chapel Street and all the neighbourhood is the worst part of Lon<lb/>don, infested with thieves and prostitutes—we have had numerous com<lb/>plaints from the railway people—the superintendent has gone there himself to see what is going on—I should say where this took place is about 60 yards from the railway-station, it may be more, but I question whether it is—we have also many complaints from the respectable inhabitants of the neighbourhood as to disorderly persons assembling—it was not the prisoner's duty alone to prevent persons assembling, but every man's and they would have special instructions to do so—the clock struck 10 o'clock as I marched the seventy-five men out for relief—the prisoner was perfectly sober when he came into the station—a few minutes after 11 o'clock, after Schwenck had been released from custody on bail I went to see him again to satisfy myself that I was not mistaken; he had been nearly five years in the force and was a very quiet, harmless, and inoffensive, good-tempered man—the duties of a constable in that neighbourhood are very onerous and arduous to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner said "She tried to slap my face," so that Bramhall would have heard his statement before he said "All she had done was to threaten to slap the constable's face"—I have a knowledge of Rat<lb/>cliffe Highway and Fleur-de-Lis Street, and the Dusthole, Woolwich; I should say the whole neighbourhood was not worse than Fleur-de-Lis Street—I did not take Miss Brown for a disorderly prostitute, I never made that mistake—it is a shortened beat near the railway-station—he had no special instructions beyond what they all had doing duty in that particular street.</p>

I am a tailor, of 127, Seymour Place—on the night in question I was coming flown Chapel Street' from the Edgware Road about 9.50 or 9.49—I saw some women at the corner of Lisson Street apparently quarrelling with each other, pushing or striking each other, and using angry language; it was a street row—the prisoner went to the women and sepa<lb/>rated them; he then followed one towards the Edgware Road, and then returned, when I saw Miss Brown standing at the other side of the street—he went up to her and said "Now, miss, you must move on," pointing towards the Marylebone Road, desiring her to go the reverse way to the other woman—she said "I am waiting for a friend "—he said "I can't <hi rend="italic">help</hi> that, I am placed here to prevent women from loitering about"—she went on a little further and then turned round and said "I shan't go "—then she went a little further and gradually went on towards the bottom of the street and said "I shan't go, I am waiting for a better man-than you, who would soon make you take yourself off," and then she proceeded a little further towards the bottom of the street by a public-house there, I don't know the name—previously to her getting to the bottom of the street a young man said "You had better go, you will get into trouble, miss"—when she got to the bottom of the street opposite to the public-house she turned round and said "I shan't go any further for a thing of a policeman like you; I shall smack your face for you "—there were a number of persons about, twenty or thirty; I should call it a crowd—the prisoner then said "I must take you into custody," and he took hold of her left arm with his left hand and placed his right hand upon her shoulder—she screamed then—she attempted to fall down; she looked as though she was falling down—her hat slipped off, but what became of it I don't know—more people approached, hearing the screams—Mr. Schwenck then came up and said "Leave her alone; let her go "in a quick manner—the prisoner still kept hold of her and Schwenck struck the prisoner behind about here (<hi rend="italic">at the back of the head</hi>), which caused his helmet to fall off—another policeman came up and took Schwenck in custody—the police used no violence whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Besley. I could not have acted more gently my<lb/>self—he could not have spoken more quietly or nicely to her—from the time he said "Now, miss, you must move," I heard all—I swear I did not hear him say "You are a common prostitute "—I was not examined at the police-court—I read of this case last Sunday week—I am a voluntary witness—I sent to Mr. Berkeley, the solicitor, last Friday week—I know Schwenck—I read in the paper of Schwenck being charged on the 19th October—I saw him taken into custody—Mr. Berkeley is the first person to whom I stated I would give evidence—I hare not got a beer-shop—it is a beer-shop where I carry on business—sometimes policemen come into the beer-shop in uniform and have what they want—sometimes I see them—Miss Brown was in Chapel Street, the Edgware Road side of" Lisson Street, when the occurrence first took place—I cannot swear to Miss Brown individually</p>

               <p>—I did not take sufficient notice then—the woman I have been talking about is the one that was taken into custody—I mean Miss Brown—the person who was taken into custody on the Edgware Road side of Lisson Street was very much like Miss Brown, but I cannot swear to her being the same—she was in the crowd when she objected to move on—he separated the two women—I supposed it was Miss Brown I afterwards saw taken into custody—she had moved to the opposite corner when he said "Now, miss, you must move on"—he divided the women and followed one up the Edgware Road, and when he came back one of them (I suppose it was one of the same) was standing at the corner of Lisson Street—there are two corners to the street, and she moved to the opposite side—there is a wall this side and a tailor's the other, the name of Bishop—I swear that at the corner of Lisson Street, on the public-house side, there was a woman to whom he said "Now, miss, move on," and I kept her under observation; following within a few yards—I swear it was the same person who was taken into custody in Chapel Street—it might have been a dozen yards away from the corner of the Marylebone Road, or a yard or two more—it was opposite the public-house—I do not swear that Schwenck did not say "Don't treat the girl so roughly; she has done nothing"—I heard her say "Let me go; I have done nothing "—I did not see two young men and a young woman to whom the prisoner spoke, or hear one of them say to him in return "I don't like such nasty snacks as that," or see them go down Lisson Street and the prisoner following within a few yards—the police-court is in Seymour Place, three turnings off the beer-shop, perhaps 250 yards—the beer shop is not just opposite—it was kept by my wife's father, but he is dead—it was left to my wife by the executors, but the affairs are not settled yet—I had been to the City that night, and I came home by the underground railway to Chapel Street—I got in at King's Cross—I tried to find a friend of mine who lived in the neighbourhood—I went to see a friend in Gracechurch Street, an omnibus driver who I knew from a lad; one of Mr. Ball's omnibuses from Brixton—I went into one public-house at the corner of Eastcheap with this <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> driver, just before six o'clock—from there I went to Finsbury to try and find a friend—I proceeded through the City and called to see a friend of mine who lives in some large buildings I forget the name of, an umbrella maker—I went in there and spoke to him—I then went to King's Cross station and there saw another friend and had another glass of ale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I daresay the beer-house will come to me—it was after the row that I saw the young woman at the opposite corner of the street—I saw an account in the paper of Schwenck being taken in custody and being brought before the Magistrate, and Mr. Berkeley's name who is well known in the Marylebone Road, upon which I sent to him—I was not got by any advertisement.</p>

On the evening of the 24th July, I was fetched to Southall Bridge—I got there a little before 7 o'clock—I saw a bundle lying on the grass by the side of the road, near the bridge about 30 feet from the bridge—I opened it and found the body of a female child; it was naked—it was tied up in what appeared to be the clothes of the child, which were torn down behind—they were the things that have been produced to-day, including the socks and shoes which were on the feet—I removed the bundle to the Leonard Arms public-house—as I noticed it I found that the legs were up on its chest, all close together, so that the legs actually rested on the chest—I had the child washed that night; I noticed that the left arm was very black—I showed the body to Mr. Bott, the surgeon, the same night, between 9 and 10 o'clock, and on the following Wednesday, the 25th, I showed it to Mrs. Brittain, and on the 28th to Mrs. Bull—at the sametime they saw the clothes that have been produced—on the 26th, I apprehended the prisoner, I found her picking peas in a field in. the parish of Aveling, belonging to Mr. Woodthorpe—that would be about two miles or two and a quarter miles from Southall Bridge, past Wennington—it is the</p>

On Tuesday, the 25th July, I went to look for the prisoner to take her to the inquest, to produce her as a witness—I found her in Mr. Earp's potato field—Sergeant Odam was with me—he is not here; I do not know that he is ill—he spoke to her first, and said "Young woman, we are given to understand you had a child in Kainham, on Wednesday last"—the prisoner replied "I never had a child"—I then said "It appears to be wrong what we understand about your having a child in Rainham"—the prisoner said "I never had a b——kid"—we then left the field to go towards the Leonard Arms public-house, where the inquest was held—on the way I said "It appears to be wrong what we understand about your having a child in Rainham"—she said "I brought a child through Barking on Wednesday"—I asked her if it was a boy or a girl, and how it was dressed—she said it was a girl, that it was dressed in a black hat, a black and red frock, a flannel petticoat, and a white chemise; and she also stated that she had the child on the Wennington Road on the Thursday morning, and gave it to a woman to take care of, and she was to meet her on the following Wednesday night—that was all that was said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at Aveling—I saw the body of the deceased child on the evening of the 24th July, somewhere between 9 and 10 o'clock, at the Leonard Arms, Wennington—it had then been taken out of the" wrapping that it had been in, and was lying naked on some straw, stretched out—the legs were not then doubled up—I made an external examination of it—it was a female child about two or two and a half years old—it was exceedingly decomposed and very much discolored—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the 25th, before I was examined at the inquest—on removing the scalp there was an appearance of some effusion of blood, under the eyebrow, under the region of both eyes—that might have occurred before death, but I should not like to give a positive opinion upon that point; it might have been a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearance—the brain was healthy though too much decomposed to say anything about it—there was a certain quantity of dark blood—the vessels of the skull were filled with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200087"/>
               <p>dark blood—I do not think that conld have been a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> occurrence—it would rather tend to shew that there had been some asphyxia—it might have been the result of suffocation, but I do not think it was, that ap<lb/>pearance was not consistent with its having occurred after death—in death from suffocation I should expect to find the vessels and the brain gorged—the veins of the skull are generally more or less filled with blood, but they were rather more so on this occasion—I found no injury to the skull itself—on opening the chest I found that the organs were very much decomposed, and judging from the condition of her I was of opinion, and I still am of opinion that the death was from fainting, because the heart was empty—that is sometimes called syncope—the heart was very pale, but I have since found it is quite possible that the emptyness of the heart, although not the paleness might have been caused by <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> changes, not from immer<lb/>sion in water but simply by accumulation of gases in the cavities of the heart distending it, forcing out the blood before it had coagulated—I do not think that that would affect the color, this heart was markedly pale—the stomach was full of semi digested food—I found no water in the stomach—I should generally expect to find that in a case of death from drowning, and I should also expect to find frothy mucus, I found none—as far as I could judge, the other viscera were healthy—the right arm was broken about the middle—the bone was splintered very much—the ap<lb/>pearance on the outside of the left arm was much blacker and darker than any other part of the body; I mean the external mark—the right arm was also broken about the same place, and the bone was very much splintered—there was a large effusion of blood, and the whole of the tissues were infiltrated with black blood—I could not trace the opening where the blood came from, but from the condition of the parts I considered that it came from one or more of the chief veins of the arm—I imagine that was caused by the veins being lacerated by the broken splinters of the bone—I formed the opinion that the child had died, from syncope and from loss of blood from the veins in the arm.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. The appearances I saw about the arm and the blood were quite inconsistent with <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances—they must have happened from injuries inflicted during life—at the time I considered that the child had been put into the water after death, and judging from all the collateral circumstances I think so still—I have since discovered from my reading that the heart will empty itself after death, but my opinion is still strong that the child did not die from drowning—the effusion of blood under the eyebrow might have been caused by a blow or it might not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The body was in a very advanced state of decompo<lb/>sition—that generally makes it more difficult to ascertain whether wounds are <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> or not—I do not make any exception in this case; it is a general rule—both arms were broken; I am not prepared to say that might not have been a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> injury—the right arm might have been broken before or after death—a fall of nine feet might have broken it—I say that the wound on the other arm was before death, because of the condition of the tissues; they were so thoroughly infiltrated with blood; it seemed to have Boaked through into the system—after death copious bleeding will not as a rule toke place, and it does not soak into the tissues in the manner this had done; it had infiltrated into the minute interstices of the tissues.</p>

               <p>occasioned before death, and also because the tissues were so thoroughly infiltrated with blood—it had soaked into it and into the tissues itself, and into the true skin—the child was not suffering from any disease that 1 could discover—there was a slight red patch in the colon, that might have been the result of diarrhoea after measles, but it was most probably <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—the liver was very much decomposed, but as far as I could tell it was healthy—I did not see the legs bent up—it would not be a matter of any very great difficulty to bend a child's legs.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at North End, Saffron. Walden, and am a game-watcher in the service of Lord Braybrooke—on 7th October I saw the head keeper Chandler, and Barker and I afterwards went to the Allotment Gar<lb/>dens and into Warner's field—it was about 7.30 after we came back out of the lane—we then returned into Warner's. field and saw the prisoner at the bottom of the field meeting us—he had two lurchers with him, or something of that species—Barker spoke first; he asked him what he did there with those two dogs—the prisoner said that he was going that way—Barker said "No, you will have to go with us to Chandlers"—the prisoner slid him<lb/>self down on the ground and said he would not—Barker asked him his name and he gave him a wrong name; I do not know what name it was, but it was not Tugby—Barker then said "Your name is Tom Tugby"—he said "I know it is, your name is b——y <hi rend="italic">Bean</hi> Barker"—we both took hold of him and pulled him up on his feet as well as we could and he slid himself jown three different times, he getting down and we pulling him up—Barker asked him where he would go—he said he would go to the police-station—we pulled him and he stood up and then he gave a chuck away, got himself away from me, and twisted round with Barker, and his back was against Barker's back, I think, and I heard a blow struck against Barker, but did not see it; it was like this (<hi rend="italic">striking a book</hi>)—Barker then said "Oh! I'm stabbed with that knife, Last, knock him down;" I saw no knife—as soon as he cleared himself from Barker he struck at me and something touched</p>

               <p>me across the breast; I do not know what it was, but it was either his hand or something in his hand; there was no cut on my clothes—I knocked him down at that instant with my stick; I hit him by the side of the head—I then turned back and picked up Barker's stick, which was on the ground, and gave it to him—the prisoner was rising from the ground when I turned back and he said "I will kill both of you b———y b———s "—I then hit him again on the side of the head with the same stick; I have not brought the stick here; I set it down at the station and left it there; I am not quite sure whether it was as big as this stick, but it had no nob; it was ash wood—I hit the prisoner a second blow as he was rising; he was not rightly on his feet—he then laid still, and I turned him over to search for the knife—I felt about where he fell and about his things, but I did not find any knife—I took nothing out of his pockets—I took Barker to the surgery, he was bleeding so that he could not stand up; he was bent down on one side like this; I assisted him to Mr. Stear's surgery in Saffron—Walden; he was attended there by the assistant and was afterwards seen by Mr. Stear—it was about 8 o'clock when we left Warner's field—I went back to the field that same night and Creffield came there after I was there—I pointed out to him the spot where that had taken place—we searched. for the knife for a little while, but could not find it—it was neither dark nor light, it was very dull—the field is meadow land.</p>

Who are you?"—he said "I am an inspector of police, open the door, I want to speak to you"—he said "What do you want me for?" "I want to speak to you about a coat that has been stolen "—he said "I shall not open the door;" I heard his footsteps going to the back door, and just as it was going to open I pushed myself in and found him about to open it—I found inside the house the coat produced—I searched the prisoner and found this whip thong in his right hand jacket pocket—I also produce a lot of groceries which I received from the prosecutor's wife next morning.</p>

               <p>work. I said I had no work that I thought would suit them. I then drove away in my pony cart and left the two prisoners standing there; I drove into the main road towards Chatham. In about four minutes I looked towards the farm, and I then saw that some straw was on fire just about where I had left the prisoners standing. I drove at. once to the fire and the prisoners were not there. From the time I left the straw until I got back it did not exceed more than four or five minutes. When I reached the stack I saw nobody there. I called for assistance, and James Barton, Wilkins, Dixon, and several others came in about seven or eight minutes. I observed the two prisoners helping putting out the fire; we were unable to put out the fire, from the loose straw that was burning. The fire then communicated to a straw stack and from thence to the barn, and burnt until the next, day. Altogether I had destroyed, the straw stack, barn, two vans, a cart house, a bullock house, a stack of clover, a stack trefoil, a stack of sanfoin, and about 50 quarters of wheat in the barn, and about 100 bushels of clover seed, and some farming implements.

I am a labourer, residing on the Beacon at Chatham—on the afternoon of 27th July I was at Mr. Stunt's farm, at the stack-yard, about 2.30 or 2.45—I saw Mr. Stunt there and the two prisoners—I heard them ask Mr. Stunt for a job—they were then close to my elbow and close by the stack-bottom that caught fire first, and about a foot from the stack itself—the bottom of the stack is the rubbish that lies at the bottom after the stack has been threshed, to keep the corn from the ground—it had been a large wheat stack, and the loose straw had not been cleared up—I went away, leaving the prisoners there—I had seen them be<lb/>fore that at the left hand of the fodder stack,' the trefoil, and one of them asked me if that was the master, pointing to Mr. Stunt, and I said "Yes"—when I left the yard I went out into the pea-field, which is towards Rainham—I was between 10 and 11 rods away when I saw the prisoners come be<lb/>tween the two stacks and come into the pea-field and pick some peas to eat—that was about three or four minutes after I had seen them with Mr. Stunt—I then saw them go out into the main road, as if they were going to Rainham—I went further on to go to my work, and had got about 20 rods out in the field, when I turned round, and saw a body of smoke coming from the stack-bottom right up over the fodder stack—I ran at once and gave the alarm of fire—I got there in two or three minutes—I found the stack-bottom on fire between 2 and 3 yards from the fodder stack where I had been the prisoners standing.</p>

It was the loose straw that was left behind after the stack had been removed, that was on fire; there was no stack on fire when I got there Mr. Stunt was—there before me—the loose straw was about 4 yards from the fodder stack; that was the nearest—the next was the straw stack; that was close to it—there was grass between the stack<lb/>bottom and the fodder stack, but there was litter of straw besides all the way between—I and Mr. Stunt assisted to put the fire out—I did not see</p>

               <p>anyone leaving there, or in the vicinity—other men came up, but I did not see anyone there when I got there—I can't say which way the wind was—there was a wind; it was dry, hot weather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE DENMAN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">expressed a doubt whether upon this evidence the prisoners could be convicted of setting fire to the stack; all that was done was to set fire to the loose straw, and although the fire ultimately spread and consumed the stacks, it required affirmative evidence to show that such a result was in-tended</hi>. Mr. Avoby <hi rend="italic">submitted that the prisoners must be held to intend what was the natural and inevitable consequence of their act, viz., the catching fire of the stack from the straw</hi> (see "Queen <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Price," 9, Carrington &amp; Payne, page 729). Mr. Gill <hi rend="italic">contended that it was not a question whether the prisoners acted recklessly or with criminal negligence; there must be evidence of the letting fire to whatever was charged in the indictment. He referred to</hi>" Reg. <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Judd," 2 Term Reports, 255, <hi rend="italic">and the case of</hi> "Beg. <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Child," I Law Reports, Crown Cases Reserved, page 307, <hi rend="italic">was also referred to. In leaving the question to the Jury at the close of the case</hi>, Mr. Justice Denman <hi rend="italic">said that if they were satisfied that the prisoners could not have fired the straw without the intention of further mischief, then they should find them guilty; the mere fact of setting fire to the straw would not of itself be sufficient, as the charge was setting fire to the stack, but if they were of opinion that they purposely fired the straw, utterly reckless whether the stack was burnt or not, in that case he should hold, for the purpose of the day, that that might be equivalent to an intentional setting fire to the stack, he would reserve the question if necessary</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). I did not myself see the stack threshed out—I saw the prisoners assisting, with others, to put the fire out—I should say that was about five minutes after I got there—I saw them both together, and spoke to them—I merely said "How are you?" no more—the fire was not put out; it spread to all the three stacks and farm buildings—the fodder stack was the first that caught after the stack-bottom, and the next was the olover—we call clover fodder in our part of the country—I have heard it called clover hay—a stack of straw was close to the clover, and as the flames ran it caught the straw—when I first saw the prisoners speaking to Mr. Stunt there was no one else in the yard so far as I could see.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was about 2.30 or 2.45—I had not been in the stack yard that morning before—I had been cutting peas with my family—a spot was afterwards pointed out to me by my son where he found a box of matches—I saw the prisoners go right by that spot as they walked from the stack yard to the pea field—it might be 2 yards or 1 1/2 yards—I can't tell how many labourers Mr. Stunt had in his employment that day—no one was working in the stack yard that day that I am aware of; no work was being done there—the stack had been threshed out on the Tuesday—the fire occurred on Thursday—I had been away from the stack yard all the morning, and only came there at 2.30—I went there to speak to Mr. Stunt, and then saw the two prisoners—I was between four and five minutes speaking to Mr. Stunt; I then left him and went across the pea field—the nearest men working to the stack yard were about 40 rods off—when I first saw the prisoners they were coming out of the main road to<lb/>wards the farm—I don't know which way they had come—they waited while I spoke to Mr. Stunt—they did not follow me into the pea field; they came in the same direction after they had spoken to Mr. Stunt—that would be the proper way to Rainbam—I had got between 10 and 11 rods before I'</p>

               <p>looked back, and then I saw them picking peas in the field; they were hardly a minute doing that—there was a shed in the stack yard, a barn, a cow lodge, another lodge, and a stable—the stack were away from them; it might be 2 yards—I don't know whether there was anybody in the sheds when I was in the stack yard speaking to Mr. Stunt—Mr. Stunt was the first person that got into the stack yard after the fire—I did not see any<lb/>body else when I got there—I did not stand to look—assistance came almost immediately—Mr. Stunt told me to go and get a pail, which I did, and pumped the water, and by that time there were other persons there—I can't tell in what order they arrived—the prisoners stripped to their shirts and took of their things to assist—I did not see Mr. Stunt leave the stack yard—I can't say whether the prisoners walked out immediately be<lb/>hind him.</p>

I am a labourer, residing at Lingfield, Surrey, that is adjoining the parish of Edenbridge—on Tuesday, 8th August, about 6 o'clock, I was drinking outside the Wheat Sheaf—a man named Budgen was there, and a woman who lived with him as his wife—the prisoner came there from 7.30 to 8 o'clock with a bagging hook which he put under the seat outside the house and said "That is a mark on some one to-night"—he called for a pint of beer, the landlord served him; he got into conversation with John Budgen and Phillis Palmer—Budgen was sober when he came in, but Phillis Palmer was not—there was some singing—the conversation was principally between the prisoner and Budgen, it was in some tongue unknown to me; they did not call it Indian; the other people called it French—I heard no remark from Budgen to the prisoner or from the prisoner to Bud<lb/>gen about being in India; they talked in the unknown tongue for half an hour, it seemed familiar to them, but not to me—they all three left together at 9.57, because that is the time for closing; that is Budgen, the prisoner, and the woman—after they had gone about a minute I took up the bagging hook; the prisoner had only then got about 3 yards away from the house; it was bound with a small hay band as he had left it; the landlord ordered me to give it to John Hickey, and I did so; the hay band was then on it the same as before; I did not try it to see that it was tight, but it was appa<lb/>rently tight; the prisoner was so near to me that I saw Hickey give it to him—I stood" in front of the Wheat Sheaf talking to my two mates, I bade them good night and went on my way home, which was the same way that the prisoner and the others had gone; they went on up the road and I saw John Budgen and the prisoner at Grayberry Lane.</p>

They stopped at the corner of Grayberry Lane—I saw them standing and talking together and could hear that they were talking, but was not close enough to hear their conversation—I got about 3 rods from them; I did not hear any quarrelling—I saw the prisoner take this bagging hook (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand and strike John Budgen on the back of the left leg; they were standing facing each ether—it was a very moonlight night and I could see very clearly—I saw the bagging hook in the prisoner's hand before he raised it over his head; I cannot tell you in what position he was carrying it till he brought it over his head; I did not see it till it was over his head and I cannot say whather he stood with it on his arm or by his side—I was not looking at them all the while, but I had. seen nothing done by the prisoner until I saw the bagging hook over his head—when he had struck the blow Budgen fell down on his back at the end of the lane, and called "Murder!" three times—he said "Oh, my life is taken away, murder!" and I never heard him speak afterwards—the pri<lb/>soner walked away a short distance and then he ran in the direction of Dorman's Land—he did not attempt to render any assistance, nor did he offer any explanation, so far as I heard he said nothing—I helped the deceased and called "John "two or three times, but he made no reply, and I believe he was dead—I knelt down by his side to see whether I could hear him breathe, but I could not—I then saw and heard blood flowing from his leg—i called Phillis Palmer—s in advance 6 or 7 rods up Gray<lb/>berry Lane; she left them talking; she came back to me—I did not find the hay band by the deceased, nor did I see any more of the hook that night—Phillis Palmer followed the prisoner along Dorman's Land Road about 150 yards, and she ultimately came back to the 'dead man—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the same description of hay band, but this is not the whole.</p>

I am a farm labourer, of Roxley—I saw the three prisoners together under a hedge on Sunday afternoon, 13th August, about half a mile from Roxley Hill—they had a basket with them—when I was coming over the stile one picks up the basket and puts it up behind—one says "What is the time?" and I say "4.55," and another said "What time are publics open?" and I said "6 o'clock"—I don't know what became of the basket.</p>

I am a superanuated rigger, of No. 3, Globe Lane, Chatham, and am in the employ of Daniel Barnard, licensed victualler, who keeps the Railway Tavern in High Street, Chatham; there is a music hall attached—it is my duty to lock up the premises at night—there is a wocden fence about 6 or 7 feet high enclosing the yard at the back, in which there is a gate which is always kept locked—the bar yard leads by a door down a passage into the concert-hall, it has a panel in it which is usually kept open—there is another door leading out of the concert room into the bar; there is an opening over it into the bar large enough for a man or three men to get in if they liked—I fastened up at about 11.5 on 4th October—I had nothing to do with the bar door, they lock that when they go to bed—on the 12th October I went in the yard at about 10.50 and discovered the prisoner in one corner with his hat slouched over his eyes and his arms folded—I asked what he was doing there, but what answer he made I don't know, being deaf—the performance was all over then—I took him to the</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. Barnard—on the morning of 5th October I got up at 5.20 and went downstairs and noticed one of the bar windows open, with a stick up under it; we always keep a stick under it when open, because there is no proper fastening—I turned round to make a report to the master and found the concert-room door was unbolted, and on searching over the place I found a large bundle of clothes behind the stage, done round with a handkerchief—the doors were all three unbolted, so that if a person were inside he could get out—there was a portmanteau there which looked as if the lock had been cut out.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. On the night of the 4th October I went to the hall. I don't know anything about the robbery. I picked the handkerchief and gloves up in the street, which I told the Magistrate. Of course any person might be walking along the street and pick up articles which might have been stolen. A good many evenings after the robbery I visited Mr. Bar<lb/>nard's music-hall, which several of his waiters know, and I daresay some of them saw me there five or six evenings. Do you think it probable that I should commit a robbery and go there every evening and be found on the premises a little more than a week afterwards if I actually committed the robbery, which I did not? The fence, instead of being 7 feet high, I should think, where I got over, is not more than 5 feet 6 inches; it is an old broken down, wooden fence.</p>

               <p>—we were quartered, on 11th October, at Fort Burgoyne, Dover—on that evening I was returning from town up by Doriston Place—I had been to several public-houses; the Saracen's Head, Beacon Street, was the last one; I saw several soldiers there, two of them were the prisoners; I left about nine o'clock; the two prisoners and others left at the same time; they went up the Old Castle Hill; I turned into an entry or passage to make water-while there I heard a shout towards the hill, I saw several soldiers round the prosecutor—the passage is about 30 yards from the lamp—the soldiers were beyond the lamp, going up the hill—I ran up to assist him and I saw something like a watch glitter on the prosecutor's waistcoat—I indentify the prisoners as two of the soldiers—I saw Prendergast struggling with the prosecutor—the men then ran down the hill towards me; I tried to stop them; they struck me against the wall and ran on towards the town—the prosecutor came running down and seized me; he said "I have been robbed, you are one of them and must come up to Fort Burgoyne "—I explained that I was not one of them, but was in the passage and tried to stop the men as they ran down the hill; I said if he would come with me to Fort Burgoyne I would give him the names of the prisoners—I have not the least doubt of their identity—one belongs to "F "and the other to "G "com<lb/>pany; I belong to "J "company—at Fort Burgoyne I was brought face to face with the prisoners in the guardroom—I was detained there till the prisoners were brought in—the officer asked me if I could identify the men; I identified both of them, and Prendergast then made a kick at my thigh, and if one of the guards had not kept him off it would have hurt me seriously.</p>

He was drunk and could not stand at all, and I saw the watch on the ground close to him, and I picked it up and put it in my pocket. I then went up to the Fort, and the sergeant of my com<lb/>pany ordered two men to take me to the guard-room, and while I was going I threw the watch away." <hi rend="italic">Jennings says:</hi>"Last night I was coming home to Fort Burgoyne, about 9.15; I had been in company with Prender<lb/>gast. We were coming home and had got as far as the Plough. I asked if he would have anything to drink. He said * No.' I then went in and had something myself. Prendergast went in and I overtook him where this scuffle was, that gentleman was drunk with his hat on the back of his Bead shouting. There was a lot of more soldiers pushing him about. I said to rendergast' Come on home; it's no use staying here.' We started a few paces and came up the hill. I heard him shout 'Help! picket!' There were some few more men of ours coming up the hill, and when they heard the gentleman shout they cried 'Holloa! what's the matter here Pren-' dergast ran away and I followed him, and I heard that gentleman say 'I have lost a 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. watch.' As soon as I heard that I went round to Fort Burgoyne. I got to bed and the sergeant of the guard and an escort, after I had been in bed a quarter of an hour, came and said 'Get up and dress.' I asked him what for. He said * I don't know. The adjutant has ordered you to be confined." When I got to the guard-room I saw Prendergast there. The adjutant and officer were talking to a gentleman like the prosecutor. I said to the sergeant 'Do you mind letting me speak to the officer to know what I have been confined for.' He said 'No, you will have to stop in the guard-room.' He took me into the cells and locked me up. At 12 o'clock, a policeman came and opened the door and said he should have to take me in custody with some more for robbing a man. I said 'I know nothing about it.' He locked me up."</p>

I was the clerk at Trinity Church, Tun-bridge Wells, Kent, in October—there is morning service thereon Wednesdays at 11 o'clock—on Wednesday morning, October 4th, in consequence of a communication I went to the church and found that two boxes had been removed from the wall and laid on the chairs on either side—the right hand box was forced open and empty—the left hand box was empty but not forced open—the box at the south door was open and empty, but not removed—the the box at the east door that was also empty but not removed—I went into the vestry and found this stick on the heathrug—I had not seen it before—a pane was broken in the vestry windows—I examined with the policeman the wall outside and under the vestry window—I found several scratches on the stones as if some hard instrument had been drawn across them—the wall was scratched—the boxes were all right the day before, but I cannot say if the vestry window was fastened outside.</p>

I am a lodging-house keeper at No. 2, Broadway Passage—Bray is one of my lodgers—on the evening of the row, I stood at my doorstep, intending to shut the door at 12 o'clock—I saw Bray come round the corner with a piece of paper in his hand—I came before him and stood in the passage—this was about a minute or two before 12 o'clock—he came in—there was fried fish and potatoes in the paper—I asked him if he was going up to bed—he said "Yes, light me a candle "—he took the fried fish and—potatoes upstairs; he generally did so when he was drunk—I locked the door after him; I locked him in—I noticed him at 9 o'clock next morning—I sat up till 1 o'clock—nobody, to my knowledge, went in or out during that time—I locked the staircase—I lock every one in to get the money—I saw him in bed next morning at 9 o'clock—the fried fish was gone—the assault was on the evening before he was locked up; I know that because Goodwin came and asked if Bray was in.</p>

I am the son of George Wray—I live at Woolwich, and am employed in the wire mills—I remember 8th October last, when I was standing at the door with my mother; I saw the prisoner, and my mother spoke to him about knocking my little brother about the Sunday before, and he began to cheek my mother and made faces at her, and I gave him a kind of knock with my fist—I do not know exactly where I hit him—he took up his knife and stabbed me with it—I saw the knife in his hands before he stabbed me—he struck me in the left side—he had the blade in his right hand—I think the blade was the downward side—I ran across the road to my mother, and hallooed out that I was stabbed—I then became insensible, and was carried off to the surgeon—the prisoner ran away, when my father ran after him—my father was not there at the time; he was washing him<lb/>self, and my mother called to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I never cheeked his mother at all. We came from school, and I went for a walk down Chapel Street and bought some apples, and was going down the street and Mrs. Wray said something to me about knocking her boy about the Sunday before. I made a face, but never said a word to her. The boy ran across the road and struck me and knocked me down. I never knew how it was done. I went home. I heard him say he was stabbed. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not knock him down; he did not fall down.</p>

I am a gunner in the C Field Battery of the Royal Artillery—on 8th October I was walking up Henry Street, and met the prisoner at the bar, paring his nails with a knife—the boy that was wounded was standing at the door, alongside of his mother—he ran across the street and struck the prisoner on the left shoulder, and the prisoner turned round and struck him here with a knife which he held in this way (<hi rend="italic">describing—he</hi> then ran away, after a minute or two.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas' Hospital—on 22nd September the prosecutrix was brought there about 10.30 at night—I received her and examined her—she had much swelling about both eyelids of the left eye; there was a large opening in the left eyeball, and some of the contents had escaped through the wound, the vitreous humour; the rent was about three quarters of an inch long—this knife might have caused it; it was more likely to have been done with some instrument than with a fist—she cannot see at all with that eye, the sight is quite destroyed—she left the hospital about 31st October and has been an out-patient ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon practising at Guildford—on Thursday evening, 6th July, I saw the body of this child at the County police-station; I afterwards <hi rend="italic">made.a, post-mortem</hi> examination of it—as far as I could judge from the condition of the heart and lungs the cause of 
death was suffocation; it was not caused by drowning in my opinion—in my opinion the child was dead before it was thrown into the water—on Sunday, 9th July, I saw Balchin at her house; I went there with Mr. Barker; I'said to her that I thought she looked very ill, and asked her—what had been the matter; she said she thought it was the change of life—I asked if she had lost a great deal; she said "Yes "—I then asked her when she was last confined; she said thirteen years ago—I said "Have you not been confined recently?"—she said "I am not conscious of having been—confined"—I said "Have you miscarried?" she said "Yes, twelve years ago "—I then asked her if she had any objection to being examined; she sad no, but she should like her own medical man—I asked her who her own medical man was—she said "Dr. Capron, of Shere—I said "I know Dr. Capron very well, we will go and see if we can get him to come"—Dr. Capron afterwards came—she asked me how it was she came to be suspected of having had a child—I said "Your mother has been taken into custody, and she states that she attended you at your last confinement on the Saturday previous, and that she afterwards brought the child in a basket and put it into the river; that is the reason why you have been suspected of having had a child "—she said "I assure you, Mr. Shollick it is quite false, I have not been confined."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She was very weak indeed, and very much blanched, in such a state as would result from great loss of blood—I began the con<lb/>versation with her at once on going in; I was alone with her; I had seen her before—she knew me, and so did her husband—I had not attended her before, but I had been called in in consultation with Dr. Capron and Dr. Taylor, of Guildford, to see her husband, who had fractured his legs; that</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D. and live at Shere—on 9th July I was fetched by Mr. Barker to see Balchin—I found her in bed and very weak; I told her she was suspected of having had a child, and I asked her if that was the case—she said if that was so she was not sensible when it was born—I asked if she had any objection to my examining her medically to see if that was the case; she made no objection—I examined her and came to the conclusion that she had been recently delivered of a child, within a week or ten days—I only noticed that she was feeble, she had evidently had a great loss of blood, nothing more—I found nothing else that attracted my notice—of course I looked at her breasts, that was part of my medical examina<lb/>tion; that was one of my reasons for saying that she had had a child—I had no doubt in my own mind of the fact—she said the first remembrance of consciousness she had was her mother saying "Good God, child, you are dying "—I asked if she had made any preparation with her mother before<lb/>hand to take the child away; that she denied—I think it is possible that as soon as the child was born she might have had excessive flooding, and she might be unconscious as to what became of the child afterwards—patients frequently from severe loss do faint away and are unconscious for some time—I should scarcely think she could have been unconscious of giving birth to a child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have never know such a case, I should think it im<lb/>possible—during the pains of labour. she must have been conscious of it; she would not be unconscious before the child was born except under excessive hemorrhage, which would be unusual before birth—such a thing might occur, but it is not usual—I think she must have been conscious that she was giving birth to a child at the time of its birth; she might have been unconscious a few minutes aftewards, and before the child was fully. born—I don't think she could suppose it to be a miscarriage; but that de-. pends upon whether the miscarriage takes place at an early or late period; at a very late period it may still be a living child of seven months, a child that breathed—I don't think it possible for her to be unconscious then—I examined the bed; there had been a considerable amount of hemorrhage, but of course I could not say when that occurred—she asserted that she was unconscious at the birth of the child—I did not hear her say that she saw no child at all—I had been her medical attendant for thirteen or fourteen years; I had never attended her for a confinement—I have heard it re<lb/>ported that the mother always attended on those occasions—my last attendance upon her was three or four months previously—she then came to me and complained that she thought she was undergoing a change of life—I treated her for that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If she had recovered from the fainting I do not think she could be unconscious of the fact that she had given birth to a child, or forget it.</p>

               <p>or directly after birth; if it occurred to such an extent as to render her unconscious, that unconsciousness might last some hours, it would depend on the amount of hemorrhage; if it lasted more than an hour I should say it would be of a serious nature, and it would be necessary to call in a medical attendant—severe hemorrhage would weaken her considerably and make her unconscious for some period, not for days, say twelve hours; not total unconsciousness, but a kind of faintness or weakness; she would be unable to take part in what was going on, or to know what other persons said.</p>

I am a coachman, and live at 1, Bromley Cottages, Castle Yard, Richmond—on 16th October, about 2.30 in the day, the deceased came into the bar of the Fox and Duck with John Stocker,—and said, "So help me God, I have killed <hi rend="italic">Bobbie;</hi>" that is the name the prisoner goes by, he asked Pieseley the potman, to go round to help pick him up, I went with him and James Kirkman to Mr. Wench's stable, and there saw the prisoner lying on the stones in the stable with his head on his arm—he looked as if he had been knocked down; I did not see any mark on him—he was lying quite still, I don't know whether he was insensible or not, the potman and Kirkman tried to pick him up—he said "He said get out of the way," which they did—after that Stocker came in and he stepped over him as he was lying and went to the corn bin, he then stepped back over him again and stood against the door post, and the prisoner got up and struck him in the face and knocked him down on his back on the gravel—they picked him up and carried him into the skettle ground of the Fox and Duck and set him on the form there—he was insensible—I saw him next afternoon dead—he was about 45 years of age; he was sober at the time, and the prisoner was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stone mason—on 4th August, I was at work at the new church Queen's Road, Kingston Hill—the prisoner was foreman of those works—on that morning he and the prisoner came on the scaffold<lb/>ing; I was about 16 or 20 yards from them—Fisher called out at the height of his voice for Morris to come up to the scaffolding—Morris said to me "There is something up I suppose "—he went up on the scaffold—as soon as he got on to the top of the scaffold I heard Fisher commence swearing at him about a stone that he had worked wrong, it was abusive language, he was very angry, indeed, he let his temper get the mastery of him—Morris said "It is no use making a row about it, it can be very soon altered"—he then said "What shall I do "—Fisher said "Go up and take up what job you like, I will have no more to do with you"—Morris then went down the ladder, he had two moulds in his hand—he went down the ladder and Fisher followed him down; I believe both were on the ladder at the same time—when they got about 3 or 4 yards from the foot of the ladder Fisher seemed to me to make a rush at him, and try to snatch the moulds with one hand and to take hold of Morris by the neck or shoulder with the other, and at the moment they both fell; there was a pail stand<lb/>ing in the way and Morris fell on to the top of the pail, and Fisher on the top of him—he cried out very loud "Oh, dear oh," with pain; apparently</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200147"/>
               <p>he could not get up—Fisher scrambled up as quickly as possible, almost as soon as he was down—a man from the other shop ran to Morris' assistance and picked him up, the moulds fell on the ground, someone picked them up, they were zinc moulds for the shape of the stone that Morris had been working; they were the property of the builders of the church, Messrs. Todd &amp; Saunders—I did not hear Morris refuse to give them up, but as Fisher was trying to get them he seemed to be holding them away from him; ho would have given them to him, only Fisher was so high in temper at the time; he would have been bound to give them up on Fisher's word being as he was foreman, and they were his masters' property.</p>

The death was from what I should call fatal syncopy in a time of great excitement—that my happen in the absence of blows; but if three severe blows had been dealt it would be almost certain to pro<lb/>duce that excitement of the heart, and that once produced might cause death—I think she would have lived on if she had not been in that excited state—she would have been likely to die at any time in any great excite<lb/>ment; in the absence of any great excitement she might have lived on—I think if heavy blows had been given even a second or so before death there would have been some appearance of them—I think death could not have been so sudden as not to produce some effusion under the skin, to be seen on a careful <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I don't say there would be any</p>

(Mr. Fulton <hi rend="italic">objected to anything stated in the prisoner's absence, but</hi> Mr. Justice Denman <hi rend="italic">considered the evidence admissible so far as it was in the nature of. a complaint or a declaration accompanying an act</hi>.)

I have taken more of it than you have "—he said he had given her two pills and taken two himself—then she complained of a dreadful pain in her heart; she continued unconscious then, a little at times she came to herself but very slightly—then she continued on in these convulsions until she died—she had fearful convulsions when the prisoner was holding her—she died at 2 o'clock; at that time she was perfectly drawn backwards the same as before—I was attempting to hold her—the prisoner was holding her all the time, and in one of the convulsions I and the prisoner had to hold her, and it was as much as we could do to keep her in the bed—she did not die when I was holding her; the prisoner was holding her then—she seemed to drop instantly after the dreadful convulsions—I gave her two dozes of the medicine that the doctor sent—I had not seen any sarsaparilla in her room, nor any bottle—there was no bottle left there after that night—Mr.—Smith, the coroner's officer, searched the room—the prisoner went away about 7 o'clock in the morning, and said he was going to telegraph down the line for somebody to be put on in his place—he came back in about half an hour, I think, and remained there I think until I sent him for the undertaker, which must have been about 11 or 12 o'clock—the coroner's officer took away the bottle of medicine which the doctor had sent, and also a pill-box from the</p>

(Mb. Beasley <hi rend="italic">proposed to ask when the witness saw the child again</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not known the deceased previous to the 21st August; he was quite a stranger to me, I saw her occasionally during the time she was with me—she would come down, say "Good morning," and so on; nothing more—she was in perfect health, she never complained—the prisoner visited her on several occasions, I never noticed anything quarrel-some between them—I was never in their room, nor heard them talking together—I never heard quarrelsome disturbances between them; I think I mentioned before the Magistrate about her complaining of the sarsaparilla on the 3rd; I am sure I did—she said it to me at the door—she got quite well again after that and in her usual health—when I was called in on the 10th, I did not notice her eyes particularly; she had them closed when in these convulsions, the same as they were when she died, I did not hold her hand at all during the convulsions—I did not notice whether they were cold or clammy—her convulsions were so strong it was impossible to hold her—I was a good deal disturbed in my mind to see her suffer so; her breathing seemed very hard, and she clutched her throat at one time and said she should be choked—her breath was almost suspended—her teeth were per<lb/>fectly clenched except when she was a little conscious, when she spoke; they were perfectly tight; a perfect fixture; as well as her hands; perfectly clenched—I did not particularly notice gnashing of the teeth, only the clenching of them, when in convulsions—I was' so excited, having the baby at the same time—after she died, round her mouth was perfectly black, when she had not been dead more than about two hours or so—I did not notice any froth or foaming about her mouth before her death—she wanted to be sick on one occasion and she could not—she repeated that on several occa<lb/>sions; she evidently felt very sick and the prisoner tried to move her to be sick, and then she went off in convulsions the moment she was touched—in the morning after her death her face and the side of her nose was very much swollen like soap-suds blown out of a tobacco pipe—I kept saying to the prisoner "Whatever is the matter with her 1 how she does suffer; the poor thing"—he said "Yes; she does "—he appeared to be distressed, but not so much as you would think—he sat on the side of the bed and held her the whole time, acting kindly towards her to every appearance—I sent for the doctor at 2 o'clock when she died; he did not say that night what she died of—from 9.30 till 2 she was partly conscious, and partly unconscious;</p>

               <p>but more unconscious than conscious—at one time she appeared to be quite conscious and to understand what was going on—that must have been about 12 o'clock or 12.30 as near as I can recollect—she spoke, and seemed as if she wanted to move; she tried to move herself and said that she would try and move to sec if she could be sick—she got up and put her hand to the end of the bed<lb/>stead to catch hold of it; after that she was a little conscious for some<lb/>time; not long; and then she went off into these fearful convulsions again—she was unconscious most of the time, and she was unconscious at the time of her death—Mr. Miller came about 10.30, and he came again when the prisoner went for him, after she died; about 2.15 I think—on the first occasion when he came he asked the deceased about her symptoms—she was a little conscious then—I do not recollect that he put any question to me—I told him that she had had some fearful fits, as I thought they were—I cannot recollect whether or not I mentioned to him about the arching-; I think I did; I cannot positively recollect whether I did—there was none of that while he was there; only her feet were turned when he looked at her toes—I do not think her back was arched so much at that time the doctor saw her—I told the doctor of the dreadful shaking, that she shook so fearfully—I might have mentioned about the arching to the doctor; I have some idea that I did—the body was bent back in the form of a bow—I had never seen anything of that kind before; it struck me as a most remarkable circumstance, I thought they were strong fits; I had no idea of. anything else—I cannot positively say whether or not I did mention, the arching of the body to the doctor; I might not in my agitation, having the mother and the child to attend to; but I know I said about the convulsions—I mentioned the arching the first—time I was examined before the Magistrate—the under<lb/>taker was sent for and came—the prisoner was there at the time—he never came to bury her—he left the body at my place—he promised to come and bury her on Wednesday the 12th—the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was at my place—she was taken from my house after the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, after the inquest, that was on Tuesday, the 19th—I did not know that she died from strychnine—I had not heard from anybody that she had died from poisoning by strychnine—I had no idea but that she had died from fits—I think the first one that said that the symptoms I gave was poisoning by strychnine was the coroner's officer—I think he said it when I said the symptoms—he did not put any questions to me in particular; nothing con<lb/>cerning the death—I gave the account to Dr. Lees on the Sunday after, when he came to my house—that must have been the 17th, he was the first person—the coronor's officer came first and searched the room—I told him about the symptoms before I told Dr. Lees—I think he came on the Thurs<lb/>day and I gave him the symptoms; I thought you meant, did I tell strangers? I told the coroner's officer the symptoms of the death of the woman; and then he said "There is every appearance of dying by strychnine"—that was on the Thursday when he searched the room in the evening—he did not ask me the nature of the symptoms—I told him how she died and I told him of the arching—I was not asked, was there any arching—I gave a descrip<lb/>tion of the woman's death to him, and also to Dr. Lees on the Sunday—I had no conversation with anyone afterwards until I saw Dr. Lees on the Sunday—I never mentioned it to anyone out of doors—I mentioned it to no one except the coroner's officer—I had no conversation with my neighbours about it; nothing of the sort—I did not speak about the arching or' the dreadful convulsions to my neighbours; I do not gossip—the deceased was</p>

He was here again on Saturday evening, the 8th of September; he stopped two hours. He came again last Monday evening, the 10th; and on the evening of Sunday, the 3rd of September, about 8.30, he came and stopped two hours and went away. After he went away she paid Mrs. Wilson the rent and ls. board. After that she was very sick and said she had taken some sarsaparilla water which her husband gave her, and said he had also taken some. On Monday the 4th, she complained of being sick; she got better and went on all right through the week On Sunday, the 10th, he came at 8.30; she was at home. They went to their room; at 9.30 he came down to the landlady and said his wife had had two fits, and asked her to come up. She went up and found her on the bed dressed; she was then conscious. In a few minutes she went into another fit. 'She complained of a curious feeling in her feet and legs. Gave her some brandy; he fetched it; she got better. He went and fetched the doctor from the dispensary in Bury Street. He came. She was better then, shaking, but conscious, and pains in her feet and legs. He applied mustard to her legs, then hot flannels, and gave her some medicine. After that she was in and out of fits till she died, at 2 o'clock in the night, on the 11th September. She was there all the time. The husband remained till Monday night and left there at 10.30 or 11 o'clock, takingthechildwith him, tellingthelandlord he wasgoing to Clapham Junction to his cousins. She has not seen him since." I am sure she did not describe to me any arching back of the body—I said to her that it appeared like a case of strychnia—I said that only from matters that I had heard and read' that there is continually convulsions—that was a matter that I thought it was a symptom of, from what I have read—I had hold of the idea at the time from the continuous convulsions—that was all, nothing else.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I reside at 112, Walworth Road—I first saw the deceased on Monday, 18th September, in her coffin, at 18, Leopold Street—I made <hi rend="italic">a post-mortem</hi> examination that day, Dr. Lewis, a friend of mine, who I had asked to assist me, was present, he is here—I made a careful <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—the body was much decomposed—there was no morbid appearance to indicate death from natural causes—the limbs were somewhat rigid, the body was that of a woman fairly nourished, the stomach exhibited no traces of irritant poisoning, it contained, about 6 oz. of thin brownish fluid—that was all that it contained that was obvious to the senses—I removed the stomach together with its contents, and put it in a glass stop<lb/>pered bottle, and a portion of the viscera I put in another jar—I received from the police-sergeant Hazell five bottles and a packet of brown powder, on 19th September, the day of the inquest, and a bag containing Fullers earth—I saw a box produced at the inquest containing one or two pills, I can't say which, they were never in my possession—one of the bottles was a 6 oz. bottle, containing a few ounces of good sarsaparilla, it was about one third full—there was another bottle of the same size labelled sarsaparilla; that was empty, it had been recently rinsed out with water, it was practically clean—I say recently rinsed out because the inside was so clean and moist, the bottle was still wet; had it been rinsed out weeks previously it would have become dry—there were a few drops of water at the bottom, just a layer of water, just as much as would remain after being rinsed out, that was my impression—this bottle (No. 9), was one of the bottles; that con<lb/>tained about 2 grs. of dry refuse, dry powder, adhering to the bottom and sides of the bottle—I am not by profession an analytical chemist—I added these ingredients to the water, 2 dchms. of spirits of wins, 30 drops of hydrochloric acid, and a sufficient quantity of liquor potassae to render it alkaline—I grain of dry powder would be in bulk about as much as would equal a grain of wheat—I wrote on a slip of paper what the ingredients were that I added and stuck it on the bottle, and it is there now—my purpose in adding these ingredients was that I suspected that it might contain strychnine, and I commenced to test for strychnine, to separate it if it was present; but my proceedings were cut short by a visit from Inspector Easter, requesting me to give him the bottles to take to Dr. Bernays—the bottle then contained the dry refuse, plus the substances marked on the label—I corked it up and gave it to the inspector in that condition; what I had done up to that time did not enable me to form an opinion, because I had not separated the strychnine, it would probably have taken me a day with other duties, to have completed it, I should have left it to settle and had it chloroformed—I analysed a portion of the contents of one bottle, No. 3, a 2 oz. phial; that was the same day I handed it over to the constable—I tested two portions of it; I had completed my observations of that bottle before I gave it to the constable, when I received it it contained 1/2 a dchm. of a reddish brown fluid, 1/2 a dchm. would be 30 drops, 1/2 a teaspoonfull—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200159"/>
               <p>I first tested 5 drops, put the drops into a vessel, and obtained clear evidence of strychnia—I used the same things as I had used with the other except potash and chloroform, and I obtained a substance which yielded evidence of strychnia when tested by manganese sulphuric acid, bichromate of potash, and peroxide of lead, those were three separate tests—the evidence of strychnia are in the colour—I used three separate tests, and had three-. fold indications of the presence of strychnia—I subsequently took 10 drops and repeated the process and obtained needle-shaped crystals, such as strychnia will crystalize in; I have some with me, (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>), they are very minute needle shaped crystals—that was evidence to my mind that it was a crystalline substance having the same form that strychnia some<lb/>times assumes—that is not peculiar to strychnia alone, it is a common property with others, with thousands of substances, it need not be a poison,—I do not think it is common to sarsaparilla—strychnia comes from a vegetable nux vomica—sarsaparilla comes from a vegetable, there may be crystalline substances obtained from sarsaparilla, but I cannot speak with authority on that subject—I am able to say that the stuff in that bottle did contain strynchnia, because I applied the tests to those crystals, that again is a matter of colour—strychnia when treated by these tests turns violet passing into red—I think taking a crystalline substance giving this colour, acting with the tests named, it would be consistent with chemical science to say that it was strychnia; in my opinion it was conclusively strychnia—it is certainly my opinion that the tests I applied enabled me to say that the bottle did contain strychnia—I showed the remainder on a watch glass to Professor Bernays-that is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), Idid not test the contents of the bottle for anything but strychnia, I left about 15 drops in the bottle; I measured the quantity when it came to me, about 30 drops, I did not measure it afterwards some might have been lost, I corked that up and gave it with the other bottles to Inspector Easter—I produced this 2-oz. bottle at the inquest and sub<lb/>sequently before the Magistrate—I took the precaution to empty the remainder of it into a clean ounce phial, rinsing out the 2-oz., No. 3, with spirits of wine, that ounce phial I corked and locked up. in my drawer, and that No. 3 bottle I produced at the inquest and before the Magistrate, it was then empty—when Inspector Easter called on me I emptied both the contents of the 1-oz. phial into No. 3 and gave it to the inspector—I should think a considerable quantity of the fifteen drops was lost by evaporation; that was one reason that induced me to add the spirit, think<lb/>ing it would preserve what was left—all the other bottles I received I also handed to the inspector to go to Professor Bernays—I should think there was about l-120th of a grain of strychnia in bottle No. 3 when I first obtained it, but not now; that was only a sort of guess, and it would represent 4-5ths of the bottle full, 4-5ths of a grain, supposing the bottle was full—the smallest dose that would be fatal to an adult would, from my reading be 1/2 grain, and a less quantity would produce serious effects—I have no idea of the quantity of strychnia in bottle 9—I have been in practice fourteen years—I have attended to Mrs. Wilson's evidence, and if she has accurately described the symptoms, I am of opinion that they are consistent with death from strychnia—they only resemble those of the disease known as <hi rend="italic">indiopathictelanus</hi>, that means lock-jaw, which comes on of itself with<lb/>out any wounds—that will not kill a person in two or three hours, it takes from two to thirty days—wheether a person who was in a state of health at 8.30 p.m. and died, after convulsions, at 2 a.m., died from idiopathic <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi>, would</p>

               <p>depend upon the character of the convulsions; but, even if the body was arched up and resting on the head and the heels, it would be too rapid to be consistent with idiopathic <hi rend="italic">tetanus;</hi> nor is it consistent with traumatic <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi>, nor with anything except death by strychnia; not coming on so suddenly—if the strychnia was administered in solution, the symptoms would come on very rapidly, indeed, possibly within a few moments—assuming a fatal dose given about 9.30 at night, it is quite consistent with death from strychnia that the symptoms should exhibit themselves up to 2 o'clock, and that death should then take place, and assuming that the strychnia was administered in solution, I should expect to find traces of it in the stomach of the deceased, but I should not be surprised not to find it—I found no contents of the stomach except a brown liquid—strychnia is a vegetable poison—I think the presence of food in the stomach would delay its absorption, and we should be more likely to find it—the brown liquid was the remains of food—the strychnia becomes absorbed into the blood in the first instance, and then it would find its way into the tissues rapidly—under some circumstances it would be found in the blood, but it would be a very uncertain chase to find a grain of strychnia in the whole blood in the body—strychnia occasionally produces irritation of the stomach, but I did not observe any here—I have seen animals poisoned by strychnia, but have not seen it in human subject—I have seen <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi> in the human sub<lb/>ject—the symptoms of <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi> are somewhat similar—the symptoms of poisoning by strychnia are the repeated occurrence of twitching in the limbs and rigidity of the muscles of the limbs, usually commencing in the lower extremeties, and a sense of weight at the chest or heart, the extension of the symptoms to the muscles of the trunk, the arching back of the body and the head, called <hi rend="italic">oposthotonos</hi>, intervals of consciousness, the absence of any great difficulty in swallowing or articulating, and death taking place in six or seven hours; those are the facts upon which I should found my opinion—I have read that touching the person will bring on an attack—I say that it was not a case of epilepsy, because of the complete consciousness between the attacks of convulsions; and in epilepsy one does not expect to get the <hi rend="italic">oposthotonos</hi>—the convulsions in epilepsy are constant contractions of the limbs coming and going, and not the rigid continuous extension which would be the case in <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. The rigidity of the limbs was passing off at the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—it is very unusual for a first attack of epilepsy to be fatal; the fits go on from time to time till the person is carried off, or they may recover.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. Fulton*. Epilepsy is sometimes accompanied by tetanic complications, but I cannot say that in that case it would be more likely to prove fatal than simple epilepsy, or that it would not; I do not think it is a more serious complaint—I have seen hysterical <hi rend="italic">tetanus; tetanus</hi> coming on on with hysteria—I cannot recall any marked case of epilepsy</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200161"/>
               <p>accompanied by <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi>—theconvulsive symptoms I have heard described resemble the symptoms of poisoning by strychnia—leaving out the arch<lb/>ing of the back the symptoms are not the same as those in epilepsy—if I had heard nothing of the arching of the back I should not be disposed to say that the deceased died from strychnia, I should hesitate certainly, I should hesitate very much—there is no case that I have read of of poisoning by strychnia not accompanied by arching of the back, it is the leading symptom of death by strychnia—I certainly should not have said if the arching of the back had not been there that she died from strychnia—I do not know of one case on record of strychnia poisoning without arching of the back; it is a leading symptom of poisoning by strychnia that the intellect is clear during the intervals of the attacks; my authority for that is my reading, which is derived from Sir Thomas Watson's lectures; I have not got them here, or "Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence "—those books and "Todd's Cli<lb/>nical Lectures "are the principal authorities I have consulted-"Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence "is a recognised authority; he says that in death by strychnia the intellect is clear, but it depends upon how the patient dies—I should say that if the patient goes off rapidly at the end of an attack his intellect would not be clear, with all that writhing in convulsions.</p>

I could only tell whether the intellect was clear or not by questioning him, but it might be that the agony would be so great that no question I put would receive an answer—you are going into somewhat theoretical grounds—I should say that consciousness was not complete, if a person was at the point of death from such fearful convulsions as to turn back the heels to the head—my only means of forming a judgment is my knowledge of physiology, it is merely an opinion—what I say is that at that time the convulsions were not at their height, but were at a lull, it may be that the intellect was clear; that would not also be consistent with well marked epilepsy, not in one fit coming on rapidly after the other; I think I should like to qualify that by saying that after an epileptic convulsion a patient may recover consciousness, but it would be a matter of time; epi<lb/>lepsy is usually accompanied by drowsiness and sometimes by profound sleep.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FULTON</hi>. In the patient being more unconscious than conscious I do not see anything inconsistent with death by strychnia poisoning—sleepiness and unconsciousness and drowsiness are symptoms of epilepsy—sickness is not inconsistent with strychnia poisoning—I cannot mention any case in which vomiting has been given as a symptom of poisoning by strychnia—I cannot say that it is a symptom of epilepsy; I think not—I have seen some hundreds of cases of epilepsy in the course of my experi<lb/>ence, and vomiting has been absent in a very large majority of them; I think had it occurred constantly I should have observed it—I am not aware that pains in the head are given as a symptom of poisoning by strychnia; it is a symptom of so many diseases that one may not attach much importance to it—it is not necessarily a symptom of epilepsy—the patient does not complain at all in epilepsy; you find him in a fit, in a state of unconscious<lb/>ness, you may pick him up and drop him down, and touch the eyeball without the least blinking—if the toes were pointed in, but not arched, I should not give my opinion that death was caused by strychnia, that would be indicative that the muscles on the inside of the leg were acting more than the muscles at the back—if the feet were stretched down in that way they would be turned in because the muscles there would be stronger; if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200162"/>
               <p>the muscles of the legs were also contracted there would bo greater pressure there, and the feet would be turned in—in epilepsy the symptoms come and go, it is not a question of stretching, it is a constant twitching; that is in ordinary epilepsy,; but epilepsy with tetanic complications is a thing I know nothing about—I examined the body on the 18th September, eight days after death—it was somewhat rigid, but that was passing off from decomposition—I should expect to find very great rigidity after the death of a person from strychnia—I should expect to find arching of the back, unless what we call the <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> had passed off—if I went in four or five minutes after death I think I should expect to find the person in an arched condition, but that is speculation—<hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> sometimes does not set in till some time after death; it varies in different persons—the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances in cases of death by strychnia are not marked, but certain symptoms have been observed in certain cases—I found the membranes of the brain highly decomposed and turning green—I know that congestion of the membranes of the brain is one of the consequences of death by strychnia; I examined the upper part of the spinal marrow—the membranes of the brain were congested, that is present in death from strychnia and also from epilepsy—I found the lungs congested; I mentioned that in the written report 1 sent to the Coroner—the heart was flabby and empty; it contained a little coagulated blood—the heart is flabby and empty if you examine soon after death, but decomposition does away with most appearances—the blood was dark and frothy and of a dull colour, but those are appearances due to decomposition; a great part of the surface of the body was green—the blood was dark, unfreshlike, and frothy—the muscles of the throat and gullet were of a dark colour and congested, and the tongue also; but we do not attach much importance to that, on account of the decomposed state of the body—the only reason I give for the death not being from natural causes is this: I could not see any indication of disease; that was drawn from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I said that there were no morbid appearances to account for death—Battle's Vermin Killer contains Prussian blue, flour, and strychnia—I do not know of my own knowledge that it contains Prussian blue; I found no trace of it, nor should I expect to do so if it was administered in any small quantity—Prussian blue is a combination of cyanogen and iron—it is partly mineral—I give as a reason for not finding strychnia that it is a vegetable and is rapidly decomposed; that would not apply to a mineral, but Prussian blue is not properly a mineral—iron would not absorb, but iron is a constituent of the body; there is always iron in the blood—iron, in a small quantity, would not stain the stomach—I do not know how much iron is contained in one of those powders—I have heard that a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. packet contains 3 grains of strychnia—four hours and a half is a long time for a patient to whom strychnia has been given to be dying; death generally takes place more rapidly, but longer intervals have occurred and also shorter, five or ten minutes—the time depends upon the dose and the susceptibility of the patient and the form in which the dose is given; if liquid, it would come on more rapidly—death would not be more likely to come on if the dose was given in a liquid form; that would depend upon the dose given and the peculiarity of the individual—there are two cases given by Watson where two men each took a grain of strychnia by mistake and neither of them died, and one scarcely suffered at all—the minimum fatal dose, quoting from Taylor, is 1/2 grain, and the maximum is any quantity.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined by</hi> Mr. Poland. In an attack of epilepsy the patient will fall down, and probably utter a cry, become convulsed, froth at the mouth, turn livid in the face, and become unconscious—the convulsions would last for a varying time, and the body would be twitching during the time—I have never known that the feet sometimes beat the ground—sometimes the muscles on one side only are twitched—when the convulsions cease, the patient probably falls into a profound sleep, lasting perhaps for hours.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. I should say that five or six successive attacks of epilepsy would be a large number, usually there is one attack and the patient falls asleep and then awakes, perhaps knowing nothing of what has happened—I have seen more than 100 cases of epilepsy; the cases in which the convulsions most frequently occur would most resemble the case we are dealing with, but I never saw a case in which the fits occurred within intervals of a minute or so, in which the patient was able to talk and remained conscious—I have known a patient to have convulsions for a minute or two and then return—he would then go off into the final sleep and then recover—it ends in sleep, and it may end in the sleep of death, but it is very unusal—I do not recollect one case of epilepsy in which there was arching of the back, or such consciousness as to enable him to talk to the extent which is spoken to—if there was no arching of the back I should not assume that death was owing to strychnia—independent of the arching of the back there was the tetanic convulsions and occasional con<lb/>sciousness, and the freedom of the jaws as distinguished from idiopathic <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi>.</p>

I am professor of chemistry at St. Thomas's Hospital—I am not a medical man—on 17th October, I received some bottles from the police-inspector and a packet of powders—bottle No. 1, contained a portion of the viscera, and No. 2, the stomach and its contents—the only thing I need mention in No. 1, is that it was in a state of frothy decomposition, but not smelling at all badly—the heart was in No. 1, and was exceedingly flabby and very much decomposed, I am not able to tell what condition it was in when the subject died—No. 2 contained the stomach, the ends of which had been tied—I found no poison in it of any description, it contained a very watery fluid, with bits of cheese, the eye and gill of an hen-ing, a bone, some fibres of meat, some bread, and some tannin, which is the astringent principle of tea—I found no signs of valerian—if a fatal dose of strychnia had been given at 9.30 at night, and death followed at 2.30 a.m. I should not expect to find in the stomach traces of the poison, I should expect absorption to have taken place, and that the poison which had killed the person would have been altered in its chemical condition, and therefore be no longer strychnia—I should expect it to have got chiefly into the liver—it is said that half a grain is the smallest fatal dose, but I can only speak from reading—there was a small 2 oz. bottle which I myself numbered "No. 3," it contained very nearly 15 grs. of a somewhat clear liquid, strongly alcholic and smelling of myrrh—I made a careful analysis of it and found no strychnia in it—spirits of wine having been put into the bottle and turned out again, would account for the alcohol, unless it had originally contained tincture of myrrh—I found on examining the cork that the bottle had contained paregoric, or a minute quantity of morphia or myrrh; I thought it had been frequently used, and the cork had been saturated—I tested it for strychnia and did not find the slightest trace—I have been a professor of chemistry for 30 years and have had a great deal</p>

               <p>of experience at St. Mary's and St. Thomas's Hospitals—I have heard the mode in which Dr. Lees tested the strychnia, and am perfectly certain that what he showed me on a watch glass contained strychnia—I do not lay so much stress upon the crystals, I look upon that as a feature of the case only.</p>

My ground for saying that what I saw on the watch glass contained strychnia is, in the first place the taste inasmuch as certainly the 8-1000th part of a grain would be readily detected by its metallic bitter taste, and then by the use of the various colour tests which Dr. Lees has enumerated, principally oxide of manganese and per-oxide of lead, and sulphuric acid, and I tried them myself in his presence and found strychnia.</p>

Those were proper tests to be used—from my ex<lb/>perience I should say that the quantity tested on the watch glass contained 1-1000th of a grain of strychnia—the crystals Dr. Lees shewed me are quite consistent with crystals of strychnia—the mode of treatment leads to the conclusion that the crystals must be those of some alkaloid—I am of opinion that the crystals must have been strychnia, that is a matter of cer<lb/>tainty—No. 4 is a mere medicine, an anti-spasmodic—if she took valerian and assafoetida at 10.30 I should expect to find the greater part of it. absorbed into the system at 2 o'clock, and the smell of the contents of the stomach was exactly like valerian, but something had evidently been given which preserved the liquid from being offensive at all—ammonia will preserve from putrefaction—the medicine seemed antiseptic in its effects—I can account now for the smell of the contents of the stomach, which I could not account for at the time—I could answer for the quantity of medicine she must have taken, from the quantity remaining in the bottle, the bottle was nearly full when brought to me. (Mr. Miller <hi rend="italic">here identified the bottle of medicine as that which he made up</hi>.)

               <p>correct—I found on opening the bottle a strong smell, reminding <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of vomit; the bottle contained a full 1/2-oz. of alkaline fluid of a yellowish colour, with a flocculent deposit, which under the microscope looked more like broken starch granules and tissue—tissue means something like the coating you sometimes see on bread, the husks, or indications of something of that kind, or bran—I evaporated a portion of it to dryness to see that it answered the description given on the label, examined it tinder a micro<lb/>scope and found a crystalline mass, consisting mainly of chloride of potassium; in fact, what one would have expected from the analysis—I then took a small portion of it and decomposed it with sulphuric acid, filtered it to remove the flocculent matter from it, took a portion of it on a watch-glass, added a tiny drop of sulphuric acid to it and held it for a few minutes on a water bath; it slightly changed colour, it turned somewhat brown, but not quite black, and when I saw that it was the right time, after a few moments, I added a few drops of water, filtered it, and again evaporated it on the watch-glass, and then used the bi-chromate of potass, which gave me distinct indications of strychnine—I then took another portion and treated it in the usual way with chloroform, having first got rid of the alcohol—I adopted all the tests—the second process with the manganese, which Dr.—Taylor prefers, gave me the most perfect result as to strychnia, and the third the per-oxide of lead in the same manner—I have not the slightest doubt that there was strychina in that; I should say from l-50th to 1-100th of a grain—I only give that as a matter of opinion having had a good deal of experience with the students; I am acquainted with the poison called Battle's vermin killer; I had a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>: packet of it brought to me by Inspector Easter, on the 31st October—I have about 10 grains of it here—it consists of flour, strychnia, and a very small quantity of Prussian blue—the total quantity is 15 grains of a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. packet, and in that there is 1-603 grains of strichnia, that is one in three-fifths; I can only guess the portion of Prussian blue—it is simply flour slightly coloured by Prussian blue—there would be about 13 grains of flour in it, but I have done nothing to quantity that—the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. packet weighs exactly double, and. contained 30 grains—the strychnia was 31 5th grains—this produced is a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. packet—in bottle No. 9 I found what appears to be brown starch—when I made the examination of it I thought it was consistent with its being some of the flour of Battle's vermin killer, and I think so now—I thought so when I came to the analysis; I was not aware whether it was Battle's or Butler's vermin killer; I do not know which, but one of them suggested itself as possible—I presume that it is made of starch because the mice eat the starch, and there is no smell about it—it is simply that there is something to eat, and it kills them—I had not heard that there was such a thing in the place where the prisoner lived; I should say it was possible by washing to remove the greater part of the flour and the blue—supposing it were put into a liquid and given to a person who died of the strychnia, I should not expect to find traces of the Prussian blue, first on account of the smallness of the quantity, and also because the slightest knowledge of chemistry enables one to remove the blue in a moment—I am a chemist, but not a physician—I cannot imagine any reason why the effect of a dose of strichnia administered at 9.30 might not be delayed until 2 o'clock, the following morning; sarsaparilla is a sweet substance—a good dead of the so-called sarsaparilla is liquorice—this was very good, indeed—I have no doubt it was made according to the British Pharmacopoea—it is a</p>

               <p>thing from which you can extract sugar—if a fatal dose of strychnia in the form of Battle's vermin killer was put into sarsaparilla, I should think it would make it bitter, in fact it must—except from reading I should not be able to give an opinion as to whether strichnia produces vomiting—I should imagine that it would; because as has been already said it does not so rapidly affect the throat as in the ordinary symptoms of <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi>, and so forth—one of the first things that I should look at in a case of poisoning by strychnia, speaking as a layman, would be whether any symptoms took place soon after taking food or medicine of any kind—if convulsion results soon after taking food that would be consistent with having taken strychnia; but I get that altogether from my reading—the clenched hands, the curved feet and the jaw fixed are the direct effects of poisoning by strychnia—I should mention that there is another vermin killer which contains strychnia, and not Prussian blue; that is Butler's, and there is one of Butler's that contains no strychnia at all; but carbonate of baryta, I should say that these things ought never to be sold, or only sold by legitimate pharmacopoeists, and that persons using them should give their name; as they do in pur<lb/>chasing other poisons.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have stated that I see no reason why death should usually be deferred from 9.30 to 2 o'clock; it depends upon the strength and constitution of the person; there are a number of cases on record of a far longer time than from five to thirty minutes, two hours, three hours, and six hours—in those cases which are on record the usual time is from five to twenty minutes, but there are cases not on record in which death has taken place much later than sixteen hours even—I would rather not answer the question whether from the symptoms described, with the arching of the back, I should be prepared to say it was a death from strychnia, because that is so distinctly a medical question and involves practice in medical science—it is, of course, my duty to be acquainted with the results of poisons, as well as the constituents of them—the arching of the back is certainly mentioned as one of the most important indications of poisoning by strychnia—in order to see whether there has been any case in which that was absent I should require to look into the books; I certainly do not remember one—suppos-ing' the symptoms I have heard today had been given to me, without the arching of the back, I should not have said that death was from strychnia, but what I should have said would be that it was a case of great suspicion and one that ought to be examined into—I should not have said it was a case of poisoning from strychnia, I mean independent altogether of the result of any chemical investigation—one of the results of death from strychnia is very great rigidity after death, but muscular relaxation takes place by time—in case of death by strychnia it certainly is said that there is great rigidity immediately after death, much more marked than the ordinary <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi>—it is stated in Taylor's book that a 1/2 grain is the minimum amount of strychnia that will cause death, but Gerard says that he has known the most serious symptoms from l-48th of a grain—I do not know whether that was a case in which death occurred—serious symptoms might occur in that case without death, but medicines have such different effects on dif<lb/>ferent persons that it would be scarcely safe to say that what would kill one man would kill another.</p>

               <p>been in Court during the whole of this case—I have paid special attention to the evidence of Mrs. Wilson and Mr. Miller, and of Dr. Lee's and Professor Bernays—assuming the description given by Mrs. Wilson of the woman's symptoms on the night she died to be accurate, in my judgment I should say that the cause of death was strychnia or some preparation containing strychnia; and assuming Mrs. Wilson's description to be accurate, I do not think it is consistent with any other cause of death—I do not think that idiopathic <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi> would produce the same symptoms; that is a very rare disease, and I do not think a case of idiopathic <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi> would have been so speedily fatal—I should say the symptoms detailed by Mrs. Wilson were remarkably typical of strychnia poisoning—assuming that description to be accurate, the death is not consistent with an attack of epilepsy—I agree—with Dr. Lees and Professor Bernays that if a fatal dose of strychnia was administered at 9.30 at night and the person died at 2 o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing traces of it would probably be absent in the stomach—I have myself failed to detect strychnia in the stomach, when I have been able to find it in other portions of the body, when it has been absorbed in the liver—I have also detected it in the urine when I failed to detect it in the vomit of a per<lb/>son who had taken strychnia—the smallest recorded fatal quantity of strychnia is a 1/2 grain—I have heard the tests applied by Dr. Lees and Professor Bernays and I cannot doubt that strychnia was discovered by both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As a rule, in poisoning by strychnia, the intellect is clear, except when the convulsions are very violent or prolonged, or when death is very near—supposing the patient was ill from 9.30 till 2 o'clock and during the greater portion of that time was unconscious, I should not say that was inconsistent with death from strychnia—on hearing Mrs. Wilson's evidence I am not sure that the person was conscious, in the medical sense of the term—persons may take no notice,—yet may be per<lb/>fectly conscious and during the paroxysms it would be quite impossible, I should say, to tell whether the person was conscious or unconscious—if proper tests are. applied it is easy to ascertain whether the person's intellect is clear; it is unusual for a person to be unconscious in strychnia poisoning, but it is not impossible that it should be so<lb/>most of the recorded cases go to show that the intellect is clear; by "clear" I do not mean that they become more clever than before, buy they understand what is said to them; when their attention is not concentrated on their sufferings they give clear and intellectual answers, and they are clear of what is going on around them; there is no impairment of the mental faculties—vomiting is not a symptom of poisoning by strychnia, not a usual symptom—persons often vomit when they come out of an epileptic attack, but I should not say that was a usual symptom—some people <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> sick and some not, some vomit and some not—a person may desire to be side with<lb/>out being so—vomiting on a desire to vomit would not be a symptom of poisoning by strychnia, nor especially a symptom of epilepsy; I have not read that it is a symptom, nor have I observed it in the effects of strychnia myself—I should think taking a great quantity of sarsaparilla by a person unaccustomed to that medicine might cause sickness; it is usually given in: water; I think it states so on the label of this bottle; it is not a thing you would take alone; it has a cloying sort of taste; a dessert teaspoonful of this is equal to a quarter of a pint of the decoction; that would be a full dose—if the patient had actually died in the middle of a convulsion I should</p>

               <p>expect to find immediately after death very marked rigidity of the body—the description Mrs. Wilson has given is consistent either with her being drawn back in the rigid state, or that relaxation had come on—the relaxa<lb/>tion of the muscles at the end of these dreadful convulsions does not usually stop on the sudden, not in a moment—the patient would be drawn back and rigid, then they would sink down, and relaxation would come on, and then they could bear to be touched—I believe it does end suddenly in a col<lb/>lapse; the person will suddenly drop back in the bed—there might be no marked rigidity shortly after death—I have never myself seen a patient actually die from strychnia, although I have seen persons who have died from it—my opinion is formed from what I have read—I have found in operating upon ani<lb/>mals that they will be quite rigid immediately after death—my own expe<lb/>rience and practice is consistent with rigidity after death; I have never observed the absence of it immediately after death in any animal—the time which the rigidity continues is very variable in animals; when it is observed im<lb/>mediately after death it often passes off very shortly; it may pass off in a few hours, it may be several days; I should not expect it to last a week—if the rigidity was immediately after death I do not think it would pass off in so short a space as half an hour—from my reading I find it stated that the body is generally as stiff as a board—when they are rigid after death they are extremely rigid—the expression "stiff as aboard "is one that has been used—the time at which <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> is continued after death in a person that dies from natural causes is very variable, it may pass off in a few hours or it may last several days; I have never observed it pass off within less than twelve hours, but there are cases on record where it is much less than that—between the death and the twelve hours the body would usually be laid out—I could not be sure that the rigidity would be likely to continue longer in a case of poisoning by strychnia than in an ordinary case; I do not think that it would be probable—if the body was rigid at the moment of death I should expect that would continue, it would depend upon whether the person was seized with death at the time that arching happened—the feet being turned towards one another would be consistent with strychnia poisoning—the feet may be averted or inverted—I should place more reliance on the fact that the muscles and tendons were subject to great ten<lb/>sion—in an ordinary case of strychnia you would find the toes turned down<lb/>wards in an arched form.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Poisoning by strychnia does not produce unconsciousness in itself; it is from my reading I know that where persons have very violent and rapid convulsions, or when very near death, they may be unconscious when dying from strychnia—I do not think strychnia in itself produces unconsciousness—they are conscious immediately after con<lb/>vulsions.</p>

If the convulsions were very violent, I do not think that they would take any notice of what was said; but when they came out of the convulsions they would express themselves as conscious of what was been going on—I mean that a person would be so suffering in convulsions that they would not show consciousness, but when they came to themselves, you ascertain that they have been conscious of what was going on, they will describe their feelings to you—that would not be the case in death by convulsions from epilepsy—there is entire unconscious<lb/>ness during the attack in such cases, and drowsiness afterwards, with a loud snoring breathing—a patient recovering from epilepsy is not able to tell you what has occurred during the fit.</p>

I got to the house I examined it—the fire was out, but there were two separate places which had been on fire; they were about 4 feet apart—I found some bedclothes and sacking burnt—I asked the prisoner what articles he really had lost, and I took down what he said in this paper.

I am a surgeon, of Wokingham—on Tuesday night, 8th August about 11.30, I was sent for to Gold's lodging-house and found Headland lying on a bed—his throat was very much cut from the centre of the windpipe up to the left ear; it was a long incised wound, extending between 4 and 5 inches; it was very deep; it had slipped over the windpipe, but it got slighter as it got nearer the ear; that was where the knife would come out—he had lost a great quantity of blood before my arrival—the cut escaped the windpipe, owing to the flabby state of the skin, but it had struck it; the looseness of the skin prevented further injury—there was a wound about 4 inches long on his left arm half way between his elbow and shoulder—I sewed up his throat and arm—he would not neces<lb/>sarily have lost his life if the windpipe had been cut, but it would have been dangerous to life—the cut was near the carotid artery—the injuries could have been inflicted with this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), there was blood on it when I first saw it, some of which was wet—the cut began from the centre of the throat and went to the side upwards; it appeared to be a stab to the throat and then to be drawn outwards—I saw the knife about 11 o'clock, Superin<lb/>tendent Millard showed it to me with blood on the handle principally, but. there was some on the blade.</p>

               <p>8th August, a few minutes past 11 o'clock I was on duty in the Market Place and heard a woman cry "Murder!"—I went to Gold's lodging-house, and up into a front room, where I found Peter Headland lying on a bed with his throat cut—I saw the white handled knife on the floor with blood on the handle and blade, and a considerable quantity of blood on the floor—I earched for the prisoner and telegraphed right round, but could not find him—on Thursday, 10th August, at 7.45, he (came to the police-station—I was in the yard, and he said "I have come to give myself up for what I have done "—the front of his trowsers was covered with blood—I produced the knife and said "You will be charged with cutting Peter Headland's throat with this knife on the night of 8th August, with intent to kill and murder him "—he said "I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it in self defence," and immediately afterwards he said "That is my knife and what I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it with, one tale is very good till the other is told "—I locked him up.</p>

I am sergeant of the Herts County Police at Tring—I went to the Railway Hotel on the morning of the 7th August, about 2.5, at daylight, I walked round the meadow adjoining the garden—I found this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are some iron hurdles and an iron fence dividing the garden from the meadow—the chisel was 5 or 6 feet from the fence—in the garden I noticed footprints, very distinct under the pantry window, with the toe pointing towards the wall—I pointed them out to Mr. Brown—I examined the chisel, and compared it with the marks on the till drawer, and it corresponded—Inspector Goodyer afterwards brought a pair of shoes—they were compared with the footmarks by making impressions alongside of them—they corresponded exactly, and I noticed as remarkable outside the heel a number of brads, which were not put in straight, but zigzag—the impressions of those brads were upon the impressions in the mould—the chisel I picked up in the meadow and compared with the marks in the till—it fits them perfectly.</p>

I am inspector of police at Birkhampstead—it was by my instructions that Weedon and Wassail went to the station—it was about 10.30—I was present when the articles were found—the prisoner said. "Good morning, Mr. Goodyer," when he first came in—I said to Weedon "Bring him up here"—the prisoner said "You are not going to keep me here, are you?"—I said "Yes; there has been a robbery, and as you answer the description of the man you will be detained "—he said "I was going to Covent Garden Market'; I have a lot of property there to sell"—I said "Where do you come from"—he said "From Stone; I was going to Watford"—Stone is in Buckinghamshire, about 16 or 17 miles from Birk<lb/>hampstead—I had his boots pulled off because they were very wet and dirty—when he was brought in, Weedon said "He has thrown a purse along the <hi rend="italic">towing</hi> path "—I said "Go back and find it; shall you know where it is?"—he said "Yes; I have made a mark"—he went and brought the purse back again—he showed it to the prisoner, and said "This is the purse you threw away"—he made no reply—after that I went to the hotel garden and saw the impressions under the window, one of them was very deep, almost directly under the window—the heel was quite 2 inches—I took the right boot and made the impression beside the other, and measured in all ways, and they corresponded exactly—that was in the presence of Sergeant Aldridge, Mr. Brown, and others—in the impression were marks of brads exactly corresponding in number with those on the boot—amongst the articles found was a knife—after we had compared the shoes Mr. Brown showed us the window open—I saw marks</p>

Have you given your proper name?"—he said "My name is Tom Brown, from London. That's good enough. It's no use going to the station, I am not known there "—but I did go down—that was all I could ascertain—after he was remanded I asked where his mother lived; whether he had any friends; and after some time he told me where his mother lived, because I had ascertained at the station all about his career, and where his mother lived, not where he lodged.</p>

I am an engine-driver—in November, 1875, I was living with my father at 5, Ashdown, Buckstead, Sussex—at that time I opened an account at the Savings' bank at Uckfield; and I received this deposit-book; this is my name at the beginning; it was issued to me by the Uckfield post-master—on 27th November I deposited 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there; my father went with me——on 15th January I deposited 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and subsequently 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. through my sister at Rotherfield post-office—since I paid in those sums I have never drawn any out, or authorised any one to do so for me—about 6th June I went to work at Midhurst—I was then lodging at my Bister's house once a month—she is the prisoner's wife; they lived in Town Row, Rotherfield—on a Monday evening in June I remember looking for my deposit-book and it was there all right; I kept it in a little box in my clothes box in the bedroom where I slept—I went away on 31st July and returned to my sister's on 26th August, and next day, Sunday, I examined my box and found that the little box was gone containing my deposit-book—I spoke to my sister about it after breakfast; the prisoner was present, and he said he would see if they had lost anything—he and my sister went upstairs and they said they had lost a ring and a. pair of black cloth trousers—I went to the post-office at Rotherfield that morning, my sister went with me, and I gave information to the post-master of my loss—I caused a letter to be written to the authorities, the prisoner wrote it at his own house; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I signed my name to it at the bottom. (<hi rend="italic">Bead:</hi>"August 27th, 1876. Dear sir,—I have had the misfortune to lose my bank-book from my box. I have paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether; 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Uckfield last November, when I began to pay; 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Uckfield, and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Rotherfield on 6th June. If no one has not taken the money out, I wish you would stop them, and let me know by return of post. I believe the number of my book is 1207. I had the book from Uckfield postoffice for 5, Ashdown. I live at Rotherfield now with my sister and brother. I have lost my letters that I had from you altogether with my book. Signed, John Reed, engine driver.") When I first deposited my money I signed this declaration—I did not sign this notice of withdrawal, nor is this my signature to this receipt on this warrant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am post-master of the post-office at Rotherfield—on 2nd August I recollect a person coming and asking for a withdrawal notice; I can't tell at what time he came; it was some time during the day——the prisoner is the man that came——I asked him if he had got a savings' bank book, and he produced a deposit book; I can't say that this is the exact book; he produced a book, and I got him to fill up the notice from the book—it is the same number on the book, it is No. 1207, Uckfield—I handed the prisoner a withdrawal form; this is it; I told him how to fill it up; he filled it np and signed it in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Uckfield, 1207, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Rotherfield, John Reed, Rotherfield, labourer.") He signed that "John Reed," and put in the word "labourer "—I then gave him the withdrawal notice and he posted it to the chief office—on the morning of 4th August I saw him again; he came into my office and wanted to know if there was a letter for John Reed; I told him the mail bag was not in yet; he said he would call again presently—in the course of about a quarter or half an-hour the mail bag came in; the letters were sorted out, and there was no letter for John Reed——in about half or three quarters of an hour the prisoner came again and produced this warrant; he did not say how he had got it, he simply produced it——I saw that it corresponded with the advice I had received, and I paid him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he signed the name "John Reed "on the warrant——that is a receipt—at the time I paid him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I made this entry in the deposit book: "August 5th, 1876, K 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., G.E."—I did not know the prisoner before by name, only by sight—as far as I knew he was John Reed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him about after the 4th of August, and I saw him when the sergeant of police brought him to my office about three weeks after——the post-office is about a mile from where he resides—when the sergeant brought him it was about the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being withdrawn—I did at first say I would not swear to his being the man; it was in the evening—I swore to him before the Magistrate on the 4th September; I think that was three or four days after the sergeant had brought him to me——I had seen the prisoner in the interim and I had seen Mogford, the letter carrier; he comes to my office every morning—I had also seen the sergeant——the prisoner wrote the first document in my presence; he wrote it as anyone would, freely enough.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Sparshott, and live at Hunston, in Sussex, next door to the deceased Charles Upsdell, his garden adjoining ours—it is separated by a high wall of Mr. Pearson's, and by a quick set hedge of Mr. Upsdell's, you can see through the hedge, I could not see into Pearson's garden—on Thursday afternoon, 26th October, I was in my garden and heard Pearson in Upsdell's garden—their gardens adjoined they run at right angles to mine, Upsdell's garden is on the right and Pearson's on the left—there is a high wall-between them—I heard both Pearson's and Upsdell's voices; I heard Pearson telling Mr. Upsdell "Your cows are in my garden "—Upsdell used bad language and said "I will do for you, and I will see it out Pearson "—I heard no more words, I heard blows, I could not see them, the wall separated us—the blows were in Pearson's garden—I saw them in Upsdell's garden and go towards Pearson's, and it was after that I heard the blows; I could not tell how many blows; there were more than two; they were heavy blows—I heard no voices at the time I heard the blows—I heard no more expressions after they left Upsdell's garden—the next thing I saw was Mr. Upsdell return to his own house by the hedge, the way he went; that was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after—he appeared to walk very weak, and he was covered with blood—I did not notice his head, he had no hat or cap—he was not doing anything with his hands, only walking to his own door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known both the men for a considerable time—the deceased was a man of very violent temper at times—I could not say whether or not he was sober that day, he was in the habit of getting drunk at times, and he was then disagreeable and violent—he was a big stout man, a powerful man, he always walked in a stooping position, with his head a good deal forward—he was older than the prisoner, the prisoner is somewhat exciteable at times—some little time ago he was pitched out of a carriage on his head; he recovered damages for that accident. he was on one occasion struck on the side of the head with a hammer by a Mr. Duke—I did not see it—I saw him return afterwards—I did not see him with his head bound up, I was not near him—I know that he was confined to his house in con<lb/>sequence of that injury, I saw him led home by a man—on this occasion, I was in my garden, rather in the back part of it; the deceased's language was foul and offensive, he spoke very loud and in a threatning manner—all I heard Paerson say was "Your cows are in my garden "—I did not hear him use threating or offensive language to the deceased—the blows I heard were</p>

               <p>as if Upsdell was beating the calf; it sounded more like whacks, on an animal than on a human being—I had heard Upsdell beat his calf before, and the blows appeared to me similar to those.</p>

Upsdel—in consequence of what she said to me I went round to Upsdell gares and found him at the upper and of his own gardens towards the straw yard—he said "Help me get my cald in, see what Pearson has done for me"—he had his head tired up with a handkerechief, and he was covered with blood; blood was running from him then—I saw him walk indoors—soon after that I went for Dr. buckls—I did not see anything of person.</p>

"Your calf is in my garden, my husband followed and passed him about half—way down the garden, I don't know what passed between them afterwards, my husband came back in about fifteen or twenty minutes bleeding very much from the head and marking a dreadful noise, groaning very much—he knew what he was about—I ask him down in the chair and washed his head—he said "Go for Hammond and get the calf out of the garden," I did so, and Hammond got the calf cut of the garden—when I came back my husband was in the garden with a towel on the top of his head, I asked him to come in; I got him in and laid him on the sofa, and he bled very much indeed and screamed, and said Pearson had hit him—I could scarcely hold nim, he seemed racked with pain—I asked Hammond to go in for Mr. buckled immediately, and Mr. buckle came within about half an hour afterwards—when my husband went out that afternoon he half a cap on his head, which I afterwards gave to the doctor—he had it on when he came in again—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when he went but it was a very good cap, there was not a hole in it, when he came in there was this cut in it—when I got him on the sofa. he took it off his head and put it on the table, and then the doctor came—the peak of the cao was good when he went cut, when he came back it was torn like this—he died on the wednesday follow<lb/>ing, 1st November.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Draper &amp; Freeland, clerks to the County Justices at Chichester—on 27th October, I was present with the superintendent of police at Upsdell's house—the prisoner was taken there in custody; I heard the deceased in his presence make a statement which I reduced into writing—the prisoner cross-examined him—Upsdell made his mark and the Justice signed it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "The deposition of Charles Upsdell, taken in the presence of George Pearson. I live here, I have lived twenty years in this house; the prisoner George Pearson lives a few doors from me; I was in Pearson's garden about 4 o'clock this evening; I went after my calf which had got into Pearson's garden. He knocked me down with-a great stick about four times, he hit me. The stick was about 10 feet long, it was a clothes prop. He knocked my head all to pieces, I was 10 feet from him. He did not say a word to me, nor I to him. I fell on the ground from the first blow. He hit me three times afterwards. After the first blow was struck, while I was on the ground he said I was not a going to take the calf out of his garden. I got up again and drove the calf off the premises. Another man, my lodger, Joseph Hammond, came to my assistance, I was covered with blood—when I went into the garden, Pearson came from the granary with the pole, in about an hour or more. We had some conversation about some straw; he wanted a barrow load of my straw for his pig. He wheeled it out of the barn in my wheelbarrow. We had no words about the straw, I sold it to him for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I have never had any quarrel with him. After he had struck me he put the prop behind the granary. He did not come to my assistance, Joseph Hammond came to me. I called out for <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> to help me take the calf out of the garden. I was able to walk into the house afterwards; I sent for the doctor soon after I came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a duly qualified surgeon, practising at Chichester—I was called on to attend the deceased about 5 o'clock on Thursday afternoon, 25th October, for a wound in the head—he had lost blood—the third finger of his left hand was bruised; it appeared to be a recent bruise, such as you get in a jamb—on the left wrist there was another bruise and slight abrasions; and on the forehead and nose there were slight scratches—upon a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination I found a clean incised wound, about 4 inches long, on the left parietal bone, going right through the scalp, both plates of the skull, into the brain itself—there were no signs of bruising about the wound—there was no other wound on the head—on throwing back the scalp so as to lay bare the skull, there was no sign of bruising—the cut in the skull was a clean cut, the edges were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200192"/>
               <p>sharply defined, and it terminated more abruptly at the anterior part, that is towards the forehead, than the posterior; I mean that it was more perpen<lb/>dicular, not so sloping, as if made with an instrument thicker at the bottom than the top—there was a slight depressed fracture at the anterior part as well; that is what is called a star fracture; it was about the size of a fourpenny piece; the inner plate of the skull was driven down between 1/8 and 1/4 of an inch; the greater part of 'the wound was 1/4 of an inch deep, but in the centre of the wound, in the brain, it went very nearly £ of an inch—the width of the fracture of the bone was about 1/8 of an inch—the width of the external wound on the scalp was retracted to 1/2 an inch or more—when you cut the tissues they alway come back directly from muscular contraction—there was no indication whatever of a blunt instru<lb/>ment on the scalp itself—it was a clean cut wound—in my opinion it was impossible that it could have been done by this pole—I compared the bill<lb/>hook with the wound, and in my opinion such an instrument would produce such a wound—the deceased's cap was shewn to me by Mrs. Upsdell—I find in it now a perforation corresponding with the wound on the head; there is a cut about 4 inches long on the left side of the cap, it goes through the outer part and after that also goes through a small layer of wadding and through the lining of the cap—the blow must have been a violent one, with a sharp cutting instrument, to go through the cap, the lining, and down to the substance of the brain—you often get the star fracture by the actual violence without anything actually touching it—it is a kind of a spreading out of the force—the primary cause of death was inflammation, produced by the wound; he died from the effects of the violence to which he had been subjected—from the character of the wound I should think he must have been stooping at the time the blow was struck, or he might possibly have been on the ground; I can't say—he was a taller man than the pri<lb/>soner—I should say the person who struck the blow was in front of him—the bruises I have spoken of might have been caused at the same time, by the back of the same weapon, I mean the graze on the wrist and the jamb on the finger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made a microscopic examination of what was on the bill-hook, not of the bill-hook itself—I could find no recent marks of its having been knocked about—it is very blunt—I examined it on the Satur<lb/>day, the 28th, following the Thursday—I stated before the Magistrate "There were two hairs adhering to it which were human hairs, but they had evidently been there some time "—that had reference to the pole—there were either rabbit or hare hairs, on the bill-hook, they corresponded with either—I was before the Magistrate and also before the coroner—the deceased never complained of being struck with a sharp instrument—I have been qualified as a medical man two years—there was a scalp wound.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Brighton Police</hi>). On Sunday morning, the 9th July, I was on duty in the London Road, Preston, about 7.30 a.m., and saw the prisoner walking in the direction of Brighton, from Preston—she had a bundle on her left arm—I wished her good morning, and she said "I wish you good morning, sir; what time does the train leave for Burgess Hill, as I have left my situation, and am going there for a few days; I have another one to go into, and am going to see some friends "—I was then close to her—I told her that I could not tell her what time the train started—I heard a noise inside her bundle, and asked her what the bundle contained—she said "Dirty clothes "—I told her that I must look inside the bundle, and see what there was, as there was something besides dirty clothes—she said nothing until I began to open the top part of the bundle, when she said "Oh! do let me go and bury it, for it is quite dead "—I saw the head of a child, and told her that it was not dead, for I could distinctly hear it making a noise, and that I must take her to the station, and I did so—the parcel was opened there, and it contained a female child, with the string of a petticoat tied three times round its neck, and the ends tucked underneath the folds—I sent for a cab, and took the prisoner to the work-house infirmary—the string was very tight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It could not have been on very tight or the child would have died, would it not, before you got to the station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was wound round three times; it was not so very tight—the child's breathing resembled that of a puppy; it laboured very much when it was drawing its breath, I could see that—it appeared to be a great relief to the child when the string was taken off, it breathed much easier, and then began to cry—I asked the prisoner on the way to the station, where the child was born, she said in a field near the church at Preston, at 4 o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> What first attracted, my notice to the prisoner was that I saw her looking very ill, and a man told me she had been sitting by the church gate for three quarters of an hour—she is very deaf; she did not seem excited when she spoke to me—the noise inside the parcel attracted my attention—it was a parcel done up in brown paper, carried underneath her waterproof—the noise I heard was a cry resembling that of a puppy just born, or more of a moaning—I could not have heard it if I had been so far off as that door—I was touching her—she did not appear to hear the noise at all—I was about a mile from the police-station when I took her into custody, and she walked that distance with me—she carried the parcel, but I assisted her—I took hold of her arm, and assisted her along; she was in a very weak condition—she was not fainting then, but she did after I got to the station, and I got a cab—it took me about twenty-five minntes to get her to the station, and during that time I had not opened the bundle except</p>

               <p>merely at the top, so that for twenty-five minutes the string which was, as I say, tight round the neck, had not been removed, and yet the child was breathing—I had only opened the parcel just enough to see the child's head—I did not see its face then because I saw she was in a very weak state, and I wanted to get her to the station—I did not think at the time that the child was in state to require immediate assistance—I could not judge whether the cry was that of a child undergoing the process of strangulation; at any rate, I did not open it till I got to the station—I was there when it was opened; the parcel was about 2 feet long, with several dirty petticoats, and the child inside them, and it was done up in brown paper—a petticoat was round the child—the string was still attached to the petticoat and the petticoat was wrapped round the child, and the brown paper round the petticoat—the petticoat was retained in its place by means of the tape round the neck—the end of the string, which was attached to the petticoat was the first round the child; I mean that the part of the string which was fastened to the petticoat; the part nearest to the petticoat went round the neck first—I went to the workhouse with the prisoner in a cab, and took the child with me—no medical man saw the child till some time after we got to the workhouse—two minutes after we got to the station I assisted in taking the string off the child's neck—we simply unwound it, we did not cut it, we simply took hold of the end and pulled it out—it came out. easily.</p>

I am a widow, and live at 1, Robert Street, Brighton—on 8th July, the prisoner hired my room for two nights, and came into it about 10 o'clock that evening—I heard her about very early in the morning,. which caused me to get up, and I saw her go out about 6 o'clock and cross the road, and turn up North Road; that is in the direction of Preston—she turned the corner, and I did not see her again till I saw her at the Town Hall—at 9 o'clock, a policeman came and told me something, in con<lb/>sequence of which I went into the room and examined the bed, and was fully convinced that a birth had taken place there, as I saw what is usual on such occasions—I am able to say that from my own knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon to the work house infirmany, Brighton—on the morning of 9th July, the prisoner was admitted to the lying in ward, at about 8.30—I examined her and found that she had been recently delivered, but it was not complete; the child had been born, but the after birth had not been taken away—she said nothing at that time—I examined the child and found that the string had been cut, about a foot from the body and there was a mark round the neck, evidently produced by some string or tape; it was a narrow mark—the tape is not here; it was cut off—the neck was reddened as if from the pressure of a piece of string or tape; the skin was broken, and it took about a fortnight to heal—as far as I could judge that wound was caused by the pressure of a string.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. It was an abrasion of the skin and it ulcerated after<lb/>wards—the mark was just over the trachea—that is a spot where if there is</p>

               <p>any tight pressure, even on a grown person, it would be serious, a grown person would be rendered absolutely powerless in a moment by any strong pressure there—the mark might have been accidental—a ligature round the neck must have been tight to produce that mark—supposing that the string was so tight as to cause the abrasion, it would be impossible for a newly born child to bear it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RAVEN</hi>. In my opinion the string might have been tighter and become slackened—I believe that was accidental—the prisoner afterwards told me in the course of the day that she did not know what possessed her to try and kill the child—the child stayed in the infirmary, and the prisoner left well, on August 8th. (<hi rend="italic">The child was now in the prisoner's arms.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She was in bed when I first saw her—I had to use ordinary force to complete the labour; it was not the process of nature—I merely asked her how it was she got into this trouble, and she told me she did not know what possessed her to try and kill the child—I think she heard my question—when I said "this trouble," I meant being arrested—she was in a very weak state, but she was able to speak; she had rallied then; she was walking about the ward in nine days or a fortnight, and the child took about a fortnight to recover; it was with its mother all the time, and I treated it for a laceration of the neck—the wound was about 1/8 of an inch long all round the neck—it was an abrasion—in newly-born children very little is required to make a serious wound—there is not a tendency in the, folds of the neck to show very bad signs, but there is lower down—I do not think the same cause that would bring forward a tendency to produce those marks would cause laceration—there was a mark on the windpipe—no lasting mark is left on the child—I was in Court and heard the whole of the case before the committing Magistrate—the prisoner is very deaf and there was no" one defending her—I did not hear the answers she made to the Magistrate's questions.</p>
