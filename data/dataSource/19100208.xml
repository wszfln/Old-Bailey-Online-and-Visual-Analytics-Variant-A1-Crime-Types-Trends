                  </hi>assistant to David White, sub-postmaster, 84, Goswell Road. On December 8, 1909, at 9.10 p.m., I left the post<lb/>office at 84, Goswell Road; it was secured with a padlock, and the safe was locked. The safe contained ₤ 161 12s. 9½ d. in cash; ₤ 896 in postal-orders and ₤ 369 12s. 8d. in postage stamps.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">HERBERT DICKISON, </hi>96 K. On December 8. at 10.35 p.m., I examined 84, Goswell Road, found the door open and the pad<lb/>lock forced, and marks on the door, I entered and found the office in confusion, strewn with postal-orders, postcards, etc. I reported the matter to other officers.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES LAING.</hi> On December 9, at 12.30 a.m., I visited the post-office, 84, Goswell Road, and afterwards went to 79, Rosebery Avenue, where the steps bore fresh marks of having been chipped as if a safe had been carried over them. I went down the mews by the side of the house, and got to the rear, when I heard a chipping noise and saw a light in the back parlour of No. 79. Standing on the wall I saw a safe in the middle of the room surrounded by the prisoner and six other men, who were trying to force the safe open. The prisoner held a hack saw; another had a chisel and hammer. Sergeant Leach was with me; we procured assistance and surrounded the premises. An officer knocked at the front door and the men came into the back<lb/>yard, where on seeing myself and other officers they ran back into the house. I followed into the back room and found prisoner together with Stanley and Brennan (who was convicted on January 13, 1910; see page 341.) I found in the room one hack saw, a hammer, four cold chisels, a chopper, a hatchet, and the screw-driver</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080006"/>
               <p>produced. Two of the rivets of the safe had been loosened, and I think the safe would have been forced in another fifteen or twenty minutes. I took the prisoner to the station; he was charged with breaking and entering the post-office and stealing the safe; he made no reply. At the last Sessions prisoner was unable to take his trial through illness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am sure prisoner was in the back room when I entered, and that I arrested him there. When looking into the room from the wall I recognised prisoner, whom I knew by sight. There was a good light in the room from an incandescent gas burner.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">HARRY WOODLEY, </hi>343 H. I produce plan drawn to scale of 79, Rosebery Avenue. The wall at the rear is 8 ft. high, and 14 ft. from the window of the back room, which is 7½ ft. from the ground. Any one standing on the wall could see down into the room. The room is 9 ft. square.</p>
               <p>Police-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES LEACH</hi>corroborated the evidence given by Laing. I saw prisoner in the room from the wall holding a steel hack saw; I knew him before. He was in the parlour when I entered with Laing. I then went upstairs and brought down another man whom I had arrested. Prisoner was then in charge of Laing. (To the jury.) Prisoner was dressed much the same as he is now.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). On December 8, from 10.40 to 11 p.m., I was in the "Wilmington Arms, " Rosebery Avenue. I then went to the Gold Air Stores, St. John's Street, to try and get a night's work. As I had not the price of a night's lodging I went to see an Italian named Gianicoli, who lives at 79, Rosebery Avenue, and who owed me a shilling. He could not pay me the shilling, but he invited me to sleep in a chair in his room. I had fallen asleep when the door was burst open and a police-constable in uniform entered, ordered me and the Italian downstairs, and took us into the room where there were four other men and a number of police officers. I was charged with being concerned with the other men in stealing the safe. I said, "I know nothing about it any more than the Italian does." We were taken to the station, and the Italian was released by the inspector. I had nothing to do with the robbery or with attempt<lb/>ing to open the safe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I left the public-house at 11 p.m., and went straight to the Cold Air Stores, and on to 79, Rosebery Avenue, getting there about twelve. I have asked for the barman to be called to prove I was in the public-house. A woman opened the door and told me to go up to the Italian's room, which is the second floor front. I have got the Italian here to prove what I say. A uniformed police officer fetched me down from upstairs. I did not tell the magistrate I wanted to call the uniformed police officer who fetched me down.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">LEACH</hi>recalled. I forced the door and brought the Italian downstairs. Prisoner was not in his room. I was in plain clothes</p>

               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED SAUNDERS, </hi>Scotland Yard. On January 12, about half past four, accompanied by Detective-sergeant Goodwills and Detective Wesley, I went to 37, Kenton Road, Victoria Park. In room on the first floor I saw the two prisoners sitting on either side of the fireplace, Stallard with his back to the window and at his feet an enamelled dish, and in the dish was the plaster mould produced with a partly-made coin in it, like it is now. The mould was warm. There was also this pot containing melted metal. I told the prisoners we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080009"/>
               <p>were police officers, and had reason to believe that counterfeit coin was being made there. As we entered the room Stallard stooped down, and with his right hand picked up the mould and was pushing it towards the fireplace, when he was stopped by Detetcive-sergeant Goodwillie. He then said, "I was only going to push it under the grate." On then table by Stallard's left hand were the ten counterfeit half-crowns produced, all dated 1906. Atkins said, "You have got it all now. I bought them for 2s. off a man I do not know. We have done nothing yet, but were going to have a practice. No one taught me this; I learned it all from a book." He afterwards produced from various parts of the room a bottle containing cyanide of potassium, a packet of plaster and a piece of antimony. He then said, "I found it all in one parcel, and had to climb over the fence for it in Bethnal Green Road. My wife was very ill or else I should not have been mixed up in this." The room was then searched by Detective Wesley and myself, and under an enamelled dish under the table I found this copper wire, and in a cupboard a packet of silver sand was found by Detective Wesley in my presence, and also this file, which bears traces of white metal. Stallard said, "I do not live here, but am only a visitor. I live at 31, Wolverley Street, Bethnal Green Road." They, were taken to the station, and on the way Atkins said, "You would not have found us out if some one had not told you about us." They were charged at the Victoria Park Station with making counterfeit coins; neither made any reply.</p>
               <p>To Stallard. I did not notice a muffin-board with a bell and some other things on it. Two postcards were found upon you at the station addressed to you at 31, Wolverley Street, one dated in 1907 and the other 1908. Both the postcards purported to be testimonials to Stallard's honesty and respectability.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES WESLEY</hi>and Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">GOODWILLIE</hi>gave similar evidence. Stallard when arrested said to Goodwillie, "I would take all the blame of this if I could get him (Atkins) out of it. I was playing bagatelle this afternoon, and had not been very long in the house when you came. No matter what you find out I always speak the truth. I have a number of references, and you will find I have a good character. I am the father of twelve children, although some of them are dead. My wife thinks I am at work how." Goodwillie also stated that as the result of comparison he had come to the conclusion that all the counterfeit half-crowns were made in the mould produced.</p>

                  </hi>clerk in the Secretary's Office, General Post Office. Prior to January 11, 1910, a large number of losses of letters have been reported from the Chiswick Post Office, and on that day I made up a test letter addressed to "F. J. Crockford, 'Birkwood, ' Hartington Road, Chiswick, London, S.W., " a fictitious name and address, containing a letter, a silver cigarette case, florin, shilling, two penny and seven halfpenny postage stamps, all bearing my private mark, which I posted at the head office at 2.50 p.m., and which would come into prisoner's possession for delivery. It would be the post<lb/>man's duty on being unable to deliver the letter to mark it "No such address, " with his initials, and to post it at the nearest post office</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080012"/>
               <p>or pillar box. The letter would then be delivered to another postman on the same district, who would again attempt to deliver it. The letter was not returned, and from information received at 10.15 p.m. I went to a tobacconist's shop in Grove Park Road, where I saw the prisoner talking to the girl behind the counter. He had then finished his deliveries for the day. I called for some cigarettes, and tendered half a sovereign in payment, when the girl said she had no change. Prisoner offered to give me change, and handed me for my half<lb/>sovereign three half-crowns, a florin, and sixpence. I paid for the cigarettes, left the shop and examined the florin, which I found to bear my private mark, and to be the coin I had put in the letter, and which I produce. It has a small "e" between "two" and "shillings" punched by the die produced. I gave instructions to Police-constable Roberts, who is attached to the Post Office, and he brought the pri<lb/>soner to the Chiswick postmen's office. I described to prisoner the post packet, and told him its contents, and said, "This letter was taken out by you for your nine o'clock delivery. As it was un<lb/>deliverable it should have been re-posted. Do you know anythingabout it? " He said, "I have got it all in my pocket, " and produced all its contents except the florin. I said, "Where is the two-shilling piece? " He said, "I cannot give it to you unless you give me back my change." I said, "Where is the cover? " He said, "I threw it away." The marks on the stamps were invisible until developed by an acid. In the folds of his handkerchief were found portions of the cardboard box, which also bore my mark.</p>

On January 11, at 10.20 p.m., on instructions from Mr. Bruce, I asked prisoner to accompany me to the Chiswick Postmen's Office, and was present at the interview between him and Mr. Bruce. Prisoner pro<lb/>duced two unopened letters (produced) which should have been de<lb/>livered by him at about 9 a.m. One bears a fictitious address, and the other has subsequently been delivered. He asked me to return them to him, which I did, and he marked the fictitiously addressed one, "No such number in Grove Park Road, " adding his initials. He explained that he had not delivered the other because he had passed the address, and did not want to go back.</p>

                  </hi>clerk, Savings Bank Department, G.P.O. I received notice of withdrawal produced requesting warrant to be sent to 215, Vauxhall Bridge Road, payable at the Post Office, 329, Vauxhall Bridge Road, in the name of E. J. Slade. Believing the notice to be a forgery, I gave information to the police.</p>
               <p>Detective-Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN HEDLEY, </hi>X Division. On January 18 I kept observation on 215, Vauxhall Bridge Road, and saw Robertson enter the shop and receive a letter; he then entered a public-house, spoke to Kinnaird, who was there, and came out. I spoke to Robert<lb/>son, returned with him to the public-house, and said to Kinnaird, "This man says you sent him for a letter to 215, Vauxhall Bridge Road." He said, "Yes, that is right." I told him he would have to come with me to the police-station on a charge of housebreaking at Harrow. On the way to the station he said, "You know it was those two men who escaped from Brentford on Saturday"— alluding to two men who have since been rearrested. At the police-court Kin<lb/>naird made a statement which I put in writing, and which he after<lb/>wards signed, "I am at present staying at Rowton House, Newing<lb/>ton Butts. I am 23 years of age. About Saturday week I met Peter Murray at the King's Cross Railway, Great Northern. I only knew him by sight, and had seen him frequently at Rowton House. He said, "Would you like a drink? ' I said, 'Thank you, ' and we went into the 'Victoria.' He said, 'I cracked a crib at Harrow.' He showed me some jewellery and a Savings Bank book and asked me to go and get the letter." He afterwards said, alluding to Robert<lb/>son, who was there, "This man is innocent, but I am as crook as can be"— meaning that he was a thief. He was charged at Harrow Police Station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Kinnaird made the statement in the presence of seven detectives. There was no pumping at all. He did not say, "As regards.Murray's movements, I was ignorant at the time and have been ever since."</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY OWEN, </hi>X Division. I was present when Kinnaird was arrested. At the station I searched Robertson and found on him a piece of paper produced, and in Kinnaird's presence Robertson said, "That was given me by the other man, " meaning Kinnaird— who said, "That is quite right." On searching Kin<lb/>naird I found envelope addressed to Peter Murray, 215, Vauxhall Bridge Road, London, and two newspaper cuttings relating to the arrest and escape of Murray.</p>

He asked me if I would go up with him to get a letter that was addressed from a friend in Paris to 215, Vauxhall Bridge Road. We went there and he asked me to go in and get the letter, as the party in the shop knew him and he was not in a presentable condition. His appearance was all right. He said he would give me something for going. He gave me paper pro<lb/>

When I got to the oil shop, which I entered, he stopped and looked through the window. When I came out he had gone on a bit further. Then I saw prisoner come out of the paper shop next door. Prisoner met the other man and they both walked along together until they came to another paper shop. They then crossed the road and prisoner went into the shop. When he came out I entered the shop and spoke to the little girl inside. Coming out I followed the two men and saw prisoner enter a chemist's shop. When he came out he met his companion. I then spoke to a police<lb/>man and saw prisoner arrested, but the other man ran round the corner by Cumberland Haymarket.</p>

Sixpence was tendered in payment and I gave him the change. I put the coin into the till, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards a policeman came in. In consequence of what he said I went to the till and found the sixpence given me by prisoner. It was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">CLIFFORD RANCE RANCE, </hi>436 S. On January 28, about 12 o'clock, in consequence of information received, I went to 78, Osnaburgh Street and there saw prisoner. I went inside and asked what was the matter, and was told by Mrs. Herbert he had been try<lb/>ing to pass a bad 6d. I told him I had heard he had been try<lb/>ing to pass bad money in two or three other shops in the same street, to which he replied, "I do not think so." I asked him if he had any more, and he said "No." I then told him I should want to search him, which I did, but failed to find any more bad money. I then told him I should take him into custody. He had upon him a good 6d., 5d. bronze, a scribbling pad, and two keys. I took him to the station and afterwards made inquiries at Blackstaffe's shop. I gave the two keys to Detective-sergeant Crookshank. Prisoner gave the address 8, Foley Street, Tottenham Court Road, and the name of James Adams.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">STEPHEN CROOKSHANK.</hi> I received the two keys from the last witness. I made inquiries at 8, Foley Street, and went in consequence to 7, Glengowe Mansions, Chapel Street, Brixton. The door had two locks on it, but one of them was latched. The flat contained four rooms, two bedrooms, a drawing-room, and a kitchen. In one of the bedrooms on the top of the wardrobe I found two parts of a mould wrapped up in a newspaper tied together. In the kitchen underneath the dresser I found some plaster of paris in a bag and a few pieces of white metal. On the dressing table in the first bedroom I found a small file which has traces of white metal on it, also a knife with plaster of paris on it and a pair of pliers which: might be used for holding the mould. I received the three bad six<lb/>pences from Rance and formed the opinion that they had come from that mould.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I was in Birmingham in May last year, at the Tivoli Theatre, and I came in contact with a man who gave me to understand his name was Frank Crichton. I have since met him on one or two occasions in different parts of the United Kingdom, and he told me he was working for a troupe of acrobats as baggage man, the truth of which I cannot say. I met him in Charing Cross Road about seven weeks ago, and he informed me he was out of employment and making these counterfeit coins, which he called by some slang name which I really forget now. I informed him I should not like to have anything to do with him as he was doing that kind of thing. He inquired where I was going, and I said I was going to Brixton. He had a small parcel under his arm, and he said to me, "As you are going over the water you might drop this in, " and he used some other words about "doing it in, " which is disposing: of it in some way, " as, " he said, "I do not wish to carry it about with me, nor to leave it in my lodgings." I took it off the fellow really to get rid of him, and I put it in my overcoat pocket and went down to the embankment. Getting on a tram, I forgot all about this parcel, and when I got home I opened it and found these bits of chalk, as I thought they were, wrapper up in newspaper, and various other little items, a pair of pliers, nail-cutter, a small knife, and a small brown paper parcel, which I found contained some pieces of white metal. I hid them in various places, so that my wife should not see them. On January 28 I met Crichton opposite Portland Road Station. We got into conversation and he informed me he had a lot of these sixpences on him, and he asked me, as he said I had a good appearance if I would go and change some of them for him. (Prisoner gave corroborative details as to the passing of the bad money.) When the girl Herbert asked me for the 5½ d. change I felt thoroughly ashamed of myself, and I thought it would be better to go back to the shop, even at the risk of being locked up, than be with this man. With regard to the plaster of paris, it was bought by my wife on account of a defect in one of the gas pipes; she was going to plaster it round.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I gave the address in Foley Street because my father lives there, and I am generally there when I am in London. I have all my correspondence addressed there; also I did not want my wife to know the disgrace I had brought on myself. I am aware that the charge against me is being in possession of the mould without law<lb/>ful authority or excuse.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. The plaster was bought the night before my hus<lb/>band was locked up. I did not say to the officer I did not know the plaster of Paris was there. If I had been afraid of the police finding it it would not have been there. I said I did not know anything about the mould on the top of the wardrobe. I was shown the white metal. I do not know where that was found. The plaster of Paris was found in the kitchen cupboard. I suppose the maid put it there. The detective took the small file, a pair of pincers, and a nail-cutter off my dressing-table. The file, which has a mother-of-pearl handle, is part of a manicure set that belongs to me. The pocket knife is also mine.</p>

               <p>Detectice-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM BURNHAM, </hi>G. On January 3 I went with other officers to 1, Compton Passage, Compton Street, Clerken<lb/>well. I knocked at the front door, which was opened by the woman Waters. 1 said, "I am a police officer, " and tried to enter the house. As soon as I said that she seized hold of me and shouted, "Jack, Jack, the police." Sergeant Garrard came to my assistance, and I got away from her. I handed her over to Sergeant Garrard and entered the house, walked along the passage, and entered the second room on the right-hand side. The woman said, "I do not know any<lb/>thing about it." At that time I had not said anything about any coinage offence. There was a bed in the room. I went further down the passage, and came to a door that was bolted on the outside. As I was about to enter that door she said, "I do not know what is going on there." I unbolted the door, and in the room I saw the two male prisoners. Upon the table I found a mould for making sixpences. I found also the sixpence produced, which has a piece of plaster of paris on it. A large fire was burning in the grate. I searched the fireplace and found three parts of two moulds, one being for a shilling and one for sixpence. Upon the table I also found part of a mould for making shillings, the reverse side having been obliterated by scrap<lb/>

               <p>ing. There were three knives on the table with pieces of plaster of Paris adhering, a large piece of glass, two files and some pincers, which might be used as a vice, an iron spoon, four white metal spoons which might be used for making coins, a tallow candle, used in making the mould, and a scrubbing brush for cleaning the coins. I found three crucibles, in one of which there was metal; one of the crucibles was hot. The female prisoner was subsequently brought into the room by Garrard, Cooper said, "That woman don't know anything about it." Wallis said, "We are novices at this game; we are experimenting." I afterwards went into the room I had looked into first, where I saw a man's hat and coat hanging up. I said to prisoners Waters, "Whose hat and coat is this? " She said, " Jack's. He is my cousin. They asked me to let them have the room for a couple of hours. I did not know what they were doing in there. I was just going in to cook my dinner." When charged prisoners made no reply. Waters also said, "I am in charge of these rooms; I am responsible; they are my mother's rooms, but I am responsible." She also said her mother was out all day at work. I searched Wallace and found on him a good shilling.</p>

Previous to that I had not seen him since October 2. I had just received from my brother-in-law a matter of ₤ 10 which he owed me, so I was able to lend him a sovereign out of that. Wallace said to me, "Can I go in for a little while? " I said, "What about that? " I referred to the money he had to give me. He said, "I have no money, but you can take my overcoat and pawn." That is how the coat came into my bedroom, or rather my mother's. I told him to hang it on the bannisters, and I would put it into the bedroom after. I then</p>

               <p>finished the windows, put on my old cap, and went out. I was out about three minutes, and just after I came in there was a knock at the door. I threw my cap off and opened the door. When I did so two men pushed their way into the passage. I said, "Yes, what do you want? " One of them said, "We are police officers." I said, "What is the meaning of that? " The one that spoke first caught hold of me by the wrist until he drew blood, and I halloaed out "Jack." When he said he was a police officer I called out "Jack, " and before I could say it again the other officer put his hand over my mouth. They then closed the street door, and one of them walked through. The door at the end of the passage was opened, I think, by Wallace. The door was bolted on the inside; there was no bolt on the outside; there is no hole for the bolt to go in. The door does not fit perfectly. It is a door my brother-in-law fitted up for my mother to keep the cat from getting into the place and breaking the things. The other prisoners bolted themselves in, and I knew nothing about what they were doing. As long as I have known Wallace I have never received a penny of him, and the other man is a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I went out to get the money for some clothing that I sell. I was living with my mother for the time being. Some<lb/>times I go to live with my sister-in-law. I swept the back room where the other prisoners were in the morning and lighted the fire about twelve o'clock. There was not a very large fire. It is only a little stove with a brick in the bottom where it has been broken away. I am certain that the door was bolted from the inside.</p>
               <p>To the Court. I did not notice that one of the men was carrying a parcel.</p>

                  </hi>artist and designer. I live with my wife at 69, Atbara Road, Teddington; we keep no servant. On Janu<lb/>ary 4 my wife went out at twenty to four in the afternoon; ten minutes afterwards I heard a noise in the hall, and on going there I saw prisoner; he said he was looking after rooms, he had met my wife, and she had given him the key, and he had let himself in. I knew this must be false. We got into the dining-room, and I knocked against the wall; this was a usual signal to my daughter, who lives next door, that we wanted her to come in. Prisoner struck me a fear<lb/>ful blow on the head with a jemmy, and I was stunned for the moment. My daughter came in, and prisoner threatened her; she went away screaming "Police." As prisoner was going away I got up and followed him; in the hall there was a china vase, which had been broken, and I hit prisoner with the bottom bit of it; we struggled together for several minutes. Prisoner pulled out a revolver and fired three times at me; I heard three clicks, but the revolver did not go off. Prisoner ran out at the front door and got away. When I first saw him he was wearing a brown bowler hat; this fell off in the scuffle, and was afterwards found in the house (Exhibit 8); when he escaped he was wearing my Trilby hat. I recognise the jemmy and pistol produced as those used by prisoner. On January 15 I went to the police station and picked out prisoner from a number of other men; I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. At the identification I did not say "I believe that is the man, I am almost sure, but I am not certain." I struck pri<lb/>soner with the broken vase in the face, pretty hard.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi rend="smallCaps">CAMPBELL.</hi> On leaving the house at twenty to four I am certain I closed the front door. I noticed prisoner in the road. When I went to the police station I was nervous and I failed to identify prisoner, but I am now certain he is the man.</p>

He made off into the grounds. I noticed that his face was bleeding. I immediately picked out prisoner from other men at the police station.</p>

               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">MAGNA.</hi> On January 4 I went to 69, Atbara Road, and saw, prosecutor. I took possession of the hat (Exhibit 8). On searching the grounds of Culchett Hall I found the revolver (pro<lb/>duced); it was a six-chambered revolver; three chambers were unex<lb/>ploded. Later on Inspector Ashley gave me three keys; on going to 69, Atbara Road, I found that one of them opened the front door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner did state that the key opened his grand<lb/>mother's front door; I did not go to his grandmother's house to test it; it is a skeleton key and would open half the doors in Teddington.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM BURNHAM.</hi> On December 3 I was keeping obser<lb/>vation on 42, Cumming Street, Islington; I saw prisoner enter that house. On January 6 I was in Arlington Road, Camden Town, which is very near Albert Street, and not two miles from Cumming Street. I was with other officers, and, after resistance on his part, we secured prisoner. He attempted to put his hand into his pocket, saying, "I will shoot you; I have got a shooting iron." On his being" searched no weapon was found on him, but there were 27 No. 9 Eli pin-fire cartridges. The three cartridges produced (taken from Ex<lb/>hibit 8) are exactly similar to those. On January 7 I went to 30, Albert Street. In his room I found up the chimney the jemmy and three keys (produced). On the day of his arrest I noticed the mark of a recent cut on his cheekbone, and his eyes were much inflamed.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN ASHLEY.</hi> On January 15 I saw prisoner at South<lb/>Western Police Court. I told him he would be charged with house<lb/>breaking and the attempted murder of J. H. Campbell on Tuesday,</p>

               <p>January 4; he said, "What day was it? " I said, "Last Tuesday week"; he said, "I know nothing about it, and I can prove I was in bed from Sunday till Wednesday." In reply to the formal charge he said, "On the 4th I was in bed." I noticed that he had a slight abrasion near the left eye and a recently healed wound on the left cheekbone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I notice a scar on prisoner's cheek now; that is not the one I am referring to.</p>

He (prisoner) knew nothing about revolvers, and had never fired one in his life. He was not in Atbara Road on January 4. He had never worn a bowler hat or a Trilby hat in' his life; he had never seen the jemmy (produced). He denied that when he was arrested he had a recent scar on his face; he challenged the pro<lb/>secution to produce the medical sheet which must have been prepared at the time he was admitted to prison. He had all his life had a scar under his left eye. Two of the three keys produced were those of houses where he had lodged; the third was the key of his grand<lb/>mother's house.

The seven signatories include the names of the prisoners. Nothing was paid on the incorporation of the company, but between December 18, 1903, and Jan. 4, 1904, 200 Ordinary shares were allotted to John Charles. Abraham. I have a record of the change of address of the company to 46, Queen Victoria Street on December 30, 1903, signed "John C. Abraham, Secretary, " and on November 4, 1904, there was another change of address to 59, Bishopsgate Street Within. On July 17, 1905, a circular requiring the annual summary of capital and shares, which should have been filed by the company, was sent to the last address, but was returned, and the company was struck off the register.</p>

                  </hi>electrical engineer. In 1904 I was living at Becken<lb/>ham, where I managed some works. My salary was ₤ 250 per annum. In July I saw an advertisement in the "Weekly Dispatch" (pro<lb/>duced) to which I replied, and received a letter, dated July 19, signed "John C. Abraham, Secretary, " written on paper headed, "Mer<lb/>chants' Legal Aid Society, Limited, 46, Queen Victoria Street." The letter referred to a district managership at Norwich, at a salary of ₤ 208 per annum, payable weekly, with 10 per cent, commission on all subscriptions and 10 per cent, on renewals, and set forth an esti<lb/>mate of the amounts of the subscriptions I should be likely to receive, showing that altogether the probable amount of my income would be ₤ 68 a month. I was required to qualify by taking ₤ 100 worth of Preference shares in the company as a sort of security for the money which would pass through my hands. I called at the offices a few days afterwards and saw in an outer room the prisoner Augustus John Abraham and two typists, and I also saw the other prisoner</p>

I said, "I put it to you now as man to man, would you give up a berth at ₤ 250 per annum to take up a business of this kind? " He said, "I would; I would not hesitate one moment." I then left, taking with me the pamphlet, which I read, and believing the statements contained in it were correct, I wrote again, and in reply received a letter signed "John C. Abraham, " informing me that the post at Norwich had been filled up, but offering me another at Oxford. Ultimately I wrote, enclosing a cheque for ₤ 50, the receipt of which was acknow<lb/>ledged by "A. J. Abraham, Director." I received a letter dated August 13, called a "letter of appointment, " and requesting me to forward the balance of ₤ 50, which I did, and early in October I pro<lb/>ceeded to Oxford to take up my duties. I took offices there, bought furniture, and engaged several agents, but I did not succeed in getting any subscribers or doing any business. I wrote to the offices in Queen Victoria Street, asking for instructions, but could get none, so I called and saw the prisoners. I then asked for my salary, but did not get it, and I returned to Oxford. I wrote again, but got no answer, so early in November I again went to London, when I found the offices closed, without any intimation as to where the company had gone.</p>

                  </hi>jobmaster, Rosemont Road, Hampstead. On January 11 Stewart came to my place of business in the evening. He gave me a certain name. Next morning, in consequence of a telephone message which was received at my stables, I sent a horse and cart to the Great Central Hotel, in charge of one of my coachmen. Its value was from ₤ 70 to ₤ 80. The next time I saw it was after the police re<lb/>covered it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Stewart is the only man I saw.</p>

                  </hi>coachman to last witness. On January 12 I took a horse and governess cart to the Great Central Hotel. The hall porter came out. I next saw Mr. Nichols and Mr. Palmer. Stewart is Nichols. They came out of the hotel and get into the cart. I asked for orders. They said, "Drive to Baker Street." I drove to several other places, and finally got to Broad Street House, E.C., about 25 past one. Palmer got out and went into the building. About five minutes afterwards he came down and asked me to fetch a parcel of printing in the name of Nichols from Holman Brothers on the third floor. I said I could not leave my horse. He said, "I will look after it." I then went up to Holman Brothers; found there was no parcel of printing in the name of Nichols. I came back to the street and found the horse and trap gone. I then went to a policeman at the corner of London Wall. I next saw prisoners in Bishopsgate Street Police Station on the 15th. I identified Stewart straight away. I failed to identify Palmer straight away. But before he was out of the line of identification I recalled my words and said, "That is the man." He was wearing glasses the day I drove him about, but not when I identified him.</p>
               <p>cross-examined. I was driving them about for 1½ hours. They both got out twice, then Palmer got out at Broad Street House. They spoke frequently about electioneering. I was not sitting face to face with Palmer in the cart. My eyes were in the direction of the mare. I was face to face with him when he asked me to fetch the parcel. When I went to the police station there were ten men in all in the row. Palmer was clean shaved the day I had him in the cart; hid moustache was waxed and looked much darker. When I saw him at the police station he was growing a bristly beard I did not see a police officer at all in the room where the row of men was Palmer had not left the row when I picked him out. I did not say before the magistrate when the inspector called out Palmer to go back to the dock, "I recognized Palmer as the man." When the depositions were read over to me, possibly with my hard hearing I did not catch the reading.</p>

                  </hi>carriage attendant, Great Central Hotel. I re<lb/>member seeing last witness drive up to the entrance of the hotel on January 12. I said to him, "Do you want Mr. Nichols? " He said yes. Prisoners were in the winter garden. I announced pri<lb/>soner; he said "All right." Both prisoners came out, got into the trap and drove away. Before the cart came up prisoners walked into the hotel and asked for the buffet bar. I said, "We have no buffet bar, but you can get what refreshment you like in the winter garden." The waiter served them. Stewart said to me, "I am expecting a horse and trap to call here, and the coachman will ask for Mr. Nichols." I next saw prisoners on the 17th at Bishopsgate Police Station. I did not pick out Palmer, but I recognized him at the Guildhall when he was in the dock with the other prisoners. He then had gold-rimmed spectacles. He took them off, and I said, "That is the man." He did not wear them on the following Thurs<lb/>day when I had to go again.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080032"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. Detective Stocker came to the hotel with the coachman and left word that I was to appear. I saw him on the 17th with the coachman Tanner. I noticed Tanner was a little deaf. We all three talked for about ten minutes. Next day I went to the police station and saw a row of nine or ten men. I did not see De<lb/>tective Stocker there. I looked along the row more than once. I.first picked out Stewart; then I think somebody said, "Look along carefully again." That somebody was in uniform. I was quite unable to recognise the second man. Although I twice looked along the row and failed to identify Palmer, I am now quite certain he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>horse-dealer, 1, Dean Street, Stanford Street. On January 14 both prisoners came to see me at eight o'clock in the evening. Stewart said he had a horse and trap for sale, and that a publican named Simpson had recommended him to come to me. He wanted ₤ 20 for them, and wanted me to go and see them that night. I said I should not buy any horse at night at all. I arranged to meet him next morning at eight o'clock. I could not keep that appointment. They came to my place about nine or 9.30 on Satur<lb/>day morning. I told them I could not get away as I had another appointment. They came back about 1.30 or two o'clock. All my conversation was with Stewart. We arranged to go and see the trap at Rodney Road. They wrote the address on an envelope. Another dealer went over with me. We got there between 2.30 and three. We went in the yard; the trap was outside and the horse was in the stable. Both prisoners were there. We had no conversation with them. As we were in the yard in walked the detectives, and they locked them up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had no conversation with Palmer at all. I heard no conversation in the yard between Detective Stocker and the prisoners. He walked towards the prisoners and said, "I am going to charge you with stealing this horse and trap." He took them straight away, and we followed to the police station. I did not hear what prisoners said; they were talking. Palmer was clean shaved on the Saturday. He had a moustache.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">STOCKER, </hi>City Police. I received information on the morning of January 13 that a mare and trap had been stolen from New Broad Street. I went to Rosemont Road and got a descrip<lb/>tion of the men from Mr. Taylor and his coachman. I then pro<lb/>ceeded to the Great Central Hotel, where I saw Wilcox, and got from him a description of the men. My inquiries led me to keep observa<lb/>tion on some stables in Hemp Road, Walworth, on Saturday morning, the 15th. About 2.30 in the afternoon Palmer and Stewart came down Hemp Road; Stewart went into Simpson's and Palmer to the top of the street, apparently looking for some one. He then came back, joined Stewart, who was followed by Mr. Benson and Mr. Smith. They all went into the yard, examined the trap, Palmer pointing out the various parts of the trap to the dealers. They then had the mare brought out of the stable. The dealers were examining the mare when I went in and said to the four of them, "Which of you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080033"/>
               <p>is Nichols? " Neither made any reply. I said to Stewart, "You answer the description of a man named Nichols"; and I said to Palmer, "You also answer the description of the other man who was with him; I hold a warrant for those two men's arrest; I am going to arrest you on the charge of stealing this horse and cart." They made no reply. The other two men told me they were horse-dealers, and I requested them to accompany me to Rodney Road Police Station. I took Stewart; Police-constable Wood took Palmer. The dealers followed, and after they satisfied me that they knew nothing about them being stolen they were allowed to go. Prisoners were detained. I read the warrant to Stewart first. He made no reply. I said to Palmer, "You have heard the warrant read; you are the man named in that warrant; that applies to you." He made no reply. They were then taken to Bishopsgate Police Station, were they were charged. Neither made any reply. The difference in his appear<lb/>ance since then is such that no one would be able to identify him. I believe Bergeant Bareham was present at the identification. The usual proceeding is to get the men there, then bring the prisoners out and ask if they are satisfied with the people there. They take what position they like. The officer in charge of the identification brings the witnesses in one by one, and says, "Look along the row and touch the man you identify." The witnesses are not asked to take a second look.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">WOOD, </hi>236. I went down to the stable. I saw there the two prisoners and two horse-dealers, and a man named Simpson. Prisoners were apprehended. I took Palmer into custody. He made no statement to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Inspector Wood was in charge of the station. When prisoners were brought in Inspector Wood asked Detective Stocker what prisoners were there for. Detective Stocker told him who he was and that he had a warrant. I was not there all the time. I went round to fetch the mare and cart. The warrant was read at the station. Prisoners made no reply in my hearing.</p>

I had the privilege of letting the stable. Stewart came again between seven and eight o'clock with a horse and trap. Another man was with him. I am not sure I can recognise that man. I put the horse and trap up that evening. I did not recognise Palmer as the man until the third time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Stewart first of all came along, and after I had seen my friend who had the stable to let Stewart drove up with the horse and cart with another man. I cannot recognise that man at all. The horse and cart were put in the stable about midday Thurs<lb/>day. I do not know that anybody came to see the horse and cart that afternoon. I saw Palmer in Stewart's company at 8 p.m. I had the key of the stable then. The cart was not shown to Palmer. I was there the whole time. They remained there half an hour to three-quarters. I understood Stewart was looking for a purchaser.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080034"/>
               <p>I did not understand that Palmer was going to introduce somebody. I did not hear Mr. Benson spoken of.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK BAREHAM.</hi> I was in charge of the station when prisoners were brought in and when the identification took place at Bishopsgate Police Station. When Tanner came to identify prisoners were placed with eight others, and Tanner was told to look to see if he could see the men that he knew. He at at once recognised Stewart. Then he stood just in front of Palmer. There was another man on Palmer's right, which would be on the left of Tanner. He looked at the two for something like a minute, and then he touched another man. The inspector-in-charge said, "That will do, " and motioned to the prisoners to come forward and leave the ranks. The moment they stepped forward Tanner said, "I have made a mistake.</p>
               <p>(Defence.)</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I had nothing to do with Stewart when he got this horse and cart from the owner. I was not with him when he drove it away, or when the coachman drove it. I am not the man that Tanner says told him to go up to the office to get a parcel. Tanner and Wilcox are mistaken. I was with Stewart when he went to Mr. Benson. I met him about 5 p.m. on the 13th, and told him I had been ill for three weeks. He said, "I know how you can earn a pound. I know a man who has a horse and cart to sell; if you can introduce a buyer you will get ₤ 1 commission." I said I should be very thankful. I went to Mr. Simpson. He said, "I know a respectable horse-dealer who does a large trade; go to him and mention my name and there is no doubt you will have a deal." I then go to Stewart and tell him, and really I am done with the business then, bar being there when the money is paid over, as I want my ₤ 1 commission.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The first I heard anything of this trap was on the Saturday, the day I was charged. I had not been in the trap at all. I have known Stewart about six months. He did not tell me where he got the horse and trap from. I did not ask him. It was not supposed to be his property. I did not know Stewart was in very low water then. I knew he was an insurance agent always at busi<lb/>ness, canvassing. I do not say he was in a good position; he had money to spend. He told me he had the pony and trap off another man, and if I could introduce a buyer I should have ₤ 1 commission. I did not want to know who the other man was. I have been to Simpson's place on several occasions. He is a publican. He is not here.</p>

               <p>Three previous convictions were duly proved. Mr. Purcell raised the objection that prisoner had not been questioned properly as to whether he could furnish evidence of having made efforts to earn an honest living since his last conviction. It was admitted by Detective Bareham that the request was made to prisoner through a warder, as he was not himself allowed to approach prisoner. Prisoner had given certain information as to alleged casual employment, but the parties to whom he referred did not corroborate his statements.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul in summing up to the Jury said prisoner had him<lb/>self gone into the witness-box and sworn that he had made such efforts, and as there was no contradiction of that he thought they might give him the benefit of the doubt.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE</hi>S. <hi rend="smallCaps">WOOLRICH, </hi>grocer, 136, Liverpool Road. I have known prisoner Smith some time in insurance business. I knew Stewart be<lb/>fore November 22. On that day they came to my shop. I knew Stewart as Reeves. Reeves said, "What about this cheque? " Smith said, "Perhaps Mr. Woolrich will change it for you." I knew Reeves as Smith's agent and clerk. Smith was my fire, glass, and burglary insurance agent. The cheque was ₤ 4 17s. 6d. It was crossed; that is why I took it. He said he could not get it changed that day, and would I advance him ₤ 2. I did so. Smith went away, leaving Reeves with me. After some little time Reeves said, "If anything should occur don't let Mr. Smith know, as he suffers from fits, and it would seriously upset him." Then I gave him the money, and he went away leaving the cheque with me. On the following day he wanted another ₤ 1, which I gave him in silver. He came again the same evening, and wanted me to settle up the whole amount. I gave him another ₤ 1. I had not enough money to pay the balance. On the 23rd I sent the cheque to the rate collector's office to pay my rates. He would not accept it. On the 24th I paid it into my son's bank, and it was returned, "No account." The matter was then in the Hands of the police. I went up to Smith's place and saw him. He was very much surprised, and appeared to know absolutely nothing at all about it; he had known Reeves 15 years, and never knew any<lb/>thing against him. He wanted me to let him have the cheque back, and I did so on the conditions that he gave me a receipt and a copy of the cheque. The cheque is signed J. G. Bacon. I believed it was a good cheque.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080036"/>
               <p>Cross-examined by Smith. The insurance business you did for me has always been carried through. The day you called with Reeves was not about the cheque business but to tell me a claim for burglary in<lb/>surance had passed through. You wanted the claim form altered, left it with me and went out of the shop. Mr. Reeves stayed. He tendered the cheque in your presence. I did not pay him the money in your presence. You had the cheque back to give to your solici<lb/>tor. You said Reeves had no solicitor, and you would do your best to get the money back. You did not say the solicitor wanted some costs to go on with the case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Stewart. I gave you ₤ 2 one day and ₤ 2 the next. You were not sober the second day. I had no suspicion that you drank before that.</p>

               <p>He did not come for the balance. The cheque came back marked "No account." I sent round to him and wrote, but never got any reply. On the 21st I went to his house. He was not in. He came in an hour or an hour and a half later. I said, "How is it you have not been in for the balance? " He said he knew there bad been some trouble with that cheque and others, and if he came and gave me the 30s. would I let him have the cheque back. He said it was to do with Reeves, and nothing to do with him. While I was talking to him two plain-clothes men came and spoke to Smith and took him away.</p>
               <p>To Smith. You had the 10s. and the ₤ 1 the same day you gave me the cheque.</p>

We communicated with him when these cheques began to. come in. There are two cheques signed J. H. Simmons and two J. G. Bacon. They are not customers of ours.</p>
               <p>To Smith. There has been one other cheque out of the same book presented for payment. It was signed J. G. Bacon.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED SCHOLES, </hi>G Division. I saw both prisoners at Clerkenwell Police Court on January 26, and told them they would be charged with being concerned in obtaining money from Miss Sexton, Mr. Cole, and Mrs. Layton by means of worthless cheques. Smith made no reply. Stewart said, referring to the case of the Mayfield Laundry, "Yes, I got the money for some one else." When the charge was read over to him he said, "Yes, it was paid as an account for Smith."</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN TANNER, </hi>N Division. On January 21 I went with another officer to the "Flying Horse" public-house, Walworth Road. I saw Smith there, called him out, told him we were police officers, and held a warrant for his arrest for being concerned with a man named Reeves in obtaining ₤ 4 by means of a worthless cheque from Mr. Woolrich in November last. He said, "I know Reeves very well. I did not have any of the ₤ 4. I was with him when he asked Mr. Woolrich to change the cheque, and did not know anything was wrong with it until Mr. Woolrich came to me. I asked him to Jet me have the cheque to send to my solicitor, which I did." I took him to the police station, where the warrant was read. He said, "I am not guilty; I never had any of the money." I saw Stewart, whom I knew as Reeves, on the 26th at King's Cross Road Police Station; I read the warrant to him. He said, "The man must be mad."</p>

               <p>do not know if your Lordship will allow me to have an expert's opinion on that. (Judge Rentoul: You are allowed to have an expert if you give notice to have him here. Experts' evidence about hand<lb/>writing is worth what it is worth, which is not very much.) With re<lb/>ference to the Mayfield Laundry, this was at a time I had a laundry myself. I used to sublet my work to the Mayfield Laundry, and they allowed me a discount. At that time I was laid up with fits about six weeks, and could not have been there. This cheque came into my business. Reeves was my manager; he paid my accounts and did my insurance business. I wrote to the Mayfield Laundry as you heard the witness say. I said, "Don't you know they have taken out a summons against me? " She knew nothing about it. The cheque was paid to them in the ordinary way of business. As to Cole's cheque, I owed him money for work done to the shop and premises I occupied, and he had written to me several times, and I took him round the cheque. It was paid to me in the way of insurance business. Layton's cheque was given to me to put through the bank, and when I went to Mrs. Layton I had no intention of asking her for any money. I asked her to put the cheque through her account. She sent the cheque out while I was there. That was Thursday morning before lunch. In the evening I went in and had 10s.; I thought it was Friday. I met several people, and we had drinks and smokes, and then I said to Mrs. Layton, "Would you oblige me with 10s., I have not enough money to stand drinks? " Mrs. Layton went to her till and gave me 10s. I had 30s. altogether. I did not know the cheque was worthless. I could have got the ₤ 4 10s. as easy as 10s.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, not on oath). You will understand the awkward position I am in, that of employer and employee. This cheque of Mr. Woolrich's was paid to me. I went to him and asked him if he would change it. I should have gone to the insurance com<lb/>pany represented by Mr. Smith, and asked them to change it. In insurance work there is a lot of cheques paid. From the time it came back marked "no account" it was given to Mr. Smith. He put it in His solicitor's hands. Time went on. The Mayfield Laundry was doing his washing, and it came a question of paying his account. The cheque was given to me to pay the account as a matter of business. I obtained the money and paid it out, and put it in Mr. Smith's hands as my employer. As far as the third cheque with this publican, I know nothing at all about it. I was not in the house when the sovereign was given to Smith with which he was supposed to pay me. I have never disputed my signature on the first cheque.</p>

                  </hi>1, Florence Villas, Ealing. Annie Covell, my daughter was 27 years old; she lived at home with me and my wife. I have known prisoner two years; he was engaged to my daughter. He stayed with us off and on till September, 1909. Annie was invited to a wedding at Hanwell on January 8; prisoner was not also invited, and this upset him. There was a quarrel, and I told him be must leave the house, and I sent his box away; he threatened to bash my brains out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner and Annie were very fond of each other. Mrs. <hi rend="smallCaps">COVELL.</hi> On the morning of January 10 I was in the kitchen with Annie when prisoner came down and went into the breakfast room. Annie went to go upstairs; that would take her past the break<lb/>fast room; in a few minutes I heard a scream; I went to the room and saw prisoner kneeling on Annie, and her throat was right out; prisoner had a bread knife in his hand, and I saw him give Annie two stabs with it. I had never seen the knife before; it did not belong to us. Prisoner threw the knife under the table and walked away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner appeared to be extraordinarily calm. Except for the incident of the Han well wedding there was no quarrel between him and Annie.</p>

When the magistrate asked prisoner if he had any questions to ask of the wit<lb/>nesses he replied, "I did it, and I am satisfied."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner is 27 years old. He entered the Army in 1900, served 250 days at Aden and over four years in India. He left the Army in November, 1907, with "very good" discharges. Since then, when in employment, he has Some an excellent character. His parents are very respectable people. When he made his statement to me he did not appear to be in a passion; his only grievance appar<lb/>ently was about the Han well wedding; he was exceptionally calm and composed.</p>

The wound may have been caused by the knife (produced). There were also three or four stabbing wounds on the side and back of the body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have had considerable experience in cases of insanity. "Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence" is a work of very high authority.</p>
               <p>Counsel put to the witness the following extracts from this work, under the heading "Impulsive Insanity": "The test of whether there has been momentary insanity is whether there is any recollection afterwards of what has occurred. In cases of impulsive insanity there may or may not be evidence of actual intellectual aberration; but the main feature of the disorder is the existence of a destructive impulse which, like a delusion, cannot be controlled by the patient. This im<lb/>pulse, thus dominating over all other feelings, leads a person to destroy those to whom he is most fondly attached, or anyone who may be involved in his delusion. Sometimes the impulse is long-felt, but concealed. There may be merely signs of depression and melancholia; there may be nothing to lead anybody to a suspicion of what is going on within the mind.... Occasionally the act of murder is per<lb/>petrated with great deliberation, and apparently with all the marks of sanity.... Of the existence of insanity in the common or legal acceptance of the term, before and after the perpetration of the crime, there may be either no evidence whatever, or it may be so slight as not to amount to proof.... A sudden restoration to reason is not infrequent in such cases of homicidal mania. An act of violence is committed, and the patient appears as if relieved from some</p>

               <p>oppressive feeling." Witness expressed general agreement with this authority.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Justice Coleridge: A perfectly sane man may go momen<lb/>tarily mad and become sane again the moment afterwards. In cases of temporary mania symptoms may have been overlooked on account of their apparent triviality, which after a crime would be regarded as evidence of mental aberration.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. (Q). If you had no evidence before you at all ex<lb/>cept that the accused had done an act of great violence, what opinion would you form as to whether he was sane or not? — If I had no evi<lb/>dence of any kind I should say he was sane. I should not call an im<lb/>pulse ''sudden" if it extended over hours: certainly not if it extended from Saturday to Monday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement before the magistrate: "I am sorry to say I have done it; I do not think it is much use me saying anything."</p>

                  </hi>2, Park Street, W. I was at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1864-67; there was with me at Trinity a Mr. Paxton; he is now in Court. In 1904 I received two letters written in the name of Paxton, asking for monetary help, and I sent cheques. In November last I received another letter, in response to which I sent the cheque for ₤ 5 (produced) with a letter on my headed paper, addressed to Paxton, 32, Bessborough Gardens. The cheque was passed through my account at the Bank of England, Western Branch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There may have been more than one Paxton at Trinity.</p>

                  </hi> I was with Mr. Ralli at Trinity in 1864-67. I have had no correspondence with him since; I have never asked for or received cheques from him. The endorsement on the cheque (produced) is not in my writing; I know absolutely nothing about the cheque.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The cheque is endorsed "Robert G. Paxton." I,. cannot say whether there was another Paxton at Trinity.</p>

I have known prisoner since childhood; in the latter part of last year he called occasionally at my house. I was short of money and asked him for a little financial help; he replied that if I would not mind taking in a letter addressed in the name of Paxton he thought he would be able to help me. I agreed; and a day or two afterwards I took in a letter addressed Paxton; this I gave to prisoner,, and he put it in his pocket. Two days later he gave me the cheque (pro<lb/>duced), and asked me to get it cashed by some tradesman. I took it</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I am an old friend of the prisoner. Early in last year, when I was living at Kennington Oval, prisoner called with a friend whom he introduced to me as Mr. Paxton; it was not the gentleman who gave evidence to-day. When the letter came addressed to Mr. Paxton I handed it, unopened, to prisoner; he did not open it, but put it in his pocket. After he gave me the cheque I kept it in my purse in my room for several days before cashing it.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I have never known the witness, Robert Charles Paxton. For twelve months I have known a Robert George Paxton. I met him casually in a billiard saloon at the "Hanover Arms, " Peckham; in May last I introduced him to Mrs. Thompson. Paxton gave me to understand that he was a public school boy, and a member of the Oxford and Cambridge Club, from which he had been expelled. In November he told me he would like an address at which to receive letters, as he was in a bad condi<lb/>tion financially, and there were some of his late colleagues at college who could and would assist him. I suggested Mrs. Thompson's address at Bessborough Gardens. The account Mrs. Thompson gave to-day is substantially correct. When she gave me the letter addressed</p>

               <p>to Mr. Paxton I kept it in my pocket till the following day. I gave it to Paxton; he opened it in front of me; it contained a cheque. I suggested to him that the person who had taken the letter in was in financial difficulties; and could I make use of the cheque, to which he agreed. He endorsed the cheque in my presence, using a very old and rusty stylographic pen. I never knew Paxton's address.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I heard my solicitor, at the police court, cross<lb/>examining Mrs. Thompson as follows: "(Q.) When that letter arrived and Bevington called you handed it to him? (A.) Yes. (Q.) I put it to you that he took the cheque from the letter and handed you the cheque the same day." My solicitor was wrong; I did not correct him at the time; I must have misinformed him. I do not know Pax<lb/>ton's address; he has written to me several times; I have not kept any of his letters; I have no idea where to find him. The writing on the rent-book covers is not mine; I cannot say whose it is.</p>

                  </hi> I have known Bevington a great many years. In November and December last he called several times. He asked if a letter came in the name of Paxton would I take it in. He said he would be able to help me with some money if I did. A letter did come in the name of Paxton, and I gave it to him. He did not open it in my presence. After that he asked me to get a cheque cashed for him. (Exhibit 1, cheque for ₤ 5.) The endorsement "Robert G. Paxton, " was not put upon that cheque in my presence. I cashed the cheque through a tradesman, Mr. Leonard, and took the proceeds to Bevington, and asked for the use of it, as I had to send some money away. He said I could have it, and I paid away ₤ 4 5s., and some to Mr. Leonard. I do not think I gave any part of the money to Bevington. About six or seven weeks before December 15 Millington called with another gentleman, whom I after<lb/>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080044"/>
               <p>wards found was Clarke, and asked if I had an apartment to let; and a week later Millington came to live at my house, occupying a room at 12s. 6d. a week. While there he was visited several times by Clarke and Wellings. Mil<lb/>lington brought Clarke home with him on December 13, and Clarke occupied his room with him. I do not remember seeing Millington next morning. At about two o'clock, on the 14th, Wellings, Clarke, and Millington returned to the house. Millington called to me from the sitting-room to bring him some blot<lb/>ting-paper. When I took the blotting-paper into the room there was a newspaper on the table, and hanging from the table what looked like the cover of a cheque-book. They remained in the room about three<lb/>quarter of an hour, and then left the house. About five o'clock Bevington called and had some tea. Soon afterwards Wellings, Mil<lb/>lington, and Clarke came in at the front door overhead. I went up and asked if they would like some tea. They were all three intoxicated; they had two bottles of champagne with them, and asked me for some glasses. When I took the glasses up I saw a very large quantity of gold on the table. Clarke was putting it into a bank canvas bag. They opened the wine and gave me a small glass, which I took down<lb/>stairs with me, and also a paper bag which Clarke gave me, he said for a Christmas present; he was very intoxicated. I counted it out down<lb/>stairs and it had ₤ 100 in gold in it. I gave nearly ₤ 60 back to Mr. Fowler, the ₤ 40 I paid away. When I went downstairs with the bag of gold Bevington was still there and another gentleman, Mr. Taylor. I told them the three gentlemen upstairs were very intoxicated, and would they kindly go up and see that they did not create any dis<lb/>turbance, and would they see them out of the house for me. After a lot of trouble the five of them left the house. Before finally going Wellings put a little packet into my hand, which I placed in my jer<lb/>sey, and forgot all about it, because I was so much upset at the to-do they were making, and it must have fallen out. I never knew what it was. Mr. Fowler told me afterwards that it had been found. After the five men left the house I turned the lights off in my sitting-room and went downstairs and prepared supper. Taylor and Bevington came back later and had supper. After supper I said I felt rather upset, and that I should like a breath of fresh air; Bevington said that as he was going home I might go a little way with him, and Taylor said he would come out with us and return with me; so we went out and walked across Vauxhall Bridge, and at Kennington Church we took a taxi and drove to Lewisham. The gentlemen visited one or two public-houses on the way. I went in, and the taxi<lb/>driver also. We left Bevington at the corner of his own road in Cat<lb/>ford, and Taylor and I drove back. Taylor, who is not in the habit of taking drink, was overcome by it, and he slept all the way home. I paid the taxi driver and Taylor returned the money to me after<lb/>wards out of a sovereign given him by Wellings to pay for his and Bevington's return taxi. I think Bevington called at my house on the evening of the 15th, and brought a paper, and said that one of the three had been arrested, and spoke of the bank robbery to us; he said it was in the papers. I think he said Millington had been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080045"/>
               <p>arrested. Saturday was the next time I saw him. I was very ill in bed: and he only stayed a few minutes, and said he would call again on the Monday. In leaving my house, I believe, he was arrested.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bennett Calvert. I do not remember now when Wellings first came to my house. I cannot remember whether he called on Millington before I got the Paxton letter. With regard to the cheque, I spoke to Mr. Fowler yesterday about a circumstance that came into my mind. Directly I had the cheque I took it to a tradesman to change for me, I think on a Friday or a Saturday. On the following Monday I was wanting to send ₤ 5 away to my landlord at Brighton, and as I was going to the post office, a few doors from the tradesman's shop, to get five ₤ 1 postal orders, I called at the shop and said to the wife of the trade man that I had to send ₤ 5 away, and if I had the ₤ 5 cheque back I could send it instead of getting the postal orders, and it would save me the poundage. I cannot tell you the name because they were new people, but it was Williams's old shop; it had changed hands. She said it was not banked, and I got the cheque back, as that would be better than buying five postal orders. On the following Saturday I took it to Mr. Leonard. The cheque was in an unlocked dresser drawer in the general living-room from the Monday to the Saturday. I did not miss it; but my lodgers would have access to that drawer. About two o'clock on the 14th when I went upstairs Wellings was there with the others. He was sitting on the chair very intoxicated; his head was forward, and he looked droop<lb/>ing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Roome. I have known Bevington for a great many years; there was nothing unusual in his coming to the house, he was a friend of the family and his father and my father knew each other. He never came to the house to see Millington, Wellings, or Clarke, and never asked about them; they were quite strangers to him— all of them. The Paxton cheque was in the draw in the break<lb/>fast-room from the Monday till the Saturday, and there was nothing to prevent Wellings, or Millington, or Clarke having access to it. I am not certain whether I gave Bevington any of the proceeds of the cheque; I may have given him a few shillings. It was a loan to me, and when I got the ₤ 100 I repaid Bevington his ₤ 5. When the three men came in on the 14th, Bevington was downstairs having tea with some other gentlemen and myself. The only reason he and Taylor went upstairs was to quiet the men and use persuasion to get them out of the house, because I did not want a row. Bevington and Taylor got them away from the house and returned afterwards, about nine o'clock, and had supper with me. They were both perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by Mr. Muir. I cannot tell you when I first men<lb/>tioned about the ₤ 5 cheque being with another tradesman. Last Saturday week Mrs. Wellings called at my house and asked if I could let her have a little money because she had no food for herself and her little girl. It was rather late, and I asked one of the gentle<lb/>men if he could oblige me with part of his money so that I could give it to her. It is not since that visit that I remembered about the cheque; it had nothing to do with that visit. I have only seen Miss</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080046"/>
               <p>Finden, whom I thought was Mrs. Clarke, when she called once at my front door and asked if Clarke, was there. I think the trademan Williams, had the cheque for three days. It was then in my posses<lb/>sion for a week before it was cashed by Leonard. That is the truth about the cheque; not my story about it. The cheque is dated Decem<lb/>ber 1. It has December 7 stamped on it, the date on which it was honoured at the bank. Leonard said he got it from me on Saturday, the 4th, but I believe it was the next Saturday. I think Leonard has made a mistake. I have not seen the date on the cheque before, and I thought it had been given to Leonard the week after it was sashed. I did say at the police court that the men were intoxi<lb/>cated at two o'clock. I made a special note of it afterwards. I made that note before Mrs. Wellings called on me. I mentioned it at the Marl borough Street Police Court the second time I was there. I thought I had omitted it on the first occasion. I said it when they were reading my evidence over to me; I corrected them in reading it. I cannot account for the fact that there is no note of it at the end of my deposition. They were all three intoxicated, although not as intoxicated as they were at night. I cannot say that Wellings was able to do the writing for the others. I do not know that he has said he did. I have never had letter paper in my possession with Mr. Ralli's heading on it. I may have have said before that I repaid Bevington the ₤ 5. I have not been asked any question about it.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bennett Calvert. When Mrs. Wellings called she did not suggest that I should say that Wellings was drunk at two o'clock or that I should say the cheque had been taken to Williams; it was not thought of She simply called to borrow some money from me to buy food with.</p>

               <p>the Bank of England changed into English gold notes of the value of ₤ 400. Millington and Wellings went to Thomas Cook and Son, at Ludgate Circus, and changed notes for ₤ 700 into German and French gold; this they took to Cook and Son's office in Cockspur Street, and changed into English gold. Other notes were changed at various restaurants, jewellers, tailors, etc. About midnight on the 14th Bevington, Mrs. Thompson, and a Mr. Taylor were driven by a taxi<lb/>cab-driver to Catford, where Bevington lived; Bevington was left there; Mrs. Thompson and Taylor were driven back to Bessborough Gardens. When he got to his garage the driver found in his cab the cheque-book from which the forged cheque had been taken. On December 15, outside the Savoy Hotel, Wellings handed two ₤ 50 notes to a taxicab-driver to get cashed; the driver went for that purpose to the Law hurts branch of the Bank of England; there the two notes were identified as part of the proceeds of the forged cheque; the driver went back to Wellings, who was waiting outside the Savoy, and he was arrested.</p>
               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">ALBERT HINE, </hi>City Police. On December 15 Wellings was pointed out to me in the Strand by the cabdriver who had sought to change two notes at the Law Courts branch of the Bank of England. I went to Wellings and said, "We are police officers and are making inquiries regarding some bank notes which have been obtained by means of a forged cheque; two of those notes have been presented at the Law Courts branch this afternoon by the chauffeur, who says he received them from you." On the way to Vine Street Police Station I asked Wellings from whom he received the notes. He said, "I received the two notes about 3.30 p.m. in Romano's, from a man I know by the name of John Stuart Robinson, who said, 'Charlie, have you any money? '; I said, 'Yes '; he said, 'How about changing these two notes for me and how about a trip to Monte Carlo; I will pay all expenses? '; I took the notes to get them changed, and the man said to me, 'Give me the money at four o'clock.'" I said, "Did he give you any more notes? " he said, "No, " He appeared to have been drinking heavily.</p>
               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY FOWLER, </hi>C Division. On December 15 I saw Wellings at Vine Street Station; he was drunk. When he saw me, before I had spoken to him, he said, "Hallo, Mr. Fowler, you have got me well beat; you know what a rough time I have had since I saw you last; I have been practically starving, or I would not have done it." I told him the charge; he said, "They brought it (the forged cheque) to me yesterday afternoon and asked me to write it; I was starving and had not a penny; they tempted me, and I did the writing for them; I had about ₤ 375 for my share; there was three of us in it; I have been on the drink ever since, and was off to Monte Carlo to-night." On searching him we found a quantity of French coins and ₤ 45 in Bank of England notes. I saw Millington at vine Street Station; on him we found a number of notes (identified as part of the proceeds of the cheque) and three pawntickets. Next say I arrested Clarke; he had on him ₤ 7 in English gold and 20 francs French gold. On December 18 I arrested Bevington. When</p>

               <p>I told him the charge he said, "I do not know what you mean; it is all new to me"; he repeated this when formally charged.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Calvert. Wellings was very much intoxicated. I am sure he did not say ''They asked me to write it, and it was very tempt<lb/>ing, but I did not do it."</p>

               <p>Wellings was stated to be an expert forger. He had on several occasions given valuable information to the police; it was through him that Millington was arrested and ₤ 450 of the money recovered. He has still a remnant of 20 months, penal servitude to serve. There is no previous conviction against Millington, but he has lately got into very bad company. Clarke has one previous conviction re<lb/>corded, and is an associate of thieves and prostitutes and worse characters.

                  </hi>25, Bromley Road, Kent, schoolmistress. On January 8, 1910, at about 8, 20 p.m., I arrived in a cab at St. Paul's Station with luggage, including a black square leather gladstone bag, the corners of which were worn brown. The prisoner, who was selling papers, placed his papers on the window sill and offered to take charge of my bag. I allowed him to do so, and followed him into the booking; hall, where I asked him to take the bag to the top of the stairs, giving him 2d. for his trouble; I then bought my ticket and went up the stairs, when the prisoner and the bag had disappeared. He must have passed the bookstall and gone through a subway which leads into the District Railway, Blackfriars Station. The bag contained wear<lb/>ing apparel, value ₤ 5. I spoke to a policeman, went to the Bride<lb/>well. Police Station, and gave a description of the prisoner. On January 18 at Bridewell Police Station I picked prisoner out from a row of eight men. I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>outside porter, St. Paul's Station. At 8.37 p.m. I was on the platform attending on the train leaving for Flushing. On that day I had seen the prisoner selling papers outside the station, and took particular notice of him because he was a new face, and I knew all the men who were in the habit of selling papers there. I heard that the prosecutrix's bag had been stolen, and ran to find the prisoner, who had disappeared. Some days afterwards I saw prisoner at the Mansion House Police Court and at once recognised him. He is the man.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). At the time the lady lost her bag I was at South Lambeth Road selling a paper called "Liberal Opinion." I was at a Liberal meeting there from 7.30 till 9.45 p.m. There were two men there whom I was going to call as witnesses. The reason I cannot call them is that on January 12 I was standing outside the station when two newsvendors said, "Detective Harris wants you." I said, "Wants me— what for? " They said, "For stealing a bag at St. Paul's Station last Saturday night at eight o'clock." I was talking to a man at the time; so I told the man where I was. He says, "Well, why don't you go to Bridewell and clear yourself"; so I said, "I will in the morning." So I went round to the "Liberal Opinion" offices in Fleet Street and found two men who were with me selling the same paper, and arranged with them to come the next morning to Bridewell Police Station, which we did. I asked the officer in charge if I could see Detective-sergeant Harris. He said, "What do you want him for? " I said, "I hear he wants me for stealing a bag at St. Paul's Station, which I know nothing about." He took me to the jailor's room and told the jailor, who said, " He does not want you. If he did he would have had you before now, " and the officer said, "You need not trouble, he does not want you." I came out and said to the two witnesses, "You need</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080050"/>
               <p>not trouble." That is the reason I have not the two witnesses here. I never took their addresses; I thought everything was alright after going to the station. I have not had a chance to find them while I have been shut up in prison. The witness who said he saw me carry<lb/>ing the bag said at the Mansion House he had known me for years— I had not done an honest day's work; he now says he has only known me eight days selling papers. I have not any witnesses here because I thought it was all right.</p>

               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK PIERCEY, </hi>City Police. On January 11, act<lb/>ing on information received, I, in company with Detective Hunt, went to the 3.45 p.m. service at St. Paul's Cathedral, where we watched the prisoner and her daughter, a young girl about 12½ years of age, for about 20 minutes, sitting behind two ladies, when they got up and moved to another position behind two other ladies. At ten minutes to five, whilst the prayers were being read, the congregation kneeling, I saw the young girl put her hand under the chair in front of her and withdraw this bag (produced) containing a blouse, value 15s. She showed it to the prisoner who nodded, and the girl then left the Cathe<lb/>dral by the west door with the bag in her hand, and took it into a passage on the north side of St. Paul's Churchyard, where I saw her examine it, and place it under her jacket. I spoke to the child and took her to Bridewell Station, where she was confronted with the prisoner. I said to the prisoner, "You will be charged with this girl with stealing a blouse." She refused her name and address or to give any account of herself. Next morning they were taken before Alder<lb/>man Truscott at the Mansion House, where prisoner still refused to give any account of herself, and told her child to do the same; they were remanded to January 18, when the charge of larceny was withdrawn against the child, who was discharged, but afterwards charged with wandering, not being under proper control, and sent to an industrial school till 16 years of age. When the order was made for the child to go to the industrial school prisoner made a statement, which I did not hear, disclosing who she was.</p>

I watched prisoner and her little girl in St. Paul's Cathedral from about 3.45 to 4.45 sitting behind two ladies. After about 15 minutes they moved to behind two other ladies. I was about three chairs di<lb/>rectly behind prisoner. Detective Piercey was sitting on a chair on the right in a line with her. Just as the last prayer was being said, while these two young ladies were on their knees with their hands before their faces, the child stooped down, and with her right hand withdrew this packet from between the chairs. The child nudged the prisoner, who was pretending to pray, and who then nodded to<lb/>wards the exit, and said something and the child immediately got up and made for the west door to go out. Detective Piercey spoke to me and followed the child out. I watched the prisoner, who still kept on her knees. When the two ladies, the Misses Wright, got up I saw them looking about on the backs of the chairs. The prisoner then got up off her knees, and I went out and gave the signal for Piercey to arrest the girl. I met the prisoner coming out of the Cathedral, and told her I was a police officer, and should arrest her for stealing a parcel which the child had got. She said, "What, she steal a parcel; she might have picked one up." We then went to the station, where they refused to give any account of themselves. Subsequently it was found the child was the daughter of the prisoner, and was dealt with by the prisoner on the remand, the prisoner being sent for trial.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I did not come and ask you if you had a little girl belonging to you, nor ask two ladies other than the Miss Wrights whether they had lost anything.</p>

We were sitting on two chairs, and the child asked me if she could move up further as she could not hear very well. We did move up, and then the child wanted to go out. I stayed during the prayers. I never heard the child go out, and did not know until the police officer came and asked me if I had a little girl belonging to me. I said "Yes, " and he said, "Would you come this way." I went with him across the road. Then he brought me back to the Cathedral and asked two ladies if they had lost anything. They said "No." Then he went to this other lady.

You have been there before and you have stolen other things; we know you well. We have got your photograph in the Strand." The man had no business to say it, so I said, "That is quite sufficient, if you know me, " and I told the child not to give her name and address. Next day I told the magis<lb/>trate who I am. I have been convicted for stealing some boots in 1905; that does not make the child a thief. I wish to call the child. The child was brought into the witness-box, but refused to take the oath. The prisoner said if she did not want to she need not. Verdict,

               <p>Prisoner confessed to having been convicted on January 2, 1906, at St. Albans Quarter Sessions, in the name of Annie Mitchell, and re<lb/>ceiving one month's hard labour for stealing two pairs of boots. She was stated to have been living at Barnet at the time with two children, of which this little child was one. The children were then handed over to some friends. This child is said to be her illegitimate child. The prisoner has led a very immoral life in her early days. No record of her marriage has been found. She is known to Father O'Connor, of Barnet, who has assisted her with the child, who has now been sent to Isleworth Industrial School.</p>

On January 23, 1910, at 1 a.m., I was on duty in Upper Saffron Hill when I saw the pri<lb/>soners loitering about in a very suspicious manner, and kept them under observation. They climbed over the gate of an enclosure of St. Peter's Church. By climbing over another door they could reach the back of a rubber factory. I climbed over the gate, found the two pri<lb/>soners there, and seized Wicks. He took jemmy produced from under his coat, and threw it over the double doors leading to the factory. Smith said, "It is only a bottle he had got in his pocket." Wicks said, "All right, governor, I only came over here to do a crap." I communicated with Langton, 128 E, who took Smith to the station. I took Wicks, who became very violent. I flashed my light; two other constables came to my assistance, and the prisoners were taken to Gray's Inn Road Police Station. I then returned, and found the jemmy just within the doors of the rubber factory.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoners were together. Smith did not come to the gate and speak to me. Wicks threw the jemmy just before I seized him. I did not ask him what he was doing; there was no occasion to when I saw him throw the jemmy. I found no other article but the jemmy in the gateway afterwards.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES LANGTON, </hi>128 E. On January 23, at 1.20 a.m., Police-constable Grainger signalled to me. and I went to assist him. I stood outside the gate and saw the prisoners standing in the shadow. Wicks took jemmy (produced) from under his coat and threw it over the double doors at the back of the enclosure. It appeared to be a stick of some kind, but when it fell I could hear the ring of steel. Smith climbed back into the street and said, '"He" (Wicks) "came over to do a crap." Smith went quietly to the station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I returned with Grainger, who had a lantern, and who got over and found the jemmy on the other side of the double doors. He searched in the enclosure with his lantern, and he found indications that some one had been there for a natural purpose.</p>

I said, "No I never saw it until he fetched it into the station. The Inspector fetched it in."</p>

I have no need to come out thieving. I earn a living selling fruit and flowers in the City. Is it likely when I saw the constables come over that I should pull a thing out like that and throw it away? The first time I saw it was in the police station, and then it was thick with rust. It is black with rust now. It has</p>

               <p>Wicks had been, in October, 1909, bound over in ₤ 5 for 12 months under the Probation Act for snatching a lady's hand-bag, after receiv<lb/>ing three months at Clerkenwell as a rogue and vagabond. The Re<lb/>corder remarked that Smith should have been indicted as an habitual criminal; that it was an extraordinary thing Wicks should be bound over in the charge of a probation officer.</p>

I weighed it in a small machine we have; it would not go down, it stuck at the top. I gave it him back. I said, "Where did you get this from? This 2s. piece is bad. Have you any more like it? " He made no reply, but gave me a shilling in payment for the tobacco. When I gave him the 2s. piece back he said, "You take</p>

                  </hi>licensee, "Bull and Anchor" public house, High Holborn. On January 15, about 5.45 p.m., Williams came into the bar. He asked for half pint of ale and a screw of shag tobacco. Miss Robinson, the barmaid, served him. Through a mirror I saw the coin put on the bar. The barmaid picked it up and began to test it. She was bringing it to me and before she put it in my hand I saw it was bad. Prisoner Williams saw her testing it. I do not think he was aware that she was bringing it to me. Prisoner ran out immediately. I followed him. He crossed the road very rapidly. I never lost sight of him. He spoke to a woman and then hurried down the road eastward. I overtook him this side of the First Avenue Hotel, on the opposite side of the road. I think he sus<lb/>pected he was being followed, but did not suspect I was following him. I did not think it wise to speak to him as there was no police<lb/>man about. He stopped, and I came up with him. Then he caught sight of Harrison in front of the First Avenue Hotel. He went across and spoke to him. I could see they were entering into conversation, and ran to Chancery Lane and got a policeman, who came back with me, and I charged them. I followed them to the police station about two yards behind. Near the police station Harrison dropped a counterfeit florin close to his right foot. The policeman picked it up. I heard the charge read over to them. Harrison protested that he only stopped the other man for a light, although he had got a box of matches on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Williams. I know where I gave you in charge; the "Bull and Anchor" is on the same side of the road.</p>

The prisoner ran out. I did not give him any change. I next saw him at Bow Street Police Station on the following Monday. I there picked him out from other men.</p>
               <p>Police-constable <hi rend="smallCaps">SAMUEL FOSTER, </hi>364 L. I was on duty in High Holborn on January 15 about 6 p.m. Mr. Roadley spoke to me. In consequence of what he said I stopped near the First Avenue Hotel. Williams and Harrison were there. I said to Williams, "You must come with me to the station." He said, "What for? " I said, "This gentleman, " meaning prosecutor, "is charging you with utter<lb/>ing counterfeit coin." He said "Certainly, " and laughed. I said to Harrison, "You had better come as well." He said, "All right, but I do not know what for; he only stopped and asked me for a</p>

               <p>light." I took Williams into custody, Harrison walked on the right hand side. In Broad Court a coin dropped from Harrison. He seemed to bend forward as though slipping it down his trousers. I picked up a 2s. piece close to Harrison's right foot. I searched Wil<lb/>liams at the station. I found on him 21s. 6d. in silver and 4Ɖ d. in bronze, all small money, except one half-crown. On Harrison I found 1s. 6d. silver and 3Ɖ d. bronze, and a box of matches on each prisoner. There were a few matches in each box. When the charge was read over Harrison said, "I have never been in that house in my life"; Williams said, "I aunt changed no counterfeit florin."</p>
               <p>To Williams. I only found about a spiteful of tobacco, on you.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. There were eight matches in one box and 12 in the other. (To the Judge.) I did not see the coin fall from Harrison, I heard the sound. If Williams had thrown the coin I should have seen the movement. I had hold of his right arm and he would have had to throw his left arm in front of me.</p>

I never had it in my posses<lb/>sion. If he see me stoop he must have seen me undo my trousers here. (A juror pointed out that the matches were of different colours.)

                  </hi>wife of William Freedman, 8a, Lombard Street, Whitechapel. I have known prisoner about two months. I had some unpleasantness with my husband, and decided to leave him and go to Holland, where I have friends, and arranged with prisoner to carry my luggage to the Batavia on Saturday, January 29, between 4 and 5 P.m. On the way I stopped at a post-office in Leman Street to post a letter, and took out three sovereigns, tied them in a handkerchief, and put it in my pocket, outside the office, the prisoner standing close to me. When we got to the wharf it was closed, and prisoner took me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080058"/>
               <p>across to a small tavern up a turning, where another man came up to me and said, "Where are you going to? Do you want to leave your husband and children? As I turned to answer him pri<lb/>soner put his hand in my pocket, took out the handkerchief with the money, and started to run. I caught him by the coat; he gave me a blow on the right side of my face, and ran away. I screamed out in Jewish, "My gilt, " returned to where the other man was standing by my luggage, and found my bag had disappeared. I then went to Liverpool Street Station to go via Harwich to Amsterdam. Having only got four shillings left I pawned my wedding-ring to pay the fare, and arrived at Amsterdam the next morning. I did not inform the police as I was excited and afraid of having to go back to my husband. I remained in Amsterdam till Wednesday, February 2, and returned to London, arriving on February 3, when I saw the prisoner in Leman Street. He ran away. I went to the police station the next day, and on Saturday when a detective went with me about the streets, and into Leman Street when I saw the prisoner following me. I pointed him out to the detectives; they brought him over to me, and I gave him in charge as the man who had stolen my money. Prisoner did not say anything in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner received my packages on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday before January 29. I did not give him 8s. on Thursday. I did not pawn a ring for ₤ 1, and give it to prisoner to keep for me till Saturday. I gave him 2s. to buy a basket for me for my clothes. I never drank with him except on the Friday, when I gave him some clothes, and when I had a lemon and a dash, which I paid for. Prisoner was waiting outside when I went into the post<lb/>office.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES COLLINS, </hi>City Police. On Saturday, February 5, prosecutrix made a statement to me, and with Detective Beechey I accompanied her through some, streets in the East End into Leman Street, when we saw the prisoner, who I noticed was watching prose<lb/>cutrix. This was at 7.15 p.m. Prosecutrix crossed the road towards prisoner, when he ran away. I ran after him for about 500 yards through various streets, and ran him into No. 10, Tenter Street, the door of which was standing open. I told him I was a police officer, and that he answered the description of a man wanted for stealing ₤ 3 and a pocket handkerchief from a woman in Water Lane. He said, "Where is the woman? I know nothing." He spoke English fairly well, and understood what I was saying. I took him to the prose<lb/>cutrix in Leman Street, and she said, "That is the man." I took him to Minories Police Station; he was charged, and said, "No such thing." There was an interpreter attending at the station, but his services were not necessary.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I know a man named Abraham Deutsch, who has a business here and in Amsterdam. The prose<lb/>cutrix was in love with a young man twenty years of age, and he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080059"/>
               <p>brought her clothes to me and asked me to keep them at my rooms. Prosecutrix came to me and said, "Abraham says you will be a true friend to me like a father." I said to her, " Do not carry on like this; keep yourself from drink." On Friday evening I went to the boat to make inquiry as to the price of the ticket. Prosecutrix them pawned her ring. On the Saturday we went to the boat and found the office closed. We went across the road, when a man named Wein<lb/>berg came and spoke to her. He said he had written to her lover's father, and he wanted to stop her going to Amsterdam. As we went across the road a policeman was standing facing us. I then left her with Weinberg, who was persuading her to return to her husband and children. On February 5 I was in Leman Street. I ran away when prosecutrix crossed the road towards me, and the detective came after me. It is absolutely untrue to say that I took her money or struck her in the face. I ran away because Deutsch had told me that she was making a charge against me.</p>

                  </hi>31, Rutland Street, Stepney, general dealer. I have relations in Holland, and have known prosecutrix since Friday fortnight, when I learnt that she was going to run away to Holland. On January 29 I saw her with the prisoner, who was carrying her basket, and followed them. In Water Lane I said to her, "It is a shame for a Jewish woman to go to Amsterdam with a young chap and leave her four children behind her." She said, "You mind your own business." I advised her to go home and not go away. She said, "Let me alone, I can do what I like." The prisoner was speaking Yiddish to her, which I do not understand, and there was some struggle between them, but I could not understand what they were talking about. A policeman was on duty there. I did not see pri<lb/>soner take her handkerchief from her or strike her a violent blow in the face— he did not do it— if he had done so she would have com<lb/>plained to the policeman who was there. I advised her to go home and offered to help her with her luggage. We came down Water Lane and some people said that she was a married woman with four children who wanted to leave her husband. I thought she looked ashamed and was going home. She made no complaint to anyone about having lost her money. There was no mark on her face. I spoke to her in English and she understood me. She made no complaint of the pri<lb/>soner having robbed or struck her. I afterwards heard from the police that she had made a complaint. I live in two rooms and carry on my business outside. (To the Jury.) I heard from some Dutch people in London that this woman was about to leave her husband and children and go off with a man. Thinking that was a very wrong thing for a Jewish woman I tried to persuade her not to do it. In my religion it is "Mitzler" (a very proper thing) to return a wife to her husband. I followed her about to persuade her not to go. I have known the prisoner about six months.</p>

                  </hi>daughter of last witness. About 3.30 p.m. on January 20 I went upstairs to get change. I found the sitting room had been entered. Drawers and boxes broken open.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">NEIL, </hi>Y Division. On January 20, shortly before 4 p.m., I was at 176, Caledonian Road, a small jeweller's shop. While I was in there prisoner came in and said to Robert Wheatley, who was behind the counter, in an undertone, "Is your brother in? " He shook his head and motioned him away. Prisoner then leant over the counter and said, "I have got some stuff for him." Wheatley again motioned him away and shook his head. He was about to leave and I said to him, "Wait a minute; I am a police officer: what have you got about you? " He said, "Nothing." I said, "You have just told this man you have got some stuff; we will see." I searched him and in his jacket pocket I found a handkerchief and a bracelet and four gold rings wrapped up in it. I said to him, "Where did you get these from? " He said at first, "I don't know." I said, "I want some account of them." He said, "My sister gave them to me to sell." I said, "Where does your sister live? " He said, "15, Rising<lb/>hill Street." I said, "We will make inquiry about them: you will be detained." He then said, "It is no use going there; she knows nothing about it. A man up at the "Wolsey' sent me down here to try and sell them." I said, " Your story is not satisfactory; you will be detained." He was taken to the police station. I made inquiries at the "Wolsey, " but could not find any such man as he described. He was charged with unlawful possession. Next morning the property was identified and he was charged with housebreaking.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner gave three descriptions of the man, but the only definite description was that he had on a trilby hat. He did not tell me he was a man he knew who lived in Essex Road. He said</p>

               <p>his sister lived at 15, Risinghill Street, but later, when I said, "You live at 15, Risinghill Street, " he said "Yes."</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">GEROGE WESTON, </hi>G Division. On January 20, about 6 p.m., I went to 9, Risinghill Street. I examined the premises. The drawing room door had been forced by a jemmy, two jewel cases had been forced open by a blunt instrument, drawers turned upside down and the place in great disorder.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I got the things off a man outside the "Wolsey" at the bottom of White Lion Street. I was going to sell them for him. I know him by the name of Harry. I do not know his surname. I went into the jeweller's shop to ask the value of the property I had to sell for this man. At first he said he wanted ready money quick. I said, "Why not pawn them? " He said he would rather sell. I said if he would give me a few shillings I would endeavour to sell them. I go straight to the shop. I am hardly in the shop, I am speaking to the man over the counter, when Inspector Nile says, " Detain that man and search him, " but as regards any remark about my having stuff I made no such remark at all. I had hardly time to speak to him. I knew Detective Neil and I knew the other officer. If I had any idea the jewellery was come by burglary I should not have gone in the shop. They were both there when I entered. I told Inspector Niel I got them from my sister. I gave him my right address. I afterwards told him I got them from a man, that was in the excitement. I was hustled all of a sudden and I hardly knew what to say. It is the truth that I got them from this man. I did not know they were stolen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was not outside 9, Risinghill Street about 3 o'clock that afternoon. I did not see prosecutor come out. The man who asked me to sell the things is about 5 ft. 8, wears a trilby hat and a dark suit, a collar and tie. I have known him casually for two or three years. He said the property was his own. He did not say I could get more for it than he could.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">OSCAR</hi>J. <hi rend="smallCaps">KLEIN.</hi>In 1906 I was carrying on business as Charles Buch and Company at 6, Mincing Lane. A transaction was intro<lb/>duced to me with reference to a contract between a man named Wool<lb/>ford and B. Holt and Company. I was to pay B. Holt and Company 75 per cent, of the value of a shipment of antimony which was coming from Seville. The amount of that was ₤ 7, 200. The price of anti<lb/>mony was advancing rapidly at this time. I made inquiries through the manager of my bank as to B. Holt and Company. I got a very favourable report from him, but he made a mistake, as his report had reference to a highly respectable firm in Coleman Street, E. Holt and Company. Towards the end of November I heard the documents had arrived. I sent a representative to offer a cheque for ₤ 7, 200 in exchange for the documents, but a commission agent had sold that cargo at an enhanced price, and I could not get the documents. I consulted my solicitor, and after an interview with B. Holt and Company, I got an injunction to restrain them from parting with the documents. At the interview at Coleman Street with my solicitor and B. Holt I saw a man named Walters, who was afterwards tried in Paris and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. Prisoner spoke in French. He said the consignment was sold, but if I would be in a generous mood and not press further this injunction he would be willing to let me have a second cargo of antimony which was being loaded in Spain on exactly the same conditions. I more or less ac<lb/>cepted. He said he was often abroad, especially in Paris, and might be away for any length of time; in the meantime Walters, who was his accredited agent and manager, would do all necessary things instead of him. I have no doubt prisoner is the man I knew as Holt. I went abroad, and the mattere was transacted in my absence by one of my staff. On my return the matter was placed in the hands of the police.</p>
               <p>(The cross-examination was directed to the question of identity, but, as will be seen later, the prisoner admitted that he had some connection with the office of B. Holt and Company.)</p>

                  </hi> In 1906 I was manager of the Mincing Lane branch of the London and Westminster Bank. Buch and Company were customers. In consequence of instructions from Buch and Company I marked a cheque on our branch for ₤ 7, 200. On December 7 a representative from Messrs. Buch and another man came to our bank. The other man brought come documents. These are the documents. I was asked to change the cheque into cash. I knew the transaction was between Buch and Company and Holt and Company. I was assured by Messrs. Buch's representative that the documents were in order. I understood the other man's name was Walters. I gave him ₤ 3, 800 in notes and a cheque for ₤ 3, 400. After they were gone I looked at the documents and noticed one of the conditions of the bill of lading was that it was issued in triplicate, and that if one of them was executed the other two were null and void. I thereupon communicated with Messrs. Buch and tried to stop the cheque, but was too late.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The only persons I saw in the matter were Wal<lb/>ters and Buch and Company's representative.</p>

                  </hi>printer and engraver, 77, Fleet Street. On December 7 I called at Palmerston Buildings, where the office of Cahen and Company was. There I happend to meet a gentleman from Buch and Company, to whom I made known my object in being there, which was to obtain payment for printing bills of lading and insurance policies in Spanish. I had also made a steel die bearing the name of the Compania Generale Sevilla Navigacion. The man who ordered these things for Holt and Company and Cahen and Company I saw tried in Paris. His name I heard was Labar.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I was in this coun<lb/>try in 1906. I was not a partner, and took no part in the business of B. Holt and Company. I used to go to their office frequently. I saw there Grant Seymour, Walters, who was called Labar, and Holt. I knew a Mr. Klein, not the one who gave evidence here. I lent B. Holt and Company 27, 000 francs. Holt wanted me to believe that he was in a position to supply Klein with antimony. I did not open a banking account in the name of Cahen and Company. I did not know it was being opened. I was a chemist in my country. I left my country on the death of my wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am of Italian origin, born in Brazil. In 1906 I was living at 20, Frith Street, Soho. I went there when I arrived in April or March, and left there in the summer, I believe. I went with the same landlord to a street near by, Church Street. In December I went to Italy. On the, way I stopped at Calais, Boulogne, and Paris. I left London because I had lost enough money, and as I did not know the language I might have lost more. My family live in Florence. I remained there till September, 1907. I knew Walters in France. He advised me to come to London. He said he was a partner in the firm of Cahen and Company, but at that time the firm was not at Palmerston Buildings; I believe they were at Ludgate Hill. His name was Walters John Lebar. I was not confronted with Walters by the French police. I did not say I did not know him. I began to go to B. Holt and Company's about September. I could not say how many times I went, as I was often away. I never went before 11 o'clock, and left about 4 or 5 p.m. I kept my correspon<lb/>dence there, and received letters in the name of Ernest Levi. I have never lived at Leighton Gardens, Kensal Rise. I had a friend who lives at Kensal Rise. I went there often. When interrogated in France I said, "I can only persist in the declaration I have already made that I have never had offices in London, and that I do not know is any way the divers persons who pretend to recognise me in the photo<lb/>graph that has been shown to them, and Labar, alias Walters, is com<lb/>pletely unknown." I am not quite sure that I said, "Labar, alias Walters, is completely unknown."</p>

                  </hi>Superintendent Rosebery Avenue Fire Station. On August, 1908, when I was stationed at Whitechapel, I was called to a fire at 44, Middlesex Street, which is about 700 yards away from the fire station; I arrived three or four minutes after the call. I found a small fire, which had been partly extinguished with pails of water and was just smouldering. Some books were injured. On December. 14, 1909, I made a careful examination of certain books. I have been 26 years in the Fire Brigade and have had considerable ex<lb/>perience of the damage caused by fire. Bought day book produced has been injured by fire. In my opinion, the injuries were not caused by the fire I was called to at 44, Middlesex Street, as it is burnt at several parts with intervening portions untouched and unscorched. I am speaking having regard to that particular fire, which was very small. Cash book produced has the covers burnt off and the same remarks apply to it. I have the same opinion with regard to the bought ledger and the sold ledger produced— that the injuries could not have been caused by the fire I saw. Some papers and shavings had been burnt; the match lining and the under side of a shelf had been scorched. I do not recognise these books as the books I saw on August 8, 1908— there were some books there, but to what extent they were damaged I could not say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I gave my evidence at the Police Court on Decem<lb/>ber 17 and 21, 1909, having examined the books three days before. It is just possible that one or two of these books might have been damaged</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080067"/>
               <p>by this fire in the way they are. I believe the fire was caused by the breakage of the rubber tube of a portable gas stove. I was in the house about three or four minutes. If I had thought the fire had been intentionally caused I should have made a report to the police. I made no such report in this case.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Had I examined the books at that time in detail I should have reported it to the police. I cannot say how many books there were there. On December 17 I arrived at the Police Court in the middle of the day and had not finished my evidence when the Court rose at five o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>of Wrensted, Hind, and Roberts, 63, Queen Victoria Street, solicitors. On July 1, 1906, Asher Richman was introduced to me by a client named Metz and consulted me with regard to the completion of the sale of the stock and business of 160, Commercial Road, by the prisoner, who is Asher's cousin, which was carried out on the next day at my office, Metz, Asher Richman, and the prisoner being present. I was told the purchase price of the stock had been agreed at ₤ 375, less 10 per cent., and the fixtures at ₤ 65. The total was finally fixed at ₤ 421 8s., and ₤ 2 2s. costs, which was paid to me in cash by Asher Richman; the money was paid into my account at Parr's Bank and I gave my firm's cheque (produced) to the prisoner for ₤ 421 8s., which has been endorsed and paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had known Metz for some years. Asher Rich<lb/>man was to be my client. Prisoner objected to give 10 per cent, reduction and, after a discussion, the amount fixed on was 5 per cent. It was an ordinary transaction, such as would be settled in a solicitor's office. (To the Judge.) My duties were merely formal. I was origi<lb/>nally asked whether a deed would be necessary. I advised that there should be a schedule prepared, which was not done in my office. A receipt was given.</p>

I have known prisoner since July, 1907, as a boot and shoe factor at 44, Middlesex Street and the owner of several retail boot shops. In June, 1908, I supplied him for Hawkins with goods to the value of ₤ 64 9s. 6d.; in July, ₤ 204 17s. 6d.; in August, ₤ 106 10s. The orders were given verbally in April, May,, and June, and amount in all to ₤ 405 7s. On August 13 goods value ₤ 136 10s. were dispatched in three cases from Northampton. In June, July, and August I did not know that the prisoner was selling his retail shops.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir objected to the last statement as not relevant to any charge on the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodkin said that the prisoner's change of his method of trading within four months of his bankurptcy would affect his credit.</p>

               <p>1908, I went to 44, Middlesex Street and made a careful examination of the stock and found only 13 pairs of our boots. About 315 pairs were supplied on August 13. Twelve or thirteen pairs were found of old stock supplied previously to June, 1908.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were three floors to examine. I was on the premises two or three hours. I could not carefully examine 26, 000 pairs of boots in that time. I went to find goods of our manufacture. The stock had already been classified for sale purposes and nineteen-twentieths of it did not concern me. My goods were packed in boxes which I should readily recognise, having the trade mark of Hawkins. I did not go to 111, Commercial Road.</p>

                  </hi>of T. Roberts and Son, Portland Shoe Works, Leicester. Prisoner has been a customer of my firm for about two years. I knew him as a boot factor at 44, Middlesex Street, and as the owner of retail shops. On May 15, 1908, I received a verbal order from prisoner for 500 pairs of boots made to a special pattern, which were delivered on July 1, value ₤ 101 16s. 1d. On August 14 I supplied further goods to the amount of ₤ 63 3s. 1d. I did not know that prisoner had disposed of any of his retail shops; had I known it I would not have supplied the goods. On October 5, 1908, I inspected the stock at 44, Middlesex Street, to ascertain whether any of our goods were still on the premises. I found three of our boxes with other people's shoes in them, but not a single pair of our goods among the stock. My goods were all ladies' boots in boxes having my trade mark and I could readily have recognised them; they were all goods of a new character. None of the goods supplied in July and August have been paid for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Our boxes contain the word "Portland, " which is our registered trade mark. It is not unusual to put the name of the purchaser upon the boxes— it is occasionally done if requested. There were four floors on which goods were. Had I opened all the boxes the goods would have taken a long time to examine. I was there about two hours. I should not expect to find a preponderence of old or unsaleable stock— I should expect to find the recently de<lb/>livered goods. I should have been very suspicious if I had known the prisoner was selling goods by auction.</p>

I said, "Now, which is it? " He ridiculed the idea, went into the office and said that that customer had not had many goods and he would not let him have any more.

I know Asher Richman and after the bankruptcy of prisoner I have sold rubber heels to Asher Richman at 160, Commercial Road. I have called there for orders up to October, 1909. On October 5 I called in reply to a postcard and took an order from the prisoner for rubber heel plates, value 16s. 3d., which was paid by a cheque a few days later. The invoice (produced) is made out to Mrs. T. Rich<lb/>man. I was paid on December 8. When the invoice was first ren<lb/>dered I called at 160, Commercial Road, saw a girl, and asked for Mr. Richman, when prisoner came out.

               <p>His arrear amounted to 6s. 6d., which was deducted from a divisional sum of 42s., payable to him on March 7.</p>

                  </hi>8, Railway Approach, London Bridge, clerk to F. W. Allen, trustee in prisoner's bankruptcy. On August 20, 1908, at 9 a.m., I went to 44, Middlesex Street, to make an inventory of the stock. I was assisted by the prisoner and his warehouseman, Zetta, The stocktaking took two days. On August 24 I took stock at 111, Commercial Road. There were 27, 484 pairs of boots at both placet; 791 of these were at 111, Commercial Road, which were on Septem<lb/>ber 2 removed to 44, Middlesex Street. We then found they amounted to 820 pairs. On September 5 I again went to 44, Middle<lb/>sex Street, to prepare an inventory of the stock for sale by private tender. I was assisted by Zetta, a workman of the prisoner, and completed the inventory on September 26, putting the stock in order and lotting it for sale by private tender. I then found the number of pairs on the premises to be 25, 680, being 1, 804 pairs less than on the previous occasion. On October 8 I had occasion to go to 160, Commercial Road, where I found the name was "T. Richman." The "T." appeared to have been freshly painted in. Prisoner was in the shop examining a boot, which he held in his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. At 44, Middlesex Street, there were four floors and a basement, stock being on all. I began taking my inventory on August 20, on instructions from Mr. Allen, who had not then been appointed trustee. The Official Receiver was appointed on August 21. I began on the first floor. Business had been stopped. No goods arrived on August 20 or 21. Prisoner and Zetta gave me the prices and called out the quantities. I worked until 7 p.m., doing the ground floor, first floor, and part of the second floor on that day. On August 21 I continued working until about 6 p.m., when I had com<lb/>pleted my catalogue. The Official Receiver took possession on that day at between three and four p.m. The prisoner and Zetta assisted me. The goods were not taken down, but the quantities were read off the boxes. I examined several of the boxes myself to see if they were full— I would not swear I examined every box. Prisoner gave me the prices from memory. 1, 804 pairs of boots and shoes would require 20 cases to pack them in of about 4 ft. square by 3 ft. high. When I went on the morning of August 21 I saw no sign of any stock having been moved.</p>

                  </hi>11, Aveling Terrace, Walthamstow, accountant to Plateaux and Co., Tottenham, boot manufacturers. I have known prisoner four or five years as a customer to my firm and at his request early in January, 1908, I took stock at 44, Middlesex Street, and drew up a balance-sheet showing the state of his affairs on January 1, 1908 (produced), showing an excess of assets over liabili<lb/>ties ₤ 5, 639 12s. 1d. Under "assets" is stock in hand, ₤ 9, 311 2s. 7d., that being the stock taken by me, assisted by Gunnis and Faulkner (two employes of Flateaux and Co.), the prisoner and two of his lads. The stock was taken down by me in book produced, in which the numbers and abbreviated description of the stock is given. The prices were given by the prisoner. To the best of my recollection prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080072"/>
               <p>stated he had no other liabilities than those mentioned in the balance<lb/>sheet— trade creditors, ₤ 2, 471 14s. 4d.; bills payable, ₤ 3, 482 8s. 5d.— which I got from the ledger and bill book. No other liabilities were given to me. In February, 1908, I saw prisoner— he wanted a loan from my firm of ₤ 250 for the purpose of opening a shop at 160, Com<lb/>mercial Road. I asked him, "Is your position substantially the same as when I took stock and made the balance-sheet at the beginning of the year? " He said it was. I asked him if he owed any money privately outside the balance-sheet. He said "No." The loan of ₤ 250 was made by my firm. It has not been repaid and there is now a balance due for that and goods supplied of ₤ 513 19s. 6d., for which my firm have proved in the bankruptcy. In June, 1908, I took stock at 77, Wentworth Street, assisted by Harris Napper, the prisoner, and two or three lads, for the purpose of the sale of the shop to Napper. I knew Napper as prisoner's brother-in-law and as a man who had a stall in the street, where he sold boots, and a front room converted into a shop in Goulston Street. Prisoner and I both expressed sur<lb/>prise that Napper was able to buy the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My firm have done business with prisoner for five or six years. About 1905 I became acquainted with prisoner, when his account assumed large proportions; it was about ₤ 500 or ₤ 600 then. In January, 1905, I took stock at 44, Middlesex Street, in the same way as in January, 1908, and did the same in January, 1906, and January, 1907, and also drew a balance-sheet. Prisoner's account decreased one year because our goods did not suit the prisoner's trade— not because we desired to close the account. The balance-sheet related entirely to prisoner's business. I will not swear that previous to January, 1908, I asked prisoner if he had private liabilities. I believe I took stock in the first 10 days of January, 1908— I cannot swear to the date. Ordinarily goods would be sent from Middlesex Street to the retail shops and if there were any returns they would come to Middlesex Street. The books may not have been written up to December, 1907, when I took the balance-sheet. If items of liability were not entered they would be missing from my balance<lb/>sheet. I took the balance-sheet at the request of the prisoner, who was an old friend of mine. I was paid by him on every occasion. Goods would be paid for by cheque or cash or by bills. After the loan prisoner paid back my firm enough to bring the account down to its normal amount. I knew prisoner had bills coming due. The amount of the loan was paid into the bank and would appear among his trade liabilities. Prisoner is unable to read, except perhaps the amount of his wages books; he can sign his name to a cheque. He is very quick at figures— he is a marvellous man all round. I prepared the detailed invoice for the sale of 77, Wentworth Street. I did not know he was Belling other shops. Prisoner repeatedly told me that he found opening the retail shops had a bad effect upon his wholesale trade and that that was the reason he was selling 77, Wentworth Street. In taking the stock the boxes were counted on the racks or where the boots were loose the numbers were taken. A stock book was kept, but the entries were very roughly made by a young girl. I could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080073"/>
               <p>not say if I included stock delivered after January 1. I took the liabili<lb/>ties which appeared in the books. The books were kept by Cissie Coral, who was about 15 when I first knew her and is now, I think, about 20 years of age. Zetta was assisting on one' of the evenings when I took stock. I did not examine the boxes to check any errors there might be in the numbers put down. The asset in balance-sheet, "Fixtures and fittings at 111, Commercial Road, and 44, Middlesex Street, ₤ 625 0s. 5d., "I got from prisoner— I do not know if it was taken from an old balance-sheet. "Lease and goodwill, 20, Went-worth Street, ₤ 216 3s. 3d., " is included as an asset; I did not know there was a mortgage. Prisoner usually paid large moneys into the bank and frequently paid small amounts by cheque. He always paid me for work done. I wish his character depended on my good word. I have always found him starightforward and upright in his dealings.</p>

I found no empty boxes. Prisoner and some of his assistants were there, and the stocktaking was properly done. Prisoner gave the prices.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was there two evenings. I give the date from memory.</p>

                  </hi>recalled. I am a member of the firm of A. C. Palmer and Company, chartered accountants, Railway Ap-proach, London Bridge. My firm has no connection with the witness. Palmer. On September 7, 1908, I was appointed trustee in prisoner's bankruptcy, certified on September 8. In prisoner's amended statement of affairs his liabilities are stated at ₤ 14, 681 8s. 7d.; assets ₤ 5, 625 14s. 3d.— deficiency ₤ 9, 055 14s. 4d. Balance-sheet of January 1, 1908, shows an excess of assets over liabilities of ₤ 5, 639 12s. 1d.— showing a difference of about ₤ 14, 700. I took the stock-in-trade over from the Official Receiver, who had been in posses<lb/>sion from August 21 up to my appointment, and have realised by a sale by tender the stock which is returned at ₤ 5, 625 14s. 3d., for the amount of ₤ 2, 313 5s. 6d. The goods account filed by prisoner show*s</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080074"/>
               <p>stock in hand on January 1 ₤ 9, 311 2s. 7d., being amount stated in Palmer's balance-sheet on January 1, 1908, less the following deduc<lb/>tions: "Stock taken in error being amount of purchases from Janu<lb/>ary 1 to 18, 1908, ₤ 298 12s. 7d.; Goods taken, not invoiced, which were subsequently returned ₤ 300; Estimated over valuation of stock on account of shorts in boxes and shelves, the contents not having been examined in many instances, ₤ 1, 500; total deduction ₤ 2, 098 12s. 7d., leaving ₤ 7, 212 10s. The ₤ 1, 500 of shortages would represent about 5, 000 or 6, 000 pairs of boots. On the side of the goods account, showing to whom and for what the goods have been disposed of, con<lb/>tains a note, "The above particulars are the only account of sales that can be produced owing to portions of the books being burnt." The Goods Account shows purchases between January 1 and August 14, 1908, ₤ 16, 214 9s. 3d.; added to the amount of goods on January 1 as given by prisoner, ₤ 7, 212 10s., shows a total stock in the eight months ₤ 23, 426 19s. 3d., from which deductions are made of ₤ 567 11s. 10d., leaving ₤ 22, 859 7s. 5d. The deduction consists of goods sent to retail shops and returned ₤ 453 16s. 4d. and ₤ 30 and ₤ 83 15s. 6d. for goods charged by T. Brown and Company on August 18, but stopped in transit. In the Goods Account I find prisoner has accounted for goods sold and to whom sold ₤ 6, 220 19s. 10d.; that includes goods sold by auction and sales to Harris Napper, Asher Richman, and the retail shops. On the next page is January 1 to August 27, Sales of stock through bank ₤ 9, 230 2s. Id. (including the ₤ 6, 220 19s. 10d., of which there is a detailed account); Cash sales not passed through bank, ₤ 4, 544 7s.; making a total of ₤ 13, 774 9s. Id. of cash received for goods sold, and leaving a differ<lb/>ence of ₤ 9, 084 18s. 4d. of goods to be accounted for, for which the following items are given: (1) Damage to stock by water on two occa<lb/>sions, ₤ 800; (2) Stock lost by robberies, ₤ 250; (3) Estimated defici<lb/>ency between cost and sale on realisation of stock by auction, ₤ 2, 796 5s. 1d.; (4) Book debts incurred since January 1, 1908, and due at the date of receiving order, ₤ 521 5s. 1d.; (5) Stock on hand at date of receiving order ₤ 5, 275— making a total of ₤ 9, 652 10s. 2d., and showing that the prisoner is accounting for ₤ 567 11s. 10d. more than he had to account for. The ₤ 2, 798 5s. Id. loss on sales by auction would represent a very large quantity of goods. From the auctioneers I have received an account of sales amounting to only ₤ 573. In the boot trade it is not unusual to dispose of small quantities of old or surplus stock by auction. As against the ₤ 5, 275 stock on hand I took the stock at selling prices at ₤ 4, 545, which would represent about ₤ 4, 000 or ₤ 4, 100 cost, with the usual 10 per cent, profit deducted, or ₤ 1, 100 less than the prisoner's statement. I have ascertained that prisoner has pur<lb/>chased from January to May, 1908, goods to the amount of ₤ 6, 101 4s. 9d., and from June 1 to August 14 ₤ 9, 445— that is, taking the date of invoice, delivery being a day or two later. The total sales in June, July, and August, which are given in detail in the goods account, are ₤ 2, 372 7s. 1d.— being ordinary sales ₤ 1, 011 4s. 4d., auction sales ₤ 535 19s. 9d, sales to Asher Richman ₤ 375 3s., and to Harris Napper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080075"/>
               <p>₤ 450— leaving a balance of goods to be accounted for in June, July, and August of ₤ 7, 173. During June, July, and August the amount paid into bank is ₤ 3, 587 13s. 1d.; cash received as proceeds of sales ₤ 1, 625, making ₤ 5, 213, as against purchases for June, July, and August of ₤ 9, 545, a deficiency of ₤ 4, 331 of goods which is unaccounted for. Then the prisoner shows by his cash account that he paid for goods purchased between January and August in cash ₤ 2, 031. In the cash account I have receipts of cash for goods banked ₤ 9, 230; ditto cash, ₤ 4, 544; making ₤ 13, 774 9s. Id. Expended on goods since January 1, bank ₤ 2, 226 1s. 10d., cash ₤ 105 9s. 6d., making a total of ₤ 2, 331 11s. 4d. paid for goods bought from January to August. Then money paid for goods bought before January, 1908, ₤ 6, 164 18s. 8d. The goods which prisoner, in fact, bought after January 1 come to ₤ 15, 600, on which he has only paid ₤ 2, 331 11s. 4d. Turning to Palmer's balance-sheet of January 1, 1908, there is trade creditors ₤ 2, 471, bills payable ₤ 3, 482— total, ₤ 5, 954, as against ₤ 6, 164, which prisoner, in fact, paid for goods bought before January 1, 1908, a difference of ₤ 210. That strongly confirms the accuracy of Palmer's balance-sheet. There are, then, four items for outlay in fitting up retail shops during 1908 amounting to ₤ 1, 040— that is, irrespective of stock. The amounts shown in Palmer's balance-sheet as expended in opening shops in 1907 is ₤ 841 3s. 6d.; I have admitted a proof of another firm who did work on 160, Commercial Road, of ₤ 169, making a total of ₤ 2, 050 expended upon the shops; for that expendi<lb/>ture all prisoner received on the sales of the shops was ₤ 241 19s. 3d. The cash account further shows paid away in repayment of loans from April to August, 1908, ₤ 896 15s. 8d. I have been unable to find any records of such loans either by entries or documents or corroboration of any kind. The amount paid in repayment of loans to Charkin Marks is ₤ 349 11s. 8d. The amount stated to be paid by Asher Rich-man is ₤ 350 by the 10 ₤ 20, 10 ₤ 10 notes and 10 ₤ 5 notes, which have been traced. The books are in the same condition as when I received them. The sold day book has the pages relating to January, February, March, and April, 1908, entirely burnt away; the rest of the book is decipherable. The bought day book has nearly all the used portion burnt; the unused portion is practically uninjured, the edges being slightly scorched. The cash book is burnt out from October, 1907, to the date of the receiving order where there should be the details amounting to ₤ 4, 544 cash stated to be paid without having gone through the bank and which I am therefore unable to check.. The bought ledger is partially destroyed, but the accounts are readable in parts of the book. In the sold ledger pages 385 to 426 are burnt out, including Harris Napper's account, page 414. Pages 303 to 330 are also burnt. I have received no bill books. Bundle of other books produced has been examined by me; they are only damaged on the outside; they are unimportant books. I have received no information from the prisoner with regard to 1, 804 pairs of boots missing from 44, Middlesex Street, and have been unable to discover any entries regard to them. Goods were delivered by Hawkins, August 13, ₤ 136 10s.; Roberts, August 14, ₤ 63 3s. 1d.; Thomas Brown and Co.,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080076"/>
               <p>August 14, ₤ 107 2s. I can discover no record or information with regard to what has become of them. The last entry of a sale is on August 26, South and Co., auction, ₤ 47 11s. 1d.— those goods must have been delivered to South and Co. before the Official Receiver took possession on August 20. They did not include any of the goods delivered by Hawkins, Roberts, or Brown on August 13 and 14. There is no evidence what goods they were. I tried to get them identified, but could get no information. The auctioneers' list produced gives the number of pairs and the prices at which they were sold. After my clerk, Leighton, had reported to me I communicated with Hawkins, Roberts, and Brown at the end of September, 1908, and they examined the stock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Harris Napper was privately examined with refer<lb/>ence to the transfer of 77, Wentworth Street; I commenced an action to set aside the sale; he put in a defence and I abandoned the action. A similar course was taken in the case of the sale of 160, Com<lb/>mercial Road to Asher Richman— he was privately examined, an action brought against him to set aside the sale as being fraudulent, defence put in by him, and the action abandoned by me; the same with regard to the sale of 20, Wentworth Street. I did not apply in the Court of Bankruptcy for an order to prosecute the prisoner with respect to the burnt books. I applied for an order to prosecute in October or November, 1909, the books having been in my possession since Septem<lb/>ber, 1908. I did not apply for an order to prosecute in respect of the alleged removal of 1, 804 pairs of boots and shoes in August, 1908, or of non-disclosure of what had become of them. I did apply for an order to prosecute in respect of non-disclosure of what had become of the goods of Hawkins, Roberts, and Brown. The order was made in respect of offences under section 11, sub-section 1. It was a general order for non-disclosure, but it did not specifically include the 1, 804 pairs. I received about 40 books altogether. A day book was kept showing sales on credit. Cash sales were entered in a rough sale book, of which there are several in Court, and from which the day's takings were entered in a lump sum in the cash book. Amounts received from customers where credit was given appear to be entered separately and the goods sold for cash are added. The cash sales were not entered in the day book. I have not got the rough sales book relating to 1908. All the entries in the cash book should be found in other books and if they were here the burnt portion of the cash book could be written up. I have checked all the payments which went through the bank account and have found them correct. I have not received the expen<lb/>diture book. I have the bought day book and the pass book. There may be an expenditure book and a duplicate invoice book of goods sold. From those books the cash account could be made up. The sold ledger could be reconstructed from the sold day book and the invoice book. The sold day book is partially destroyed, some of the invoices are in existence, but not all. Harris Napper produced in his examina-tion monthly statements of goods supplied to him from which, if accu<lb/>rate, his account in the sold ledger could be made up. The bought day book would contain the invoices sent in by the creditors and the portion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080077"/>
               <p>burnt could be made up by obtaining copy invoices from them. The prisoner was given the assistance of an accountant by the Court to prepare the accounts which had been produced. Prisoner stated to me that he owed money for loans. One was of ₤ 100 from the Prudential Assurance Company on his life policy. I found that correct. I do not think it is entered in the books. It was a private loan. Prisoner gave me the names of the lenders of the other loans, which are set out in his statement; I have not made inquiries of those persons. So far as I know, he had only one banking account. With regard to the item of cash which did not go through the bank I have no materials from which I can verify or negative it. I have not made inquiry as to whether prisoner's account of the damage by water is true or false. I find his account of book debts practically correct and the stock in hand taken at the selling price is also practically correct. I cannot say whether the sales of Hawkins,, Brown's, and Roberts, goods are included in the cash item, ₤ 4, 544 7s., except that there are no pay<lb/>ments shown in the account at that date amounting to anything like the value of their goods. The items ₤ 625 for fixtures, fittings, etc., may include structural alterations, which the landlord would get the benefit of on bankruptcy. I cannot tell you if the ₤ 169 is for building a wall which the landlord would get the benefit of, as also any struc<lb/>tural alterations included in the ₤ 1, 040. The movable fittings could be taken out. I made no inquiries of Charkin Marks with regard to the loans or their repayment. There is an index to the burnt ledgers; all accounts I have referred to I found in the index and I could tell whose accounts had been destroyed. Napper produced his invoices in his private examination. I received rough sale books containing goods sold on credit and including sales to Napper. The 1, 804 pairs of boots are included in the first stock list made by Leigh ton. I have not been able to trace the removal of any of them and the charge rests solely upon the difference between the first and second stock list. I have traced none of the goods delivered by Hawkins, Roberts, or Brown. The Official Receiver was in possession from August 21 to Septem<lb/>ber 10. The sales by auction of which I have South and Co. 's account amounted to ₤ 573 0s. 10d. between May, 1908, and the receiving order.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. From January to May, 1908, the sales by South and Co. amounted to ₤ 240. I discontinued the actions against Harris Napper and Asher Richman because the committee of inspection came to the conclusion that, if successful, nothing could be recovered from then,. We did not have Charkin Marks and other suggested lenders examined because it would have cost a lot of money. There is nothing to indicate whether the goods damaged by water are included in the losses on the sales by auction.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muir submitted that on counts 1 to 6, referring to the transfers to Harris Rapper and Asher Richman, under section 13, sub-section 2, of the Debtors' Act, 1869, there was no case for the Jury (Arch bold, p. 1, 150; Be Cranston expte. Craneton, 9 Morell's Bankruptcy Reports, p. 160, 8 "Times" L.R., p. 504). There was no evidence fit to be left to the Jury on counts 13, 14, 15, and 16, charging removal or concealment with intent to defraud creditors of 1, 804 pairs of boots and shoes, there being no sufficient evidence that the goods were on the premises or that they had been removed by the prisoner (Archbold, p. 1, 135).</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080078"/>
               <p>With regard to counts 7 to 12, relating to the destruction and mutilation of boob there was no evidence against the prisoner (assuming the books to have been intentionally injured); further, there was no sufficient evidence that the books had been injured other than by an accidental fire. On counts 17. 18, and 19 relating to the goods received from Hawkins, Roberts, and Brown and Co., there was no evidence to show that the goods had been disposed of other than in the ordinary way of the prisoner's trade.</p>
               <p>After argument,</p>
               <p>The Recorder held that on counts 13 to 16 the evidence amounted to great suspicion, but suspicion only; there was not specific evidence on the subject matter for the Jury to act upon, and those counts would be withdrawn. On the other counts he held there was evidence for the Jury.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I came to England 20 years ago and started selling boots from a barrow; three or four years after<lb/>wards I took a room at 110, Goulston Street as a store, selling from my barrow outside. About seven years ago I opened a shop at 20, Wentworth Street, continued it for a short time and left, retaining the lease up to August, 1908. About five or six years ago I started a wholesale warehouse at 44, Middlesex Street and reopened the retail shop at 20, Wentworth Street, at the same time giving up the room at Goulston Street; I retained those two premises until 1907. During 1907 I had a very bad year, losing over ₤ 1, 000 by bad debts and bad trade in the wholesale. I then opened retail shops at 77, Wentworth Street, 111, Commercial Road, and 160, Commercial Road. I cannot read or write, beyond signing my name. I superintend the businesses with the assistance of young lads of 15 and 16. Cissie Coral has been my clerk for the past four or five years; she came to me at 14 years of age on leaving school; she has kept my books, written letters, etc. Palmer was engaged by me to check the accounts and take stock; I paid him ₤ 10 a year for checking and ₤ 5 for the annual stocktaking. 160, Commercial Road was not opened till March, 1908. In 1908 I could not get my debts in and I could do no business because I would not trust. Wholesale business got very bad; people said, "You open shops round in the neighbourhood— why should we buy of you? " and they would not come in to buy. In August I found I could not carry on business and consulted my solicitor, and on his advice sent out notices to my creditors and to my bank to retain my balance of ₤ 114 for the creditors. I paid Mr. Allen a fee of ₤ 20 to take stock at 44, Middlesex Street, which he did on August 20. On August 21 a peti<lb/>tion was presented and a receiving order made. In June, 1908, I sold 77, Wentworth Street to my wife's brother, Harris Napper. I sent for Palmer and told him it was ruination to me to keep on the retail shops. Palmer advised me to sell them. I went to see Napper; he came to 77, Wentworth Street and we came to terms— he to take the stock there at cost price and the shelves at ₤ 8; but the more expensive fixtures were of no use to him and I removed them. Palmer took the stock, which amounted to ₤ 379. Napper paid me ₤ 102 by a cheque dated June 11 for ₤ 75 and a bill dated June 2 for ₤ 27 and gave me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080079"/>
               <p>bills for the balance. At that time Napper was dealing with me for boots, paying up at the end of the month. He paid also on June 11 ₤ 30, June 15 ₤ 25 by cheque, June 18 ₤ 40, 22nd ₤ 45, 25th ₤ 10, 29th ₤ 40. Those amounts were paid into the bank. Cissie. Coral, who kept the books, will give you a better explanation than I can. I arranged with the landlord to transfer the agreement to Napper. Some time in June I offered to sell 160, Commercial Road to a party who was willing to buy the goods at 30 per cent, less than cost without taking over the lease. I thought I had better close the shop and take the goods into the warehouse, but in the meantime I learnt that my cousin Asher was looking for a shop. Towards the end of July I sold the lease to Eleazar Napper, brother of Harris, for ₤ 150, of which Langley, his solicitor, gave me a cheque, on which there was some expense, and it appears in my bank book as ₤ 148 19s. 3d. I then sold the stock and fixtures, to Asher Richman for ₤ 356 8s. and ₤ 65. He asked me for time to get the money and the sale was completed by Mr. Hind, who gave me his firm's cheque, as he has stated, on July 2 for ₤ 421 8s. The other two shops, 20, Wentworth Street and 111, Commercial Road, were advertised for sale in the "Daily Chronicle" on the advice of Mr. Craig, the secretary of the Boot Trade Protection Society. We had no reply. I offered the shop to Harris Napper, who proposed to sell 77, Wentworth Street and buy No. 20. In the middle of August he purchased it for ₤ 390 for the stock and ₤ 20 for the fixtures, giving me a cheque for ₤ 410, which went into my bank. Palmer took the stock. I do not know where Harris Napper got the money. A few weeks after my bankruptcy I moved from 160, Commercial Road, where I was living in rooms over the shop, to Westcliff. In October my wife learn that Napper was giving up 20, Wentworth Street, and some of my creditors, on security giveta by her relatives, advanced stock for her to open the shop; she became a weekly tenant at 32s. a week and I afterwards assisted her as manager. She previously had a shop at 215, Whitechapel Road, which she had given up. She afterwards took 160, Commercial Road. Charkin Marks came down to Westcliff and asked her if she could buy it. My wife offered to find ₤ 100 and give bills, which were endorsed by friends of hers. He accepted that and about the end of August or beginning of September, 1909, she took it over. Other people were living in the rooms. They moved out and we went to live there in November, 1909. In the second or third week in January, 1908, Palmer made out the balance-sheet of 44, Middlesex Street. I have made certain deductions from that balance-sheet which are correct to the best of my recollection. On, two occasions in June and July, 1908, water pipes burst at 44, Middle<lb/>sex Street and damaged a lot of boots and shoes— there was a lot of expensive coloured shoes which were spoilt and were sold for a very low price. I estimate the loss by that at ₤ 800. Hawkins', Brown's, and Roberts's goods were delivered as has been stated. They were all specially ordered for customers and were sold for cash immediately they were received. The amounts were all entered in the cash accounts and I handed some of the money to the trustee. On August 7 I was up in the top floor when I heard screaming, came down stairs and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080080"/>
               <p>found the office on fire. Some carpenters had been making a window case and putting up a shelf for the books; a pipe of the gas stove had broken, it had caught light and the office was full of flame and smoke. Men were repairing the road outside. They came in and put the fire out with pails of water. The books were injured by the fire. I told Cissie Coral and Zetta to ascertain the amounts of the book debts where the accounts had been burnt. The books were put into the safe, which was locked and the key taken charge of by Coral, who the next day went to Margate for her holidays, taking the only key with her and returning on August 18 or 19. On the 19th the books were handed over to Mr. Allen— his clerk, Leighton, came on August 21 to take the stock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I filed a cash account in my bankruptcy showing receipt of ₤ 9, 230, which went into the bank, and ₤ 4, 544 which did not. It was the system in my business to pay cash out of the takings for goods purchased. We had receipts for all cash payments, which were delivered over to Mr. Allen. I left it to Palmer to check these things and paid him ₤ 10 a year for doing so— unfortunately he did not do the work. I cannot say whether he saw the receipts. In my cash account I state repayments of loans amounting to ₤ 896; I cannot say if there are any entries in my books relating to the loans. I cannot remember how much I borrowed from Marks. I wanted the loans for business purposes in the latter part of 1907— from August to December. Charkin Marks lent me ₤ 450 and had acceptances at about six months. Part of these are in the bank pass-book. They were paid back about Easter, 1908. Coral used to take the money to him and get back the bills. The bills were put among my papers with my ordi<lb/>nary trade bills— they were left in the warehouse when Mr. Allen took possession. Some of the payments appear in my pass<lb/>book. I do not know if they were entered in the bill book. There was a bill book. Other loans were made to me by Koski and Shapiro on bills. There was a loan from Keighley of ₤ 57 4s. I did not tell Palmer that I had no liabilities outside my business. He was aware I had a loan. He assisted me to get a loan of ₤ 200 from a society. If he said he did not know about the loans he was not speaking the truth. Palmer knew that Magnus had advanced me ₤ 200; he knew I had loans from Koski, Shapiro, and from Marks— I told him about them personally. Palmer absolutely ruined me. I put all my confidence in him. He said what he did to get out of it because he would be blamed by his firm, from whom he got me ₤ 200, which I put into the bank in February. Palmer knew I had other liabilities. I know the liabilities to Charkin Marks are not included in the balance-sheet. I did not make the balance-sheet and did not understand it. I got the par<lb/>ticulars of the loans stated in my cash account from Marks. There are entries of them in the pass-books. I told Palmer that I had had a very bad year in 1907; I must have lost a nice lot of money. He tapped me on the shoulder and said, "Do not worry— everything is all right." I did not know my other liabilities were not included. I cannot say whether Palmer showed the balance-sheet to Flateaux and Co. before they lent me the ₤ 200. I do not know that Palmer showed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080081"/>
               <p>in the profit and loss account for 1907 a gross profit of ₤ 1, 779— he did not tell me so. I had more likely lost ₤ 1, 779. He did not tell me there was a net profit of ₤ 314 10s. 11d. I lost money in 1907 by bad debts and by having such a terribly bad year. I cannot suggest any reason why Palmer should draw up a false balance-sheet— I only tell you what happened. Eleazar Napper, to whom I sold the lease of 160, Commercial Road, is my brother-in-law; he is a schoolmaster and secretary to several societies, his age is 25; he married about August, 1909, the lady he was engaged to when I sold him the lease. I offered it to him at ₤ 150 and he accepted it after a day or two's consideration. I do not know here he got the money He earns about ₤ 5 a week. He is not here. Asher Richman is a general dealer and a wholesale stick manufacturer; he has been 17 years at 8a, Crispin Street; he used to buy about ₤ 6 worth of boots a week from me regularly. I do not know where he got the ₤ 400 to buy the business from me. I do not know whether he borrowed the money from Charkin Marks or not. Marks is a tobacconist and money<lb/>lender; he is the father-in-law of my cousin, Asher Richman. Harris Napper had the same stall in the street that I had had; he was a man to make money as good as I was. I knew he did not want to pay the money for the business at once. I did not tell Palmer I was sur<lb/>prised he had the money. I sold the shop to him because I wanted to get the trade, and as I had dealt with him for five or six yean. I had put down ₤ 1, 500 as overstatement of stock in Palmer's balance<lb/>sheet of January, 1908; that is an estimate; when I failed and found such a big loss I asked my people and tried to account for it. I also esti<lb/>mate to have lost ₤ 800 through damage by the water pipes bursting; and ₤ 250 from losses by robbery during eight months; customers were frequently found to have stolen boots. I have estimated a loss of ₤ 2, 798 on sales of old stock by auction and in job lots in the ware<lb/>house and from the shops. I had old stock that had been there for years, and sold it at a loss of from 30 per cent, to 70 per cent. In June, July, and August, 1908, I may have received ₤ 9, 545 worth of goods. During 1907 I had a bad year, but had ordered large quanti<lb/>ties of goods which the manufacturers were pressing me to take de<lb/>livery of, some charging me interest for holding it over and insisting on sending it in; it had been ordered from three to ten months before. As I had to take it I sold off large quantities of the old stock. I told Morris I should lose 10 per cent, by taking his goods, and offered him that to let me off. He said it was too late to sell the stock elsewhere. I may have had goods delivered from January to August, 1908, to the amount of ₤ 15, 730, of which I only paid ₤ 2, 331; I paid ₤ 6, 160" for goods delivered before January, 1908. When I sold goods received from one man I paid another. The goods I received from Hawkins, Roberts, and Brown were a regular line, of which most were sold wholesale immediately they came in for ready cash, and therefore are not shown in the goods account. My people will give you a better ex<lb/>planation how the goods came in and went out. They came in after the books had been burnt. I do not know if there is any sort of account to whom those goods were sold; I never interfered with the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080082"/>
               <p>sale. I should say of the ₤ 306 worth of boots received on August 12 to 14 we sold over ₤ 200— my people will be able to give an explana<lb/>tion. I have many customers who would buy 200 pairs of boots or 500, and pay cash; most would pay in coin or bank notes. I hate given an account of what became of the money. I gave ₤ 12 10s. back to the Official Receiver on August 26. Boots priced at, say, 8s. 4d. or 9s. 3d. I should probably sell at the same price, my profit being the trade discount of 6ƈ, 7½, or 12 per cent. The money is in<lb/>cluded in the ₤ 4, 544 shown as cash receipts in my statement; I had three weeks' living; ₤ 50 I kept for myself when I saw the bankruptcy was coming, of which I gave an account to the Official Receiver. There would probably be 50 or 60 pairs left which were in the warehouse. You will find my explanation in my examination. I paid wages up to August 27. I got ₤ 3 damages from the fire; I claimed ₤ 6. I can only give you the explanation that the carpenter gave to the firemen as to how the fire arose. Most of the books were on the shelf which the fireman broke down as he tried to take the books off. More boob were burnt than are here. All the damage to the books has been done by that fire.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. With regard to payments, if we had cash we paid in cash; if not, I used to give a cheque or bills. Cheques were sent to country people. I used to bank money in hand. On many occasions I had no receipts. I first borrowed money from Charkin Marks in the latter part of 1907. It was at first repaid by cheques or bills. On one occasion a bill came back; Charkin was annoyed, and I afterwards paid in cash. My cheques were always met. When I gave up the retail shops I required more stock, because the wholesale is always a bigger trade than the retail. I generally had three to six month's credit; sometimes the bill was renewed. In 1908 the 1907 bills were falling due, and I was paying right up to August, 1908, for foods delivered in 1907. You will find the amounts in the pass-book. I was paying Flateaux in August, 1908, for goods received in 1907. No one had access to the books after August 7 until I called in Mr. Allen; they were locked, and Coral had the key.</p>

                  </hi>94, Rothschild Buildings, Commercial Street. I was formerly clerk to the prisoner, and am now in the employ of his wife. While employed by prisoner I kept the books entirely; pri<lb/>soner never examined them or knew what was in them; he cannot read or write; he never interfered with the books. On August 7 when the fire occurred I had gone home for dinner and returned about 3.30 p.m. I could not get into the office on account of the smoke. When I got in prisoner told me to look through the books and get the particulars out as well as I could. Looking at the books produced they are in the same condition now as when I saw them on August 7. The particulars I could not get from those books I got from the invoice books and from the bills sent in. Zetta, the warehouseman, assisted me. The warehouse was not opened on Saturdays. On</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080083"/>
               <p>Friday night, August 7, after we had taken the particulars, Zetta put the books in the safe, which was locked, and I kept the only key there was. I left the next morning for my holidays at Margate and took the key with me, returning on the 18th or 19th, when prisoner told me not to proceed with any work as Mr. Allen's clerks came in to check the books; the books were then handed over. There was an invoice book, which contained a carbon duplicate of the invoices sent out containing the customer's name and the number and particulars of the goods. The invoice books were kept in a desk in the ware<lb/>house. They were there when the trustee took possession. Returns were made from the retail shops which were not entered— the boys generally put the goods into stock without telling me. Sales at 44, Middlesex Street were mostly for cash, the customers paying on taking the goods. Many bills for goods received would be paid by cash by me from the till; others by cheques. The wages were paid from the takings by me. I heard of the delivery of goods from Hawkins, Brown, and Roberts, and that they had been sold to customers; the sales are in the invoice book with the date, quantity, and names of customers. Mid-August was our busiest time because the Jewish holiday is in September and a large quantity of goods are bought at that time. Prisoner had loans of which I had all the particulars and which were entered in the "loan book, ' a narrow, long book— they were paid in cash and the money was paid into the bank. A bill was given, which was entered in the Bill book; that was left in the ware<lb/>house. There were loans from Tennebaum, Tobias, Barnet, Adler, Koski, and Charkin Marks. I have paid money to those persons in respect of loans. I remember in June and July, 1906, the water pipes bursting; the goods were damaged and were sold to various people for cash in job lots at very low prices. On a good many occasions we had boots stolen, some by customers. About August 12, while at Margate, I wrote letters to several creditors asking for a statement of their accounts and of the bills, owing to our accounts being destroyed by the fire. I kept an expenditure book— it was a long narrow book; in it were recorded payments to workpeople and others. Napper's account in the ledger was burnt. He had a monthly account showing goods supplied and payments made. Accounts with Napper are produced to me from May 1 to August 10. They are in my writing. They show goods supplied in May ₤ 122, less discount ₤ 111, and showing that the whole of that paid; then there is a cheque, June 8, ₤ 30; June 11, cheque ₤ 75— the receipts are in my handwriting; June 15, ₤ 25; June 18, ₤ 40; June 22, ₤ 45; June 24, by return, ₤ 49; June 25, cheque ₤ 10; June 29, cheque ₤ 40. All those cheques went into the bank. There is a summary of goods supplied to Napper during the month ₤ 73 net; goods supplied in the sale of the shop ₤ 379; there is a credit by returns, and ₤ 404 10s. is shown to be due from Napper on June 30. Then a sum<lb/>mary of the cheques I have mentioned is credited and a balance of ₤ 112 is carried forward. On July 1 there is a bill for ₤ 30 receipted by me; July 13, cheque ₤ 45; July 20, cheque ₤ 50; July 28, cheque ₤ 45— all receipted by me; then a summary on July 31 of goods sup<lb/>

               <p>plied net ₤ 114 with a balance forward ₤ 112, making ₤ 226; cheque ₤ 170; balance forward ₤ 56. The cheques and bill went into the bank. On August 5 there is a credit by returns ₤ 27; August 10 cheque ₤ 25, receipted by the prisoner. There is a cheque of August 12 by Napper for ₤ 410 and a receipt for ₤ 410 for the stock in trade and fixtures of 20, Went worth Street. From those accounts and receipts anyone could make a copy of Napper's account in the burnt ledger; they were all made out by me on the dates they bear. Pri<lb/>soner drew money for his private and household expenses from the cash in the warehouse, which was entered in the expenditure book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am 20 years of age. I went into prisoner's employment at 14 on leaving school. I have kept prisoner's books ever since— I had some instruction in book-keeping at school. We had a set of books. After the receiving order I was out of employment till December, 1908, when I was employed by prisoner's wife at 215, Whitechapel Road, until the end of July, 1909. Since September, 1909, I have been in her employment at 160, Commercial Road. I had nothing to do with 20, Wentworth Street. I always went for my holiday in August. In 1908 I went away on August 7 to Margate and remained 10 or 12 days. I wrote letter (produced) and several others while at Margate, signing "J. Richman— C." On August 10 I received a telegram from prisoner to come to London, and returned that evening. Meantime, prisoner sent me another telegram (pro<lb/>duced) to say that he was coming down, and I returned to Margate the next morning. I did not go to the warehouse, but went to pri<lb/>soner's house. The loans I have mentioned passed through my hands. There was one from Charkin Marks in the latter part of 1907 for which bills were given which were paid by cash. Last Friday (Feb<lb/>ruary 18) I went to the trustee's office for the expenses book but could not find it— I was shown a number of books. The loans were not en<lb/>tered in the bill book but in the loan book so as not to interfere with the trade accounts. I repaid Marks in money when the bills became due; he would return the bills, and they were put amongst the trade bills that we had back from the bank which were kept in a drawer, and which were handed over to the trustee when he took possession. I re<lb/>member his taking all the bills away; I am certain they cleared out all the drawers. I did not see the bills at the trustee's office— I did not look for them; I went to look for some letters and could not find them. When I left the letters were all done up in separate parcels according to the dates, but I found at the trustee's office they were all in confusion. I remember at the time the Official Receiver took posses<lb/>sion the expenditure book, bill books, etc., were all there, and he took away all the books and documents. I paid Tennebaum for repairs to the burst water pipes, and had a receipt, which is amongst the other receipts. I paid ₤ 410 in respect of 160, Commercial Road, to Tenne<lb/>baum, Tobias, and Barnet; I cannot remember how much to each; I had receipts. The goods delivered in August, 1908, were of a special American shape, for which various customers had asked— Charkin Marks, Soper, and others— there was a run on that shape. Hawkins's, Robert's, and Brown's boots were sold to Marks, Soper,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080085"/>
               <p>and others. I do not know if invoices were delivered; when I came back from my holidays Zetta gave me particulars. I got the money from Soper and Marks; they had paid a deposit, and they paid me the balance which I gave to prisoner; I do not remember how much it was.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Receipt to Harris Napper for cheque ₤ 25, dated August 10 (produced), was signed by me after I came back from my holidays from particulars given me by Zetta. I left 44, Middlesex Street immediately after the Official Receiver came into possession and never went back. I have since seen none of the books or docu<lb/>ments until I saw them there. The paid bills, both from the bank and for loans, were altogether in a drawer and were handed over. All the letters were done up in packets in order of date, and the dates stated on the packet; they are now all mixed together; it is impossible to find anything.</p>

                  </hi> I am a boot cutter, now employed at 8, Shepherdess Walk, City Road. I was in prisoner's employ for 3½ years until the Official Receiver came in. There was also Miss Coral and about half a dozen lads of 14 to 18. My duties were confined to the warehouse at 44, Middlesex Street. I had nothing to do with the books. Palmer came to take stock about the third week in January, 1908. Business was going on as usual up to 8 p.m. Two chaps came with Palmer, one of whom I sent upstairs to count a lot of stuff that had been mixed up. Palmer was there from a little before 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. on three days, and I stayed to assist in the stocktaking. The boys had put the stuff straight during the day and sorted the goods so that they could be counted; tickets were put on the boxes containing the quantities. I called out what was on the ticket, which Palmer wrote down in the book, prisoner stating the prices. It was from the marked quantities alone that the figures were given. In the early part of August, 1908, a quantity of goods came in from Hawkins, Roberts and Brown; they were of the American shape, which was in great de<lb/>mand at that time; they were sold very quickly to different customers, who were in a hurry to get them because it was just before the Jewish holidays. I remember in June and July water pipes bursting on the third floor; a large quantity of water went through the floors and flooded the place, injuring a large quantity of boots, which I sold off to job buyers. I found some days afterwards boxes filled with water and the boots and the boots shrunk and spoilt; very low prices were got for them; there were all kinds of boots. We frequently missed boots which were stolen by customers. On one occasion I caught a man taking a pair and called prisoner's attention to him, but he would not prosecute him. I remember a fire occurring in August. Prisoner and I were on the top floor. We heard holloaing, rushed down, and found the office in flames. I rushed about to get some water; some men were doing the road outside who came in with pails, and we put it out. There was a flame right up to the ceiling. There were some carpenters at work making a window case. The books were being used. Some were on the shelves and some were on the desk, and they were injured. Coral and I went through them to see if she could get particulars out. The five books (produced) were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080086"/>
               <p>then put in the safe. I should say they are now in the condition in which they were after the fire. The safe was then locked and Corel took the key; that was the only key we had. We sold old stock by auction. When I first went there there was a lot of very old stock of extreme sizes, and in order to make them saleable I added medium sizes from the new stock, and we got rid of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were not 5, 000 or 6, 000 empty boxes on the premises when Palmer took the stock. Two days afterwards I went to get some children's sizes and found the number on the outside was wrong; there was an empty box which should have contained 18 or 24 pairs of children's boots— the boys had put the number down without counting them. I asked the two boys about it, but each of them denied it was his fault. I did not very often find an empty box. I should say most of the boxes in January, 1908, had boots in them, The fire was out just before the firemen arrived. The American shaped goods delivered early in August were sold to several people. Soper bought a decent parcel— about £120 worth. I took some of the money in cash on account; the rest was paid when he took the goods— I cannot be sure whether it was cash or cheque. I did not make out the invoice; I very seldom interfered with the invoice book, but I used to give Coral the particulars on a slip of paper and she would do the invoices. Marks bought a lot and a number of people bought quantities of a dozen or three dozen. When I shut up the warehouse I went round to prisoner's house and gave him the money.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. When I got down to the office the flames were up to the ceiling and the back part was all alight. I should say it continued half an hour. After the Official Receiver came in I applied for a situation at Webber and Co., where I had been 18 years ago, and I was taken on the following week.</p>

On August 28, 1908, I went to 44, Middlesex Street and removed all books and papers that were on the premises in the safe, the office, and elsewhere. The books in the safe were covered with mildew. There were some papers in the drawers tied up in bundles. I conveyed them to Bankruptcy Buildings, where they were entered in the register of debtors' books by Webb.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Coral and Zetta were there. I asked Coral where the current books were kept. She said, "In the safe." I believe our caretaker, who had been in possession a week, had the key. There were some papers in a desk. I took everything that was in the saw and from the drawers of a desk in the office; at the top of the building there was a large quantity of old books. I moved everything I could find— I had a van load. I searched the premises thoroughly.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Neither Coral nor Zetta pointed out any boob of papers other than those I took away.</p>

About 10.30 p.m. t entered the gate of All Souls' Church. By the vestry door I saw prisoner and another man. I said, "Hullo, what are you doing here? " Both men ran towards the railings leading to London Road; one succeeded in jumping over; I caught prisoner. He said, "It's all right, guv'nor, we have only just come round to do a job for ourselves." I searched him and found a combination tool and two pairs of pliers. I said I should take him to the station; he replied, 'You have made a mistake." I took hold of his right wrist with my right hand and with my left hand held the right side of his coat; his left hand was free. He walked quietly till we got outside 79, Finchley Road. He then suddenly raised his left hand towards my face; I saw something glitter; I ducked my head forward; I heard the report of a revolver and felt a scorching pain in the left side of my neck. prisoner said, "Take that, you bastard." I found afterwards that a bullet had gone through my helmet. I felt dizzy and let go of him for a minute; he then fired at me again, four shots going through my great-coat, one wounding me slightly in the right tide. I got the</p>

I was off duty for 14 days and was deaf for three weeks. On Decem<lb/>ber 17, 1909, I went to Wormwood Scrubs prison and picked out pri<lb/>soner from a number of men.

                  </hi> I am a waiter at the Railway Hotel, West Hampstead. I have known prisoner about six years; I was at school with him. I saw him on November 20, 1908. We went together between 7 and 8 o'clock to All Souls' Church. I used to be in the choir there and I wanted to see some of the boys. Choir was all over and we went to a public house: afterwards we went back and made a convenience of the churchyard. The constable came in and I ran away. I did not know that prisoner had a revolver or housebreaking implements. Later that night I saw prisoner; he told me he had fired at the constable and he hoped he had not hurt him. The revolver produced I have seen in prisoner's possession; he told me it had been given to him by a man named Cooper. I know also that the combina<lb/>tion tool produced is his.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE WALLIS, </hi>S Division. On November 20, 1908, about 11 p.m., I went to All Souls' Churchyard. I found a slight mark near the catch of the vestry window; it may have been effected with the tool produced. On December 17, 1909, I was present when Heasman identified prisoner; prisoner said, "I know nothing at all about it." On January 25 he was formally charged with the attempted murder; he made no reply. I afterwards saw him at his request, when he said, "I had no intention of killing him; I only wanted to frighten him, so that I could get away; I had the revolver in my right outside jacket pocket and when he commenced to search me I pulled it out and held it in my hand and put it back again when he had finished searching me. I never got on the 'bus, as stated by the</p>

               <p>police constable; I hid in a garden in St. John's Wood Park until all was quiet, then walked home; I left some of the tools, a screwdriver, etc., in the garden I hid in; Gurney knew why I went into the church, as he put the job up; when he gives his evidence I shall have some funny questions to ask him." I went to the garden indicated by prisoner, but found no tools there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate." I had no intention of murder; when I fired the first shot it was my intention to fire it over his head; when he saw the gleam of the revolver he jumped towards me, threatening me; I should also like to point out that the churchyard would be a much better place to commit murder than the Finchley Road; all the shots were fired at the right side of the body. I am very sorry I hurt the constable; I only wished to get away from him."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Before the institution of these proceedings I had not seen prisoner for eleven years. My daughter has been living with me and with her grandmother all that time. She does not drink. 8he bad 21 days for stealing a petticoat. The sending of money to her was stopped by the Army authorities. It is false to say it was stopped because of her bad conduct. My husband has been a teetotaler I do not know how many years, and will not have her out of doors after nine o'clock at night, when the doors are all fastened up.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I was first married 21 years ago, being then 17 years of age. My wife was four years older than I was. So far as I was concerned it was a terrible life we led. She was never at home and I was working 14 or 15 hours a day seven days a week. She was very seldom at home, and when she was she was practically always drunk and filthy dirty. After her con<lb/>viction I left her and went into the service. I joined the colours in November, 1890, and on returning to England in December, 1898, I went straight to where my wife was living with her mother, and she was in such a shocking, filthy condition she was ashamed to let me see her. I went out while she washed her face; she could not change her clothes because she had none. After that I lived with her, and did the best I could with the savings of my deferred pay, which I spent wholly and entirely upon her, rigged her out and bought a home, and a little over two months afterwards everything was sold. The incident of the conviction was in March, 1899. I afterwards served in South Africa. As to the stopping of the pay to my wife I was in the Transvaal at the time, and one day I was called to the office-tent— which was the only tent we did have— and the sergeant-major said to me, "The allowance your wife has been receiving is stopped, " but he could not give me any particulars as to why that was. The only thing I know of that pay is stopped for is misconduct. I returned to England in 1902 and made inquiries for my wife, but heard nothing of her until the present year. When I went to see my mother in March, 1904, as soon as I got in the door mother said, "I have got some news for you." "What is that? " I said. She replied, "Eliza is dead." I had no reason to disbelieve it as mother was rather a truthful woman, and she thought a lot of me. My mother has been employed at the London Hospital for 22 years. I had a very good discharge from the Army, and for seven years I have been with the London County Council. When I married Mary Ann Gill she had no money. I married because I wanted the comfort of a home. I honestly be<lb/>lieved my wife was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My mother told me she had heard from some<lb/>body that my wife was dead, and to tell you the truth I was rather pleased with the news. I did not take steps to verify the fact because I firmly believed what my mother told me, and she congratulated me on being able to live a little happier life. I did not know where my wife's friends were to be found.</p>

                  </hi>411, Battersea Park Road. Pri<lb/>soner Russ applied to me in March last in regard to an empty shop at 2a, Bridge Road, West Battersea. He wanted the shop to carry on the business of a builder and decorator, more as a receiving office for orders, I understood. He gave me three references. One was a Mr. Champion, another was J. Robinson, 22, Cleveland Street, Fitzroy Square, who wrote, " In reply to yours respecting Mr. Russ, I have known him some time as a respectable tradesman. He has done work for me satisfactorily and I should consider him quite up to the rent you name and should think he would prove a good tenant." I was quite satisfied with the references, and let him have the premises on a three years' agreement at ₤ 22 a year. He owes 30s. on account of the Michaelmas rent and a quarter's rent due Christmas. I visited him several times. I saw various goods in the shop, gas fittings, waste preventers, rolls of wall paper, etc.</p>

He said his business was getting too large for him to cope with. He said it was a plumber's and gasfitter's busi<lb/>ness. He introduced Robinson to me as a friend who shared the office with him, and who did his clerical work for him as he was no scholar. Russ asked what I was prepared to put into the business<lb/>he said anything from ₤ 25 to ₤ 50. I said I would try and get ₤ 25. He said he wanted it as security against his trade with an option of partnership at the end of two months. He said he was not going to let me into the secrets of his trade unless some money was put into the business. He asked me how much I had with me then; I said ₤ 1. He said he could not accept less than ₤ 5 and as he was satisfied with my writing and clerical work if I brought another ₤ 4 by 2 o'clock I should have the appointment. I told him I had ₤ 4 in the Post Office and he said I could get it at an hour's notice by telegraph. I came back at two and handed him the ₤ 5 and took a receipt for it. I agreed to pay the balance on October 14. I commenced work on Monday, the 11th. He said he could not get on with any work then till the agreement was settled, and asked me to go round the West End to show me some of the work he had done. He showed me two houses in Westbourne Grove, 24 and 26, Colville Road, which he said he had done up in the summer. Then he showed me two in Lancaster Road, 132 and 168, which he said he had painted in the summer. Then he showed me a church which he said he had put in an estimate for and a church at Watford he had put in an estimate for building. That week I never left work later than two to half past. On the 13th he asked me if I was going to fulfil the agreement on the 14th. I said, " I hope to do my best to pay the ₤ 20." I paid ₤ 10 on the 14th. Robinson was there. He wrote out the receipt as in the former case. Russ asked me why I did not complete the full agreement. I told him I could not get the other ₤ 10 then. He said when I had paid the full amount I would have to stop to half-past six and seven in the evening. He asked me to get the other ₤ 10 as soon as I could. The next day I had an interview with my uncle. Prisoners accom<lb/>panied me there. Russ told him he had a ₤ 40 job in the Minories and had put in an estimate, and expected several other jobs to come along that week, and if I would put a further ₤ 25 in the business we should get along well together; he had plenty of work to do and did not see why we should not get on well together. He left me to talk it over with my uncle. I afterwards saw Russ and had a conversation about the other ₤ 25. If I paid that I was to have ₤ 2 a week and a share in the profits. Robinson was there when he made that offer. He said, " I think you can manage that, Russ." Russ asked Robinson if he could give me ₤ 2 a week. Robinson said, "I could not say exactly for certain, as I have not the books here. I have to have them audited. I reckon, roughly speaking, you can manage to give him ₤ 2 and a share of the profits, making his money 45s. to 50s. a week." I then agreed to advance the further ₤ 25. That day Russ sent me to 2a, Bridge Road to take a partition, a show case, we were</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080093"/>
               <p>putting up. There were a few mantles, some fittings, and a few rolls of paper there. A workman was there named Mann. On the 15th and 16th I went to the office. Nothing was doing. Next week there was nothing to do; I put up a little bit of partition in the office, but no orders came in. On October 25 I paid Russ ₤ 10 more. That completed the first ₤ 25. Robinson wrote out the agreement. Russ and I signed it and Robinson witnessed it. A week or two after that I did a little work. On October 25 or 26 I got into communication with Hyett. In consequence of what he told me I gave Russ a written notice on October 27 to terminate the agreement. I told Russ I did not think the business was a genuine one. He said, " You have nothing to grumble at until I fail to return you the deposit, " My wages were paid up to November 26. On the 22nd I asked Russ for my money. He said I would have to wait till the 26th. On the 26th I went to the office. Russ was not there. I saw Robinson; he said I should find Russ at George Street, at Mr. Lovett's, his solicitor. I saw Mr. Lovett. He asked me if I had received a letter on the 25th; I said no; he said, " I sent you a letter." I received a letter from Mr. Lovett on the 27th. I saw Lovett and Russ at George Street the following day. I said I had come for my wages. They asked me if I had the key of the shop at Battersea. I said yea He gave me a receipt to sign and he paid me 30s. I do not remember seeing the receipt written out. I read it through before I signed it. It is not now in the same form as when I signed it; "in full settlement of all claims" was not on it. Two or three weeks afterwards I had a con<lb/>versation with Russ about my money. He said, " You will never get that money; I have not got it, and it is no good kicking up a row about it." The only book I ever saw was an order book. The only orders in it were one or two that I had done at 75, Lancaster Road, a house occupied by Robinson— some cords and some blinds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Russ told me where he had been apprenticed, but not that he had been with their successors 2½ years. I know his father as a respectable man. There was no plant at Bridge Road for a builder's and decorator's. There was some stock when I went there. It did not strike me then the thing was a fraud. Mann went about on one or two little jobs. I put up two shelves at 80, William Street, Regent's Park. Mann was also working there. I received ₤ 12 in wages from Russ. I paid him ₤ 25. I got ₤ 12 for doing practically nothing. I do not know if Russ took me to 62, Cromwell Road. I do not remember his showing me a board of his on the railings of that house. I heard afterwards he had done work at 114, Cromwell Road, but I do not remember him showing me that house; I will not swear; it is a long time ago. I spent about a day painting at George Street, Minories. I swore an information at the Guildhall; it was not done with Hyett.</p>

                  </hi>43, Cole Street, Borough, assistant elec<lb/>trician. I answered the advertisement in the " Daily Chronicle " on October 5. I afterwards called at 49, Newgate Street. I saw both prisoners. Russ asked me if I had come in answer to the advertise<lb/>ment. I said yes. He told me he did business as a plumber and elec<lb/>trical engineer; he said he did the plumbing and his brother the elec<lb/>trical part of the business. I did not see his brother. I asked what money he required put into the business and he told me anything from ₤ 20 to ₤ 25. The duties were partly office work and I was to assist in the electrical department. I agreed to invest ₤ 15. He told me Robinson had been assisting him in his clerical work and that it inter<lb/>fered with Robinson's business. I asked him if he required a reference and he said not unless I did, and if I required one I could refer to his bankers; he did not mention their name. He told me he had a fairly decent business and had several jobs pending in the West End; the business was growing so large he could not cope with it himself, and he required someone to take an interest in the business to assist him. I saw him the following day and my wages were agreed upon at 30s. a week, and when I had paid my money I was to have a share of the profits. I paid him ₤ 5 in gold. Robinson wrote out the receipt and Russ signed it. On the following Monday I received a letter from Russ to go to 80, William Street, Regent's Park; that is a dairy, a sort of general shop. I saw Miss Smith there and a workman. I did not know who she was at the time. Robinson has since told me, first, that she was his daughter-in-law and afterwards his step<lb/>daughter. She appeared to be managing the business. I proceeded to do the work set out on the paper with the assistance of the man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080095"/>
               <p>named Mann. I had to buy some glass in the neighbourhood. I never saw any stock of glass at Russ's. Russ came in the afternoon with Robinson. I told Russ there was no material and I had pur<lb/>chased some; he said any material I required I was to purchase and he would repay me. I bought 2s. worth or more. On the Friday I went to, If think, 72, Lancaster Road, Notting Hill; there I re<lb/>paired some Venetian blinds. On the Saturday I went to George Street, Minories, a place occupied then by a Mr. Morgan; it was to be done up inside. Russ and Robinson went with me there. On October 23 I had a conversation with Russ in the "Grapes''; he asked when I was going to settle up the ₤ 10 balance. I told him I could not see my way clear to pay it. I did not receive any wages that day. I asked for the return of my money. He told me as I had not completed the agreement I had forfeited it. I told him I should have it back, and he told me I had my remedy. I worked a fortnight, but only received 30s. in wages. I received about ₤ 3 of my deposit at different times. While I was at 49, Newgate Street no orders were received to my knowledge. I did not see any books. I did not make entries in any books or see either prisoner do so. I went on one occasion to Battersea; there were a few gas mantles and acces<lb/>sories and such like there. There was no material for decorating or putting in an electrical installation. I saw no signboards. I met Pollitt the Monday after I left. I had a conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There was a. little stock at Battersea. I did a little work during the two weeks I was engaged. My time was far from being fairly occupied. I did work at three places. At far as my knowledge goes, orders had not been given to do that work; the premises belonged to friends and relatives of theirs. I do not suggest there is anything criminal in a man employing his ton. I did not do any other jobs that I was paid for. I swore an information at the Guildhall with someone else. It was not at anyone's request; it was of my own free will. I do not think I received the whole of the ₤ 3 10s. before I signed the information. I did not tell Russ I did not wish to be a party to the criminal charge against him.</p>

                  </hi>132, Lavender Road, Battersea. About the end of May last I entered Russ's employment. I worked at different places. The headquarters were 2a, Bridge Road West. I was in charge of the shop. I stayed there till the commencement of November. The business done was small jobs. There was not much stock there. I was principally out at jobs through the day when he had anything to do. I do not think he kept any books. I never saw any entries made. I never wrote letters or made out accounts. I have seen him make out accounts on the notepaper. I remember Hyett coming. Before that I remember Russ saying he thought he would give up the Battersea shop; that he was going to take an office in Newgate Street to share with another party. I think it would be about the end of September he said that. I left about November 7. I did some plumbing work at Tavistock Crescent, No. 29, I believe. I believe that house belongs to Russ's father. I did some work in the Minories, George Street; it was a general shop; Lewis was the name,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080096"/>
               <p>I believe. I did some work at Francis Street, Battersea. cleaning the paper in the passage, hall, and staircase. That was in July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had no set wages. When I was doing plumb<lb/>ing work he paid me 8d. an hour. I was paid what I earned. I do not know what he got for the work done in George Street. I was working there a fortnight or three weeks. At Albert Villas we were about three weeks painting the front door for Mrs. Smyth. Albert Place is a turning out of Cornwall Road, Bayswater. I also did three or four days' work at 114, Cornwall Road; about a week at 162, Cornwall Road. Two or three times I did work at Rillington Place, and I did a few small jobs at different places Battersea way. There was some stock at Battersea. The business was carried on genuine enough when I was there.</p>

                  </hi>19, Chapel Street, W. I deal in electrical goods wholesale. When I was at 16 and 17, Barbican, I had dealings with Russ Brothers. On September 16 I received a request from them to quote for cable for house-lighting. An appointment was made and I saw both prisoners. Robinson did not give his name. Russ selected some electric fittings. The other man only said, " We also want a padlock.'' The goods selected came to ₤ 30. I asked for a reference; Russ gave me his brother as a reference; the other man said practically nothing. Russ said his brother was the manager of the electrical department of their firm, but was away at Oxford on some job, but he would write his brother and I would get the reference from him. I never got the reference from the brother. I have since seen him; he is employed by a firm in Bond Street. Russ said he wanted the stuff as he was wiring a mansion that was going to be let in flats. He also wanted 12 baths at ₤ 2 each. The goods were partly fetched and partly sent by Carter, Paterson. I cannot say where they went to as the delivery notes would be at the stores. When the reference did not come and I found things did not seem to be straight I pressed for payment. All I got was. about 24s. worth returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The goods that were delivered came to ₤ 13 be<lb/>cause the whole order was not executed. I am agent for Busch, of Westphalia, and invoice the goods on his forms. To firms of good standing we give 30 days' credit. I gave credit to Russ subject to references being satisfactory. I do not call that giving credit.</p>
               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">HERBERT HINE, </hi>City Police. On December 17 I served the original summons on Robinson. He made no reply Later that day I saw Russ and served him. He made no reply. There was no stock-in-trade there. There was a quantity of sta<lb/>tionery, billheads, and so on, but nothing written on it. There were no books. I had difficulty in serving the summonses. About 9.15 a.m. I saw the two defendants cross the street. Russ stood on the doorstep leading to the offices above. Robinson went into the chemist's and shortly afterwards came out, passed Russ on the doorstep, and went upstairs. Russ looked about for a few minutes and then fol<lb/>lowed up. I immediately followed. When I arrived on the second floor landing I saw Robinson opening the office door but could not see</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080097"/>
               <p>Russ. I followed Robinson into the office and said, " Are you Mr. Robinson? " He said, " Yes." I said, " Where is Mr. Russ? " He said, " I do not know; I have not seen him." I went up and down the staircase, tried every door; every door was secure. After going up the staircase two or three times I said again to Robinson, " Where is Russ? " He said, " I do not know; I have not seen him." I said, " What is the use of talking like that? He entered the building with you." He said, " He is in the little place underneath." Below there is a small place where there is a wash-hand basin. I saw Russ there; he was commencing to wash his hands as I opened the door. I served him there.</p>

On September 22 I received a message on the telephone from Mr. Russ. He was worrying as to the delivery of the goods. I replied that he had not furnished the references as pro<lb/>mised. He said he had written his brother, who was engaged at a job at Oxford and could not understand why he had not replied, but he presumed he was very busy. He said it was most essential he should have the goods or part of them. He wanted this cable, as he had men absolutely waiting— I think he said about eight. As far as I remember, he said they were engaged on a mansion. I ultimately let him have one and a half miles of cable, value ₤ 13 14s. He took a portion of it away— I think about half a mile. As the references did not come I made application for payment and 24s. worth was returned. The balance has not been paid for.</p>

I happened to lose a little money. I went to Battersea in May last year. I left Little Britain about eight months before that. I got in some stock at Battersea. Mann was working for me in Little Britain. I showed Pollitt some houses where I had done work. I had to go to 80, William Street, to see how my man Mann was getting on. Pollitt saw him working there and said it was all right. On the way back we went through Aldridge Road Villas. I pointed out No. 8, a house where I did work; then I pointed out 62, Cornwall Road, where my board was on the balcony railings. I had just completed repointing and repainting the front and railings. We went past 114, Cromwell Road, and I pointed out that house, that I had done a lot of work there inside the last two years. I showed him some work I wanted him to go and do on the following Tuesday at 75,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080098"/>
               <p>Lancaster Road. We went from there to 18, Rillington Place. I pointed that house out as a house I had done various work at. We never went near Colville Road. I was present when this document was written out by Mr. Lovett. Pollitt was also there. He was at Lovett's the day before. He told Mr. Lovett he had been home and seen his friends, and he thought the best thing he could do if I would pay him his wages was to sign a receipt. I said, " I will have your wages here to-morrow, " and it was arranged he should call at 12 o'clock the next day, Saturday. He called next day at Mr. Lovett's office. Mr. Lovett asked him whether he had changed his mind. He said "No." He asked me if I had got his wages. I said " Yes, " and put the wages on the table. Mr. Lovett said, " We will have a receipt for the wages, and if you accept this 30s., as you said yesterday, it will be in settlement of all claims." Pollitt says, "I agree." Mr. Lovett was reading this out as he wrote it, and he handed it to Pollitt to sign it. Pollitt was sitting one side of the table, I was sitting at the other by Mr. Lovett. Pollitt sat there five minutes; while he was fetching the key out of his pocket he was reading it, and then he signed it, and when he went away he shook hands and said he was perfectly satisfied. I next saw him on the following Saturday. He said nothing about the receipt or about his claim on me; he asked me if I would lend him a few shillings— that is what he had come for. I lent him 5s. He said nothing about criminal proceedings or going to the City Police. It was the month of December then. I did not see him again till the police court. The summons on the 16th was the first I heard of any complaint by him. I did not try to evade the service of the summons. I got a black across my hand in the railway carriage and went into this lavatory place to wash my hands. I was finished when Inspector Hine opened the door. I did not know him. I had no reason to suppose anyone was waiting to serve me with a summons. Mann was working for me when Hyett came. Hyett was with mo about a fortnight. I paid his wages the first week. The second week he said, " Can I have a couple of days off, as I should like to go down to Watford to get the balance of the money from my people. I did not see him again till Saturday morning. He said he was very sorry, but he had lent a friend of his the money— ₤ 40 he said— and he was a dealer: he had laid the money out in stock and he could not get it in time. He asked me to wait a little while longer. I said, " I do not see as I can keep you on." I wanted the money to carry out the work. I could not keep him on. He went away. He had a sovereign, 5s. 6d., and 2s. 6d., and on the third week he had 30s., making ₤ 2 17s. 6d. Several weeks after that he used to come up and do little odd jobs. He used to draw an average of about 3s. or 4s. a job, and 10s. I allowed him what I was paying back for his deposit. He made no complaint about having been defrauded by me. I did not hear that Hyett was alleging that I had conspired to cheat and defraud him till the Saturday following the service of the summonses. That week Hyett was looking after my shop at Battersea. After the service of the summonses he was supposed to be looking after my shop. I went over on the Wednesday and found no one there. The shop was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080099"/>
               <p>closed.The same on Thursday and Friday. When he came up on Thursday he asked me for his wages. I agreed to pay him 25s.for stopping at the shop that week. He came up and asked me for the 25s. I said to him, " What do you mean, you've not been to the shop; you closed the shop." He said, " Yes, I have been there every day." I said, " You have not." I paid him 10s.afterwards and he said he never lodged the complaint, but Pollitt had been round there. He said it was against his wish and Pollitt's mother had been round to his house, they had all been trying to persuade him, barring his uncle. He showed me a note signed by some police-constable on befalf of Detective Hine, of the City Police. Hyett said he was against charg<lb/>ing me with a criminal offence and that he was pressed into it. I wrote to Brauckmann asking him to quote me for cable and signed the letter, "Russ Brothers.— A. Russ." At that time I had submitted an estimate for the International Hotel, Aldgate, to wire the place throughout. All told, there was going to be about 75 lights. Mr. Brauckmann was a day or two with the cable, consequently the job was hanging about. I got on the 'phone to Brauckmann. I had got the job for the International Hotel when the cable came along. In the meantime I had made inquiries and was not satisfied to get on with the work, consequently the goods were no good. I kept them in the shop some time, then I sold them to tradesmen for what they cost me. I wanted the money to keep my business going. I sent my man to Drury Lane for some of the cable and he brought back a quarter of a mile. He took that to my place at Battersea. Before the other was delivered I went to Brauckmann and told him I had got the Job. I never said anything about mansions; I said I had a job in the City. I called on Brauckmann after I received the quarter of a mile of cable. I wanted other fittings. I chose some. He said, ''All right." He never said anything about references then. He said he would have them delivered as soon as possible. A couple of days after that the goods came in, the completion one and a half miles. I could not stop it. I was about the City and did not go to the shop till night time. A friend in the City asked me if I had any cable I could let him have and I sold it to him. Brauckmann delivered the goods about September 22. I received an invoice with the goods. It was under<lb/>stood I should have credit. I have not been sued for the amount. I did not know till I came to this Court that Brauckmann was complain<lb/>ing that he had been cheated and defrauded.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was apprenticed as plumber and electrical engi<lb/>neer. I was qualified about three years ago. I stayed on with my firm until I took premises in Little Britain in 1908, when I started on my own account as office fitter, electrician, and plumber. I had one electrician with me all the time I was there. That man had left me when I went to Bridge Road, Battersea. Mann took his place. I had no bank account then; I had at Little Britain. When that ac<lb/>count was closed the balance was only a few shillings. The bank did not close the account; I did. The sanitary work I did after I went to Bridge Road amounted to ₤ 5 or ₤ 10. My father paid that. Russ Brothers had no books. I made no entries of contracts. My stock-in<lb/>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080100"/>
               <p>trade did not consist of notepaper; I had three shelves at Battersea. It is hard to say what my takings were at Bridge Road. I should say I made between March and October about ₤ 60. It was all paid in cash. I had a cheque from Mr. Montague Smyth, 8, Aldridge Road Villas; it was ₤ 8 8s., I think. I had a 25-round ladder, seven planks, three or four pairs of steps, and three shelves containing incandescent globes. I paid cash for those. I was dealing retail in incandescent globes, burners, fittings, and everything. I had two waste preventers there and two closet pans, two lavatory pans, several boxes of fittings for plumbing work and gas fitting. I went to Newgate Street because I did some work in the City and it was more handy for me. I did some electrical work at Hatton Garden for Mr. Maddeley, a shop and office fitter. I did a lot of work in the City when I was at Little Britain. That was the idea of my going back to the City, to work it up again. Robinson was an agent. He introduced me to one or two people when he saw work going about. I did not say I was so busy that Robinson had to write all my business letters. I did not understand office duties. Robinson had no connection with me at Little Britain. There was not much writing there, only making out accounts. Robinson wrote my letters at Newgate Street; he is a better writer than me and I do not care about writing. He had no interest in my business. He never made a penny out of any of my work. I was walking out with his daughter. I believe I first met him about three years ago. I used to see him in the City and at Ladbroke Grove. The reference I gave for the tenancy of 2a, Bridge Road, was Robin<lb/>son. I was doing a little job for him at the time and I mentioned I was thinking of going to Battersea and asked him if he would be good enough to give me a reference. He did. The first quarter's rent was eventually paid; there was some work done and there was a contra✗ account. I owe now one quarter, and 30s. 80, William Street, Regent's Park is a dairy and general shop. Mr. Robinson's step<lb/>daughter carried that on. The work done there was done for her account. I knew Robinson was the tenant. 62, Cornwall Road is my father's property. I have to submit an estimate for my father's work in competition with others. I live there, and that was the place where the decorator's board was displayed. 114, Cornwall Road, 18, Rillington Place, and 29, Tavistock Crescent belong to my father; 75, Lancaster Road is where Robinson lives, and 8, Aldridge Road Villas was the only place which did not belong either to my father or Robin<lb/>son. I could have pointed out several houses there where I had done a lot of work, but we did not go near that way. It is absolutely false that I showed Pollitt two houses in Colville Road. I saw Pollitt on the Fri<lb/>day after he had been to see Mr. Lovett. He said he had seen his friends and they advised him that they knew he had no claim against me as he refused to do work and was a continual nuisance. I agreed absolutely with that statement. The receipt was not made out till Saturday, till he signed for the wages. It was made out by Mr. Lovett. He said to Pollitt, "This will be in settlement of all claims." Pollitt said, "I agree." The October 5 advertisement secured Pollitt and✗ Hyett. On November 9 I wanted to get another young man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080101"/>
               <p>with capital— not for office duties; I wanted a fellow who could take an order. I told Pollitt. He said, "I will help you to get another man to take my place." I said, "I propose keeping books." On December 1 I wanted a young man for the shop at Battersea. I think there was a lot of prospects if he looked after it properly. I asked Robinson to write that advertisement for me, also that of the 8th. I had one or two replies, but I tore them up. I had a couple of fellows come up. They went over to Battersea but they wanted to go more into the ironmongery trade. I had a communication from a Mr. Jaune, a Frenchman. He saw me at Newgate Street. He paid me ₤ 5 deposit pending the agreement— the same as Pollitt and Hyett. He got it back before he started work. That was not after proceedings had been taken against me. I had one and a half miles of cable from Brauckmann. I did not tell him I was wiring a mansion. This Inter<lb/>national Hotel is an old mansion. I never said anything about men working there. I do not recollect mentioning about my brother at Oxford. I do not know whether he was at Oxford. The amount of the tender at the International Hotel was ₤ 35. I did not do the job. The man has been sold up since. The tender was not in writing. He gave me the order verbally. He said, "If you like to start, you can." I was going to employ three or four men.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I carry on business as agent for provision dealers at 49, Newgate Street. I first became acquainted with Russ about, three years ago, when he came to do some work for his employers. I was in business then at 82, Cleveland Street. When I moved to Newgate Street I had a conversation with Russ about it. I said I had answered an advertisement for this office, would he give me a reference? I said, "I have always obliged you." He said, "All right, I will give you a reference." When he came to witness the agreement he said he should like to have a seat in the office; it would be handy for his City business. I said to the landlord, "Mr. Russ, the witness to this agreement says he would like to have an address." He said, "All right, you have the key; you can do as you like." Russ had the seat and paid 5s. every week for it. The receipts are here. I have no knowledge of plumbing or sanitary work. I have never taken part in the conduct of his business. When Pollitt came Russ said, "I am taking a deposit of this man. Will you just write out a receipt? " I had written out other things for him when he asked me. I said I could not form an opinion as to how much wages to Pollitt the business would stand without looking at the books.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I cannot say what Russ was doing when I first knew him; he was working for a firm and came to do some work at our house. I did not see him often then. We lived in the same neighbourhood and met in the evening. We became intimate about 12 months ago. I did not meet him when he was at Little Britain. I knew he was there. Russ gave me a reference for the Cleveland Street tenancy, also for William Street. My step-daughter bought the dairy from a man named Harvey. She is my tenant. I told Russ I wanted a cowl put on the chimney and he went down and did his own business. I gave Russ a reference when he took 2a, Bridge Road. I could not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080102"/>
               <p>tell you why Russ did not write his own letters. He asked me to write them. The reason I had the advertisement addressed to my house, 75, Lancaster Road, is, he asked me to put this advertisement in and when I got to the "Chronicle" office I wrote on the paper off their desk. The gentleman at the desk said, "We must have a name and address." I simply put my own, there and then, on the back of each one. The replies did not come to my address; they went to the "Chronicle" office. I do not know that there was any reason for Russ not writing them himself. He wrote out what he wanted and when I got to the "Chronicle" office I wrote on their paper. I should say he was carrying on the business as described on his letter paper. It did not strike me as extraordinary that he should want a large number of leather bags, because he was about sending some travellers out. I saw about eight or nine bags. I don't know how many travellers he was going to send out in the plumbing trade. I only went with Russ to see Brauckmann on that occasion about the lock. I did not know what Russ wanted from him. I had nothing to say in it. I was standing on one side. I did not hear anything about it. I thought Russ had room for a partner, and if he had taken the job he spoke About he would have required one. He would want another at Bat<lb/>tersea. When Pollitt came I did not know whether he was suitable. I did not trouble about it. I did not know why, if they were wanted for book-keeping, they were put on to whitewashing. I never asked Russ for his books. I did not trouble about them or him at all. He had his own key to come in and out when he liked. I think he had some books at Battersea. He had a man there selling stuff and taking money for it. I remember the summons being served on me. Before it was served I was with Russ. When Detective Hine came in he said, "I want Robinson." Then he said, "Where is Russ? " I said, "I do not know." I did not say I had not seen him that morning. I did not know where he was then. I knew we came to<lb/>gether. I used to go into the shop for my letter and then go up. I did not look to see who was following me. It appears Russ went in to wash his hands on the second floor; our office is on the third floor.</p>

On going down the road I saw prisoner being brought back in charge of plain-clothes constables. The piece of beef stolen weighed 19 1b., and its value was 10s. I had no other piece of beef of that kind.</p>

On the barrow was a basket covered with a sack, and inside the basket was the piece of meat. Prisoner said, "Let me off; I have a wife and children." I told him I should have to follow him until a policeman came along. Prisoner and another man afterwards got me into a narrow court and attacked me.

Martin ran up a passage after this man. I was within the handles of my barrow. I am a costermonger by trade, and have no cause to go stealing. I have seen enough punishment in my time. I came out of prison on December 22, and made up my mind to go straight, but the police do not seem to let me alone at all.</p>

               <p>Mr. Marshall Hall, K.C., Mr. George Elliott, K.C., and Mr. Storry Deans prosecuted; Mr. Valetta and Mr. T. Wing defended.</p>
               <p>Defendant pleaded not guilty, and put in a plea of justification.</p>
               <p>Defendant is sub-editor of the "Academy, " and in that paper pub<lb/>lished certain articles libellous of "a certain scion of a noble house, " alleged to be identifiable, from the articles, with prosecutor. His solicitors wrote to the publishers of the paper, demanding the insertion of a paragraph stating that Mr. Manners-Sutton was not the person referred to in the articles. Defendant, as director of the publishing firm, replied, "We do not propose to oblige you by stating that Mr. Manners-Sutton is not 'the gentleman referred to.' Rather, at our own time, and when we have completed our investigations, we shall be dis<lb/>posed to say that he is the gentleman. With regard to the action you threaten, we have only to remark that in our view Mr. Manners-Sutton is a person whom it will be difficult for reasonable people to libel. At the same time, if he wishes to make a fool of himself we shall be quite pleased to receive his writ." Defendant subsequently wrote to prosecutor, stating that, as no writ had followed upon the solicitor's letter, "I must conclude that the letter was a piece of bluff, and that you yourself are a coward and a poltroon, besides being a person of no principle." The plea of justification put in by defendant alleged that prosecutor was a man of low living; the details of the evidence do not admit of complete publication.</p>
               <p>The jury returned a verdict of <rs id="t19100208-56-verdict-1" type="verdictDescription">
                     <interp inst="t19100208-56-verdict-1" type="verdictCategory" value="notGuilty"/>

               <p>The Common Serjeant. You find the defendant Not guilty. Unless both sides wish it, I do not see any reason for putting the other plea. You do not wish it, I suppose, Mr. Valetta?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080105"/>
               <p>Mr. Valetta. I have nothing to say about it. I do not want any<lb/>thing to affect my client's position in the matter. I do not conceive that it is my duty to press for anything further.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant (to the jury). You find, gentlemen, for the defendant on the question of publishing defamatory matter. You find that he was Not guilty of publishing defamatory matter beyond any thing he was entitled to say, but you do not find, on the other issue, as to truth and public benefit?</p>
               <p>The Foreman. That is so.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. You put it on the first plea?</p>
               <p>The Foreman. We do.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant (to Mr, Valetta). Do you wish to make any application?</p>
               <p>Mr. Valetta. In the first instance I ask for a verdict of acquittal.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. You have got a verdict of Not guilty. I cannot do anything further.</p>
               <p>Defendant was then discharged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Valetta asked for the costs of the defence.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant said he would decline to make any order on the county that public funds should bear the costs of either the prose<lb/>cution or the defence.</p>

                  </hi> I am manager to Edgar Samuel Edgar, trading as Saqui and Lawrence, jeweller, 54, Strand. Hasel has been employed in the shop about seven years as porter; his duties were to clean windows, take out goods, and assist generally. Up to the time of this robbery complete confidence was placed in him. Constantly about the shop, he would be able to see what jewellery was in stock and what placed in the safe at night. On Saturday, January 8, I saw the place locked up in the usual way about 8 p.m. I took a quantity of jewellery from the window and placed it in the safe, together with about ₤ 70 in cash; I kept the keys in my pocket. Hasel assisted me to lock up the premises, and apparently locked all the doors securely. On January 10, arriving at 8.40 in the morning, I found a burglary had been committed, and goods to the value of ₤ 1, 200 were missing from the window; nothing had been taken from the safe.</p>

               <p>times, and gone out with Hasel; she last saw Wiltshire about a month before his arrest.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ALFRED COLLINS, </hi>E Division. On January 21, about 8.30 a.m., I went with other officers to 100, Judd Street, King's Cross, and there saw Lucy in bed. I said to him, "We are police officers, and I shall arrest you on suspicion for being concerned with other men not in custody in breaking into Saqui and Lawrence's, jewellers, 54, Strand, on January 8, and stealing jewellery value about ₤ 1, 200; you will probably be put up for identification at Bow Street." He said, "All right." Whilst dressing, he said, "How much did this information cost you; I suppose some of them have been shouting again, as usual; this is a surprise visit; how did you get in here? " I said "Over your back wall." On my commencing to search the room he said, "You won't find anything here, so it's not much good for you to put yourself to a lot of trouble: I am surprised at you people searching a place like mine; do you think I should be such a fool as to have it here for you to come and get, especially now it's getting very hot; if a job's done everybody is in the know; I don't know why I should be put to the trouble of having my place run over by you people when you like; I suppose you've come here with a warrant? " I said, "No, we don't require one." On the same day, about 5 p.m., I went to 7, Tottenham Mews, a blacksmith's shop, where I saw Wilt<lb/>shire at work. I gave him particulars of the charge, and told him that Hasel had made a statement concerning him. He said, "I know nothing about it, only what I've read in the papers; I know Hasel, he's a pal of mine; I cannot help what he says about me; I know Teddy Lucy, but I can't understand all this; the only thing I can say about it is that the part I took in the matter, if it was not straight, I was acting the innocent." Later the same evening I went to Hasel's house: his wife gave me a sealed packet, which on opening I found contained ₤ 21 in gold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Lawrie. When I went to arrest Wiltshire I found him at work. According to the deposition, I said at the police<lb/>court that Wiltshire's words were "I am absolutely innocent"; that is an error; I could not have noticed it on having the deposition read over to me. What Wiltshire did say and what I have on my note is "I was acting the innocent."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fulton. I made a thorough search of Lucy's premises and found nothing there relating to this charge.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Wiltshire works for a man named Fritzfreyer, better known as "The Dutchman."</p>
               <p>Detective-inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM GOUGH, </hi>E Division. On January 10 I received information of this robbery, and went to the premises. The robbery had evidently been affected by someone concealing them<lb/>selves on the premises (which are not occupied at night), passing to the rear, and admitting others through the back. In a cellar in the base<lb/>ment a hole had been cut in the ceiling and the floor boards pushed up, leading to an office on the ground floor, immediately at the back of the safe. Attempts had been made to break open the safe, and then a passage had been made through the outer office and into the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080107"/>
               <p>shop. A quantity of jewellery had been taken from the trays in the shop window. Exit had been made by the thieves through the door at the back (a side street). I found a jemmy, pieces of a safe<lb/>breaker, and some skeleton keys. I had Hasel kept under observa<lb/>tion. On January 21 he was brought to the station, and made a state<lb/>ment which was taken down. I then had Lucy brought in; I said, 'This man Hasel has made a statement about you, and I'll read it to you." I then read it; Lucy said, "A nice little story; he can say what he likes; you can say what you like"— —</p>
               <p>Counsel for Wiltshire and Lucy objected that the statements made by those prisoners on having Basel's statement read to them could not be admitted in evi<lb/>dence. Hasel'e statement itself was clearly not evidence, as it was not made in the presence of the other prisoners; the object of reading it to those two men must have been to elicit replies from them; the reading of it was in effect a "questioning" of prisoners under arrest, which was contrary to well estab<lb/>lished principles of law. (The authorities referred to, in the course of a pro<lb/>longed✗ argument, were, R. v. Smith, 18 Cox, p. 471; R. v. Bromhead 71 J. P., p. 103; R. v. Thompson, "Times" L.R., 1910, and 4 Cr. App. Cases, p. 46.)</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul ruled that the prosecution must get on without the statements. Examination continued. Basel's statement was also read to Wilt<lb/>shire. When formally charged prisoners made no reply. When con<lb/>fronted with Hasel the other two showed no hesitation in recognising him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Wiltshire and Lucy were put up for identi<lb/>fication on two occasions; no one identified them. I have made in<lb/>quiries about Wiltshire; he has never before been charged with any offence.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Wiltshire is known to have associated with safe<lb/>breakers and burglars. "The Dutchman, " for whom he was work<lb/>ing, is a maker of burglar's tools, and made the implement found on these premises.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, oh oath) said he had known Wiltshire for two years, and was introduced to "Ted, " whom he now knew as Lucy, by a man named Michael; he was also introduced to a man known as "The Dutchman." Witness was taken through various conversations he had had with Lucy and Michael regarding the shop, the safe, what was in the window, where the valuable jewellery was placed during the night, and particulars of the alarm bells in the shop. On the Tuesday before the burglary he met Michael and Lucy at Michael's house. They discussed the burglary that was to take place on the Saturday, and he was asked to draw up a plan of the shop, and he did so. The following night he met Michael and Lucy, and it was arranged that witness should make a signal, and Michael should go and hide himself in the cellar. Michael was to admit Lucy at the back door. On the night of the robbery, about seven o'clock, Michael and Lucy were standing opposite the shop. Witness gave a signal, and Michael crossed the road, went downstairs, and got into the cellar of the shop. Wiltshire was not there. When the shop was locked up at eight o'clock witness saw Lucy. They went into a public house, and Lucy asked if Michael was all right. Witness replied, "Yes." Lucy said he was going home to get the tools, and would come back in a taxi-cab. Lucy got in by the back-door. On Sunday witness went to Michael's house with Wiltshire and "Dutch<lb/>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080108"/>
               <p>man." Michael was out, and they went to a house in Judd Street. Lucy came to the door, and "Dutchman" spoke to him. Lucy told "Dutchman" that they had had a hard job at the safe, and the tools broke. Lucy said he expected the buyer for the things in the after<lb/>noon. "The Dutchman" mentioned that Lucy expected to get about ₤ 130 out of it. The same evening witness, Wiltshire, and "The Dutchman" went to Michael's house. Witness got ₤ 4 from Lucy, and some days later Wiltshire handed him a parcel which contained ₤ 21 in money. Witness said that his evidence to-day was identical with his statement made to Inspector Gough. While in Brixton goal Lucy had spoken to him and threatened that unless he said that he (Lucy) was not the man, he would tell the court that witness had been robbing the firm; Lucy had offered witness ₤ 5 and ₤ 1 a week for his wife while he was in prison if he would say that Lucy was not the man.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Lawrie. Wiltshire never asked me any questions about the shop or about forcing an entry, or about the safe or the electric alarms.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Fulton. I do not expect to get any benefit from the fact of my giving evidence for the prosecution. This is the first time I have done anything wrong, and I am glad to get it over. My story is the absolute truth.</p>
               <p>This concluded the case for the Crown.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Wiltshire and Lucy submitted that there was no case to go to the Jury. The evidence of the accomplice, Hasel, was entirely uncorroborated. The statements of prisoners when arrested were in no sense confessions of guilt. There being no corroboration of the accomplice, it was for the judge to direct the jury to acquit. (R. v. Farler, 8 C. and P., p. 106; R. v. Everest, 2 Cr. App. Cases, p. 130.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Roome argued that, although it was the general practice to require corro<lb/>boration of the accomplice, there was no rule of law to that effect. (Archbold, p. 390.) Here there was some corroboration, from the statements of the pri<lb/>soners themselves; the weight or value of such corroboration as there was was for the Jury. Unless the judge was satisfied that it was absolutely beyond the bounds of possibility to find corroboration, the case should go to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul said he would let the case go to the Jury as against both pri<lb/>soners.</p>
               <p>Verdict,

                     <interp inst="t19100208-57-verdict-1" type="verdictSubcategory" value="no_subcategory"/>Guilty</rs>. The Jury added that they believed Hasel's story, and hoped the Court would make his sentence as light as possible.</p>
               <p>Lucy confessed to having been convicted at North London Sessions on December 3, 1901, of larceny, after previous convictions, and sen<lb/>tenced to three years' penal servitude and two years' police supervi<lb/>sion. A number of other convictions were proved, going back to 1896. There is no record against Wiltshire, but he has for some time been the associate of thieves and burglars, and has been the medium between burglars and people in such positions as that of Hasel. Hasel has borne a blameless character until this occurrence.</p>

                  </hi>fitter, 64, Clarendon Road, Hornsey. I am a trustee and member of the Twentieth Century Loan Society. Prisoner has been treasurer and secretary of the society for many years. I have been a trustee for six or seven years; I cannot swear how long. The duties of the secretary are to receive subscriptions from members and to grant loans on the application of members, loans being granted to double the amount on members' cards, that is to say, members having deposited 10s. may borrow ₤ 1 as provided by Rule 3: "That loans be granted to members at 1s. in the ₤, which will be added to amount of loan granted. There will be a fine of one halfpenny for every 1s. left unpaid, reckoning from the first week of omission. Loans to be repaid at the rate of 1s. per week for each ₤ borrowed. Members must find a surety for a loan, and such surety and borrower to have their shares paid up to half the amount of loan before it can be granted."</p>
               <p>Judge Rentoul thought the rule very difficult to understand.</p>
               <p>Witness. 1s. is deducted from every ₤ advanced, so that a member getting nominally ₤ 1, in reality only gets 19s., but has to repay 20s. There is a fine ofƉ d. for every shilling a member is in arrear in respect of repayments. Members cannot borrow beyond double the amount they have paid in. Money in hand, after loans have been advanced, should be paid into the bank, but I do not know of any rule to that effect. In May prisoner told me he was going to pay ₤ 6 into the bank, and I told him it was about time something was paid in. He replied that he would be able to put a lot more in soon, as loans were being repaid— something to that effect. On December 16 I asked him what the dividend was going to be. It has usually been from 2s. to 3s. per share. He replied, "I am sorry; I am short." "Short! " I said, "What do you meant" He said, "I am ₤ 150 short." I said, "You are getting at me"— I did not believe it— "let the auditors see the books. You cannot be ₤ 150 wrong." He said the auditors had the cards but not the books; he was going to give them the books to<lb/>morrow morning. I spoke to him again on the Saturday. The auditors were still at work on the audit on the Saturday morning, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080110"/>
               <p>I told him he had better come along with me at dinner time and see how they were getting on, so he came along with me, and the auditors told us he was ₤ 150 short. Prisoner asked me to lend him ₤ 100. I told him I had not got it. On Saturday, at dinner time, prisoner handed over ₤ 81 19s. 9Ɖ d. in cash, of which I took charge. On Tues<lb/>day, December 21, I went to the post office with prisoner, and drew out ₤ 317. The money from the post office and the cash in hand was distributed at the sharing-out meeting. Prisoner said he did not know. where the money missing had gone; he could not account for it in any way; he was sorry, very sorry, and if he had the money he would pay it, but he had not got it. Prisoner handed in a list of six names— Mr. Erancis, Mr. Phillipp, Mr. Budd, Mr. Powlesland, Mr. Walters, and Mr. Williams. I cannot say whether any of them have ever been members of the society. I have never seen them to my knowledge. When prisoner handed me the list of names he said, " Here is my lot "; or, " that is what my lot is." I cannot for the life of me re<lb/>member the words. I said, " All right, I will see to them when I get the money from the post office." None of the people whose names are on the slip have ever applied for any money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner has been secretary and treasurer of the society since its was founded; in fact, he founded it himself. I under<lb/>took the duties of trustee six or seven years ago, but hardly at the request of prisoner. There was a kind of mutual agreement that we should have the money put into the bank. We were all desirous to make the money secure, and the post-office people would not accept our money unless there were two trustees, and I myself would not belong to the club unless we had the money banked. There was no doubt about the club being successful for the last year. The trustees did not have much to do with carrying on the affairs of the society. We were only a figure head as regards the post office. According to the rules of the society there ought to have been an audit of the accounts every half year; to my knowledge no such half-yearly audit took place. I did not think it was my duty as trustee to see that such an audit took place; I thought my duty was mainly to see to the vouchers from the post office, or I would not have taken such a job on, I can assure you, and to draw the money when it was shared out. It was not the custom to pay money into the bank in the early part of the year as the amount to be paid out was as large as that coming in. The loans varied at different parts of the year; numbers would borrow at holiday time. I do not know what was the weekly turnover of the society; the auditors will be better able to tell you that. Prisoner showed no reluctance in handing over the books. It was advantageous to the society that there should be as many loans as possible, pro<lb/>vided they were paid back properly. I cannot say that at the sharing out on December 19 members at first thought they would get nothing at all. I heard one member say he thought he was very lucky to get what he did. As a matter of fact the members actually got 19s. per share instead of 25s. This is the first time there has ever been a deficiency or shortage. I do not know whether the books of the society were destroyed at the end of each year. I have known pri<lb/>

                  </hi>painter, 44, Rectory Road, Hornsey. I am a trustee and member of the Twentieth Century Loan Society. The meetings were held at my house. I became a trustee in October last. On December 20 I went to Hornsey Post Office and signed the form. for the withdrawal of the society's money. Prisoner then asked Mr. Harrison to pay over to him ₤ 34 in. respect of the six members he was supposed to pay in for. Mr. Harrison said something to the effect that he would pay it when he got the money. At the club meeting afterwards Mr. Harrison told the members that there was so much short. Prisoner said he was sorry, but he did not know what he had done with the money. He admitted that he was ₤ 150 short.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Before becoming trustee I had been a member many years. The money on prisoner's shares was never claimed. On Saturday, December 18, the night fixed for sharing out, as members, came round I told them there would be no sharing out before Monday night. They did not seem to make any bother about it. Then the sharing-out was held on the Monday, and the sharing-out amounted to 19s. per share. Prisoner seemed "a good deal upset and surprised at the amount of the deficiency. At the meeting Mr. Harrison said, "I understand the secretary is short of money." Prisoner said he would pay all the money back in twelve months. Then he was asked; how the deficiency had arisen, and he said he did not know. I have known prisoner about 25 years, and have never known anything against his honesty before this.</p>

                  </hi>engineer, Finsbury Park. I was formerly a member of the Twentieth Century Mutual Loan Society, and on December 20 I was called in to audit the accounts, Mr. Sheldrake being the other auditor. I cannot say whether the books were audited annually, last year being the first year I had anything to do with them. The Post Office Savings Bank book (produced) shows the money paid in by the defendant. On May 12 ₤ 6 15s. 7d. was paid in. Looking at the takings book I find the total amount received up to that date was ₤ 382 15s. 7Ɖ d., and that the loans amounted to ₤ 328 9s. 6d., the difference between the gross takings and the loans being ₤ 54 6s. 1Ɖ d. Deducting the ₤ 6 15s. 7d. paid into the bank from the ₤ 54 6s. 1Ɖ d. there is left ₤ 47 10s. 6Ɖ d. I have not calculated the largest amount paid out in loans in any one week, but I think the average would be about ₤ 15. I find there is another payment into the bank on June 2 of ₤ 15, and the balance on that day, after paying out the loans was ₤ 25 5s. 11d., leaving ₤ 10 5s. 11d. in hand, which, added to the ₤ 47 10s. 6Ɖ d. gave ₤ 57 16s. 5d. On June 9 there was ₤ 6 paid in and as the balance that might have been paid in was ₤ 19, there was a further deficit of ₤ 13, which, added to the ₤ 57, made the total deficit ₤ 70. On June 30, carrying out the figures, prisoner had cash in hand.</p>

               <p>I told him he had better come along with me at dinner time and see how they were getting on, so he came along with me, and the auditors told us he was ₤ 150 short. Prisoner asked me to lend him ₤ 100. I told him I had not got it. On Saturday, at dinner time, prisoner handed over ₤ 81 19s. 9Ɖ d. in cash, of which I took charge. On Tues<lb/>day, December 21, I went to the post office with prisoner, and drew out ₤ 317. The money from the post office and the cash in hand was distributed at the sharing-out meeting. Prisoner said he did not know where the money missing had gone; he could not account for it in any way; he was sorry, very sorry, and if he had the money he would pay it, but he had not got it. Prisoner handed in a list of six names— Mr. Francis, Mr. Phillipp, Mr. Budd, Mr. Powlesland, Mr. Walters, and Mr. Williams. I cannot say whether any of them have ever been members of the society. I have never seen them to my knowledge. When prisoner handed me the list of names he said, " Here is my lot "; or, " that is what my lot is." I cannot for the life of me re<lb/>member the words. I said, " All right, I will see to them when I get the money from the post office." None of the people whose names are on the slip have ever applied for any money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner has been secretary and treasurer of the society since its was founded; in fact, he founded it himself. I under<lb/>took the duties of trustee six or seven years ago, but hardly at the request of prisoner. There was a kind of mutual agreement that we should have the money put into the bank. We were all desirous to make the money secure, and the post-office people would not accept our money unless there were two trustees, and I myself would not belong to the club unless we had the money banked. There was no doubt about the club being successful for the last year. The trustees did not have much to do with carrying on the affairs of the society. We were only a figure head as regards the post office. According to the rules of the society there ought to have been an audit of the accounts every half year; to my knowledge no such half-yearly audit took place. I did not think it was my duty as trustee to see that such an audit took place; I thought my duty was mainly to see to the vouchers from the post office, or I would not have taken such a job on, I can assure you, and to draw the money when it was shared out. It was not the custom to pay money into the bank in the early part of the year as the amount to be paid out was as large as that coming in.

He said he had not got his books and could not make them out. Next day, when I went again, he said, "I am about £150 out." On December 18 I went to Mr. Alpe's house, and prisoner handed over ₤ 81 19s. 9Ɖ d. I said to him, " Frank, what have you done with the money? " He said, " I do not know." I saw the slip of paper with six names on it. I do not know any of them as members of the society. I assisted Mr. Alpe in the audit this year. I think the number of cards miss<lb/>ing was 41. In former years the number of cards missing has only been one or two, representing bad debts. There has never been cards missing belonging to people who had a right to take part in the shar<lb/>ing out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. In former years the accounts have been abso<lb/>lutely right. Prisoner seemed very much upset. I then offered to take the cards home and go through them.

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I started working for the Westinghouse Company in 1890, when I was 21 years of age, at 24s. weekly, and I am now receiving 36s. Previously to that I was employed for four years on the Great Northern Railway. Previously I was for about four years in a dairy and for about two years with a Mr. Wilson, linen draper, of Crouch End. I came to start the Twentieth Century Loan Society through having been secretary of another one. Then another secretary was elected, and in the following year several of the members asked me to start one on my own account. That occurred 11 or 12 years ago. There were about 30 members to start with, but the number increased every year, and last year the number Was 160 or 170. I had entire charge of the money, and received as remuneration 2d. per share per quarter, and I suppose that in a year my commission would amount to about ₤ 8. The work involved a good deal of time and trouble. For the first three or four years I worked the club myself; then trustees were appointed. The club was growing very much, and I did not like to have the whole responsibility on my shoulders, so I asked Mr. Harrison and a brother of mine to become trustees. My brother was only trustee for one year, and then Mr. Sercombe was appointed and. remained trustee until 1908, when he died, and Mr. Watts became trustee. I kept all the books, and de<lb/>stroyed them at the end of the year, when the society started afresh. The audit took place every year at Christmas time, though according to the rules it should have been half yearly. With regard to the six names they represented members who had fallen out of the club, whose shares I took up myself. I used to pay in every week the money in respect of the shares the same as anybody else, and make loans on the shares and repay the loans. I treated myself as seven men. Of coarse I could not have them all in my own name, as I was only allowed to have six shares according to the rules. I did not issue,, cards in respect of the six names. I paid on the whole lot about a guinea a week. I had other sources of income besides my wages. I used to lend out money to my shop mates, and so I was able to take up the shares. Every member ought to have had a card. With regard to the 41 found to be missing they either belonged to members who had left the club or were not given up at Christmas time. I kept the cards for some of the members. The card was nothing more than a receipt for the money paid in. I borrowed on the six names perhaps £₤ 50 or ₤ 60. It was to the advantage of the society to have as many loans as possible, as the more loans the greater the amount of interest and the larger the division at the end of the year. I started using other names than my own about five or six years ago. I started</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080116"/>
               <p>lending money perhaps 10 or 11 years ago. I have got, perhaps, ₤ 100 out on loan now, and I am willing to assign that money to the trustees, and have offered to do so. I am quite willing to pay every halfpenny back, but it will take a long time. I have also lent money privately to members of the society, 10 or 12. They have not paid me on account of my being short. I estimate the bad debts last year at about ₤ 12. My custom in regard to paying money into the bank was to keep it in hand till the end of the year. I think I have gener<lb/>ally begun to pay in about August. There was no rule as to paying money into the bank. I used to receive about ₤ 20 a week, and some<lb/>times the loans more than balanced that, so it was necessary to have money in hand, and, in fact, part of the year I used to lend the club money of my own. Members had to be clear on their cards or else they would be fined 3d. Members were sometimes short, and I used to fine them. At the end of the year they had to clear all the cards up or they had no dividend. Members who were short at the end of the year used sometimes to ask me to square the cards, so that they might get the full share out; then they owed me the money instead of owing it to the club. The money was kept in a cash box in a drawer, and both were locked. I never knew what would be required beforehand, so it was necessary to keep money in hand. I cannot account at all for the shortage. At first I made the deficiency ₤ 166. I did not last year spend more money than usual. I can honestly say I did not steal this money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I commenced to make an allowance to my wife of 15s. per week on February 13, 1909, out of my wages. My only other source of income is the interest on the money lent to my shop mates. I had sometimes ₤ 4 or ₤ 5 a week coming in, and when I work overtime I get more. The money I lent has been saved from my earn<lb/>ings. I am not registered as a money lender, and am not aware that a person who lends out money has to be registered. The six names were fictitious, and were really the names of members of my own family. I do not accept the suggestion that I have used the money of the society for my own purposes. I do not consider that ₤ 88 was a large amount to have in hand, but no doubt it would have been safer to put ₤ 50 or ₤ 60 into the bank.</p>

                  </hi>, manager, Fulham branch, English Record Com<lb/>pany, 653, Fulham Road. I engaged prisoner on December 16; his duties were to canvass for orders for machines. Our method of doing business is to sell to a member of the public five records for 12s. 6d., the customer binding himself to buy one record a week till the number of 48 is reached, and after that time the machine becomes the property of the buyer, so that the machine is thrown in. On every sale prisoner made he was to receive 5s. commission and his salary was 12s. per week. Out of the 12s. 6d. received he would deduct his 5s. commis<lb/>sion and hand over 7s. 6d. He would only have one machine at a tune. As soon as he brought in the money for that he would get another one. On December 22 prisoner took out a machine and five records and came back with an order in the name of Gale, 36, Steven<lb/>dale Road. Thinking it was a bona fide transaction, I gave him another machine. He 'returned on the same date with another order in the name of Bert Hannaford, 20, Queen Street, Hammersmith, and I gave him another machine. On December 28 he came in with another order in the name of Palmer, 73, Tynemouth Street, Wandsworth Bridge Road. On December 30 he came in with a bona fide order from a customer of the name of Roberts. After the 30th I missed him. I made inquiries and sent out a man several times. I went to the addresses given on the three orders of Gale, Hannaford, and Palmer, but there were no such people to be found there. When I. next saw prisoner I asked him about this and he offered to go round with me and show me that what he had said was correct. He took me to people from whom he had really got orders. Then I said, " Where are the others? " Then he said he would look them up himself, and I promised that if he found them out I would reinstate him, He was not discharged, but did not come to the office any more. Prisoner knew the routine of the office and the hour when I went out to lunch. On January 11, after my return, I found an order in the name of A. Jenkins, dairyman, 72, Branfort Street, Chelsea, and also that one of the machines had gone. I went to verify that order the same day and found the order was bogus.</p>
               <p>Detective-sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES HANCOCK, </hi>V. Division. I made in<lb/>quiries regarding Samuel Gale, fishmonger, 36, Stevendale Road. No such person lived there, there was no fishmonger's business, and no ecrophone had been delivered at that address. I applied to the other addresses, with the same result. I arrested prisoner on December 29 at Walham Green Police Station. I told him I was a police-officer and read the warrant to him. He replied, " Yes; I understand. You can do your worst." When charged he made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>(prisoner, on oath). I took a machine out and five records and canvassed for orders from door to door or from shop to shop, as the case might be. I met Gale and got into conversation with him and gave him one of my cards and told him he could have a machine free of all charge. So he said, " What do you mean by free of all charge. I would not mind having one free of all charge." Then I told him he could have one and five records for 12s. 6d. He agreed to the terms and put his name down on the contract as " Sam. Gale, " and his occupation as "fishmonger." He gave me 12s. 6d. and I took the order, relying upon it being straightforward, and I went to his address with the machine. With regard to Hannaford, I met him in the " Greyhound " public-house, Fulham Road. We had a drink and got into conversation and I told him my business and took an order off him. I do not suppose that if I had not been drink<lb/>ing I should have taken an order of! him in a public-house. He paid me the 12s. 6d. and I let him have the machine and went back to the shop. With regard to Palmer, of Teignmouth Street, Wandsworth Bridge Road, I went to his house. We have circulars to distribute round the houses and then we go back to see whether the parties would like a machine, and when I knocked at the door this party entertained it and I took his order. With regard to Jenkins, of Beaufort Street, I took his order in a coffee shop and went round with him to his house to see if it was the correct address; then I left the machine there and came out again.</p>
               <p>To the jury: I had never seen any of these people before in my life. I have seen one of them since.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191002080119"/>
               <p>Cross-examined: I took 16 orders altogether. As to whether one<lb/>fourth of them were absolute frauds, the people have defrauded me and got me in this position. I heard Mr. Misener say this afternoon I was to make inquiries as to whether the people to whom I sold these things were responsible people, but I deny that he ever told me so. I had never seen Bert Hannaford before. I saw Gale at his private house. I never inquired whether he was a fishmonger. I went to Jenkins' address. No dairy business was carried on there; there was no shop. I do not know the witness Ashworth. I know Nicholls. I did not sell him two pawn tickets; he is lying on purpose. The machine I got when I came in with the Jenkins' order is in Archell Road, Ful<lb/>ham. I have not sold it. I have got the machine and am holding it for my wages. I told the governor he could have it when he paid me my wages. I have borrowed 5s. on that machine. I had other machines after I went with the governor to find these addresses. One was Miss Ada Roberts, of 38, Mill Hill Road, and another was Mr. Rose. (Prisoner was then asked to write the words " one disc talking machine " for the purpose of comparison with his receipts.)</p>
