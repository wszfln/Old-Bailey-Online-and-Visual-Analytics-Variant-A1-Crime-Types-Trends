Fowler—among the 122 there were about twenty different names altogether—I found also a paint-pot with two colours, a dark and a drab colour, and a brush—there was nothing else in the cellar—I did not see the prisoner till October 7th—I had made every inquiry since September 21st—on October 7th a communication was made to the police, and the prisoner came to the Police-station in company with a solicitor's clerk—I said to the prisoner, "Is your name Isaac Goldsmith?"—he said, "No, Griszard"—I said, "Do you live at 27, White Lion Street?"—he said, "No, 29"—I said, "Do you rent the cellars at 5, Sandys Street?"—he said, "Yes, and I pay 1s. 6d. a week for them"—I said, "On 26th September I obtained a search warrant to search these cellars, and there I found 122 baskets, the greater part of them with names on them, some painted out"—some names were painted out—I said, "How did you become possessed of them?"—he said, "I bought them"—I said, "How much did you pay for each basket?"—he said, "All prices"—I said, "It is usual when you buy fruit in baskets to have metal tickets; have you any?"—he said, "No, I bought them all empty; I am a basket dealer"—I said, "Anything else?"—he said, "Jewellery"—I said, "Brummagem?"—lasted him previously whom he bought the baskets from, and he made no answer—after he was in custody I saw Langham, one of Pink's carmen—he made a statement in my presence and that of the manager, Mr. Fowler, at Pink's place—he was arrested, brought before the Magistrate, remanded, and discharged—the prisoner was charged by Fowler, who identified some of the baskets—the name was painted out on one basket with paint of the same colour as that in the paint pot—I knew on 21st, when I went to keep observation, that there were baskets in the cellars—I had no knowledge of the removal by the two vans—about twenty baskets in the cellar had the names painted out—you cannot trace the name at all now—the paint was dry when I saw it; it would dry in a very short time.</p>

I am the wife of Frederick Wilkinson, and live in the basement at 8, Rick ford Street, Shepherd's Bush—the prisoner is our landlady's son, and lives in the same house as we do—about eleven p.m. on the 29th October, as soon as I and my husband came in, the prisoner, who was at the top of the stairs, began to use abusive language—my husband told him he was at home, and if he was a man to come down—I went in my room, and my husband was at our door when the prisoner came in without any boots on, with a long dark weapon in his hand, and he struck my husband down, and stunned him for a moment—then he came into my room and started knocking me about the head and face, with his fists, I believe—my husband got up and knocked him down, and hit him, and then let him go, and the prisoner went upstairs—my husband went out to see if he could get a policeman to stop the noise, and I went into the passage, and the prisoner came down and stabbed me in the left breast; I did not see what it was with—he then rushed into my room, and I thought he had gone to my baby, and I went into the area to ask the policeman to make haste—when the policeman came in the place was in darkness, as the prisoner had thrown the lamp, which I had left alight, into the grate—I lost my senses for about five minutes; all I cannot remember is being carried from the street to bed; I remember everything else; I did not fall at all—after I was in bed the doctor came to see me.</p>

               <p>"Yes"—I said, "Will you come to the station with me?"—he said, "Yes; I know what it is about; it is about a watch I bought at Raffle's. Music-hall for 15s.; I paid him 10s., and I was to give him the other 5s. on Monday"—he was placed with five or six others, and Davidge identified him—he then said, "If you get my brother Mathew you will have the right man; he brought the watch to me to get rid of.

I am a provision merchant, of 15, King Street, Smithfield—on Saturday, 3rd December, I was at my shop door when Aldridge, a man in my employment, and another porter brought two large and one small cases of rabbits into my warehouse—while the rabbits were there the prisoners came in, and asked if I would sell the rabbits—I said I did not think they could give the price for them—I ordered two of the cases to be taken to the back of the store down the yard—Henry Guyon asked me if I would sell the remaining case—I said, "I don't know that you would give me enough"—he bid me 2s. 8d. a skin—I would not take it—they passed out of the warehouse—I went away for three quarters of an hour to keep an appointment—the prisoners followed me, and said, "Are you going to take our price?"—I said, "No; run away, we are very busy; I won't sell you the goods"—I did not see the prisoners come in after that—at five o'clock a customer came in, and I showed him one case, and said, "I have two more in the yard"—he said he would look at them, and we went into the yard, and found only one case there; we missed the other case and a small truck with which we used to take the cases down the yard—the case was a small one, containing about forty-eight fresh-skinned rabbits—the carman who had put the rabbits down the yard said something to me, and after inquiring as to where the case was I went to Exmouth Street, and saw the two prisoners selling rabbits at a stall about twelve minutes' drive from my shop—I swear those rabbits were my property—I can give reasons for identifying them—I said to the prisoners, "Good evening; how is trade?"—they did not answer, but simply looked down—all they said was fivepence a lb.—I did not ask anything; I gave them into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoners first came to my shop about three, and afterwards at four, I think—I quoted them no price—the wholesale price that day was sixpence per lb.—I next saw them after four o'clock, at the stall at half-past seven—I missed the rabbits a little before five—I don't remember if I said before the Magistrate that it was half-past five—I don't know if there are hundreds of costermongers engaged in selling rabbits in this neighbourhood; our customers are not costermongers—there are tradesmen in the neighbourhood selling rabbits—I don't know of any other stalls there—the prisoners' was the only stall I saw rabbits on—I don't know that several people sell rabbits in that street—the weight of the forty-eight rabbits would be about 140 lbs.—they were all skinned Ostend rabbits—the consignments of Ostend rabbits coming to London average about 200 tons a week, I believe—there is a difference in the rabbits according to the people who kill and skin them—the man who consigns to me begins to skin at the hind feet; some people begin at the belly—I don't say that my consignor is the only man who begins at the feet; it is not an unusual thing—there are five details in my consignments which distinguish them; the ears are cut off, not very close to the head; the throat, in killing the rabbit, is not cut across, but only punctured—the case of rabbits which was stolen was opened in my yard by me, and inspected for another customer; and two or three rabbits had been taken out to sample them—no other person besides my consignor would dress rabbits exactly in the same way.

I am a carman to Mr. Beer—on 3rd December I took a case of rabbits from the warehouse down the yard at the back of the shop—after that I went into a public-house, where I saw the two prisoners—Henry Guyon said to me, "Have you sold out?"—I said "No" and asked him what the governor was going to charge him for them—he said, "3s. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I offered him 2s. 8d."—John Guyon said, "I should like to <hi rend="italic">pinch</hi> a case of rabbits"—I laughed, drank up, and went out—afterwards I drove up to their stall with one of our travellers—he recognised the rabbits.</p>

                  </hi>. I practise as a surgeon at 2, Spital Square—on the night of 2nd December I was called to Commercial Street Station, and there saw the prosecutrix—she was suffering from an incised wound in the throat, which had turned back a flap of skin about an inch and a half in length, and about a quarter of an inch thick—the width of the wound was about two inches—there was another and a smaller wound in the neck, about half an inch long, just through the skin, and a wound about three-quarters of an inch long and a quarter of an inch deep across the inner side of her thumb—the wounds were such as might have been caused by this razor—I was shown the blade at the station—there appeared to be recent blood-stains upon it—I do not think the more serious wound would be likely to be caused by struggling for the razor—the cut was from above downwards—I saw a surface wound on the prisoner's finger—his hands were perfectly steady, and he seemed perfectly calm—I had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I examined him before he was charged—I did not notice a nervous look in his eyes—the prosecutrix's wounds are now almost healed—if the wound in the throat had been caused in a struggle, I think it would have been more jagged; this was a clean wound—if in a struggle the edge of the razor had been pushed, it might have been</p>

               <p>farmer, of Nana Farm, Yeading, six miles from Uxbridge—on Sunday, November 20th, about 10.20 a.m., I was in the meadows near Mr. Early's house, watching to keep the poachers off, and saw three men, of whom the prisoner was one—I went and asked him what he was doing—he said he was only there to shoot starlings, and if I did not like it he would shoot me—he had a double-barrelled gun, and one of the others had a gun—I was not armed, not even with a stick—he put the gun to his shoulder and fired; it was close to my face—I could see the end of the barrel—I put my head on one side, and he just missed the side of my head; it almost touched my right ear—he struck me at the same time with the barrel end of the gun—the firing stopped my hearing—the gun was loaded; I heard the shot rattle in the trees behind me—I was knocked down—they went on about twenty-yards, and as soon as I recovered I followed them to the Grand Junction Canal, about 500 yards—he pulled off his coat, laid his gun on it, and said he would give me what I came for—he tried to throw me into the canal, but could not, and we all three went down together—I then went to Constable Brown's house a mile off; he was in bed—I called him up, but he could not find them—I went to the station, and reported it to Sergeant Payne—on the next Tuesday, the 22nd, I saw the prisoner at Fulham Gasworks—he was brought into the office, and I identified him from others; he was in his working clothes, and two more of the men were dressed the same—I could have recognised them if they had been clean, but their faces were very black; I have no doubt the prisoner is the man—I should know the gun again; it had two pieces of copper on the side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I live in Mr. Early's house, and am engaged as gamekeeper on Sundays—I have no gamekeeper's licence; I am not allowed to carry a gun—there is a good bit of game on the land, and poachers are about—there is a path along the bottom of the field by the canal where there is no hedge—there is no path but that one—the men were a hundred yards from the cattle track—there is a track part of the way across the fields towards Yeading, but that is never used by people—there are two fields, one is a small one—there is no footpath in the held where I first saw them, but they went into the field where there is a footpath at the bottom—I did not know Mrs. Dummer till she was called by the prosecution at Uxbridge—the path might be used without my knowledge—the path by the canal is not much frequented on Sundays, but at times there are people shooting or enjoying themselves there—they were the only three people that day—I did not see any game killed, nor was I attracted by a shot before I went up—no angry words took place before he fired at me—the clump of trees against which the shot rattled was at the side of the field—Pearce and I were about ten yards from the clump of trees—the shots never hit the trees which were close; they hit the trees in the hedge, forty yards off, and Sergeant Payne found them—I did not point out a willow tree to him—a second might have elapsed between the shot and the blow—he did not punch me; he hit me on my shoulder with the barrels of the gun, such a terrific blow that I was felled to the ground—after he struck me he said did I think I had got a country <hi rend="italic">mug</hi> to deal with—I remember that, although I was stunned; it was when I was following him, just before he got to the canal—I have no doubt it was Pearce said that</p>

               <p>—I only went down on my hands and knees—the place was very muddy; I thought he was a dangerous character, but though I was unarmed I followed him—when I came to the stile the three were together; two went over the stile, and Pearce pulled off his coat, laid his gun on it, and laid hold of me—there was no conversation then—my right arm was quite numbed from the blow—the two men did not help him to throw me into the canal, or help me—the struggle was a very violent one—it was a wrestling match—he did not strike me then or throw me down, but he did his best—the others had got about forty yards over the stile, and the three walked away together—I told Sergeant Payne that the prisoner struck me on my right shoulder—I have seen labouring men shooting small birds about there on Sundays—I did not see the boy Biddle till after the three men had gone—they were in sight, but some considerable distance over the canal, where they shot a starling—the boy was on the towing-path—he was not in sight at the time of the struggle by the canal—I have made five charges against men for poaching on this property during the three years I have been in Mr. Early's service, and four of the men have been convicted—Constable-Brown made a charge against a man named Dowden, and I was a witness—the summons was withdrawn—I brought a charge against a man named Stephens, and the charge was dismissed—I have weekly pay, and something extra for Sunday duty for looking after the game—I never observed poachers watching me—I only get my expenses for attending the Police-court—I receive nothing special for arresting these men—Brown lives there on purpose to be handy—he is one of the Metropolitan police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There were four men in a field, and Brown said that Dowden was one—a summons was granted, and we found it was not Dowden, and the summons was withdrawn—I was there to say that it was not Dowden, but it did not go so far as that.</p>

I am a labourer at Fulham Gasworks—on Sunday, November 20th, I went out to shoot small birds with Langton and Pearce—Langton shot a bird—I do not think it was picked up—Hills came up and asked what business we had there—I told him we were not doing any harm; we were going to shoot some small birds such as starlings—he said he wanted our names and addresses and he should summon us—Pearce did not threaten him—it is not true that Pearce shot at him—no shot was fired after Hills came on the scene—Pearce threatened to hit Hills when he demanded</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The gun with copper on it belongs to Langton; the Magistrates' clerk made a mistake—Pearce had the gun which has not got the copper—Pearce pulled his jacket off, and threatened to punch Hills' head—no gun was fired after Hill came up; he came up ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the gun was fired.</p>

Hunter"—the tenancy continued till 29th September, when this new agreement was entered into: "I hereby agree to rent from you from 29th September, 1892, the premises, No. 16, at the monthly rental of £4 3s. 4d.," signed by Fearoz—that is one room in the same building.</p>

Duncan Hunter"—he said, "That is me"—I took him to the John Street Police-station, Edgware Road, and then I went to 111, Marylebone Road—in the first floor front I found a Gladstone bag with many hundred documents in it—also a letter-book—I returned to the Police-station, and read the warrant to the prisoner—he said, "It is a lie; I can meet the case"—he was then charged, and said the same, and on him were found seven shillings in silver, a card-case, four bills of exchange, and three duplicates. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>,)—I went to 11, Queen Victoria Street, where I saw "Hunter and Co." on the door and "Jehanger" in the corner—I was refused admittance—Reynolds said they did not recognise Hunter as a tenant—I afterwards got a summons for the other prisoner, dated 1st October—I made several calls at 11, Queen Victoria Street, and at his private address, where I ultimately left it.</p>

For your information we may mention that our Mr. Framgee has been in the North of England for the last twelve days," etc—I instructed my solicitors, Buller and Co., to issue a writ in the Birmingham Division of the High Court—it was sent up to Dr. Arnold, in London, for service—it was not served—I stated erroneously at the Police-court that it was served—the morning it was taken for service was the day after the landlord had cleared out the place for rent on the bankruptcy—I got information from the newspapers, and then applied to the Official Receiver in London, but he could not admit the claim—I had no notice of the bankruptcy—Framgee was adjudicated, I think, on 4th June, 1891.</p>

L. and Co.," or something like that, and then, at the corner, "J changer"—I saw Jehanger—I said "Good morning," and held out my hand, and very nice indeed he was—Mr. Hunter was not there, but he said Hunter wanted to see me, and instructed a man to take me to 111, Marylebone Road, which he did—I went to the bedroom, where Hunter was in bed—he was very poorly, and covered all round his head and throat, and could hardly speak—I was sorry for the fellow, for he had always been very nice, and I said, "I am not going to do any business with you in that state; I will go and do it with Jehanger"—he made a motion and got his breath, after a cordial from his nurse, and said he would talk the business over in bed, which he did, in a semi-whisper—it was on the subject of the non-remittance of the £119 worth of goods—he said being ill it had upset the business; in fact, that the items given in were too small to be passed through the bank, but could be included in the lots I had—a letter of credit was eventually resolved upon—I did not know what a letter of credit meant at that particular time—I said, "Are you sure that the letter of credit you have got is sufficient to cover what has already been sent, and those that are being shipped by the <hi rend="italic">City of Perth?"</hi> and in the presence of the man he said, "Yes; but it will take nearly the whole"—I understood a letter of credit to be a banker's draft practically, and expected it was available—I pressed very much for a means of giving notice to my friends—he said as soon as he got the documents he should be able to give me the whole of the money—I said, "You had better give me cheques, falling due on Saturday, so that I can pay them away; for I am going away to Wales, and have instructed my clients that the money would be forthcoming at the time stated, and I want to leave the cheques, so that things may be settled"—he said, "We do not need a banking account; we send our things right away to the people who have bought the goods"—I thought that rather strange, and said I must have something I could draw the cheques against—then I suggested he should give me an acceptance to fall due on Saturday—I am speaking now of the interview on the Monday—the man was there all the time, so that he could hear what was said, and I took it down to Jehanger to carry it out, for he was too weak to go over it again—Jehanger was to arrange everything being carried out, and the documents were to be completed and handed over the next day—I called the next day, and found him a lot better—Jehanger produced blank acceptances, and Hunter said, "Give them to Mr. Merrell and let him fill them up," which I did—you notice I made one or two little erasures—these two papers, "G" and "H," were the stamped papers which I wrote on, one for £119 and the other for £300 12s. 11d.—Hunter wrote the acceptance across—I was ignorant of the fact that three days' grace applied to seven-day bills—they did not correct me—Hunter passed them over to Jehanger to look at, and then passed them over to me—the bills were dishonoured, and I did not get any money out of them—I had got this document ready to hand over when everything was satisfactory, so that when I got this acceptance I handed this over—I afterwards found this telegram at Corporation</p>

You have got me into a hole in this matter You know my position; you have obtained these goods on the ground that you were going to pay, and I have no statement, only what you made to me. My friends know I was not possessed of capital, and I want something that will clear me; it is not my fault this has occurred"—he said, "I will walk down to Euston, and write direct, so that you may get it on Monday morning"—on Monday morning I thought, perhaps, he had missed the post, and I did not see my creditors about it, but I had a telegram on Monday, saying, "Thought advisable to interview endorsees before writing—I thought that was plausible enough, but on Tuesday morning I did not get the letter, and then I wired, and went up by the 12.40 train and found him in bed at Marylebone Road—he said he had got cold going out on Saturday and was not able to get the acceptance—I said, "What are you going to do in this matter?"—he said, "He has robbed me, and I am going to take proceedings against him, and am making out an account now; he has done me for £500, and I am going to charge him"—I said, "It does not matter to me what you do; these goods I intend having back, or the money; if you have been robbed, it has nothing to do with me; I shall have to proceed against both of you."—they put me off and off until I gave it over, and saw it was no use—on the Tuesday night I said, "You had better give me a document to the bank stating what you are telling me now, and also give me the transfer order back again"—so I got those two documents and went to the Chartered Mercantile Bank accordingly—I believe he had been there—he gave me all information—I said, "Where does Jehanger live?"—so he wrote it down—I said, "Give me his full name"—he gave me the full name, "Jehanger Framgee," somewhere—he said he lived up at the West-end—I said "You had better show me how to get at it,"—and he drew a plan on this paper, and his address—I saw an official of the bank—he said they would advise Jehanger and Co.—the rest was by correspondence—I consulted Mr. Barnard, solicitor, and obtained warrants from Mr. Hopkins, at Marylebone Police-court, against Hunter and Jehanger.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 123, Manor Place, Walworth—about one o'clock a.m. on 2nd December I was walking home from Holborn towards Ludgate Circus, and as I crossed from St. Bride's Street I was seized by the throat and thrown to the ground; my eyes were covered; I felt half stunned—I felt a hand searching my trousers pockets; there was nothing there—I struggled as much as I could, and called "Help" twice—my mouth was violently covered, so that I could call no more; but presently I was released, and as I got up I saw Sergeant Stevens holding one of the prisoners on the ground, and another constable bringing back the other—I lost nothing; they had not time—my throat was very sore, and my face was scratched—I could scarcely eat for a week.</p>

I live at 186, Gloucester Road, Regent's Park—I lived with the prisoner for seven years before this happened—at 11.10 on 25th November I went into the Pembroke public-house, Gloucester Road, for a glass of beer—the prisoner was sitting against the bar—he asked me to treat him—I said I had no money—he repeated the question, and I repeated my answer—I had spoken to no one in. the public-house before that—a young woman came up to the door with a violin and began to sing—I left my beer on the counter, and turned my back to the counter to listen, and about two minutes afterwards I felt the prisoner's arm round my neck, and then I felt a knife, and I screamed out, "My God! he has got a knife.

I am manager to the London and Provincial Licensed Victuallers' Employment Association, 319, Strand—the object of the association is to obtain places for men in the licensed victuallers' trade—they apply to us and give references, and if they are satisfactory we issue a certificate of character—on 22nd August the prisoner, who gave the name of Frederick Knight, came and gave us particulars from which we filled up this form of application—the prisoner signed it in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that Knight required a situation as barman; that his last employer was H. Hodson, with whom he had been for seven months; and gave as his address the Railway Hotel, Sudbury, and</hi> 24, <hi rend="italic">Homestead Terrace</hi>)—24, Homestead Terrace, was not put on at first, but afterwards—we wrote to the Railway Hotel, Sudbury, and got no answer; and then the prisoner came three days afterwards and asked if we had a place for him—I told him I had not got his reference, and could not do anything for him—he told us Mr. Hodson had sold the Railway Hotel, Sudbury, and was now living at 24, Homestead Terrace, the address I wrote on the paper—we then wrote to 24, Homestead Terrace, and received this reply (<hi rend="italic">This was signed Hodson, and stated that F. Knight had been in his employment seven months, and that he had always found him an honest, sober, and industrious barman, and a good cellar man</hi>)—I think that letter is written by the same hand as that which signed the application form—the prisoner called shortly after the letter was received—my clerk, Frank Collins, saw him, and issued this certificate of character to him on this letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Burlington Villas, Strood, Kent—on the 1st June, 1891,1 saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle:</hi> "Man, respectable, steady, able to take charge of offices and act as messenger; permanency. Would be required to invest fifty pounds. Good wages.—Mr. K., care of Army Agency, 17, Finsbury Pavement, E. C."—I went to Finsbury Pavement that same day—I first saw Mr. Leonard, and afterwards the prisoner—I said I had come in answer to the advertisement—he said he had the engaging of a clerk or messenger, that he was the manager of Bryant's Agency Company, that I should have to take care of the offices at 55 and 56, Chancery Lane, to receive any persons that called, take in letters, and do</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189212120070"/>
               <p>confidential work; that I must look only to him, that he was the factotum, and there was no one else to consider—he asked if I could pay the security down—I said I could pay some of it down and the remainder in a few days—he said it was required because I should be entrusted with moneys and various things—he said the salary would be thirty shillings a week, the office hours ten to four, on Saturdays. ten to one—I took till next day to consider it, and then came back with my niece—I saw him and wrote him a cheque for £29 14s., which was all I had in the bank at the time, and gave him six shillings in cash—I got this receipt: "Bryant's Agency Company.—Received of Thomas Bassett £30, on account of an investment of £50 in Bryant's Agency Company.—H. <hi rend="smallCaps">MOSTYN</hi>, Manager"—I knew the prisoner by the name of Henry Mostyn—he was to let me know when I should begin my duties—I received this letter, dated 19th June (<hi rend="italic">This was headed "Army and Navy Agency Company; managers, T. Leonard and R. J. Baker" and requested him to call next day at eleven</hi>)—on 20th June I went there and saw the prisoner, who asked for the rest of the deposit, and to the best of my recollection I gave him a promissory note for it—the note is in my writing—I. began my duties on the Wednesday—I signed this agreement (<hi rend="italic">This purported to be signed by Henry Mostyn, manager, and the witness; by it, in consequence of the advance, the prisoner agreed to take the witness into his employment at thirty shillings a week. Either party could terminate the agreement by a month's notice, when the</hi> £50 <hi rend="italic">advance would be returned in full with interest, and if any misunderstanding arose it was to be decided by an arbitrator</hi>)—the cost of the agreement was £1 or £1 1s.—we each paid half—I paid 10s. 6d. or 10s.—on the following day I received this letter, headed "Bryant's Agency Company, 55 and 56, Chancery Lane"(<hi rend="italic">This asked him to attend there on Wednesday to take charge of the office and commence his duties</hi>)—I went on the Wednesday—the office was two rooms on the ground floor—the outer office was supposed to be mine, the inner was the prisoner's; they both opened into the passage—I attended there for a month—many persons called—I was not supposed to know what they called about—a few questions were asked me, but my instructions were to know nothing and divulge nothing—nobody was at home there but the prisoner—no account-books were kept—I saw no press letter-books—the correspondence was done in Mr. Mostyn's room; I don't know what it was about—I saw many circulars similar to this; I was employed in writing many of them (<hi rend="italic">One of these was read; it was to the effect that a certain district in South Africa was rich in minerals, and that a man with</hi> £200 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> £800 <hi rend="italic">capital could secure a fortune in a few years</hi>)—I might have posted some of them; I don't know—I received my salary for two weeks, but nothing more—the prisoner asked me to lend him eighteen pence, and on another occasion two shillings—I paid my promissory note—on 15th July the prisoner said I might have a holiday—I went away, and next day when I returned I found a notice on the door, "1.30," by which I understood that the prisoner would be there at that time—I went at 1.30 and the notice was still there, and I did not see the prisoner that day—the office was not open, and I could not get in with my key—I next saw the prisoner on 21st July, in Holborn—I had had a communication made to me, and I asked him about the office being closed—he told me he was going to open again in a few days in another name, and he should want me and must have me,</p>

               <p>that I suited him admirably—I asked him about the £50—he said he would get it for me and also my wages—I kept going to the office for several days, and at last I managed to get in, and I found all the furniture was gone—all I found was an umbrella of mine and an alpaca coat—when I parted with my money I believed the statements he made, and thought it was quite a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> affair, and that there was work for me to do—I was only trusted with very small amounts, to go and purchase the <hi rend="italic">Daily Graphic and</hi> get a few stamps—I believe 1s. was the only sum I was trusted with by the prisoner—I did not receive back my 1s. 6d. or 2s., and I only received back on two occasions, that I remember, the small amounts I had to pay and receive back at the end of the week.</p>

Get out of my office, or I will get someone to put you out"—I went out—I met Ufton, and we had a conversation together, and went to the Detective Office, Old Jewry—when I gave the prisoner the £2 I believed it was a genuine business—if I had had the £20 I should have parted with it—I was quite confident that he had employment to give me—I believed he was manager of this Californian association.</p>

I am a dairyman, of Hambledon, Rutlandshire—on 3rd October I saw an advertisement—I replied to it two or three days after—I got a postcard in answer, and called on 10th October at 44, Finsbury Pavement, and saw the prisoner, who asked for the postcard I had received, and I gave it to him—I saw on the door the name, "Californian Wine Growers. Victor Wintor, manager. Ground floor"—I told the prisoner why I had come—he said he wished me to collect accounts, go to the Customs House, take messages, and have charge of the call-book during his absence—he said the business was that of a Californian wine and dried fruits agency—he asked me the wages—I said 35s.—he said it was too much; he would give 30s. to start, and 33s. later on in a few weeks—I was in a situation at the time, which I had given notice to leave at the end of the month—I told him that—she said he did not wish to take me away before the time; but I was to go back and see him at the earliest time I was at liberty—I saw him two days afterwards, on 12th October, and told him I could be at liberty at his convenience—he said very well, he would take me—he did not think he should require any deposit of money, as I looked so respectable—I told him I could get a security almost to any amount up to £100—he said he had made inquiries, and no doubt I could—I told him I had an uncle in a good position—I next saw him on 15th October—he told me he had seen his employers upon the subject, and he should require £10 security, because I should have to go into the Customs House with money—afterwards I saw an agreement—he said it had cost him half a guinea, and I was to pay half—I paid him 5s. 3d.—then there was no stamp on it—on the Thursday following he told me he should require me to go to work, and he should require some deposit—on Tuesday, 18th October, I went and paid him £2 10s., and he gave me this receipt—he said it was a very small premium for taking me, and that he should want me to make it up to £10—I promised him 50s. in the following week, and £5 the third week—I attended at the office on 18th, 19th, and 20th October—I had nothing particular to do—I did not go to the bank or Customs House—there was no correspondence; no books of account were kept—I did not see any letter-book—I attended from about ten to four; it varied, but I attended several hours each day—I went to Ludgate Hill and bought the Kensington Directory with, I should say, the same coin which I had given him—it was immediately after I had paid it—I also bought 500 envelopes—I addressed all of them—I believe nothing was put into them; they were there when I left—during the three days I was there four or five people called; one in reference to some business I had been to Charing Cross about, about a situation—not the least business was carried on there, either in wine or dried fruit, as far as I saw—on 20th October he said he had seen his employers, and they were very much surprised at his taking me on such a small premium—he wanted me to make the £10 up at once—I said I was unable to do it—he said at first he would give me three hours to go and see my uncle and borrow it of him; after that</p>

E. Ackerman," are what I call the stationery—Ellison is not carrying on business in the name of Ackerman—he traded as Ash worth and Co.—Herbert Miller told me the prisoner had a shop, and that the men had gone to work there—I did not know that when he left he left some things at Ellison's place.</p>

               <p>I employed the prisoner as manager at £4 a week salary—I had an inventory of stock, machinery, etc.—I have not the inventory here, only the agreement—it does not specially refer to the trade-mark—after the prisoner had been some little time in my employment, I helped at the second stock-taking—Mr. Bubeck, Mr. William Davies and I took it—the price fixed upon the stock was partly taken according to the old inventory, and what was not in the old inventory was fixed by Bubeck and myself—as a result of the stock-taking I gave the prisoner notice, expiring on 29th October, to quit my service—almost directly after 29th October I received information which became more complete ten days afterwards—on 15th or 16th November I went to the police—after proceedings were taken I was shown some of the sticks found at the prisoner's place in Apple Street—there is a mark "A. E. A." on this stick, and it is a stick that was part of my stock at Moorfields—no one else is entitled to use that mark—I recognised this case—this is my stationery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have heard that when the prisoner carried on this business, he carried it on with a partner who died—the assignee of the receiver sold the business—I don't know that Mr. Delia represented the estate of the late partner only—he was the representative of the whole firm—I don't know Mr. Benwell personally—I don't know that he was the receiver appointed to represent the deceased partner—I never heard anything of it—I don't know that the prisoner had a partner—I believe his father had one, who died—I don't know that the partner's representatives wanted money out of the business—I was <hi rend="italic">going</hi> to carry on the business in the name of Ash worth, the name I am going to adopt later on for family reasons—the name of Ackerman was of no value to me—when I gave the prisoner notice to leave I did not tell him that I could not afford to pay £4 a week, or that I could get someone to do his work for half the price—about two or three weeks after he left I took his brother into my emlpoyment—I pay him 5 per cent, on the turnover of the business; no fixed salary—he gets about £3 a week on the average—I did not make the change for the sake of the saving—I did not know that the brother had been discharged by the prisoner's father—I made inquiries as to his character—he was not in the stick trade then—two or three days before I gave the prisoner into custody I knew that he had started a shop of his own—I discharged six or eight of my workmen—I did not know where they had gone to work—I knew about the same time that I knew the prisoner had started another business that they had gone to work for the prisoner—some of them are the men who make these stick-handles—I had not exactly a trade-mark, but my initials, "A. E. A."—the prisoner's initials are "A. E. A." also—my name is not Adolphus Ellison Ash worth; I trade under it for family reasons—I know it is a serious things to give a man into custody, especially when lie has just started a new business—it might ruin his business—I saw Oswald twice, I believe, before I gave the prisoner into custody—I saw him once alone and once in company with Lythel, who took a statement from him—I saw Oswald a few days after the prisoner left, when I first heard of this case being packed, and I asked him what it meant—he said he packed the case by order of Mr. Ackerman; he did not know that he was going to leave—this was one or two days after Ackerman left, on 29th October, or it might have been before he left, I cannot exactly say—Oswald did not come to me, I went to him—I</p>

               <p>think the case was removed while the prisoner was still there, but I did not know it at the time—I went to the boy immediately I found out that a cage had been packed and removed—I think I saw the boy before the prisoner left—he said he had packed the case and put these things in it, but he thought Ackerman had a right to take them, and he was bound to do what, he told him—he remembered specially putting these nine silver-mounted sticks in—the first time the boy told me this it was in the wareroom above, I believe, where the sticks are generally kept—no one else was present—I did not send for anyone—I did not send for the prisoner, because he was not in the place then, and the case had been removed, and I did not see any possibility of identifying anything—afterwards I heard a great many more particulars—one of our men went to the prisoner's place for some purpose, and saw the case there—that was the same week that we took these proceedings—I did not speak to the prisoner about it, because the case was gone—as soon as I heard of the case being removed and packed I spoke to the boy—I have not yet made a claim against the Guarantee Society in connection with this—I must find out what the whole damage is—what I miss is about £350 worth—that is all I ask for—this is the mark on the stick—I cannot see it myself without the magnifying glass—I saw it before the Alderman.</p>

Ashworth and Company—I brought away fifty-one sticks—this one was shown to me with a silver band, and the initials "A. E.

E. A."—I helped to pick out the fifty-one sticks at the prisoner's place, and this is one I found; it was among several others—all the sticks we brought away were completed except one—the handles were of a peculiar shape, which can only be made by one workman—I have had experience in stick manufacture for eighteen months—when handles are bored they want a few weeks to dry—I have never been a practical workman; I speak from my observation in the workshop—I have seen handles as they come in rough, just as they are out, and quite wet—about two months must elapse before they can be put on to sticks.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bristol, and am agent in this country for the sale of margarine—on May 2nd I advertised for a traveller, and received these two letters, signed W. Hay don (<hi rend="italic">Offering himself as traveller.</hi>)—on November 17th I came to London, and had an interview with the prisoner Haydon—he said that he had been travelling in London sixteen years, and had a good connection among grocers, bakers, and confectioners—I asked him for a reference; he gave me H. Ward and Co., 403, Barking Road—I wrote there, and received this letter (<hi rend="italic">From E. Ward and Co., recommending Haydon as a thoroughly hard-working traveller.</hi>)—on May 25th I wrote to Haydon, agreeing to engage him as traveller, and received a letter from him asking for samples, after which I received orders from him for goods to be delivered, amounting altogether to upwards of £1,000, some of which I declined to execute—but I executed orders value between £500 and £600, and up to August 9th, when these proceedings commenced, I had only received £20; but I have received between £30 and £40 since—on June 17th I received an order from Haydon on a billhead of W. Harland and Co., bakers and confectioners, of Penge, for five hundredweight of margarine, in 56lb. firkins, value about £15, which I executed; and on June 29th one from Haydon, for thirty kegs of margarine, value £27 10s., which was also executed—I applied to Harland and Co. for payment, and on July 14th received this letter: "Dear Sir,—Yours to hand; shall certainly hold you to</p>

               <p>your contract, given by your representative, which I hold"—I had not ordered two months' credit to be given—I wrote several times to Harland, but never received anything—about May 27th I received an order from Haydon for goods to be supplied to W. R. Jackson, provision merchant and butter-man, of Lambeth and Croydon, for fifty kegs of margarine—I delivered thirty kegs, and then received this letter from Haydon dated June 1st: "Dear Sir,—Mr. Borrows' order was for cash, etc.; Mr. Jackson, of Lower Marsh, is doing a good trade"—I received another order from Haydon, dated June 11th, for another thirty kegs, value £24, to be sent to Jackson—they were sent—I applied for payment, and received this letter of June 15th (<hi rend="italic">Requesting the witness to draw on him for the whole amount at one month.</hi>)—upon that I drew a bill on Jackson, and sent it to him for acceptance, but never got any reply, and never saw the bill again—I came to London, and called on Jackson both at Lower Marsh and at Croydon, and found the shops closed—about June 11th I received this order through Haydon (<hi rend="italic">Ordering ten boxes and twenty-two kegs to be sent to Mr. J. Berry, of</hi> 191, <hi rend="italic">Whitecross Street, and referring to Holmberg, Lund, and</hi> Co.)—I wrote to Holmberg, and received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Giving Berry a recommendation, and asking for a price list, or for the traveller to call</hi>,)—I then received this order for goods, value £78 14s. 6d., to be supplied to J. Berry, which were sent—there was an order from Blackman for twenty kegs, and I was told that there was a fire at his shop, and that the carter took back the goods to the warehouse, and Haydon transferred some of them to Berry—I applied to Berry for payment, but received nothing—about June 11th I received an order from Haydon for twenty-four boxes and forty kegs of margarine to be supplied to J. Mathews, 28, Great George Street, Lisson Grove—I supplied them, and received a further order, on which a reference was given to Holmberg, Lund, and Co., as I had required one—I applied to them, and got this reply (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Messrs. Mathews were safe for the amount mentioned.</hi>)—about June 7th I received an order for four kegs and one cwt., value £6 16s., to be sent to Owen and Co., grocers and cheesemongers, 136, St. John's Road, Holloway—I sent them, and afterwards applied for payment, but received nothing—I next received an order, dated June 25th, for goods to be sent to Mr. J. Marshall, of 2, Havil Street, Southampton Street, Camberwell—I sent goods, value £6 12s., to that address, and wrote to make inquiries about Marshall, and received this reply (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the shop had a bad name but the man was all right.</hi>)—on May 26th I received this order from Haydon on a billhead of W. Borrows (<hi rend="italic">For four kegs of margarine as samples, order for cash.</hi>)—I did not execute the order as I did not make anything so cheap—on June 15th I received an order for goods to be sent to Mr. H. Blackman, baker and confectioner, of 44, Long Lane, Bermondsey, enclosing as a reference a card of W. Oakley and Co.—I applied to them, got a satisfactory answer, and sent the goods; but in consequence of the fire they were not delivered, and the whole lot was transferred by Haydon to Berry (<hi rend="italic">The reply from Oakley and Co. on one of their bill heads was signed R. B. S., those being Salisbury's initials.</hi>)—I received a further order from Haydon, containing on it, "References you have had, "for goods to be sent to Blackman—I started them, and then stopped the delivery by telegram, because I had a suspicion about</p>

               <p>Blackman—about June 1 at I received this order from Haydon for goods to be supplied to George Edwards, 120, Victoria Dock Road, Canning Town, 5 cwt. and 48 boxes, value about £60—I obtained information, and wrote to Haydon, and received this reply: "Your report about Mr. G. Edwards is not correct; but, however, please cancel order at once"—I did not execute the order in consequence—I think it was transferred to Berry by another order, at Hay don's request—on June 21st I got this telegram: "Send eight kegs refused by Macauly to G. Edwards, 120, Victoria Dock Road, at once, for cash. Wire him.—<hi rend="smallCaps">HAYDON</hi>"—I did not send the goods; I sent the invoice, and got this letter (<hi rend="italic">Signed Geo. Edwards, stating that he woe disappointed at not receiving the packages, and ordering three kegs for cash.</hi>)—I did not supply any goods to Edwards, or get any cash from him—I received this letter from Haydon (<hi rend="italic">This stated:</hi> "I am glad you have taken my advice <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Edwards," etc. "Do not trust Garner; I have every reason to believe he is no good ")—on July 16th I received an order from Haydon for goods for Mr. H. Rice, 79, Wyndham Road, Camberwell, for ten kegs—they had to be sent to 122, Woodville Road, Forest Hill—I started them, but made inquiries and stopped them—I then received this letter from Rice (<hi rend="italic">Cancelling the order, as it had been so long about that he had had to buy elsewhere.</hi>)—I then wrote this letter to Haydon (<hi rend="italic">Dated July</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1892, <hi rend="italic">asking for explanations as to the people he had sold the goods to, and the firm who gave him a character when engaged.</hi>)—I got this reply (<hi rend="italic">From Haydon, stating that he had been absent from home, and tendering his resignation, as he had never received any commission.</hi>)—there was no commission due—I did not see him again till he was in the dock—I did not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to any people he mentioned—all those orders were between May 17th, when I engaged him, and July 16th—I also received an order, through Haydon, from Vincent and Co., of Lower Road, Deptford, but did not execute it in consequence of inquiries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Haydon.</hi> In my agreement with you I reserved to myself the right to refuse any orders, which I have done—I made inquiries through the Trade Protection Society—I delivered £600 worth net of margarine in London, and have received nearly £60—£60 or £70 worth has been returned—not £10 worth has been cancelled through the trade reports, and that was done after I had cancelled them myself—I called on all that I could find, and wrote to the others—I did not receive any anonymous letter—I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> not know Morris or Morgan Clifford—there is nothing due to you; the commission was to be paid on the cash returns—I told you to call on Rice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Borrows.</hi> I did not supply any samples at 48s.; our lowest price was 60s.—all the orders were for cash—I called at 2, Havil Street, Camberwell, and asked for Marshall; he was out, but I saw a woman—I did not swear in my information that Marshall and Borrows were the same man—Marshall had goods of me—you have never received any goods from my directions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Hennessey.</hi> I do not think I received any reference on Mr. Owen's order—I wrote, several times to Owen, but never received any reply—the goods were worth about £6.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUGESSEN</hi>. I wrote to Oakley and Co., making inquiries about Charter—I have never been paid—I also inquired about</p>

               <p>Charter and Blackman through the Trade Protection Association—it was entirely on the reference by Oakley and Co. that I dealt with Charter—the Trade Protection Society did not influence my mind at all—I had never heard of Oakley and Co. before, but they were good business men, and I thought they would give a truthful reply—the amount invoiced is £15; but I supplied no goods to him, and suffered nothing directly, but I did indirectly, because the goods were transferred to people who I never got a penny from.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Rice.</hi> I sent you a letter, quoting prices, after your inquiry—I never supplied any goods to you—I telegraphed and stopped them about the 19th; and they were returned to me at Bristol; and I sold them at a very ridiculous price.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Jackson</hi>, I do not think I had a reference from you—I had a very poor report about you; but I executed the order, because I depended on my traveller—I drew a bill on you, but it was never accepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Harland.</hi> I sent the goods direct to you from the works—that lot of June was not returned cancelled from anybody else; it was in the docks to my order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gross-examined by Morris.</hi> The first order I got about June 1st was for about £60—I gave you no information about it; it is not usual to do so—I wrote as to the order, amounting to £6, of June 25th, sending an invoice, and asking you to remit by return of post, when the goods would be delivered—the letter that has been read was the only one I received from you—in no communication from me was reference made to the £60 order received from Haydon—no goods have been delivered to you—I was not going to let goods go into your shop without cash against invoice—you owe me nothing—no reference to anyone in the dock has been given by anyone in the name of Edwards, Morris or Ward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Holmberg.</hi> I received a letter from you, Cancelling the order I received for you—I should think I wrote you four letters altogether—it is possible I wrote that Haydon would call upon you—you owe me nothing—in reply to a letter giving me an invitation, I wrote saying that when I came to London I would call on you—judging by the whole contents of your letter, I thought you were a rogue—it really edged away from the reference you had previously given—you said in a general way that you had seen my stuff in several shops, and it would be wise to be careful; and if I called on you you would show me your books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw the printed heading of the letter from Oakley and Co., and I believed there was a firm of Oakley and Co., carrying on business at the address given as flour factors—Holmberg gave references to Matthews and Perry as two distinct firms—in his letter afterwards, which led me to suspect his honesty, he said that, from information that had come to hand since, he looked on them with suspicion, and advised me not to do business with them.</p>
               <p>

I am manager to the Melton Sauce and Pickle Company, Melton Mowbray—on April 8th I received this letter from Haydon, offering his services as traveller—I replied, and then received this letter from him, enclosing as a reference a card of W. Borrows, baker, refreshment contractor, etc., of 63, High Street, Peckham—I believe I wrote to Borrows the same day—I got an answer from him, which I have not got—in consequence of it I wrote to Haydon, engaging him—he then wrote for samples, and on the 16th April he sent an order for goods for Borrows on one of Borrows' cards—we sent the goods to his address—we then received this order from W. Borrows, "The South-Eastern Grocery and Provision Stores, 2; Havil Street, Southampton Street, Camberwell"—we supplied the goods—at the same time we received this letter from Haydon (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the quantity of pies named in the order would be required every fourteen days at</hi> 63, <hi rend="italic">High Street, Peck<lb/>ham, and that he had sent an order for his other shop.</hi>)—I received other orders from Haydon for different people—after a few orders had come in we suggested that he should give us security, and collect money—he gave us the name of George Edwards, Victoria Dock Road, I believe. as security—the letter is lost—nothing came of it; we did not make the arrangement—I then received from him this order for A.

Ennes, 79, Stonebridge Road, South Tottenham—I supplied about £30 worth of goods-nothing was paid—I sent bills in to Borrows, Edwards, and Ennis, but got nothing—I never saw Haydon till he was in custody—I could not see him; all my dealings with him were by correspondence—on May 5th, when I came to London, I went and saw Hawthorne, of Loughborough Road, Brixton-Haydon sent an order from him-we got no money from him—I saw in his shop the sauce and pickles we sent, and that was the only stock I saw there-there were a few tables and forms—the police afterwards showed me at Scotland Yard some of my goods—Nightingale not a customer of mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Haydon.</hi> We inquired about you through the Trade Protection Society, but not about all the customers you introduced—goods leave our place the same day as the invoice as a rule, and perishable goods of ten reach London the same day—I only made one personal application for money, and that was to Hawthorne—I did not know that he had a pension of £1 a week from the War Department—goods were supplied to him on April 22nd, 23rd, and 29th, and then having our</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Borrows here signed his name on apiece of paper, which was handed to the witness.</hi>)—I believe this signature is a facsimile of the reference, from what I can remember—I also had from you a reply to an application for cash, and a very interesting document—I remember making a remark to one of my directors as to the character of the handwriting at the time—we applied for payment about a week or ten days after sending goods—we send sausages off in the evening and they should be delivered in London the next morning—we never had any complaint from you as to delay—the pies are always made the same day that they are sent away—I remember no complaint about them—I don't remember calling at either of your places—the matter was put into the hands of the Trade Protection Society—I cannot say if they applied for payment before you were arrested on June 16th—I received no reference with your order—the goods sent to Havil Street were fit for a grocers' and provision merchants' as far as I remember, and those sent to High Street were fit for a restaurant—I only know from your card that you kept a restaurant there—I never remember seeing your premises—on all our invoices there is the word cash, which means a week for pies and a month for sauces—I had no complaint from you about delay in delivery.</p>

Borrows (<hi rend="italic">This had a printed heading, and stated that he had known Haydon for some years, that he had represented him in the biscuit trade, and would be found industrious, a good salesman, and all he required.</hi>)—I also had an answer from Mr. Barringer—on the faith of those letters I engaged Haydon—he signed an agreement by which he was to have ten shillings a week salary and commission, and he was not to collect cash, or to receipt any invoice—the first order Haydon sent in was on 21st April, for three chests of Ceylon tea, to be sent to Borrows—before I delivered the tea I called at Borrows's, 63, High Street, Peckham, and asked him for a reference—he pulled his cheque book from his pocket, and said, "This is my best reference"—I said, "You don't sell much tea here"—he said "No; I want the tea for my other shop," and he handed me a printed memorandum form containing at the top, "South-Eastern Grocery and Provision Stores, 2, Havil Street, Southampton Street, Camberwell"—he said he did not want all of one sort of tea, but different prices, and I sent him samples—he gave me no reference—I received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had had better samples on better terms, and so he cancelled the order.</hi>)—my ordinary terms are two months, but I told him I must have a reference or cash—a day or two after that I received a letter from Haydon for goods to be sent to Mr. W. Owen, 136, St. James Road, Holloway, giving a reference to Fletcher—I wrote for another reference, because that was too far off, and received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Referring to J. Perry and Co.</hi>, 191, <hi rend="italic">Whitecross Street.</hi>)—I called on Perry, who gave a satisfactory account of Owen, and said he had done business with him for some time—I asked him to show me his ledger—he said, "If you won't take my word I won't show you the</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Ordering a</hi> 14 lb. <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 24 lb. <hi rend="italic">packet of tea to be sent to Mr. Ennis.</hi>)—I sent it to the address given; the value was £2 3s. 2d.—I had no idea that Mr. Ennis was the same person as Mr. Owen, who I had refused to supply—I wrote soon afterwards for payment, and a man giving the name of Ennis called on me—I do not recognise him among the prisoners; he did not pay me any money—on June 13th I received from Haydon an order for 112 lb. of tea, to be supplied to Mr. H. Blackman, 44, Long Lane, Bermondsey, giving a reference to Mr. A. Oakley, of 6, Savage Gardens, Tower Hill—I called there, and was told he was out—I wrote to him, and received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Giving a satisfactory character to Blackman</hi>,)—I believed there was a firm of Oakley and Co., carrying on business at that address—I made further inquiries about Blackman through the Trade Society, in consequence of which I refused to do business—about 24th June I received an order for tea to be sent to Mr. Nichols, a grocer, of 2, Havil Street, Camberwell, but did not execute it—about May 4th I received an order for 56 lb. of tea to be sent to Mr. G. Staab, written on a piece of a flour-bag, and referring to Messrs. Marriage and Needs—I wrote and received a satisfactory answer, and sent goods to Staab value £3 10s. 10d., and on 16th May a further order for 28 lb. to be sent to Staab—I executed part of it—Staab did not pay—I called once and wrote—I took County Court proceedings, got judgment, and put in an execution, but there were no goods except what the landlord claimed for rent—I wrote to Haydon complaining of the character of his customer, and got this answer: "Gentlemen, I shall never be able to do a large trade the way you want it done"—I made other complaints to Haydon up to July 8th, when I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Demanding his salary and commission.</hi>)—I next received this letter (<hi rend="italic">From Haydon complaining that he had called three times for his account and no one could be seen, and had been to Stubbs and Co., who would take the matter up, and it would be published in the</hi> "Grocer. ")—I then received this post-card: "You can come down to my house, but I am sure to do you, but I intend to be paid, you are not dealing with a fool," etc.—I had paid his commission; I paid him more than was due to him—he was with me two months—I paid him 10s. a week and 30s. a week commission—altogether I received orders from Haydon amounting to £250, but only executed £56 of them, and out of the £561 have only received about £25.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 52, Welclose Terrace, Leeds, and am sole agent to Crosby and Co., millers—I received letters from Salisbury and Co. in January, which I tore up-about January 26th I met Salisbury by appointment—he said that he had known the London trade for thirty years, and had been a miller; that he had been in America, and had the best connection possible to be obtained, and knew the market very well—I said that I only wanted to work with A. 1. customers—he said that his customers were first-class, and the best in London—he referred me to Charles F. Bean, 36, Seething Lane, and to a clergyman whose name he did not give me—I gave him a trial, and made inquiries afterwards—I did not engage him as traveller, but to sell for me—he introduced me to customers—I allowed him 4 1/2 d. commission per sack on all sales when they were paid for, and twenty-eight days credit—his address was 102, Gore Road, Victoria Park—he gave me this card in January: "H. Blackman, Bakery Stores, Camberwell February 1st. 10. X. X. as soon as convenient," and said that Blackwell was an exceedingly good customer, he had known him in trade for twenty years, and he had always paid—the goods were supplied on that order and paid for, £16 5s.—on March 2nd I had a verbal order from Blackman in Salisbury's presence for thirty-two sacks, value £51 4s., of which £26 14s. was paid on account on April 22nd by cheque, and at the same time he gave me an order for fifty sacks of flour in Salisbury presence, which was not executed—a cheque for £28 was post-dated and met—on 29th April he gave me another verbal order for thirty-two sacks; I did not</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Giving orders from Rice, Filkins and Webster.</hi>)—I executed those orders—Salisbury said that he had known Rice for a long time; he was very rich and was a millionaire—that order was executed on February 4th at 79, Wyndham Road, Camberwell—I called there on March 2nd, and Rice paid me the whole amount, £16 5s., and gave me a verbal order for thirty sacks—I sent ten, value £15 10s., and the other twenty on March 31st, total value £46 10s.—the £15 10s. was paid to our manager on April 14th; the remainder has not been paid—I received at the same time a verbal order for ten sacks at 30s., £15, which I executed—Rice owes me £46—I served him with a writ, and got two contributions of £2 each on account, leaving £42 owing—on March 2nd Salisbury introduced Staab to me, and said he was a millionaire and carried on business in Beck-well Street and gave me an order for twenty sacks value £ 12, which was executed on March 12th—at that time £54 was due to me from Blackman, £42 from Rice, and £32 from Todd, £1,400 altogether from Salisbury's introductions, on which I do not reckon for a farthing—that is from January to April—I gave him notice on June 12th—the total amount of orders he sent in was between £8,000 and £9,000, of which about £3,000 was executed; about £1,600 was paid.</p>

About February Ainsworth came up to see how the business was getting on, and went with me to Salisbury to visit about nine or ten of these customers—I did not hear that he expressed himself as thoroughly satisfied with the business introduced by Salisbury—we went to the Alhambra—the first delivery of ten sacks to Rice was paid for—the second delivery was paid to Ainsworth for our firm—he forgot to pay the third delivery—I did not agree that he should pay by instalments—he paid me two sums, and after I served him with a writ he paid me nothing—I served him with a. writ of £44, and that morning he gave me £2 and left £42 owing—I went on with the County Court proceedings; they cost me about £30—I got judgment against him—after Rice paid me £16 for the first lot of ten sacks, I must have gone to see him—it was not on my own judgment that the second lot was delivered—I left it to Salisbury's honesty—at the time Rice paid me he gave me an order through Salisbury—I daresay I went to see him before—you cannot tell by a shop whether a man has a genuine business—Blackman paid for the first lot—he had another lot—I saw him once, or perhaps twice, between the two deliveries—he was very deceitful—I continued to supply him—Mr. Beane did not give him a character—he might have done so after we communicated our affairs—Blackman never gave me any reference—Blackman did not say that he had been dealing with Salisbury in the flour line, and that he owed him an account of £8 or £9—I will swear</p>

Jackson, provision merchant and butterman, 135, Lower Marsh, and Surrey Street, Croydon—during the same time I received orders through Taylor for Mr. Vincent, of 206, Lower Road, Deptford—I did not know that Taylor was carrying on that business—I twice supplied goods to Homberg, Lund, and Co., at Wilton Chambers, Vauxhall Bridge Road—I had no idea that they were the people who had given me the reference to Taylor; I believed they were carrying on a genuine and <hi rend="italic">boan-fide</hi> business—I expect altogether the value of all the orders sent to me by Taylor, and executed, was</p>

               <p>£2,000—he sent I a orders from February to June—the loss to us on that trading was about £900, I think—apart from customers introduced by Taylor. Morris obtained goods from me in October, 1891, to the value of £53 7s. 11d.—he called and said another traveller of ours had supplied his father—we trusted him—he said he was carrying on business at 152, Balls Pond Road, Dalston, and I believed he was carrying on a legitimate business there—he said he only wanted fourteen days' credit—he never paid anything—I pressed him from time to time—when I could not get the money I went in December to look at the business at Balls Pond Road, and found the place shut up—when I came to the Police-court to give evidence against Taylor in this case I saw Morris in the dock, and I also recognised Borrows, whom I knew as Stone, in which name he had got goods from me in 1891—I believed he was carrying on a genuine respectable business at 62, High Street, Peckham—he came there from 9, The Parade, Hanwell, where we sent goods to him to the amount of about £10—he did not pay—he was sued, judgment was recovered, execution was put in, and then he said the proprietor of the shop was Borrows and he, Stone, was only the manager—the sheriff's officer was afraid to stop and the execution was withdrawn—I never got my £10—Jackson gave me a cheque for £35 8s. 10d., dated June 11th, 1892, and got a receipt for the goods he had had—the cheque was paid in and returned marked "Refer to drawer"—on or about 30th July I received this letter from Taylor. (<hi rend="italic">This gave as an explanation of an enclosed cheque from Vincent being signed by himself, that some months ago he had joined Farrant's brother in the business which was carried on in his wife's name; that he had found Farrant's brother was constantly getting drunk and getting rid of the money, and in consequence he had been carrying on the shop himself for a few weeks; that he had paid some of the money due from him, and hoped with a little indulgence to pay off the whole amount.</hi>) The first order from Vincent was April 6th, 1892—after deducting the £5 he enclosed in the letter, his indebtedness was £77 odd—Jackson's indebtedness was just over £200, and Berry's £200—the first I heard of Vincent being the same man as Taylor was from this letter—Berry, Jackson, and Vincent together owe over £500.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a flour packer, of 36, Seething Lane, and the Corn Exchange—prior to November, 1891, I had known Salisbury—in November, 1891, I had a conversation with him—he was in my debt—I went and found him in great distress—he said his wife was dead, and that the last two things he had promised her were to give up drinking and pay me back—he said he was going to get me the best customers he could to make up for previous losses I had had through him—he afterwards introduced Rice to me, saying he was a very good man—about November he gave me an order for Rice—this was Rice's card, which Salisbury gave me: "Henry Rice, wholesale pastrycook and confectioner, Wyndham Road, Camberwell"—I supplied Rice with</p>

               <p>various orders from November, 1891, to the 30th May, 1892, to the value, altogether, of £120 12s. 6d.—of that he paid me £70 5s., leaving a balance of £50 7s. 6d.—in January Salisbury brought Mr. Fontheim to my office, and asked me to buy flour from Fontheim—I never asked Fontheim about Salisbury's position—I never got the balance from Rice—Salisbury told me if I would wait Rice was taking a fresh shop, and would be able to pay me—on the 15th of January Salisbury brought me this card; "H, Blackman, The Crown Bakery and Confectionery Stores, 30, Crown Street, Camberwell"—Salisbury said he was a very good man—Blackman gave me various orders from January to May, in all amounting to £107 12s. 6d., of which £64 5s. was paid, leaving a balance of £43 7s. 6d.—I tried to get the balance, and spoke to Salisbury about it repeatedly—he said it would be all right presently, because he was getting some money from the country—I got none of it—later in May this year Salisbury came to me about getting flour for himself—he said his arrangements with Fontheim were over, and he was setting up for himself, and he began giving orders, and took delivery orders from me—I do not know where the flour went to—I supplied him up to August—altogether he had £987 worth of flour—he paid me £594, leaving a balance owing of £393—I have not got a penny of that.</p>

I am a traveller to Mr. Hirsch, of the Hop Exchange, Southwark, importer of eggs—in May this year Jackson called, and asked to be supplied with eggs, and showed me his trade card, which described him as of 135, Lower Marsh, Lambeth, and 40, Surrey Street, Croydon, provision merchant and butterman—I believed he was carrying on a genuine business at those addresses—I got a reference, and in</p>

Nightingale's—I saw my own name on some of the cases in the van. and some cases of Mr. Anselmie's—the van stopped at the Crystal Palace Tavern—I went up and asked Jackson for the payment of my account, in the first place, and then I asked him what he was going to do with those eggs—he said he was going to Sydenham with them, but he would be back at the office at twelve o'clock, and he would see Mr. Hirsch and settle with him—the tavern is about two hundred yards from 207, Crystal Palace Road—I sent my man several times to try and get payment from Jackson—I believe after a time the shop was shut up—after the arrests were made I went to 207, Crystal Palace Road with the detectives—in an outhouse I saw one of my egg-boxes—I identified it by marks—I had never supplied Nightingale with eggs, nor has Mr. Anselmie, as far as I know—it was about the 13th July that I saw this van in the Crystal Palace Road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness, and help him in business—in April, 1891, I carted some provisions from Jackson's shop to Nightingale's in the Crystal Palace Road—Jackson and Freeman came in the van with me—we pulled up before we got to Nightingale's at the Upland public-house, and I was left there while they went on with the goods—we pulled up at a public-house and had a drink, and then they said, "We will go up here and come back," and they left me in the public-house and went further up—I could see where they were—I delivered more provisions, not a very big load—Jackson and Freeman, were there—we pulled up at nightingale's shop, and he came out in a white apron and the goods were unloaded—then I and Freeman pulled across to the public-house, leaving Jackson behind—after about a quarter of an hour Jackson came to the public-house—about this time we used to run out a lot of articles for Jackson to Nightingale and other people—one of our businesses was next door to Jackson—I very often saw goods delivered at his shop; sugar, bacon, eggs, tinned goods and pro<lb/>visions generally—after they were delivered some of them were carted away—I took out some that came on the same day—the sugar I took away was done up in the bags as it came in—I cannot say whether any more were taken away in the same way—I moved Jarvis from 30, Crown Street, to 44, Long Lane, just before Good Friday this year—I knew him as Blackman—when we had unloaded the furniture we removed, we brought up five sacks of flour from the cellars at 44, Long Lane, and carted it to different places—the cellar then was well stocked with flour—there were some tickets on the five sacks marked <hi rend="largeCaps">XX</hi>—I believe we went over the bridge and had a drink, and left one sack at a carpenter's shop next the Trafalgar, and the rest went to Borrows', High Street, Peckham—I saw no money pass at Herbert's, the carpenter's shop—Borrows came out from his shop; we took in three sacks and left one, and we took a small sack of American flour from Borrows' place, and took the two sacks to 30, Crown Street next morning—on another occasion Long Bill went with us to Crown Street—I had orders to go to 30, High Street, Peckham, and we packed up some boxes of fruit and candied peel, and we took them to Havil,. Street, Borrows' other shop—Long Bill was with us then—after that we went with him to Crown Street—I thought Long Bill was working for Borrows, and that is what he gave me to understand—coming back from Deptford, he said he was going to work in the bakehouse afterwards, and that he was working for Borrows—we went to 30, Crown Street under Borrows' direction—we backed in at the side door and went into the loft—I saw ten sacks of flour there; I brought five down, and put them in the cart, and took them to High Street, Peckham, and left three there, pulling round the back way and taking them into the</p>

               <p>bakehouse—the other two we took down to Deptford, a general shop—Harland went with me; he told me to pull up there—he went in first, came back, and told me to carry them in—afterwards we pulled up to a public-house in the New Cross Road—Harland produced a cheque, and asked a man to endorse it—he said he had to be very careful, as he had once got into trouble over a cheque—Freeman was always at Jackson's shop—Teddy Symons came to Jackson's other shop at James' Grove—Symons, Jackson, and another man came to give the order for moving Jack Done—I have seen Harland, Borrows, Jackson, and Dona together once.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Borrows.</hi> It was before Good Friday, in April, that I carted flour to Deptford—when I came from High Street, Peckham, to Havil Street, the shop was being done up; the painters were at work there—you met me on Trafalgar Bridge, and told me to go and get five sacks of flour; but I did not care to do it, and I said nothing about it, and some other man went—that was some time afterwards—that which came from Crown Street was for you—you never paid me any money; I do not know if you paid my father—I think he sent in a bill, but did not get the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Margaret Street, Camberwell—about 20th May I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi> for a young man wanted as manager at an egg and butter store, £15 to £20 cash security being required—I wrote to the address given, 104, Old Street, St. Luke's—I got an answer, which I have since lost—printed on the top was 'Ward and Company, 403, Barking Road"; it was signed "George Edwards," and told me to apply to J. H., at 403, Barking Road—I went there the next day, and asked for J. H.—I saw a tall gentleman in the shop; I do not see him here—Morris came in and said he was George Edwards, and that he was the person who had advertised—after telling me about the shop he asked me if I would go down and see it—it was middling stocked—he said it was not very well stocked, because they had not long started on it—I saw paper bags with "Ward and Company" on them, and some paper stuck on a few biscuit boxes, with the name of Charles Higgins"—I said I thought this was Edwards' shop—Morris said, "It is all right; it is just the same. It belongs to me"—he said his other shop was the one I was to manage, at 140, Victoria Dock Road—I went there and saw a woman in charge—it was a baker's and provision shop, fairly well stocked—"George Edwards" was on the paper bags—Morris said it was his shop—I did not decide that day, but next day I went to Barking Road—a day or two afterwards I took the situation—I-gave £15 security in cash—Morris gave me this receipt—he said at any time I did not like it I could give up the situation, and have my money back—on the 30th May I moved in—the shop was fairly stocked for a man starting, but it was not kept up—Morris wanted me to make a big show there—he had got some cheques, but he had got no money at the time—I told him I did nut like the way things were carried on; I could not do any trade if I had no stock—he said if I would wait</p>

               <p>a little time it would be all right; he would bring it out all right—he showed me two cheques, and said the money was not in the bank to meet them just at the time; they were post-dated, but that I should have plenty of things directly the time expired—I never got any additional stock—what I did get went away again as soon as it arrived—it did not go into the business; it was not unpacked—boxes of feculina and Bentley's sauce came—he did not tell me what I was to sell them for—the sauce went to the cloak-room at Liverpool Street Station, to be left till called for—there were about sixty or seventy bottles—those bottles had been in stock when I arrived—four boxes of feculina went in the same way to Liverpool Street—there were about sixty packets of Neuralia tea, I should think, the majority of which was taken away by Edwards—it had been in stock on my arrival—on the 28th June some casks of margarine came, and butter and cheese—they were carted by Kearley and Touge—they were not delivered; the carman would not leave them until they were paid for—I told Morris; he said he did not expect they would; and he said I had persuaded the man not to, because he would never get his money—the carman stopped there two hours or more—I saw Morris the same day, and he said he had been across on the other side of the railway line, watching for two hours and a half to see what happened—after I had been there a few weeks he told me that the Barking Road shop was shut up—that was a day or two after the interview I have spoken of—he said there was a law case on about the rent—they would not accept him as a tenant—I was to have 28s. per week, rent free, and provisions—I stayed there six weeks—the first two weeks he paid me all right; the second two weeks I had a few shillings at a time, and the last two weeks I got nothing—after I began to dun him for my wages he ceased coming there; he sent his wife and little boy for letters—afterwards I had this letter from him, asking me to meet him at the National Provincial Bank with letters—sometimes, six or seven letters came for him in the morning—he gave me no money for the landlord—I gave Morns a month's notice before four weeks were up—he did not trouble about it—he said he would talk to me when I was in a better temper—he said I could have mv money and plenty of stock as soon as these cheques were cashed—some days afterwards the brokers were put in by the landlord—Morris's wife called, and I went with her to Fenchurch Street Railway Station—I found Morris there, and gave him some letters, one or two of which were from Mr. Burris, of Bristol, and one was from Mitchell, of Thames Street—Morris wrote a telegram to the landlord: "Withdraw man from possession, am on the road to pay you"—he did not send it—I asked him for my wages again—he said he would give them to me—I said, "I shall not wait till you do so"—he gave me these I 0 U's, one for £15 and the other for £2 4s.—I was talking to Mrs. Morris, and when I looked up Morris had vanished—I never saw him again at the shop, which I gave up—I found he was living at Hackney—I asked him again for my money—he said he would not pay me, because someone had put him away, meaning that someone had told me where he lived——I got 10s. from him—I have given him bills for goods coming in and not paid for—Haydon called, and said he wanted to see Edwards—I said he was not there—the average takings at this shop through the six weeks was about 35s.—the first week I took £2 9s. 7d., the second week,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Morris.</hi> The first few weeks I was there there was not sufficient stock for me to take £10 a week—I offered you £15 security, and said I could not advance more—the rent was 13s. 6d. a week, I think—my wages were 28s. and provisions and house-rent—there were provisions there if I had liked to have what were there—the expenses would be over £3 a week—there is no doubt you were losing—I cannot say how much—you took nothing from the shop directly it came in except this feculina—Bentley's sauce is very expensive—I did not say it was too dear for the neighbourhood; you said so yourself and took it away—I never went with you to Coombe Brothers—I went there on your behalf to buy eggs for you for cash, on my own responsibility—it was your money—the paper bags were on credit and the feculina—the man has come to me and complained about it—I cannot say if it is paid for now—feculina was all that came in—you did not send eggs several times—your son did not bring some—you sent four or five biscuit-boxes with a few biscuits at the bottom—you sent a few bottles of pickles and penny bottles of sauce—you brought some tapioca and sago and took them away, because you had no bowls to show them in—you left me four or five pounds of each—you sent in no packet goods; they were there when I went—I did not have a large stock of them—before I went to you I had been a grocer—I have been a 'bus conductor since—you had no character with me, as you said £15 was a good enough character for you, and you had not time to run about after my character—you told me you and Ward were just the same—I did not know who Ward was, unless it was you—I told Mitchell that you told me you were Ward and Co.—you did not say you would turn over the shop and fixtures to me as security for my money—you came down half-drunk one night, and said you would turn over the thing to me if I signed my name to a paper showing I had received it, and I said I would not have it—I did not know the week the brokers were in that, through the falling through with Ward and Co., you were helpless and without a shilling—I agreed to take your <hi rend="largeCaps">IOU</hi> because I could not follow you and get the money from you—you suggested it to me, and I said that if you got a good start I would come and work for you again, but the agreement was to be that you paid me my old account first—everything at the shop was sold at a proper price—Haydon was the only other one of the prisoners I saw—there was not plenty of feculina left in the shop when you took some of it away—I only had the case—a box of 740 eggs came in the day before the brokers took possession—you only owed the landlord two weeks—the eggs would be more than sufficient to pay the broker out—I came to your house at Hackney, I should say, twenty times—you paid me 10s., and promised to pay me more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of 37, Edmond's Street, Camberwell—I have known Rice for some time—in June I was out of employment, and he arranged to put me into that baker's shop at 39. Edmond's Street—I was to be paid by what I made out of baking people's dinners—I superintended the selling of bread and everything—I commenced selling bread 4 1/2 d. per quartern; that was a fair price in the district—a week previous to Rice's arrest, in August, it went down to 3 1/2 d.—Rice said he was buying flour at £1 and 19s. 6d. per sack; and if so we were getting a fair profit on the bread—other bakers were selling at 33/4d. and 4d., it was very unsteady—Rice had another shop at Wyndham Road, which he managed himself, and he had taken a shop at 122, "Woodvale Road; but he was arrested before he opened it—I saw thirty sacks of flour at Woodvale Road—twenty of them bore the mark of Appleton and French—before his arrest I fetched sixteen of them away to Wyndham Road, and two to my place—before the detectives came Rice and Symon's came to 39, Edmond's Street, at half-past ten or a quarter to eleven on Thursday night, I think, and took ten shillings, all the money in the shop—about a week after the detectives came the brokers came in, and I shut up the shop—there was no more flour to go on with—I went to the Wyndham Road shop very often, and two or three times to Woodvale Road—I have seen in Rice's company Salisbury, Jarvis (whom I knew as Blackman), and Borrows—I saw Haydon with Staab at Mark Lane, and I saw Borrows (whom I knew as Stone), Symons, and Haydon outside his shop when he was out—I saw Rice very often in Salisbury's company—I was at 39, Edmond's Street for close on three months—we did four, five, or six sacks of flour a week; the takings were £8, £9, or £10 a week for bread and flour—there was a fair stock, and it was renewed from time to time; there was no difficulty in getting fresh flour—there was not a grand number of customers; they varied—I took no proper account of what I made from the bakings; it was nearly enough to maintain me—you cannot expect enough when you first open a business—I had no reason to be disappointed with the business; we did as well as we expected—I have no complaint to make of my treatment—I made a living.</p>

I live at 30, Crown Street, Camberwell—I met Borrows in the Greyhound when I was doing nothing—he asked me if I wanted a job, and appointed to meet me a day or two afterwards—I met him with Haydon—Borrows spoke of taking a shop in Crown Street from Blackman, and he said he had arranged for me to go into possession of it—I was to have 30s. a week—I went into it—there was no furniture there—the stock consisted of a few half-quarterns of bread, pickles, and tea; flour afterwards came in—Borrows had other shops in High Street, Peckham, and at 2, Havil Street—Herbert, who kept a chandler's shop in Peckham, was a friend and customer—bread was sold at 4 1/2 d. at Crown Street and Havil Street, and I believe it went out at 33/4d. to be sold at Herbert's—at the price paid for flour we could not afford to sell the bread at that price—I spoke to the prisoner about it on two or three occasions—he said, "Oh, he is an old <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> of mine, because at any time I am in want of a pound I can always get it"—some of the flour that came into this shop was carted away to High Street, Peckham—twenty or thirty sacks of flour, some marked <hi rend="largeCaps">XX</hi>, and some Appleton and French, was brought from Blackman's shop in Long Lane to this shop in Crown Street before I went there—Blackman is Jarvis—when flour came from Bermondsey, Borrows would sometimes, but not always, come to the shop; sometimes he would send it by carmen—the money I took in the shop I handed to Borrows-sometimes he came in two or three times a day and took the money; I never handed him a full week's money—this went on for eight weeks, and then the shop was closed—Harland came there twice, I think—I have seen him in the Havil Street shop very often; he was managing it—Borrows got me to cash one of his cheques for £3 for him, and got the money—the cheque afterwards came back—I got someone I knew to cash it; he never got the money back—he went to ask Borrows for it, and he pushed him out of the shop on to the pavement on his back—I did not see that—I believed the money was there when I cashed the cheque—he has never paid me my last two weeks' wages—I have seen Haydon at the shop several times, and Harland and Jarvis—I saw Symons there about twice—I have seen Haydon there five or six times, it might be—when Borrows came to take what was in the till he came sometimes in a Hansom cab; once or twice I think he came with Blackman—he had met Haydon and Symons at the shop by appointment—they seemed on friendly terms—sometimes they went to a public-house, and sometimes they asked me to go with</p>

               <p>them; I went, of course—I once saw Haydon and Borrows dining together—I said to Borrows one Sunday morning when he came to take the little money that was left, and there was not enough to pay me, "This won't do, your going on like this; you cannot do the thing that is right with your wife and family and driving about in cabs and calling at Herbert's; that is a loose way of going on"—he said, "I know I am doing wrong; I ought to turn the drink up"—he was more or less given to drink—Haydon, when he has been there, has used the place to write letters—I lent Borrows' son four shillings for Blackman to make up a cheque, as he had not sufficient money to meet a bill.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Letters from Stone and Easton were here put in, testifying to Borrows' respectability.</hi>)—he went into possession, and in rather more than three months I found a sheriffs officer in possession for £30—Borrows said that he owed nothing else—I let him stay on, and he was arrested before he had paid any rent—he paid £2 for some fixtures.</p>

I live at 2, Kempson Road, Kennington—in October, 1891, I had two baker's shops—I met Borrows, Garland, and Blackman about letting them 49, Frean Street, Bermondsey, but nothing came of it—I afterwards saw Blackman and Rice, but nothing came of that—in February, 1892, I went to 30, Crown Street, Camberwell—a female was behind the counter, and when I was introduced to Blackman he was managing the shop-we arranged that he was to take the premises and I was to have half the profits—he was not exactly the tenant; I was to pay the rent, and he was to manage the business—he went there on a Saturday in October, and remained about three weeks, and then I found Garland managing the business, and complained-that went on for three weeks, and then I found the place shut up—I never got a farthing from Blackman.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had known Holmberg and his father eight years, that the, were very respectable, and had the reputation of being very wealthy.</hi>)—we rather gathered that he was financial agent to the firm—he took possession on May 1st, with his wife, his sister, and two children—Taylor told me he could pay £400 a year—they had no servant, his sister acted as servant—he paid the rent up to July 9th and then went away, leaving his wife and family there—I saw him at the end of Sep<lb/>tember,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). In conjunction with Sergeant Williamson I have had charge of this case from the commencement—in August I was keeping Borrows under observation—on August 9th, at 10 p.m., I saw him go into his shop, 63, High Street, Peckham, and come out shortly afterwards with a man who is not here—they went to Hill Street and came back and turned up Rye Lane where they met a man driving a pony and cart—Borrows ran after him, stopped him, and spoke to him; he shook his head, and drove on towards Peckham—Borrows and the other man continued up Rye Lane till they met two men driving a donkey in a costermonger's barrow—Borrows spoke to him, and the others went back to 63, High Street, but Borrows continued up Rye Lane, and went into the Reindeer publichouse—the first two men in the barrow came there, and went in, leaving the barrow outside—I went up to the barrow, and saw two half tea chests in it—the four men came out and got into the barrow, and went up Rye Lane to Crystal Palace Road—on August 15th I got a warrant at Lambeth Police-court to arrest Haydon, Harland, Jackson, Owen, Perry, Borrows, Blackman, and Edwards—on 16th August, about 8.30 a.m., I arrested Haydon at Wyvenhoe Road, Peckham—on the way to the station he said, "Those who have given the references ought to he had, too"—he was searched at the station, and <hi rend="italic">two</hi> letters were found on him from Mr. Burris, of Bristol, and some cards, bearing the name of Holmberg, Lund and Co., Wilson Chambers, 304, Vauxhall Bridge Road, and this card of a manufacturer of margarine—I went in the morning to High Street, Peckham, and remained at the side of the house while Williamson went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189212120127"/>
               <p>into the shop—shortly afterwards Borrows came out at the side entrance, and Williamson arrested him—about 11.30 the same morning I went to 44, Long Lane, Bermondsey, and saw Jarvis—I said, "You are Mr. Blackman?"—he said, "Yes"—I read the warrant to him—he said, "I don't owe anybody a penny except Mr. Hicks, and I have paid him £2"—shortly afterwards he said, "I have got Staab to thank for getting me into this; he owes me £100"—I found a number of documents in the back parlour, and a pass-book of the London and Southwestern Bank, Camberwell branch, issued to H. Blackwell, of 30, Crown Street; the account was opened on March 2nd with £13 10s.; it ends on June 30th—it is all drawn out, but not overdrawn—I found three notes from the bank that the account was overdrawn in March and April, and three counterfoils of June 3rd, 11th, and 15th £7 2s. 6d. each, payable to Oakley and Co.—they appear to be in Salisburys writing—I have seen him write—I also found four returned cheques drawn by Blackman in favour of Borrows, and on a counterfoil an entry of 10s. to Harland; five pawntickets for articles pledged in May, June, and July, one is for trousers and boots—I also found a number of cards of different people, some of Borrows, 63, High Street, Peckham, and of Harland, wholesale grocery and provision merchant, Penge, and of Wright, of Woodville Road; some circulars of Blackman, an envelope with E. Symons, 120, Vestry Road, Camberwell, three cards of Oakley and Co., a writ issued to Crossley for £54, a letter from Mr. Chester; a solicitor, of Bedford Row, and an answer to a letter from Blackman, with a draft of his reply, which, in. my opinion, is Salisburys writing—I found two County Court summonses, and two receipts for rent, purporting to be signed by Smeed, for £6 10s.—I took Blackman to the station, and charged him with Haydon and Borrows—he gave his name as Hugh Jams—about August 25th I got a warrant against Staab, Wright, and Salisbury—I took Salisbury the same day, and said I had a warrant for his apprehension for conspiracy to defraud—he said that there must be a mistake, and asked who laid the information—I said, Mr. Fontheim, of Leeds"—he said, "Why, I have paid them £6,000; they asked me £20 commission at 3d. a sack; can I go to my office in Savage Gardens?"—I said, "Yes"—on the way there ha said, "I must see my bankers and my solictors—when we got there Mr. Eastwood was there—Salisbury took up some letters, opened one, read it, and tore it in two—I got possession of it—it was from Dixon and Sons, millers, of St. Albans, complaining of a dishonoured cheque—I examined the room and found an order-book from Oakley and Co., containing entries of flour supplied to Rice at three different addresses—I took Salisbury to Seething Lane station, where he was detained some time—he gave me his private address, 17, Rock Mead Road, Victoria Park; I went there and found two cards of Mr. Burris's and several notices from the Commercial Bank of Scotland to Salisbury, complaining of over-drawn cheques, a letter from Mr. Burns, of Bristol, and letters from Blackman, Staab, and Stone, a receipt from Staab, and five cheques in favour of Rice, which had been returned cancelled—I took Salisbury to Camberwell Police-station, and on the way there he said, "Who are the others?"—I said, "Rice and Staab are included in the warrant with you; there are four others in custody telling him their names—he said, "But we had nothing to do with them,</p>

               <p>ours is a different matter altogether; I was saying what a good thing it was that those scamps were locked up"—before reaching Camberwell Station he said, "That man Rice is at the bottom of all this, he is a bad man"—I then went with Williamson to 79, Wymondham Road, Camberwell, and afterwords to 37, Edward Street—I saw Charles Crams and went to 122, Woodville Road, another shop of Rice's, and found a large case there filled with packets of tea, which I returned to Bertie Symons—I found some soap locked in a cupboard in a back room—Mrs. Shelton has identified some of it—there was no furniture in the shop, and no one there—on August 31st, about two p.m., I saw Jackson in custody at Peckham Station and read the warrant to him—he said, "I have not conspired with anyone"—he refused his address—on September 5th I found Harland detained there—he said he had no fixed address—on 13th November a warrant was granted against Taylor, and on the 15th I saw him, detained at Walthamstow Police-station—I read the warrant to him—he said, "I have done wrong; I am very sorry; Jackson and Perry have brought me to this; I must suffer for it"—he gave his address 36, Granville Road, Walthamstow—I found three County Court summonses and a number of letters between Taylor and Holmberg, beginning "Dear friend," and one containing a reference dictated by Holmberg—I can say that that is in Holmberg's writing—it tells him what to write about in reply to inquiries—I also found letters from Hennessey to Taylor, and one of February 25th, signed Garrett, about a reference to Taylor, which in my opinion is Hennessey's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Taylor was a very respectable man.</hi>)—I also found this letter from Jackson to Taylor—in another letter Jackson explains how he is going to clear out, and how surprised the landlord will be—I found a number of letters and invoices addressed to Perry, and printed cards of John Von Kempen—just before reaching the station Taylor said, "I have been the dupe of Jackson and Perry, and I am willing to give you all the information I can"—on September 21st I obtained a search warrant, and searched Nightingale's shop. 257. Crystal Palace Road, Dulwich—Williamson" was with me—I said, "Are you Mr. Nightingale, the proprietor of this shop?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "We have twelve men in custody at Lambeth Policecourt charged with conspiring together to obtain goods by false pretences, and from what has come to our knowledge I obtained a search warrant to-day to search your premises"—he said, "I bought some odd goods of Jackson some time ago; a man named Vincent came to me and sold them, and I sent them back to Jackson; that is all the transactions I have had with him; I have never bought any goods from Borrows, but I have sold him some—we searched the back premises, and Sergeant Williamson found a number of tea wrappers labelled "Cattawattie" and "Tit-Bits," on the lead which covered the paper they wore wrapped in—I asked Nightingale if ho had any invoices for the goods—he took a file down and handed me a receipt for soap sold by Harland to Jackson for £36 10s. 4d.—these are cards of Borrows and Harland, a receipt for £4 12s. 6d. from Borrows, and a document, "Wholesale price, 1s. 7d., if you can do with twelve chests, wholesale from 1s. 1d."—there is a receipt in pencil by Jackson for £9 11s. for cheese and other articles, and some counterfoils, one to Borrows for £9 12s. 9d., and another for £10—Nightingale asked if we</p>

(<hi rend="italic">From Holmberg to his wife, stating, "When" you receive this I shall be in Germany; all I have got in my pocket it</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>)—"I found letters and telegrams at Vauxhall Bridge Road between Perry and Morris, Jackson and Taylor, and two letters to Jackson asking for references—I obtained warrants for Perry or Berry and Mathews and Symons, neither of which I have been able to execute.</p>

Inconsequence of complaints made to the police, inquiries were made, and I kept observation on some of the prisoners—on Tuesday, August 9th, I was in the neighbourhood of Crystal Palace Road, about 10.30 p.m., near Borrows' shop—I saw a costermonger's donkey-barrow outside the Reindeer public-house, Rye Lane—I followed it to Crystal Palace Road—two men and Borrows were in the cart; they drove to Nightingale's shop, to the side door—it was then 11.15 p.m.—the shop was shut; Nightingale was standing at the side gate—he assisted Borrows to carry two half-chests into a little room, and the barrow drove away, leaving Borrows in the house—the door was closed, but there is glass in the upper part of it—I looked in, and saw Nightingale there with a small iron case opener opening one of the half-chests—he took out a handful of tea, and placed it in his doublehands; smelt it; placed it back in the chest and after some conversation with Borrows paid him £2 or £3 and silver—Borrows picked the money off the table, put it in his pocket and went away—no one was in the shop but Nightingale and Borrows—there was gas inside, and it was very dark outside—on August 16th I went with Brock well to Borrows' shop, 63, High Street, Peckham—I asked for Borrows, and heard him say to his wife, "Say I am not in"—I went round to the side door where Brockwell was keeping observation—I saw Borrows there, and told him I held a warrant for his arrest—he said, "Come inside"—I read the warrant to him—he said, "The goods which I have had I wanted for the shop; have you got Haydon?"—I said, "Yes"—he said to his daughter, "Go and tell Blackman at once"—his wife then said, "I have told you several times to keep away from Haydon and his gang"—she then said to me, "I have told him to keep away from Haydon, Garland, and that gang many times; they have been in this shop for hours"—he said nothing—I took him to the station—he was charged, and made no reply—I found on him an invoice for two half-chests of tea for £6 15s. 4d. obtained on 14th August from Henry Deacon, tea merchant, of Devonshire Square—I found no half-chests of tea in the shop—Deacon has been subpœnaed, but he is ill—I searched Borrows' shop and found cheques payable to Blackman, four County Court summonses, a receipt from J.

               <p>with a table and chairs in it and flowers—the door opens almost into the road—the end of the room and the, door were about 3 1/2 feet apart—that room leads into the kitchen—Nightingale was as far from me as his Lordship is—there was one gaslight; a strong light—I could riot have seen if the shutter had been fastened on to the door—they were the only two persons I saw there—I should have seen anyone else if they had been there—I should say that the tea-chests were not locked up when they were at the Reindeer—they were not covered up in any way—Brock well is stout, and cannot run, and I had to run about two miles and a half—I told him what I had seen, and took him into the back room, and made Nightingale take the shutter down, while Brockwell stood outside—when Nightingale was arrested the shutter was up—I could see the tea as plainly as I see your brief—it was not small biscuits—I laid the information at the Police-court on September 21st—I know reference was made as to tea being found in the cases—there was only sufficient evidence given to obtain the warrant, it was five o'clock, and the Magistrate wanted to go away—there were five remands—I was called at the end of the case.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Borrows.</hi> It is a good two miles from Rice's door to Nightingale's shop—the counter is nearly as long as the shop—there are three narrow tables—the parlour door was open which leads to the shop—when Brockwell came he said he had a warrant for you, and you said, "Come inside"; you did not say, "I have had no goods"—when I got outside, your wife was in the parlour, and a girl about six years old, and another girl, and there was a girl in the shop—I found no letter on you.</p>

I have lived at 68, Ordnance Row, with my uncle for about two years—I am a stevedore's labourer and work in the docks—I believe I have worked with a man of the name of Morris—there are a lot named Morris—I heard of Morris's arrest for being in possession of stolen stamps—Morris's wife came round on one occasion as I was going out; that was after her husband's arrest—I made a statement about this to the police—I did not see Mrs. Morris when she came; I was going out as she came in—I had worked with Morris as a stevedore—a gentleman came round to see me—I went before the Magistrate; I think the prisoner was the man I saw there—some time before the arrest a man spoke to me about going into the docks with him one night; the prisoner looks like the man—I said before the Magistrate, "I know the prisoner, and have done so for eighteen months, by the name of Little Ben"—the man is much altered; I should not like to swear he is the man now—I knew Little Ben; he had no whiskers—when I went before the Magistrate the first time it was Little Ben I was speaking of—I have heard him called Ben Morris—I work as stevedore's labourer, and to clean ships' bottoms—I have on occasions worked with the prisoner—I remember hearing of the prisoner's arrest; three weeks or a month before hearing of the arrest I had a conversation with him—he spoke to me about going into the dock with him—he asked me if I would take a walk with him; he said I should come to no harm—I was looking for a ship—I was to do nothing that I know of—he said something about looking out—he said I should come to no harm; all I had to do was to look out; something of that sort—I did not consent to go with him; I could not go—after that, on a Monday morning, he said that the day before he had had the longest three hours he had ever spent in his life—he said, "We had a drink and went in as lightermen"—he boasted that he had got about £2,000 of foreign paper money, and he would take £50 for it if he could get it—he did not talk about going abroad—I was trying to get to sea—nothing was said about forging papers and going to sea—the man who had this conversation with me was not going to forge the papers for me; that is what I said myself—I believe Morris also wanted to go to sea, and wanted papers to do so—the first time I gave evidence and was cross-examined I did not nod to the prisoner when I came into Court—it was not said in Court that I did—the prisoner's wife called on me before I gave evidence at all, for me to sign a paper for money—I did not see the prisoner till 1st December—he had been in custody from 24th August till 1st December before I gave evidence—when I first went into the Police-court I was flurried, and I never took notice of the prisoner to speak of—I believed the man I gave evidence about was the man I knew as Little Morris—I never heard of the name of Bracket—I hare never seen him at my uncle's place, but I believe he used to visit there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> To the best of my belief the first conversation was when he asked me to walk to the docks—I said I believed he used to visit my uncle's house; I don't think I ever saw him there—previous to that—I had never, to my knowledge, walked with him—I only knew him</p>

               <p>as a workman—I believe I had seen him before—the conversation about foreign paper took place in the East India Dock Road—there were a lot of people passing; a lot of people were out of work at the time—there might have been 500, for what I know; they were looking for work—I was there looking for work, and so was the prisoner—I cannot say if I spoke to half-a-dozen other people on that occasion—other people were about when we had our conversation, and might have heard it—I knew the men that were round us—I did not believe what he told me; it struck me for a moment, but I took no more notice of it—I did not tell my uncle anything of it, although he was a friend of the prisoner—I don't think I mentioned the conversation when I heard of the arrest—I am not sure I did not; I don't believe I did—I had not, to my knowledge, mentioned it before hearing of the prisoner's arrest—I made a statement to the detective who came to me—he. asked me a number of questions, and it was from my answers that he took down my statement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My statement was read over to me, and I signed it—I did not want to go to the docks with the prisoner—I was afraid I should get into a bother, because you are not allowed in the docks—I refused to go with him into the docks on Sunday, because I was afraid I should get into a bother—I think I said so before the Magistrate—I fix the date as Monday because we were clean—I have no idea what the prisoner meant when he told me—I did not ask him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Sergeant</hi>). On 24th August, about a quarter to seven, I was standing outside the Canning Town Railway Station—I saw the prisoner alone—in a minute or two he was joined by a woman, who handed him a large brown-paper parcel—he spoke and handed her back the parcel, and came into the station and took a ticket—the woman rejoined him in the station, and handed him the parcel—he went along the passage, and was going downstairs to the platform, when I stopped him and said, "We are police-officers: what have you in that parcel?"—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "I want to see"—he said, "Very well"—I took him into the ticket—collector's box, and opened the parcel and found it contained stamps—I said, "Where did you get these from?"—he said, "A short, stout gentleman asked me to carry it from Kurtz's"—that is the Bridge House Hotel, about forty yards from the station—I said, "Your answers are very unsatisfactory, and I shall take you to the station"—I did so—I first charged him with unlawful possession—he was asked his name and address; he said he was engaged to carry them for a short stout gentleman—he gave the name of Benjamin Lawrence, Fivehorn Street, Bromley-by-Bow—we inquired, and found it was a false address—the parcel contained 239,000 and odd stamps—120 were loose—each sheet contains 240 stamps—pieces of <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's</hi> newspapers were between each 100, showing that they had been counted, and these pieces of paper put in.</p>
