                  </hi>. I live at 19, Alfred Mews, Tottenham Court Road—I have lived there for about eight years past—I am by business a carman—I have got some vans of my own—I keep some in the coach-house and one outside—I had up to Christmas last in my employ a man named Barnes—on Saturday night, October 30th, I had to pay Barnes—on the evening of that day I was in the Apollo public-house from a little after nine till ten with Barnes—I remained there up till nearly ten o'clock—I left there alone—we came outside and we parted there—Barnes went home, and I went home—I walked towards Alfred Mews on my way home—we had a few words, or rather spoke to one another, and then separated, and each went home—I know a Mrs. Lear—I do not remember seeing her on that night—on my way up to the Mews I did not speak to anybody—when I got to the corner of the Mews I turned in—as far as I know there was nobody else in the Mews except a constable—he was the first person I saw, and the last one—up to the time I saw the constable I had not had any disturbance with anybody at all—when I first saw the constable he was standing with his back to the premises of He witsons and Milner's—his face would be towards me—he was about three or four feet away from me when I first saw him and just at the entrance of the Mews—I spoke to him, I asked him if he had been his round and done his duty, and turned the lodgers and roughs and lay-abouts out of the Mews—the lay-abouts come down the Mews—he asked me who I was talking to, and I said, "To my superior, I suppose"—he was in uniform, and he had his lantern in front of him, and as soon as I said "I suppose, my superior," I was down on the floor—I was about two yards from the kerb at the side of the Mews, about nine or ten yards from the entrance to the Mews—that is all I recollect—his lantern was in front of him, but I do not know if it was fastened to-his belt or in his hands—there was no light coming from it then—the lamp was just by his belt—it was not alight then—there was a little light in it when I first saw him, only a little glimmer—I cannot tell if at that time it was fastened in his belt or in his. hand—the blow was struck in the face, on the left side—I fell then—I do not know if I was struck more than once, but I fancy there was one in the jaw—the next thing I remember was being at the hospital—I think that was on Tuesday—I am not able to recognize the constable who struck me on that night, I did not take any notice—as far as I can tell I had never seen him before, he was a stranger to me—I do not recollect my wife coming to see me on the Sunday morning. (<hi rend="italic">Inspector Boothman and Sergeant Brown are here called in.</hi>) I see those two men—I do not remember them coming to me on the Sunday morning—I do not recollect</p>

               <p>any persons putting questions to me, and my giving answers to them, on the Sunday morning—Inspector Shannon was the first officer I remember seeing after this occurred to me—I cannot say if that was on the Tuesday, he was the first officer I saw at the hospital—I remember a Magistrate coming to me at the hospital, and taking my statement—that was on November 12th—I do not know if it was December 8th that I attended at Bow Street police-court, and was examined, it was the first day I left the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I went into the Mews I saw the constable with his back to Hewetson's premises—their warehouse is at the entrance of the Mews—he was standing with his back to the wall as I passed in front of him—the warehouses at the corner are Hewitson's—when I met the policeman he was at the block of buildings just at the Corner of the Mews—it was not at that spot where we exchanged the words which I have said—he walked further up towards me—I was walking down towards my house—I passed by him and spoke to him, and then he followed me down the Mews—the conversation and the blow was the work of a moment—when I was struck the one blow, on the side of the face, I fell and became unconscious—from the injuries I received I supposed that there had been other blows as well—I do not remember before being put on the ambulance speaking to my wife—it would not be correct to say that I partially recovered, sat up, and spoke to my wife—I remember making a statement to Inspector Shannon when he saw me at the hospital—I saw him there more than once—there were other persons with him—I do not know the prisoner—I cannot say if he was there with the Inspector—I do not know if I saw Shannon at the hospital on another occasion besides that time when there were other people with him—I do not remember saying to Shannon, "about nine or ten o'clock on Saturday night last, I was in Alfred Mews, near my house, I saw a constable, who I could not recognize—I said to him, "Have you done your duty, have you cleared the roughs out"—he said, who are you talking to—I said, to my superior—shortly after that he landed me with two or three—I then fell and remember no more—I do not remember saying that to. Inspector Shannon when there were other people with him—on the night that I was taken to the hospital I did not tell the doctor that I had been assaulted at 9.30—I do not remember Dr. Wills asking me how I had got my injuries—I do not remember saying that a policeman did it—I am not aware that my wife came up to me and asked who did it—I cannot say if I told her a policeman did it—I do not remember her saying that she saw him speaking to me—I do not remember baying anything to the police officers or answering any questions—I do not remember them coming—I did not see anybody on Sunday morning or know anybody—the swelling on my cheeks prevented me from seeing out of my eyes—I did not answer questions, and an officer did not read anything over to me or ask me if it was right. I do not recollect hearing this read in the hospital, "I do not know who it was assaulted me but there were several of them. The row began in Tottenham Court Road and finished up in the mews. I do not know how the injuries were caused but expect it was by the boot—I suppose they kicked me when I was down, I am sure there was more than due who assiuted me, it occured between Frances</p>

I do not recollect hearing my wife speaking to me, I do not remember seeing her on the Sunday evening—I cannot say if I saw her to speak to in the hospital before I saw Inspector Shannon and the other people—the only person who was there was the nurse—I remember making a statement to the Magistrate in addition to the statement to the Inspector—I said to the Magistrate at Bow Street that his lantern was in his belt or in his hand—I also said I saw a glimmer in the lantern—I said that to Inspector Shannon at the hospital, not at Bow Street—I said before the Magistrate, "to-day is the first time I have said I saw the lamp alight"—I had said it to Inspector Shanon—I remember being a witness at Bow Street—I did not then say, "to-day is the first time I have said I saw the lamp alight"—I did not say at the court," when I first saw the constable I believe he had his light in his hand. To-day is the first time I have seen the lamp alight"—I was not asked anything at the hospital about his lamp being alight—I have been charged at Bow Street for assault—the prosecutor was Harris—I had applied to Mr. Harris for payment—we had a war—the war took the shape of my striking him a swinging blow in the eye in the presence of a constable, who Mr. Harris had fetched in—he fetched the constable in, but we had an "up and downer" in the yard first—Harris got me on the floor—when I was charged at Bow Street I was fined £4—That was the occasion on which Sir James Vaughan cautioned me—at the bottom of the Mews there is a company called the French Wreath Company—Mr. Harris is a French Polisher—he calls himself so—his men would have to carry loads of furniture down the Mews—I have never drawn my van across the road so that they had to wait till I let them go by—Harris has not complained of my doing that—I have thrown sand at Mr. Harris's men once—they threw broken bottles and brushes at me a good many times, that was over a lad who was working in the Mews—I have also been charged with assault, and with having hit the prosecutor a swinging blow in the eye, in the presence of a constable—I have sometimes been threatened by men in the Mews, I cannot say a good many times—that is not the occasion I am answering here—I said at Bow Street, "I have never struck men or boys with a strap in the face, I have not thrown flower-pots at their heads, I dropped one near their heads by mistake"—I do not know if I am liked down the neighbourhood—there are very likely a good many men in the neighbourhood who don't like me—some police don't like me—I don't know, I like the police very well—I said, "The police don't like me and I don't like them."</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital I was there when Joseph Cowell was brought in at 10.30 p.m. on October 30th on an ambulance by two constables—I made a superficial examination at first, and afterwards examined him more carefully—he was conscious, sitting up in a chair, and bleeding slightly from the nose—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189801100012"/>
               <p>I found his left cheek bone and the frontal bone broken, as well as the nose—the wounds were not likely to have been caused by the fist—great violence must have been used—the lens of the lantern produced might have caused them—there must have been two blows, possibly three—the blows might have produced concussion of the brain—not necessarily at once—or there might have been a slight concussion which might disap<lb/>pear and return later—he appeared fully to understand what I said—I asked him, in the presence of the constables, "How did you come by those injuries?"—he said, "A policeman did it," but he could not identify the policeman—I asked him if he knew him, and he said "No"—his wife came in and asked him who did it—he said, "The policeman did it" She said, "Yes, I know he did, because I saw him speaking to you"—then I stopped the conversation, and asked her to step back while I examined him more carefully—the wounds required to come from some<lb/>thing curved—had the blows come from something quite flat, the skin would probably have been broken, and there would have been a mark on the edges—in my opinion, the wounds were caused by a fall—they are on different sides—I asked him when the policeman did it, and he said 9.30—he did not seem quite sure, but something after nine, he mentioned—the case was handed over to Dr. Mudd.</p>

I am house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital—I saw Cowell about 10.45 p.m. on October 30th, about a quarter of an hour after he had been admitted—his left cheek bone was broken up, the frontal bone was injured, the nasal bones were broken—the injury to the cheek bone required considerable violence—the lens of the lamp might very well cause it—I am of that opinion because with most blows like that the skin is stiff and a surface blow would very likely cause a bleeding of the skin, although of a force to break the bone—the injuries were not like likely to have been caused by a fall—I have had a lantern brought to me—I have tried it and find it would go out as the result of a blow—I saw him again at twelve, and at four o'clock, and at ten the next day—I saw him shortly after Inspector Boothman had seen him—I do not think he was in a condition to make any sworn statement—he appeared dazed, and required a great deal of rousing to make him speak intelligibly—concussion would produce that condition, or there might be a good deal of bleeding inside the skull—I do not think I would have consented to his making a statement—there was no evidence to show he was drunk.</p>

It occurred between Francis Street and our yard"—I wrote the statement at the ward table from my memory of his answers—when I read it and asked him to sign it, he said, "I cannot see"—Brown was then close to me—Arnold, a patient, was paying attention to what was going on, and I turned to him as an independent party who had heard Cowell's answers, he being close enough, and listened, and I handed him the Statement, then read it for Cowell—Arnold and Brown signed it—I asked for the doctor before I left the hospital, but was told he was not available—I heard no caution from any nurse against questioning Cowell—I returned to the station where I was in charge till two p.m., when I informed Inspector Sutherland of the case—he was my superior, the sub-divisional inspector—when I came on duty at six a.m. I had seen the prisoner's written report in the book—I had nothing else when I went to the Mews—I gave that paper to Sutherland and acquainted him verbally with the whole of the circumstances—on the Sunday afternoon I went to the hospital to see Dr. Mudd, and was then told he was out—I went again on the Monday morning, being told that was the best time, and saw Dr. Mudd—I also reported on Monday, November 1st, to Chief Inspector Shannon—I asked Cowell if he knew that he had said the night before that the police had done it—he said, "No, I do not"—I said, "Well, you said last night that the policeman did it"—he replied, "Oh, if I did, that must be wrong"—I put his words down as near as I could remember a few minutes after he had spoken them—he appeared to be paying attention when I read them over—I did not then know his wife had accused any person—I knew that on the Sunday, because she had told me—I reported that to Sutherland when I gave up the written statement—she said she came downstairs immediately and found him on the ground—she showed me the window where she saw the policeman, but it was at an angle, and we concluded, having this statement, that she must have been mistaken—he surprised me the next morning when he said the policeman had nothing to do with it—he appeared fit to make a statement, to know what he was talking about, or I should not have taken it—I put the questions to him, but I had no knowledge it would develop into so serious a matter, I was simply endeavouring to find out the truth—I knew the injuries were severe because he was in the hospital—I knew the charge was that a policeman had done it, and that the wife practically suggested it must have been the policeman on the beat—I knew no other policeman who could have done it—after his wife had said it was a police<lb/>man and that she had actually seen a policeman before the man was knocked down I was astonished he should state that no policeman was there—she did not know the nature of the injuries, and I thought she was speaking to the best of her judgment—before I went to the hospital Mrs. Cowell had accused the man who went for the ambulance—I had had that in the report from the constable—I had heard from King on the Sunday morning what Mrs. Cowell had said to him that it was the man on the beat, but he said Cowell had said at the hospital it was at</p>

On my arrival there a woman came down the Mews and said, 'That is my husband, turn your light on, and do not stand there looking.' I had not got my lamp alight. Mrs. Cowell went into the house to get some matches, as I could not find mine. When she returned she said, 'Go and fetch the ambulance, someone will have to answer for this,' I went for the ambulance, and with the assistance of Police-constable King (351), took him to the Middlesex Hospital. As we were getting him on the ambulance Mrs. Cowell took a bottle from him, which appeared to be a bottle of whisky. On arrival at the hospital he was examined by Dr. Mudd, house surgeon, who stated that he was suffering from a fractured malar bone on left side, and a compound fracture of frontal bone, fore<lb/>head, on right side of head. Detained at 10.30 Brodrip Ward, No. 2 bed. Patient stated, when questioned by Dr. Mudd, that he had had an altercation with a police-constable, and further stated that he received his injuries at 9.30 p.m., that they were done by a police<lb/>man, of whom no description can be given.

As he uttered those words I put them down as they are written here—Dr. Mudd and Inspector Sutherland were present—the prisoner made no reply—I accompanied the prisoner to Tottenham Court Road police-station—I said to him there "In consequence of what the man Cowell has said, and the statement of Mrs. Cowell, I must charge you"—he said "I am innocent, and an innocent man has nothing to fear"—I had had a statement from Mrs. Cowell, and had made full inquiry into it—about 6.30 or seven p.m. I said, "You had better get the lantern you carried on the Saturday night"—he brought One from the lantern room and said, "That is mine"—and that is the lantern on the register allotted to that beat—the practice is to go to the Mews in the day and look, but not examine it unless there is anything to Call the attention of the constable on duty—from ten p.m. the constable on duty is supposed to examine every inch of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is nothing en the lantern to indicate that it has been used for an unlawful purpose only the marks of ordinary usage—I got Cowell's statement to Boothman about six p.m. on Monday when I saw Mrs. Cowell at the station—I sent for the prisoner and Mrs. Cowell—Boothman was present not Brown—Mrs. Cowell said she looked out at the window and there was nobody in the Mews except her husband and the policeman in uniform—the prisoner admitted that—she said she saw her husband standing facing the policeman—I did not interrogate her that night—she made the statement and I wrote it down—I did not suggest anything to her no more than to tell me all she saw—I did not caution the prisoner nor say "The less you say the batter—at that time I did not consider the nature of the charge against the prisoner—after the charge was taken the prisoner commenced questioning the prosecutrix and I said "The charge has been taken against you, you had better ask those questions before the Magistrate in the usual course"—the inquiry was going on from about eight till 10.30 p.m.—I saw Doctor Mudd at the hospital about twelve p.m. and he told me Cowell was not in a condition to be seen; that he was wandering—I went the next day about two, and again on Tuesday afternoon when I saw the doctor—Sutherland was with me—I did not see Cowell then nor before he made a statement in the prisoner's presence—Boothman was not then with me.</p>

"Take it, I am all right"—I caught him, and did not lose sight of him for a second—as we fell he kicked me on my stomach with his knee—my watch was worth 50s.—I had only had two glasses of ale that night.</p>

They said, "Yes"—they made no answer to the charge at the station—I went to Lee's address on the 10th with P.C. Gillard—we went into two rooms on the second floor at the back—he occupied them both with his wife—in one room there was a drawer, Gillard looked into it and took from it this gimlet—I did not see where he got it but he handed it to me and he came from the direction of the drawer—the address is No. 5, Milton Road, Euston Road—I was present when Colborne tried it in the hole in the post and it fitted—that would have been a very secure way on fastening the door.</p>

I live at 22, Venables Street, Lisson Grove—I am a labourer—the prisoner is my brother—for some months before September 10th I was a lodger in my brother's house at 30, Palmerston Road, Kilburn—on August Bank Holiday my brother and I had a quarrel—we were both the worse for drink—he told me to leave the lodging and clear out of the house—he afterwards asked me to return, and I did so—I was not in the house on the night of September 10th—before I left that day I saw my brother and his wife—I had some ordinary talk with them—I wished them good morning—I did not go back that night—speaking generally I was on very good terms with my brother—he has never accused me of improper intimacy with his wife—that has never taken place between us.</p>

At about 10.15 that night the prisoner looked into my room—he spoke to me but I did not notice any<lb/>thing strange in his appearance at that time—he asked me how I was, he went up to his room then—I noticed nothing strange about him—he seemed as if he had had a little drink but not much—after he had been gone about five minutes he came down again to where I was—he asked me if I would go up to his room—I said no, I did not care about it then I wanted to get to bed—he said, "Come up for a few minutes, I want to speak to you"—I then went up to his room with him—on going in I saw the little boy Willie—there was no one else there—the prisoner told the little boy to go and get a pint of porter and a pint of ale—the boy went—the prisoner said, "This is all right, nothing to eat, nothing to drink, and no one to speak to"—by that time the little boy had returned with some porter, some ale, and some fish was on the table—I said, "It is all right, Jim; here is some ale and some fish"—he got up and gave me some ale—he drank some himself—outside the room, down some steps, there is a water-closet—the little boy went towards the water-closet—after a short time the prisoner went down to the water-closet himself—he said, "Annie, come out"—his wife replied, "After you go up into your own room I will come out"—he came back into the room and took a chopper and went down to the water-closet again—he hit the door three times with the chopper, splitting one of the panels—after which he returned to the room—the wife then came into the room—she sat down between the table and bed, which was in the room—the children were in the room at the time—the prisoner asked me to pour out some ale—I said, "No, it is your place to pour it out"—he poured out some ale then, he handed me a glass and I drank, and he drank too—he then said, "This is all right after being married for fifteen years, and not having had connection with your wife for a month—he then exposed himself to me, and I told him I did not understand it, and asked him to be quiet—he said that his b—dirty brother had given her the dirt, and she had given it to him—I asked him to be quiet—his wife did not say anything—he got up from his chair and punched her in the face with his fist, and pulled her hair—I don't remember him saying anything at the time—I interfered, and pulled him away from his wife, back to the chair which he had left—he then took a chopper out of the fender and said he would chop her b—head off, it was the same chopper he had taken down to the water-closet—he then went towards his wife—he raised it as if he would strike her, I went towards him and again inter<lb/>fered, and took the chopper from him—he then took a wooden mallet from the coal-box behind the door, and said he would knock her b—brains out—he went towards her, and I again interfered, and took it away from him and put it with the chopper in the fender—I do not remember if he drank anything more—I asked him to be quiet and he said he would—the room was lighted by a lamp, and he said, "George, the lights are now growing</p>

I am a stableman—on September 10th, I was living at 30, Palmerston Road, in a room next to that occupied by the prisoner and his wife—on the night of September 10th I went to bed, and about 12.30 in the early morning I heard a noise as of some scuffling in the prisoner's room—I knocked at the wall—the prisoner came out of his room—I went out and saw him, and asked him to leave off—he said he would go and keep quiet, and leave off; he did not know he was disturbing me—there had been some noise coming from the room before, but not the same—there was quiet for half an hour, and then the noise re<lb/>commenced and continued for a considerable time, up to three o'clock, then there was quiet again till 4.45 a.m., when I was awakened by Mrs. Harris's voice calling out, "Mr. Young, Mr. Young, murder! murder!"—I jumped out of bed, and went to the door of the prisoner's room—it was unfastened—I went into the room, and as I did so the prisoner's two little children ran out of the room—the little girl was bleeding from the side of the head—when I got into the room I saw Mrs. Harris on the side of the bed, which was in its usual position—the prisoner was behind the door kneeling, and he seemed to be feeling for something near the coal-box—I said, "I will soon stop this"—I went to my own room, put on my clothes, went down stairs to Mr. King, who lived two doors off, and as I was ringing him up, my fellow-lodger came to Mr. King's door—together we fetched a policeman, and went back with him to the house—on arriving at the door of the prisoner's room it was locked from the inside—I went to fetch more assist<lb/>ance, and when I got back the door had been broken open—I stood at the door—the woman was lying on the ground, and the prisoner was lying straight across her—the bedstead had been overturned—the woman was dead and the prisoner very severely injured.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition of William Harris was read as follows:</hi>—"I am 10 years old. I am the son of the prisoner. I am now in the Hampstead Workhouse Schools. On September 10th I lived at 30, Palmerston Road, on that morning the prisoner did not go to work—he went out at eight, returning about ten o'clock. I do not remember his bringing anything home. He washed up the things and I wiped them. He said he should be home to dinner at twelve o'clock. He returned at one o'clock to dinner; we had then finished dinner. I remember getting home at five p.m. to tea; the prisoner was then at home. He went out, and came back about ten o'clock. When he returned mother and sister were in the lavatory; I was up in the room. The prisoner sent me for a pint of porter and a pint of ale; the ale was to be in a can, and the porter in a bottle. He then sent me out for some fish and potatoes, the prisoner had had, some beer and fish; my mother called to me and I went downstairs to the w.c.; my sister and mother were there; the door was locked. The prisoner then came down with a chopper and burst open the door. We all went up to our room. Mr. Brown then came up. The prisoner said he would kill my mother; he took up a chopper. Mr. Brown stopped him. I and my sister went to sleep. I was aroused at five o'clock in the morning by the prisoner striking me on the head, Sack, and shoulder with the chopper; I was bruised. He then hit my sister on the head, cutting it open. I took my sister out, and called Mr. Brown, and I saw no more. I have heard father and mother quarrel, both when he was drunk and sober; when he quarrelled he used to swear. I was not fond of him when he quarrelled. I had seen the chopper before; he never struck me before with it."</p>

                  </hi>, M.D.—I live at St. James's Mansions, West Hampstead—on September 11th I was acting as divisional surgeon for West Hampstead—about six a.m. on that day I was called to 30, Palmerston Road—in the back room on the first floor I found a woman lying dead; her head was towards the fireplace, and quite close to it—the floor near where her neck lay was covered with blood—an iron bedstead in the room had been turned on its side, and a portion of it was resting on her leg; she was pinned by the bedstead to the floor—I subsequently made an examination of the woman—I found a superficial incised wound through the skin and over the left side of the chest, above the breast—there was a wound in her neck extending vertically from the middle of the neck upwards and backwards to the base of the skull, cutting through all the larger structures of the neck—it was a very large and deep wound, and one that must have been given with very great force—the cause of death was hæmorrhage from that wound, and death must have been very rapid—this small knife might have caused the cut on the chest and the wound on the neck; 'one single movement of the knife beginning at the chest andrunning upwards to the neck would cause the two wounds—assuming the wounds to have been inflicted after the bedstead was overturned the effect of the overturning would have been to have pinned the woman under the bedstead, and she could not have offered any resistance; she was lying face downwards on the ground, and the bedstead was on one of her legs, and she could not move possibly—my attention was also turned to the prisoner, who was in the room when I arrived there—he was being supported by Sergeant Brown, who was trying to staunch the blood coming from a wound in his throat—it turned out to be a very deep wound, and the effect was to completely divide the windpipe—if the bleeding had not been stopped the effect of it would have been fatal in a short time—the prisoner was insensible from the hæmorrhage—I attended to the wound and got a tracheometry tube and inserted it into the windpipe, and the prisoner was able to breathe through it, the hæmorrhage having been arrested—I got some brandy and brought him back to consciousness—I noticed the front of his trousers was unbuttoned—he made a motion as if he wished to produce his person—I made no examination, but directed his removal to the infirmary—I did not see him again—my attention was directed at the same time to the children—there was a slight injury to the boy's shoulder such as would have been occasioned by the flat side of this chopper—the girl lay on the bed in a dazed condition—I found an incised wound on the scalp at the top of the head, penetrating to the bone, and two inches long; a con<lb/>siderable amount of blood had flowed from it—I dressed that wound—in my opinion her dazed condition was due to concussion of the brain—I caused both children to be removed to the workhouse infirmary—no doubt the prisoner's injury was self-inflicted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dental surgeon, of 7, Wimpole Street—on December 20th Captain Meilvane owed me £22 1s.—I did not receive a cheque—this is not my endorsement, nor did I authorize anybody to endorse it—the prisoner was employed at Mrs. Hawkins'. where I was; I never authorized him to change the cheque—there are five female servants.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, of 121, Trafalgar Street, Walworth Road—on October 16th I was living at 3, Temple Street, St. George's Road—on that day, about eleven p.m., I was with Mr. Finch in the Lord Nelson, Trafalgar Street—I had met him about nine pan.—the Lord Nelson is about 12 or 13 minutes' walk from the Elephant and Castle—I had two <hi rend="italic">ponies</hi> of bitter in the Lord Nelson—that is about half a pint—I left the Lord Nelson about 11.30, quite sober, with Finch—I said "Good night" to Finch at his door in Trafalgar Street, and went towards home—I had nothing more to drink—I lived with Carrie Jones, in Temple Street—since this case commenced I have been charged with her abduction—as I was going down the Walworth Road, towards the Elephant and Castle, I saw three young women going round Short Street, leading from Walworth Road—Carrie Jones, Louisa Jones, and Rosa Cook—I knew them—Carrie was first, Louisa next, and then Rosa Cook—they went towards the elephant, and crossed the road—I went and spoke to Carrie Jones—I was immediately arrested, from behind me—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189801100036"/>
               <p>there was no more disturbance than there is now—Cook pulled Carrie away from me—she may have talked rather loud, but there was no screaming—I could not see who arrested me, two constables I suppose—I heard a heavy voice, from a constable, say, "We want you"—I was pulled, and received a kick on the right ankle—I fell in the constables' arms—I felt faint, I could not stand—I said, "What have I done?"—the constables said, "Come on," pulling me up again—I was dragged towards the station—I heard Carrie say, "Let him go, he has not done nothing"—there were a few people round and a bit of a noise, and I was picked up by the ankles by two more constables—one constable had one hand on my collar and another on my wrist—I was carried face downwards, with my head first—two constables held me by my ankles and two by my wrists—both wrists were being held—the constable removed his hand from the collar to the wrist—I was carried a good distance—I said, "I should like to walk"—I heard two or three people say, "Put the man down"—I was put down to walk, but I could not, I was knocked about too much—they proceeded with me in the same style—I was again taken face downwards—I was put down to walk two or three yards, then turned on my back—a large crowd gathered—a constable put his knee into my groin, causing me pain—I could tell he was a constable by his clothes—that caused me to faint—I recollect coming to when I was held up in the dock at the station by two constables—I was in a fainting condition, having no recollection—I asked for a drop of water—I felt myself going off again, a nasty feeling—then I found myself on the floor—I felt a hand lift my eyelid up—I was lifted and taken into a small room—two constables sat me near a table—I saw a gentleman come in with a box with two handles and place it in front of me, and put tubes to my neck—I was very weak, but I jumped up and said, "Oh, do not do it any more"—I felt worse—it hurt me—I was taken into a cell and sat on a seat—the doctor came, and I said a few words to him—five or six years ago I was in trouble with the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know the constables—the kick on my ankle was with too much force to be an accident, even if the constable was pushed by the crowd—at twelve o'clock at night the Borough is a rough place—I was not rough—I have been forced to fight as a boxing man at an exhibition 25 rounds—I am married—I was not brought to Rodney Street police-station for assaults and violence to my wife—I was summoned and bound over to keep the peace at Kennington Lane, and charged with not supporting her—I have been charged with attempting to rescue a man in custody named Fenn, and throwing a policeman on his head by getting between his legs—I got away, but they knew where to find me, and I was arrested from the house where they took Fenn—three policemen took me to the station—I got 21 days—I was charged with having a costermonger's barrow in my possession which was not my property—for that I got a month—that is five or six years back—I am 25 years of age—the cause of this trouble, Carrie Jones, had been living with me at different addresses—at 3, and at 41, Temple Street—we were not turned out of No. 41—there were no complaints of rows—we left because she saw someone she liked better—this is the first I have heard of her com<lb/>plaining that I assaulted her—I did not leave her with her face bruised</p>

Connor, of 2, Old Kent Road—Mr. Connor gave me a good character before the Magistrate—I had met Carrie Jones of a night in the Walworth Road, and at Mills' public-house, between 10.30 and twelve p.m.—she asked me to have a drink—I afterwards went to live with her for several months, till October 16th—she went away and left a note on the table—I was charged with abduction—previous to October 16th I had been to the mother's house—I was talking to these girls on the refuge when I was taken—the girls did not go away before I was arrested.</p>

I was Prince Richard last Friday night, and saw the manager, but it is not settled yet. I missed the 'bus and had to walk home on Saturday—eight miles; I was quite done up. I did not know I had a home to go to till last Tuesday. I enclose a letter from my little sister. You will see I am not a liar. If the fund does not help another once I shall have to starve or die. I have done all I can to get an engagement, and have tried all the gentlemen in London to get me one, but have not got one yet, Thanking you for your very great kindness, I am, yours faithfully, R. A. Prince."—"To C. I. Colston, Esq. Dear Sir,—I shall not get another engagement in London now. The ship goes to-day; and as they have been so kind to me they might pay my fare if you will ask them.—Yours faithfully, R. A. Prince. The fare is 15s., and I will go to-day if I can get the money.—(<hi rend="italic">there were also several other letters</hi>)—I think he received on November 10th, £1; on November 27th, 10s.; on December 2nd, £1; and on December 9th, 10s.—I obtained from him receipts for those different amounts—I saw him myself from time to time—on every occasion I handed him the money myself—I had no knowledge of him except seeing him personally at the office—he told me he had played at the Adelphi—I saw him at the door on December 16th, but did not speak to him—my clerk spoke to him.</p>

I saw another knife in the room—he got up very late in the day, and was then in and out several times—he was engaged in writing—that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife I saw in his room—I saw it there on more than one occasion—I saw it about a week before his arrest—I saw it on the dressing-table when I was tidying the room—he was not there, then—he paid his rent regularly up to the last fortnight—when he got in arrears., with his rent I asked him about it, and he asked me to wait for a few days—I did wait for a few days, and it came to the Sunday, he spoke to-me about it himself—he said, "Mrs. Darby, can you wait till Thursday?" I said, "Yes;" he said, "I will give you the two weeks, together, on Thursday"—he said he expected a letter from his sister, and it would be one way or the other—I did not understand what he meant; I said, "Mr. Prince, what do you mean?"—he said, "That is best known, to God and man"—that conversation was on the Sunday before his-arrest—until he was owing me this rent he seemed to be pretty cheerful—he conducted himself like a gentleman—he received a great many letters—I did not know he was pawning his clothes, I noticed that they were gradually disappearing—on Thursday, the 16th, he went out about two o'clock—I saw him again at 3.45—he came and spoke to me—it was between 3.45 and 4.15—he knocked at the door and said, "Can I speak to you," I said, "Yes," he said, "I am sorry I have not got any money for you, what shall I do," I said, "I don't know, Mr. Prince, I am very sorry for you," I saw him no more then—he asked me for some hot water, and I said I had not got any—that was the last I saw of him till he was in custody—he told me he was looking for employment—he had some meals in his room—he made tea there—he spoke to me about having gone to church on Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Surveyor and live at 44, Talbot Road, Bays-water—I knew the late Mr. William Terries all his life—on the afternoon of December 16th I was with him at his residence in Prince's Street, Hanover Square—about seven in the evening we went from there in a cab to the corner of Maiden Lane; we there got out of the cab and walked to the door of the Adelphi Theatre in Maiden Lane—I did not notice anyone near the door—Mr. Terriss said to me "Wait a minute Harry till I get my keys"—he then took his keys from his pocket and stooped slightly to put his key in the door, and while he was doing that somebody rushed from across the road and struck him two blows most rapidly on the back—I thought at first they were given in good fellowship and it occurred to me how exceedingly rough the act of friendship was—Terriss turned round instantly, and the man then struck a third blow in Mr. Terriss' chest—Mr. Terriss said "My God, I am stabbed"—the man then backed into the road, I followed—I did not at that moment know what had been done—there were cries of "murder" and "police"—I followed the man and never lost sight of him for a moment—a constable came up and I said "I charge this man with stabbing Mr. Terriss"—I cannot say exactly how far he had got from the door of the theatre when the constable came up, it was some little distance—I and the constable went with the prisoner to the police-station; the prisoner walked very quiety, he was in the middle and the constable and I were on either side of him—he said nothing when I gave him in charge—on the way to the station I said to the prisoner "What could have induced you to do such a cruel deed"—he said "Mr. Terriss would not allow me to have any employment, and I did it," either "in revenge," or "by way of revenge," I am not quite certain which—when the prisoner was charged at the station I returned to the theatre, and found Mr. Terriss lying at the foot of the stairs, he was dying then, and he died in my presence shortly afterwards—the prisoner was speaking to the constable on the way to the station, and I heard him use the word "blackmailing," but it was in a disjointed way.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector E</hi>). On the night of 16th I went to the room at 16, Eaton Court, after the prisoner's arrest—I there found this envelope in the handwriting of Mr. Terriss, also this printed list of subscribers to the Actors' Benevolent Fund and some manuscript which appeared to be theatrical plays—I looked through the list of subscribers, and amongst them found Mr. William Terriss' name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been making inquiries in this case—I have received from Mr. Frederick Terry two post-cards and this letter—I have not seen the prisoner write.—I have seen a lot of his handwriting</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189801100049"/>
               <p>and I say this is his writing. "68, Hill Street, Dundee." Sir, please return play, <hi rend="italic">Countess Otto</hi>, at once—if you are hard up for the money I will send it—Terriss, the Pope, and Scotland Yard—I will answer in a week.—Richard A. Prince." <hi rend="italic">The other documents were read as follows:</hi>—"68, Hill Street, Dundee." Sir, favour to hand this morning at ten o'clock—the old story about King Charles and the £200,000—they sold him for a king—I'm only a Prince, not a woman, mon Dieu, a woman.—Richard A. Prince." "51, William Street, Vic. Road, Dundee—late <hi rend="italic">Union Jack</hi> tours—to Mrs. Fred. Terry. "Madam, I thank you as 'a Highlander and a gentleman,' and in the name of the Almighty God, our Queen, and my rights for play <hi rend="italic">Countess of Otto.'</hi>—I am, Madam, yours faithfully, Richard A. Prince." "If Lord Salisbury will only stand by his God, his Church, and his Queen now, with the forces of our motherly Queen, and for the honour of Great Britain, by the side of the godly King of Greece, we shall have 'peace with honour' and God's blessing."—I have also received in the course of my enquiries these letters, which appear to be written from Hollo way Prison, and to be in the prisoner's writing, addressed to Mr. G. Astley, at 51, Burlington Arcade. "Dear Sir, Many thanks for letter. It was no fault of yours or anyone's that night, but Mr. Terriss himself. Had he only spoken to me he should have been alive now, and the poor Prince would have been in Scotland; 'he ask for it and he got it.' That's why I killed the cur who could only fight a gay woman and a starving man sent on tour to ruin my character. Had been there. I would have given them the same. The only one I am sorry for is my sister. But she must stand her ground now with the things that call themselves men I have named in this note. You may call any day and see me from ten to twelve daytime, afternoon two o'clock till four. If you know any gentleman, or your own doctor might do that, knew my sister or myself in the passive, tell him to send his doctor to see me here once. I must see a doctor. I should like one of the best in London. If you can do this for me God will reward you. My soul is all right.—Yours faithfully, R. A. Prince. N.B.—Send a doctor, Astley, if you can."—" H.M. Prison, 1—1, '98. To G. Astley, Esq. Dear Astley,—I am more than sorry you came and they did not let you see me. It was my fault. I did not ask, and one must go by H.M. Rules' here. The Governor of Holloway Prison has just told me you can come and see me any day you like, any day but Sunday. Hours ten till twelve o'clock., two till four o'clock. If you could only come once more I shall deem it an honour. I have never seen anyone but the lawyer since I've been here. I will give you all the news when you come and see me. One thing you might do, bring or send a white shirt and collars 15 1/2 or 16, a tie and handkerchief, and one stud. I would ask my sister again, she sent the last, but I don't think she is in London. Maggie sent me a lot of underthings last week and 10s. Please come and see me. N.B.—I don't want a doctor now; come by yourself.—Yours faithfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">RICHARD ARTHUR PRINCE</hi>."</p>

               <p>the engagement I offered him, that he had not got a wardrobe for it—I tried to get him an engagement for pantomime—I had made up my mind to put him into one of my pantomimes; I run pantomimes as well as being an agent—I do not think I told the prisoner that—I said I would do my very best to get him something to do—I knew Mr. Terriss very well—I should say he was decidedly not the sort of man who would have tried to keep another actor oil of work, but, on the contrary, would have been willing to help those of his brethren who were in low water.</p>

You have poisoned my te.," and go and empty the tea into the sink, and he used to say that I wan league with my mother to poison him—he has said, "I am the second Jesus Christ, my mother is the Virgin Mary, and you shall go to Hell," meaning-me—he was not so bad when he began to stop at Dundee about eight years ago—he got worse afterwards—I remember something of his going to the <hi rend="italic">Alone in London</hi> troupe, and coming back in April, 1895, I think—he has often been away on an engagement since then; his last engagement was the Friday before the July holidays; I went to the station and saw him off—we got a letter that he had arrived and was doing well—he was very peculiar in his dress—he used to say, "They don't know the way to dress in Dundee and London"—he used to have a great big stand<lb/>up collar sometimes, and a felt hat, and a great big long coat, with a great big collar and a black tie; the collar was a double collar, and his cuffs were always tied up with string or black ribbon, he would not have studs.</p>

I live in the same building as Mrs. Archer, next door to her—I have known the prisoner nearly two years—I have seen him not in his right mind; that is what I think, because I have heard him tell his mother there was poison put in his tea, and I have seen him empty the teapot and make fresh tea for himself—in June last he came home to breakfast, and I was washing his mother's blankets, and he got quite excited and said there was poison in his tea—I did not notice if he tasted the tea before saying that—he emptied out the teapot and made fresh tea for himself—I did not interfere—I don't remember what I said—I remember his mother saying never to mind, that he took these turns often—on those occasions when he was out of his mind his appearance was very excitable and wild.</p>

               <p>poison in it; he was in a great passion at the time—I have more than once seen him in a passion; I could not say how often—he was an excitable man, and passionate, and wild looking—I have seen him very nice—I know he went about his work when he had got employment, and attended to it for weeks at a time—I have heard him talk about himself—he talked principally about himself—I have heard him say he thought he was a great actor, and he was very angry because he did not get proper parts, and thought he had not been properly appreciated.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 84, Ferry Road, Dundee—I am the foreman at Gourley's Iron Works at Dundee—I have known the prisoner for the last 23 years—he worked for me before he went to London—he came to work with me again about three years ago, in May, 1895—he was a very steady, attentive and obliging workman when he worked for me—from time to time he went away on theatrical engagements—he had a very eccentric strange way with him; he was very strange in his ways; he was very jealous minded—he was looked upon as a little soft—the workmen gave him the name of "Tripe"—he was a passionate man—when in a passion you would think he was a man not in his senses; he did not know what he was doing—his passions were not those of an ordinary man—on one occasion on a steam-boat trip of one of the masonic lodges between Edinburgh and Dundee, he had to be locked down in the fore compartment, he would give a song of his own accord, and someone interfered with or interrupted him, and he would not have that, and nothing would please him but to sing, and, people interrupting him, he lost his temper altogether and would not be quietened down, and the white foam was at his mouth and we had to lock him down—that was about two years ago, in September—when he worked under me I had occasion to go, when his shopmates were interrupting him, and quieten him; take him away on one side—he passed the remark sometimes when I had occasion to chastise him that he thought his fellow workmen were trying to put him out of the shop—he com<lb/>plained of that—there was no foundation for the statement—he did not say anything particular regarding other people, only that he had different ones always to complain about when I would chastise him—sometimes he was very kind speaking, and at other times he was very angry speaking—it was always his, idea to be an actor—I think he stopped working with me in the middle of March last year—I never saw him drinking—the scene on board the steamer was not the effect of drink, but people tormenting him—the workmen tormented him more than other men, because he always had a way of reciting to them, and he was always considered a sort of butt and soft by them—I never heard the prisoner mention Mr. Fife's name; I don't know him.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 22, Carmichael Street, Dundee—I used to live next door to the prisoner's mother when the prisoner was living there—I have known him about seven years, and I have known him pretty well—I did not see much of him through the day as I was at work; but when I was done with my work at six p.m. I have come home, and I have scarcely had my supper when I have seen and heard through the wall a performance by the prisoner; he was in a very excited condition, with his arms flying about and his eyes rolling in his head; sometimes we would get a bit of a recitation from him; at other times he would change the thing altogether and we might get a little bit of an act; and that might go on a little time and then singing would start; I have known him sing from seven p.m. till one a.m., and to the best of my ability I always considered that the man who would do that was not of sound mind—I don't believe there is a man in the whole of the part of the country we come from that is of any other opinion—I have heard people say as he passed, "That is mad Archer, the actor"—he was dressed like a mad-man, too; I have noticed him with a collar six or seven inches; no other man would have worn it in Dundee but himself—I never knew him to drink at all; I never saw him under the influence of drink.</p>

               <p>about then in a very peculiar sort of way—he was not the same as any other lad, I would think—he spoke very little at that time—he seemed to be stage-struck at that time, so far as I could see—he became quite professional in his way at the theatre altogether before he left for London; he was not like other professionals; he seemed to think himself above everybody who was connected with the theatre, though he was only a super—he was quite a lad at that time—in March, 1883, I was in London and I met him in the Strand, and spoke to him—he said he was at the Adelphi—I took him to be a little off his head—he still thought he was a great actor; but I had very little confidence in him at that time—I next, saw him at the Dundee Theatre, about nine years ago, in the <hi rend="italic">Union Jack</hi> company—I saw a good deal of him then—he had a quarrel with the supers at that time because they called him "Tripe"—he did not behave like an ordinary person then; he cursed and swore more than most people would do, and carried on a bit—I had to turn him out of the Star dressing-room one night; he got into it from the upper circle, or somewhere, and he was not engaged in the company—I travelled with him, in 1895, in <hi rend="italic">Rob Roy</hi>—I had to carry him out from the dress circle, at that time, because he was standing hurrahing at the actors when they were on the stage, and was creating a disturbance—he looked then about something similar to what he looks like now—12 months last April, when <hi rend="italic">For the Crown</hi> was being played, the prisoner wanted to go for Arthur Stewart, an actor, and was turned out—he then pulled a revolver from his pocket, and threatened to go for me and Fife, the acting manager of a theatre.</p>

               <p>what he wanted from them was a character stating he had been employed by them, and the acts he had taken part in, so that he could use them in applying for a situation independently of these gentlemen—he complained that the letters they had given him were not satisfactory, and would not enable him to get a situation; he wanted to act independently of these gentlemen—he wanted to get a leading part on his own merits—he left the works of his own accord in order to take up one of these theatrical engagements—I had no complaint whatever against him when he left—he was quite competent to do his work—he left on July 22, 1897—I gave him a certificate of character which I very often do—it was written on one of the firm's memorandum forms, and merely stated, "This is to certify that Richard Archer has been employed under me for a considerable time past, and he has conducted himself to my entire satisfaction; he has also proved himself steady and obliging, Yours truly, Alexander Husband."</p>

               <p>time would tend to aggravate his condition—all the distress and anxiety he suffered for the last two months in London would be likely to have made him worse—the letters and postcards of the end of 1895 and 1896 that have been read afford the same sort of notions with which I find him now thoroughly imbued; he was evidently under the influence of those same notions some years ago, and they would be strengthened by what took place afterwards—I believe them to be distinct delusions—there are many other things; I have only mentioned two or three of the most prominent; he was really full of delusions of all kinds—I connect the act of killing Mr. Terriss with the delusions—I think the act he diet was to a certain extent the outcome of the delusions themselves; he believed he was persecuted by Mr. Terriss for eight or ten years, and undoubtedly there was a connection between the act and the delusions—I do not think he was capable of exercising self-control at the time; taking the state of his mind as it had existed for some years, and then taking the privations and troubles he had had, I have no doubt he had no proper control.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have heard the account of the prisoner's life given to-day, that as a youth he was extremely passionate, that all his life he has been very vain and of very jealous disposition—I know the prisoner says he bought the knife a month before the crime, when he went into lodgings, for the purpose of cutting bread; I believe that to be true from my conversation with him; so far as I have heard that was the only knife he used to cut bread with in his apartments—I did not know his landlady supplied him with a table-knife—I imagined that was a use to which he had put the knife; I don't for a moment believe the man contemplated any act of this kind a month before—I know he had spoken of being even with Mr. Terriss, and of Newgate as a possible consequence of some conduct of his, and that he had said the country would ring with, his madness—I think it was a sort of crazy talk—I cannot say I attach any importance to the fact of his purchasing this butcher's knife at the end of October—I understood that he was leaving his lodgings at the time he went out with this knife in his possession; he did not tell me that, I gathered it—the fact of his going out with such a knife concealed about him would look like premeditation of a serious crime—it is not a knife a man would carry for any other purpose—in a matter of this kind I should attach importance, from the point of view of premeditation, to a man waiting about the stage door, if I had to do with a man of sound mind; but if I had to do with a man whose mind was saturated with delusions, I should attach less importance to it, because my experience of insanity leads me to know that persons with insane minds will premeditate acts of violence—there is evidence of a certain amount of premeditation in this case—the waiting about the neighbourhood of the stage door bears the aspect of premeditation—his making enquiries as to which door Terriss came out of was because he wanted to see Mr. Terriss; I don't know what his object was—I think he had been in this condition for a year or two, but I have no doubt his condition was made much worse of late by his continued privation and disappointments, and those would act very differently on a man of his condition to what they would in ordinary cages, and make him less capable of controlling himself—a man of evenly balanced mind does not commit a murder from any motive—it would not make a difference in my</p>

               <p>opinion of his insanity whether he had premeditated the killing of Mr. Terriss or not, because insane persons do premeditate acts, and are capable of doing it—a man insane, in the ordinary acceptation of the word, may premeditate acts of violence, think them out, plan them and wait his opportunity, and probably be under no delusion as to what he intends to do—there may be no evidence here to show that the prisoner did not intend to murder Mr. Terriss at the time he stabbed him; I know nothing about that—I should not go so far as to say that at the time he stabbed Mr. Terriss he knew he was inflicting or intended to inflict on him a mortal wound, and that his object was to kill him; he knew he was making an assault undoubtedly, but I do not think he knew the quality of the act, and in a sense his mind was too disordered—I think he had sufficient capacity to realize that he had a knife in his hand; every person's acts are the outcome of their knowledge and belief; the prisoner's knowledge and belief were in my opinion entirely perverted, and therefore one could not expect from him that these would be rational and sane acts—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not this the conditon of things, that he may have and did have delusions with regard to Mr. Terriss' conduct and the wrongs he suffered from, but was perfectly conscious of how he was going to avenge those supposed wrongs.—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know how far he may have acted on the spur of the moment at that time—from my conversation with him I rather believe he did not go there with the actual intention—I have heard him say that if Mr. Terriss. had only spoken to him it would not have occurred, showing that he did yield to some impulse—immediately afterwards he produced the knife with the blood on it, and said that was the knife he had stabbed him with—that is quite common after acts of violence of this sort by insane people—they often calm down almost at once, and there is no particular indication afterwards—he was in no paroxysm of rage if he came across the road and stabbed him—I understood from what he told me that he wanted to speak to Mr. Terriss and that Mr. Terriss would not speak to him, and then he stabbed him immediately, happening to have the knife in his hand—I have heard Mr. Graves' evidence—I do not think the prisoner knew the moral or legal quality of the act—in all probability he knew he had a knife in his hand—his mind was saturated with all sorts of delusions, and under the influence of those he acted—he acted with premeditation, undoubtedly—I know he stabbed Mr. Terriss twice in the back, and then in the heart, after Mr. Terriss had called out that he was stabbed—the prisoner never used the word "revenged" to me—I know he used it immediately after he was arrested—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have no doubt, have you, that he did this act in order to be revenged for supposed injuries—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have no doubt the things were connected in his mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I heard Mrs. Carby's evidence that she had seen traces of the knife being used to cut bread—his committing this act in a public place, and not attempting to get away, is further evidence of his insanity—it is quite possible that in insanity there may be delusions which overcome the moral sense and self-control, and that yet some of the functions of the mind may perform their ordinary operations; a man's power of judging of the quality of his actions would be altogether altered by his beliefs, and this belief of persecution which had been going on for some time would influence him—I consider an act of this sorts</p>

               <p>the climax of his mental disease; I think the act was directly connected with the delusions—a man with that amount of mental aberration, under trying circumstances, and I should say with his habit of body which has existed all through, and been explained here, would, under such circumstances, have very little power of control by habit of body I mean his eccentricity and odd behaviour and vanity—the fact that his father's two children were affected mentally, that one was an imbecile from birth, and that the other died in a lunatic asylum, are very im<lb/>portant elements in the case—the prisoner's brain was damaged by an attack in infancy; he came from a stock evidently wrong in some way, because three children of that father are affected—he was always weak mentally, and under the strain of life he acquired these delusions—he has harboured the delusions for years, and under the influence of them he acts, no doubt with a great deal of premeditation—he was in a weak condition of mind and body, too, I should say.</p>

I think his power of judging as to right and wrong generally, and as to the right and wrong of this particular act, would have been much interfered with by reason of those mental delusions that interfere with his mind to such an extent, that at the time he would have had no adequate control over his actions, and therefore would not have known properly the quality of the act—"control" is a contested Phrase—we know quite well that in these cases where a man has weak brain power, he has a weak power of controlling his actions, and there are certain forms of insanity that are distinguished by uncontrollable impulses coining over a man-generally his power as to forming a conclusion as to whether an act was right or wrong might be fairly good, but under the influence under which he acted I chink he would for a time have lost his power of judging, that is in anything connected with Mr. Terriss, as to whom he had got these delusions, he would not have the power of judging as to right and wrong.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am lecturer on mental diseases at St. Mary's Hospital, demonstrator of psychology at, St. George's Hospital, and senior assistant physician at Bethlehem Hospital for the Insane—I have had an opportunity of seeing the prisoner at Holloway—I came to the conclusion that he is now of unsound mind, and, so far as I could understand, the beginning of the trouble was in infancy to the best of my belief he was of unsound mind at the time he committed this act—I found the prisoner to be suffering from delusions of persecution, which, have arisen in various ways through the senses; he had the idea that he was poisoned; he also had perversions of smell, of the significance of which he was unaware; he also on various occasions heard voice, calling out to him the word "Rats!" the significance of which was that rat-poison had been put into his food—he imagined that he could actually taste poison in his food—he has been in Holloway Prison on four separate occasions he has stated that he has tasted poison in his food, and it had a very serious effect on his physical condition-a sunstroke in infancy is sometimes followed by various sequelae of this kind; there may be some uncontrollable impulse, or homocidai tendencies which may be carried through life: or there may be various other mental manifestations some eight years ago I collected a number of cases of sunstroke in infancy which had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189801100064"/>
               <p>been followed by similar perversions—I should say that when he committed this act he was not conscious that it was one he ought not to commit, from his own statement that he believed at the time he was carrying out God's will—the delusions from which he suffered had dominated the whole of the individual—I cannot say whether when he committed the act he would be likely to know the consequences to himself, beyond this, that I put the question to the prisoner and he said that before God he did not know the consequences at the time he committed the act, so that he did not calculate the consequences—I believe the act was the outcome of those delusions—I agree with Dr. Bastian that the fact of two of his brothers by the same father having been insane would induce me to come to the conclusion that the prisoner is of an unsound, nervous disposition—I do not think his mind was in such a condition that he could judge between right and wrong; I think he regarded himself as being infallible and simply carrying out the will of God—privation and hunger is the most productive means of loss of control—I should think the fact of his violence having increased of late years would point to the growth of his condition of delusional insanity; cases of delusional insanity do tend to become more demonstrative—owing to his suffering from hunger and privation the control over his will was weakened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The chief delusion under which I considered the prisoner was acting was that Mr. Terriss had done him some injury by preventing him from getting better employment; and that he was per<lb/>secuted directly and indirectly by Mr. Terriss—I believe what he did was done in revenge for this supposed injury—starvation would increase the absence of control over himself—if under the influence of that starvation he had stolen food I should not suggest he was not responsible for that act, if that was the only feature in the case—some of his delusions had reference to food—it was because of his delusions I think he had not control over his actions—if he had merely inflicted some injury on Mr. Terriss with a view to preventing him performing at the theatre that night I should say he would have had more control, he would have manifested more control than he did—I take into account the fact that after he had stabbed him twice in the back, he stabbed him a third time to the heart—I have no doubt that when he inflicted that third blow he intended to kill him—the prisoner has demonstrated on myself exactly how he did it, and he has stated that he did it in the usual stage manner—my statement of my belief that he did it under the belief that he was doing it under the will of the Almighty is based on the prisoner's statement to me in the prison, after his committal for trial—I had not seen him, or heard such a statement, before he was committed for trial—I do not think it likely he would tell that to the policeman immediately after it happened—there was no statement of the kind fill I came to examine him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have heard the evidence that he said he was Jesus Christ; that type of insanity is very common, to have hallucination of tastes and delusions, associated with the idea that the person is Christ, and very possibly the belief that he was carrying out the will of the Almighty—I never heard any delusions from him as to the rights of property—the post-cards and letters written in 1895 and 1896 indicate that the prisoner was suffering mentally, and show that the disease was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189801100065"/>
               <p>growing stronger, and point, I should say, to acts of violence—probably want of food and dissappointmcnt would increase the mental stress and strain, and dimmish the want of self-control.</p>

               <p>I shook my head, and he said, "You shall have them for £4, are these your little children?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "You give £1 to the children and I will give you the horns for £3"—I said, "Are you acting straight-forward?—he said, "Yes," and crossed himself, and took his solemn oath—I gave him £3—he said, "I have been offered £14 for the horns by a Jew round the corner, but when I came to this country before, I bought a watch of a Jew, who sold me a brass one for a gold one, and I will never let a Jew have anything again of mine"—I believed his story.</p>

"thank God I am innocent of anything of this kind I was in bed before eleven o'clock"—I went to the same house with Sergeant Brown and found Jones in bed, a silk handkerchief fell from him, he denied that it belonged to him—I examined the premises and found that an entry had been made by sliding on to a wall and on to a window ledge, and a pane of glass had been removed—I read the charge to the prisoner at the station he said, "I deny it"—I believe Brown picked up a pawn<lb/>ticket.</p>

I am a packer, of 41, Johnston Street, Somers Town—on January 2nd I was going home, in St. Martin's Lane, about eleven, when four men came behind me and threw me down—North said, "Rifle his pockets"—I got released and threw Collims to the ground, and held him till a policeman came and took him—I asked a</p>

Did you cause the fire?"—he said he did not know, then "I suppose I did" (I do not recollect the exact words)—I said, "Surely you know whether you did or not?"—he did not answer—I left the room and sent for the police—on the premises were George and Stephen Chum, and Ellis and Straney—I got to the scene of the fire about three a.m.—Stephen Chum has been employed there about 17 or 18 years, his brother about two years, a man Ellis about 18 years, Straney 15 or 16, and Hall and Taylor and the watchman about eight or nine years.</p>

I live at 88, Collinson Street, Southwark Bridge Road—on Friday, October 1st, I was night watchman to Mr. Pascall—I have been in his service seven years—on October 1st the workmen went out in two batches, one at 6.30 p.m., the other after seven—a man, Clarke, was left—I shut up the premises, except the stables and the loading dock entrances—I had the key—in the club room were Stephen and George Chum, Ellis, a traveller, and Clarke, a salesman—Clarke went about nine p.m.—Straney was in the cottage at the other end—no one else was on the premises—I visited every department—workmen are not allowed to stay—a van came in with the carman and Peters upon it—I undid the doors to enable them to be backed into the loading dock—I went through the packing floor to do so—I they locked up—I pulled the shutter down of the dock—this is the screw (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when the horse was put in the stable I left Peters in the stable-yard—I let out Wetherwisk about 10.20 pm.—about 10.30 Peters came to me and said, "Taylor, did you hear the dog bark in the stable?"—I was sweeping the office—I said, "No, did you?"—he said, "Yes, barking furiously"—I said, "Go to the iron doors "(they cut off the yard from the main building)," and hear what you can hear," and he went there, and came back and said, "Taylor, there's a fire"—I told him not to open the iron doors, but he disobeyed me—I went to the two Chums, in the club room; they came and found the fire in a wicker-basket, standing near the dust heap—we put the fire out quickly—Constable Morphy came—we locked the place up again—Morphy was still on the premises when I heard the cry of a second fire in the loading dock, and I opened the door to enable water to be brought—I got to the loading dock through the shutter, but who opened it I cannot say—someone rung up the fire brigade, by telephone—Straney came out of his cottage after the first fire—someone suggested strangers were in the yard, and I asked Peters to stand by the iron doors to see that no one went in or out who had no business there—the gas is usually turned out, but we lit it and searched the floors—I went outside—Peters was in the yard, but not at the iron doors where I had posted him and told him not to leave it—Inspector Howe and some firemen came on the premises—an earnest search was then made—then a fire was announced in the boiling-room—there were then two police sergeants, George Chum, and, I think, a constable there—Peters came from outside and said, "Did you hear me call?"—I said, "No"—he said, "The packing floor is atire"—at the time he came from the inner building; no one else was there to my knowledge—I ran through the fire to open the door, which was locked, as the fire was gaining upon them, and let them out.</p>

On October 3rd I went to these premises after the third fire, and with others made a search to see if we could find anyone on the premises—we found no strangers—I remember searching the boiling-room; the two Chums were there, and Taylor and Peters—I was in the boiling-room for about 10 minutes; certainly not under—I was in the stable when the big fire broke out—when I left the boiling-room I did not see Peters, not till a couple of hours after the last fire—I saw where the straw had been burned in the stable and under the bottle-shed, and while standing in the yard I smelt a strong smell of gun-powder, I believe, and I passed that remark to the employe's, and had the stable opened, and the flames broke out in an instant—I got out over the little ladder, and through the house into the street.</p>

This matter was put into my hands to investigate—I kept the prisoner under observation—I noticed that he acted very strangely—I followed him several times to Croydon and other places—I had taken statements from several persons on the premises, including the prisoner—on November 19th I was at the station when he was brought there—he was sitting in the charge-room, and I said, "Peters, I suppose you know what you are brought here for?"—he began to cry and was very excited—I noticed that he was upset, and left him for probably half an hour—I then returned into the room and found him more quiet, and told him he would be charged with wilfully and maliciously setting fire to Mr. Pascall's premises, in Blackfriars Road—I did not caution him first—I simply told him the charge—it was not my duty to caution him. [<hi rend="italic">Mr. Drake contended that this should exclude the statement, but Mr. Justice Channell declined to exclude it.</hi>] He said, "I perfectly well remember setting fire to the first fire in the dust-hole, in the yard; the dog was barking; he told me to go and see if anyone was on the premises; we went round to the yard and heard a scuffle in the bottle shed; I looked back, and Taylor fetched me back to the iron door; the second fire broke out in that shed, but I don't remember setting a light to it or the other fires; I have had a great deal of trouble lately; I am sure I don't know what made me do it, as Mr. Pascall has been very good to me"—after the inspector had taken the charge, I searched a bag taken from the prisoner, and found a quantity of broken food and a cartridge—I gave it to the prisoner, and asked him what it was—he said, "It is a firework, throw it away," and commenced to cry—they are a penny each, this is a slow match, it burns gradually till it bursts, and throws out a flame—it is gunpowder.</p>

About 9.15 on December 9th, the prisoner came to the South Norwood police-station and said "Please send an ambulance to 49, Portland Road"—I said "What for?"—he said "There is a doctor there who will tell you all about it, it is to take a girl to the hospital"—I said "What has occurred?"—He said "I shot her"—I said "What do you mean?"—he said "What I say, I shot her"—I said "Deliberately"—he said "Yes, I must have been mad"—I told him I should detain him for inquiries, and placed him in charge of a constable—I then went to the house—Constable Parlett came afterwards—I helped, to search the bed-room and I saw the constable pick up a small spent bullet—he handed it to me—I went to the prisoner's bedroom, and in a email box I found eleven small cartridges similar to this—I then went back to the prisoner—he said, "I suffer from these paroxysms, I'm not responsible for what I do"—to the formal charge he made no reply—next day I took him to the police-court—on the way there he said, "I intended to do her no harm, I put the revolver in my mouth next, but it would not go off."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was a stranger to me—he was undoubtedly greatly upset when he came to the station—I have made inquiries, and I have found that he has been a respectable quiet man—I found that he had paid too much for the stock of the house he had taken at Norwood—he said he had nothing for his children and himself—he asked me how the girl was going on and if he could see her.</p>

               <p>12.30, on the morning of December 21st, I saw the prisoner; I said to him, "I have just been to the Croydon Hospital, and found your daughter, Honora, detained there, suffering from a wound in the head and a wound in the hand; and from what I have been told I shall charge you with shooting at her twice with this revolver"—he made no reply—I examined the revolver, two chambers had been recently discharged—I examined the bed, there was blood on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He asked me how his daughter was going on—I told him she was going on—after that he calmed down greatly; at first he was greatly upset.</p>
