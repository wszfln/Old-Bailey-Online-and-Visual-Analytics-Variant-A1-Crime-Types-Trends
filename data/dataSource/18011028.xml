            , myself, and William Pearson, the younger; the prisoner was employed in our warehouses; I know nothing of the transaction.</p>
               <p>RALPH WATTS sworn. - I am an Excise-locker: On Thursday, the 24th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in the warehouses at Paul's Wharf; the prisoner came down with the rest of the men to the lower room, I rubbed him down, and heard something rattle, which was the coffee running down through his breeches knees; I then called my partner to my assistance, and we secured him; we took nine pounds and a half of coffee out of his breeches; we got a constable, and took him before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have generally a bye word for a man that goes out of the warehouse? - A. No, we rub them down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you a bye word, get on as fast as you can; walk away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you a bye word without which persons cannot get in and out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reward upon the conviction of a man for robbing the warehouse? - A. I never made any enquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard what the reward is? - A. I did not know till I made enquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by telling me you had not enquired what was the reward? - A. A guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not search the men when they came into the warehouse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore a man might bring coffee into the warehouse if he pleased? - A. We have nothing to do with that.</p>
               <p>Q. But you expect a guinea if this man is convicted? - A. No, I don't care a halfpenny for the guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell this man he might have the sweepings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Brady? - A. Yes, he is the Custom-house-locker.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation had you with Brady before you rubbed him down? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stopped him first? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes.(James Brady and one other witness corroborated the testimony of Watts.)(John Wainewright, the constable, produced, the property.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gossett. This is the same sort of coffee that we had in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been a very little while in the coffee business, and Brady and Watts told me I might make a shilling or two, and he made motions with his hands to his breeches, and seemed very much surprised that I did not understand his motions; and he said, why don't you go; I told him I did not know where to go; and then I took the coffee; and when they rubbed me down, I was surprised at their taking me into custody; this was sweepings; it was impossible any man could attempt to go out of this door, when he was sure to be searched, without it was with the approbation of these officers; it is they that commit the depredations.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(To Gossett.) Are sweeping allowed as a perquisite? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Smith. (To Brown.) Q. Have you not said, within forty-eight hours, before the Grand Jury, that you could not swear to the handkerchief? - A.

            , Esq. sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am solicitor of the Post-Office: On the 11th of September I was sent for to the Post-Office, in consequence of a discovery that had taken place; I asked him where he had that bank<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280006"/>note from; he said he had it from his brother, John Keep, one of the letter-carriers in the Office; that he had given it to him to purchase clothes; I asked him what became of the change he had received for the fifteen-pound note; he said he gave the ten-pound note to his brother again; he said he had carried the cloth to a tailor's near the Bank, to make into clothes; he was then ordered into custody, to be carried before the Magistrate, and his brother John was fought after, and taken into custody. The next morning, before he was before the Lord-Mayor, I saw him again, and then he said, that what he had said respecting his brother John, and obtaining the note from him, was untrue; he acknowledge having taken the letter containing the note.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel.</p>

             sworn. - I am foreman to the prosecutors: On Tuesday, the 13th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going past a door that leads into the coal-cellar, I heard a rattling among the coals; I asked who is there? the prisoner answered, me; I did not see him; I knew his voice; I then suspected him; a little while afterwards I got a light, and went into the coal-cellar, and saw a loaf of sugar upon the coals, near a hole that goes into the yard; I put out the candle, and placed myself in a corner of the manufactory, to see if any person would come to take this loaf away; a few minutes after, the prisoner at the bar came down with a light, but he did not go to the place; the next evening, about six o'clock, I watched about five or six yards from the hole, the prisoner came down. and stooped towards the hole; I saw him put something under his coat, and go out at the gate; I immediately followed him, and took him in the middle of the street with the loaf upon him; upon which we had an officer called, and he was taken to the Justices.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I live at Tottenham; I am a widow.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any children? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the last witness that was examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I know no further than her coming to lodge with me; I was a lone woman, and she came for a lodging; my room was in Mary Willis's house; she was to sleep with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who slept in the next room to you? - A. A man and his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What family has Mrs. Willis? - A. They have got two children in the house; one is a niece, five or six years old, and a boy older than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us what day of the month it was? - A. She came to me on the Thursday night; it was the Wednesday night after that this affair happened; I cannot say the day of the month; she came from Mrs. English to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before that? - A. I never saw her but once in my life before she came for the lodging; but I knew where she came from; in about a couple of days after she came to me, I told her my neighbours said she was with child, and she was very angry, denied it, and asked me if I was not with child; I told her of it again, and told her to provide herself with a lodging; she continued with me till the Wednesday night, and on the Wednesday night I went to bed, and went to sleep, and the cry of a young child, three hearty squalls, waked me; I went to bed about nine o'clock, and waked about eleven; the prisoner went to bed first; I was greatly surprised, and said, I heard the the cry of a child; and she said, no, there was no such thing; I said, then did you cry; she said, what for; I said, I am sure there was a cry, and I will get up; she said, what should you get up for, lie still; she said, she did not all any thing; I got up between six and seven o'clock, I cannot say exactly, and left her in bed; it might be half past six;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280008"/>I went to fetch some milk; when I came back, I met Mrs. Rowland; she went with me; the prisoner went down stairs as we went up; she had her clothes on just the same as any other time; a black bonnet on, a black gown, a black silk handkerchief; Mrs. Rowland waited half an hour for her, and went away; in consequence of suspicion, I looked all over the room as close as I could, to see if I could find any thing; but I did not find any thing but the state of a lying-in woman upon my bed, and all over my room, and that; I was sure there must have been a child or a miscarriage.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that appearance? - A. Every thing was very bad, very bloody, just as if it was dipped into a blood-tub; the bed, blankets, and sheets, all through; and there were a great many spots of blood about the room, as if it was wiped or smeared about.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of that sort about the room the night before? - A. No, in no part of it; when the prisoner came back, I asked how she could make the woman wait so long for her; she said, I have been a good way to the shop to fetch some tea, and I will follow her; I said, no, you must not follow her, you are not fit to go; the prisoner said, I am; I said, no, you are not; then she said, yes, I am, I all nothing; and she went after her, and did her day's work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular about her dress? - A.Nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. Where was the prisoner when you heard the crying you speak of? - A.In the bed by me.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard no more cries than that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you heard that so distinctly, that you heard three cries? - A. Yes, I waked with it.</p>
               <p>Q.How many days did she continue to lodge with you? - A.She went away from me on the Monday following; I turned her out.</p>
               <p>HANNAH ROWLAND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I have been married near fourteen years, but my husband is not with me; I worked with the prisoner last September; in the month of August I worked first with her, at the Bull, for three days: On the Thursday morning, I think, the 27th of August, I met

             in the street, as I was going to my day's work; I went home with her, and the prisoner was up in the room; when I went into it, Betty was very near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the prisoner? - A. Yes, she said to me, Mrs. Rowland, are you going to work so soon, it is not seven o'clock? I told her it was seven, but it was not eight; and she pressed me to stay for her, as she was going out for butter; she went away that instant, and I staid about half an hour; I looked round the room, and saw small clots of blood and trickles all about the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be fresh? - A. It looked very fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present with Mrs. Moss when she looked at the bed? - A. No, about ten o'clock she came into the field to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in her appearance when she came to the field? - A. She looked very ill; her petticoats were very much soiled, and her stockings; and we persuaded her to pin her petticoats up, and gave her pins to do it; and we advised her to drop her gown down, for fear the men should observe her; she told me she was taken very ill in the night, so much so, that she thought she must have died; she told me the bed was in such a situation with her illness, that, if I had seen it, it would have frightened me; I said, was it; she said, it was through every thing.</p>
               <p>MARY WILLIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Mrs. Moss lodged in my house; the prisoner lodged with Mrs. Moss; she came on the 20th of August, and went away the 31st; Mrs. Moss lives there still.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have seen her twice; I saw her early in the morning, between six and seven o'clock; she had a darkish coloured own,a black cloak, and a close bonnet; she went down a little field, called the Slipe; it is a grass field, and a pound in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the same person? - A. Yes, I am certain it was the same person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her before? - A. Never before that time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. She had a close bonnet on - you did not see her face? - A. Yes, I could see her face, but not so very particular as to discern her features; she had a bundle under her arm about the length of my arm; I did not see her return; I saw her again about a week afterwards when she was brought to Tottenham to be examined.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You heard that the woman, who was in custody, had put a child into the pond? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then, when you saw her, she was under examination? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. You say it was yesterday fortnight, which, from the date of the examination, would bring it to the 2d of September.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MACLEOD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a labouring man in the parish of Tottenham; I was at work in a field, called Twelve Acres, in the last September.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that did you know the prisoner? - A. No, I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her at any time so as to know her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes, the first time I saw her was going through Twelve-Acre Field.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say that you saw a woman go down the field? - A. Yes; she had on a dark gown, a dinsey-coloured cloak, and a close bonnet.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was she from you? - A. One hundred and fifty yards ; or more; she went across Twelve Acres to a little field, called the Slipe; she had a bundle under her arm; I observed to Bliss what that woman could do down the field at that time in the morning.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was it a foot-path field? - A. No; we lost her nigh this pond a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You lost sight of her? - A. Yes, we both looked a considerable time to see which way she went, but we could see no more of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what day you were examined before the Coroner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you were examined before the Coroner? - A. I cannot say; I did not recollect the woman going down the field till after I heard that the child was found.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I live at Tottenham; the last witness is my son.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his informing you of any thing he had seen in the pond? - A. Yes, I think on the 7th of September; it was on a Monday; I went to the pond, and found a female child lying upon its belly in the water; I took a stick, and turned it up to the side of the bank; it looked very fresh in the face; I then sent for the beadle; two men took the child to Mr. Bartlett's, the first public-house.</p>
               <p>JAMES SHEFFIELD sworn. - I am assistant to Mr. Holt, surgeon, at Tottenham; I was called in to examine the child; I looked over the body; I found it in a very putrid state, insomuch that I could not discover any marks of violence whatever about the child; I examined the navel-cord, and found it lascerated; that it had not been properly attended to by a surgeon or midwife; and, from its appearance, I think it was a full-time child.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then, finding the child in this state, you can form no judgment how it came by its death? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the navel-cord, not being properly attended to, of itself occasion the death of the child? - A. It would undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it is a very frequent thing for the child to die in the birth in the very act of delivery? - A. Most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. Even where a skilful practitioner attends the birth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is the more likely when an ignorant woman delivers herself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you yourself can form no judgment how the child came by its death? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Whitbread and Co. On Saturday, the 17th of October, the prisoner was employed in making a pipe good which communicates with the liquorback, and from the reservoir to the copper in the brewery; about twenty minutes before one, I went into the room where the prisoner was at work; he seemed to be very much flurried, and buttoning his jacket up in great haste; I asked him how he was going on in his business; he turned round towards me, and I saw that he was a little more reconciled; he answered, that he was going on very well; there was a pipe in that hop-lost that the cock was foldered to; I then saw him walk away very much on one side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This man was employed by a master-plumber upon these premises? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore as much work as he had done, Messrs. Whitbread's were to pay for? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any lead was lost, the plumber must stand to the loss? - A. No, Messrs. Whitbread must stand to the loss; when lead comes to our house, if it is a whole sheet of lead, or whatever quantity comes in, I put it into a book, and that lead is paid for by Messrs. Whitbread.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MINTON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Scott. On the 17th of October, I was standing at Mr. Whitbread's gate, in Chiswell-street, I saw the prisoner come out apparently very much swelled in the sides; I laid hold of him, and felt something underneath his waistcoat, and found some lead; I then took him into the accompting-house, I put my hand under his jacket, and found two pieces of pipe; he said it was the first time he had ever done any thing of the kind; I delivered the lead to the officers.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street, (produces the lead;) I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner; I took charge of the prisoner, and Mr. Minton brought the lead to the Office, and delivered it to me; the next day I compared it with the pipe from which it was cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that pipe fixed to the building? - A. It had been; it was cut from another piece of lead that was lying in the store-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that piece from which it was cut fixed to the premises? - A. No, it was loose, but it was a very large piece.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that in the same shape with the piece that you fitted it to? - A. No, this piece is split; it had been cut off with a faw; the faws exactly corresponded.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen. I went with Ray to compare the lead with the pipe that he was at work upon.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am waiter at the Salisbury Coffee-house, Chancery-lane, nearly opposite Serjeant's-Inn; the prisoner brought a foreign sailor to our house, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on the 10th of October, the first night of the illuminations; the woman asked for a room; the sailor could not speak English; they were shewn into a bed-room; the prisoner asked him to pay for the room, which he did; I fetched a pot of porter for them, and left them; the woman came out first, about twelve o'clock; she told me the man was going to sleep by himself, and that he was very agreeable to her going; she went away, and in about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes afterwards, I saw the man; he came down crying and wringing his hands; I could understand that he said guineas, and he counted seven of his fingers; I went to the Cheshire-Cheese, in Fleurde-Luce-court, and in about ten minutes found her; I charged the watch with her, and took her to the watch-house; I gave charge of her to the constable; I was in the room when he searched her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is it that keeps this house? -

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not call you up several times, and tell you I would not stay with him? - A.

               <p>Q. Was the black one the horse you missed from the pasture? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the two prisoners doing in the stable when you went there? - A. I did not see them do any thing there; I went into the town, and afterwards saw them; they were a very little distance apart; Ellis mounted Mr. Staples's horse, and tried to ride away, then I seized Price, and said, he was my prisoner for stealing horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in Ellis's hearing? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Ellis do? - A. He tried to ride away, and rode over a Welch runt; the horse knocked the runt down, and fell over it, and threw the man off; this was not above two or three rods from Mrs. Neale's; I found the other bay horse at Whetstone, at Mr. Freeman's, which I had lost from the pasture.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were those horses turned out by you? - A. By my servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with your servant? - A. No; but I was in the yard when they came from the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your servant here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you, that what you communinicated to Price, you don't know whether Ellis heard? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or whether he saw that you were taking Price at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The horse Elis was upon, was not your horse? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he had not carried it on for the last four or five years? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade has he carried on in that time? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. For the last five months, you don't know, perhaps? - A. I know so far as the time he lodged with me, and for the other time, to the best of my knowledge, he carried on that, and nothing else.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it? - A.Because, if I must speak the truth, I lent him a couple of guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How are you so sure? - A.Because, in the morning, at half past six, he got up, and said, will you get me some breakfast; I said, I would; he said, have you got the trisle of money by you of two guineas; I said, I have; says he, I will be much obliged to you, if you will lend it to me, and I will pay you when I come back; I said, if you will promise to pay me, I will, and I lent it him on the 1st of September.</p>
               <p>Q. He was going a journey, and would pay you when he came back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He set off on his journey? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he was going? - A. To Barnet fair.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifton. My Lord, I will now call Stevens, the coachman of the Riverhead coach, to prove he took the prisoners down by the coach.</p>
               <p> - STEVENS sworn. - Q. Did you drive the prisoners any where? - A. I took them up at Lewisham, and drove them to Collier's, the White Hart, at Riverhead, on the 1st of September.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they inside or outside? - A. Outside.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, never having seen the men before, whether they are the men you took up at Lewisham? - A. That man in the jacket is one (Price.)</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, will you swear that the other is one? - A. In regard to that, I cannot say; his dress is different; it is something like the man.</p>

            , I have it in my hand; I told him I had not so much in my pocket, only a 5l. note, which I sent by the waiter, and desired him to say, he might have the remainder to-morrow, or any other time; he had been several times at my house, when he was officiating at the church of the parish of St. Martin; he dined one Sunday in his black gown, and went away in the evening; it was on the Wednesday morning I received the draft for change, and on Saturday I took it to Smith, Payne, and Smith's, to get cash for it, when they told me it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again, after you had been informed it was a forgery, before he was taken up? - A. Yes, I saw him that evening, and informed him of it; he told me he had it from his father, inclosed in a letter from Weymouth; I asked him for his father's address, which he said was Robert Smith, Esq. Terrace, Weymouth, Dorset, and that his own address was Thomas-Scott Smith, No. 25, Frederick-place, Hampstead-road; he said, if I would go with him to his lodgings, he would convince me that he came honestly by the bill, by shewing me the letter he had from his father; I went with him, and he shewed me a letter, of which he read part; I was not satisfied with it, because he would not let me see that part of the letter that related to the draft; for, he said, there were family affairs in it, and he would not let me see it.</p>
               <p>Q. What steps did you take? - A. He said, if I would let it remain till Monday, he would then call upon me, and go with me to the bankers to convince me it was all right; on Monday, he sent for me to the sexton's room in St. Martin's Church-yard; I went, and he told me he had been disap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280015"/>pointed in hearing from his father, but if I would let it remain till Wednesday, he would give me satisfaction, and I should lose nothing by it; I wrote to his father by Monday night's post, as I supposed, at Weymouth, but received no answer whatever; on the Friday, I went to Bow-street to ask Mr. Bond what I had best do about it, and then he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. This transaction first took place on a Wednesday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the waiter brought you the bill, you gave him five pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday was the first application you made to the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you his father's address, and his own? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went to his own lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went again on the Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You met him again on the Wednesday? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you saw him on the Friday? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That was Friday week after the transaction first took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have gone away in that time? - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You always found him agreeable to where you expected? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p> - sworn. - I am clerk in the house of Wilkinson, Bloxham, and Co. bankers; I have known the prisoner some years before this transaction; he was in the house of his father, who is in the leather line in Crooked-lane, in the city of London; the business was carried on there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his father ever living at Weymouth? - A. I do not.</p>

             sworn. - On the 11th of September, I apprehended the prisoner in his room, No. 25, Frederick-place, Hampstead-road; he seemed very much alarmed; I found two letters there. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Capper). Should you know the letter that was read to you? - A. No; as he was reading it, and refused to shew it, I said, good God, is there any similarity between the hand-writing of the draft, and that letter.</p>
               <p>Q.(Shewing him a letter). Can you say whether that was the letter? - A. I did not see the inside of the letter he read from.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. May it please your Lordships, Gentlemen of the Jury, I only have to say, that I received the note in question from my father; and as for any intention to defraud Mr. Capper, I am sure I had none; there was not a meeting that he fat, at which I was not regular to the time, and I leave it to your Lordship's consideration, and that of the Gentlemen of the Jury, whether it would not have been in my power to have got out of the way, if I knew I was in danger, after he gave me a week or ten days; instead of that, I kept in the way, and told him, I should be able to settle it with him, but he took me up without giving me the least notice; indeed, when I gave the draft in question, Mr. Capper was very much intoxicated, and did not know what he was about, and if I had asked the witnesses, they would have said the same.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Capper.) Q. Were you in liquor, or not? - A. I was not so bad but I recollect every thing that passed; I remember receiving the draft, putting it in the till, and locking it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe you will recollect, that before the Magistrate, you said, the first waiter that came, gave you the draft? - A. I don't recollect which waiter I fixed on at that time, but one of them brought it, and I asked him who the change was for; he said, for Mr. Smith, the clergyman; then I called the other waiter, and gave him the 5l. note to take to him.</p>

               <p>Q. What coloured mare is she? - A. A duncoloured mare: On the 18th of April, she was missed, and I heard of it about the 26th.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her again? - A. On the 23d of July, to the best of my knowledge, I saw her in possession of the younger Manby, in Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross; he was up stairs, and the officers desired to see a mare he had got, and he came down, and shewed it him; as soon as I saw it, I said, it was my mare; I am sure it was the same mare.</p>
               <p>Q. What were her marks? - A. A mark that she had in foaling; she was hurt in foaling; a twist upon the off leg, a star upon her forehead, a mark down the back, and a mark over the off knee; she had been thrown down, being rusty, and a mark over the off eye, which she got at the same time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The young man came before the Magistrate, upon being desired by the officer, without being taken into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, he there told you his father had bought the mare in Smithfield? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. The Magistrate thought it was only a case of misdemcanor, and they were both bailed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When did he say he bought it? - A. On the 10th of October, 1800.</p>
               <p>RICHARD EVANS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I have had the mare ever since she was before the Magistrate; she is over the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known it? - A. I bred her, and broke her into harness.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any accidental marks about her? - A.She rather treads outward her off leg, and a star in her forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any mark of having received any injury about her body? - A. None particular; there was a mark where she had had the stranguary, but that was hardly visible.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that the mare you got from the Magistrate's, was the same mare? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you do any farriery to her? - A. On the 15th of October, 1800.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you saw her? - A. The latter end of October.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You spoke to her by the natural marks, and by the twist in the hind leg? - A. No, she got that in foaling.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How are her knees? - A. You can hardly discern it now.</p>
               <p>Q.Discern what? - A. They have been broke, or a little scratched over the off knee, and there was a little bit of a cut over her eye, but very triftling; it is pretty well grown out now.</p>

I am certain of it; I have no hesitation in saying he is the man; he produced a measure, and asked for a pair of women's shoes of that size; he put his hand into a pair of shoes that I gave him, and he said they were not big enough; then I went to the glass case and got a larger pair; he said, they were to go to Mr. Brandon's, in Tabernacle-walk, a family that had dealt with us a good while; I said, I did not like to send the shoes by him, but I would send my litle girl with them, and I sent her with three pair of shoes; she came back again, I am sure it was not five minutes after; I gave her the purple shoes, and she took them; the child came back direcly afterwards, crying very much indeed, said, mother, the man has run away with the shoes that you gave me, and here is half-a-guinea he has given me; I looked at the half-guinea and saw it was a pocket-piece, (produces it;) the next morning I saw him again at the corner of Union-street, Bishopsgate-street, with a barrow of apples; I did not say any thing to him, but went home and fetched my husband; he went with me; I said to him, did not you rob me last night of three pair of shoes, and he said, go along, woman, I never saw you to my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, you are certain the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes, I am very sure of it, by his hair, and being marked with the small-pox; I am very sure he is the man; he is a great deal cleaner than he was then, and he has a different coat and waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>Q.Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The man was a stranger to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The person that came to you, told you he came from Mr. Brandon? - A. No, he did not say he came from Mr. Brandon, he said they were to go to No. 25.</p>

               <p>Cook. In consequence of this woman's information, I went on board the lighter, and found a sack or barley concealed under the sore-sheets of the barge, covered with a rope, two bundles of empty sacks, and two hurdles; Rolls denied it stoutly; Hammerton, I can scarcely say, did deny it; he was very modest about it.</p>

             sworn. - At the time this happened, I lodged in my master's warehouse, Mr. Gray, an auctioneer, in Roll's-buildings, Bond's-stables; I lodge now at the Bird-in-Hand public-house, in Long-Acre: On the 30th of September, I had been at work for my master all day, and I had drank a good deal in my work; in the evening I went to the Elephant and Castle, in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know at all how you got home that night? - A. I don't; I found myself in bed in the morning at home; I waked about seven o'clock in the morning, and found the prisoner in bed with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection whether you had seen him over night? - A. Not to my knowledge; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether, upon any occasion, you had ever seen him before? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon finding a man in bed with you that you knew nothing of, what did you say? - A. I asked him how he came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he undrest? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so too? - A. Yes; he said I had attempted to commit an unnatural crime, and he would not leave me till I gave him two guineas; I told him it was not in my power to give him two guineas, for I had not two guineas; he said, as I was a poor man, he would let me off for a guinea and a half; he said, if I did not give him that, he would report me; then I gave him a one-pound note, a seven-shilling piece, and four shillings in silver; it was money that I had taken belonging to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that induced you to give him this money and this note? - A. From the threats that he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. The threats of doing what? - A.Accusing me of an unnatural crime; he said, he would report me, and turn me out of my bread.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it from the fear of that accusation that you parted with the money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay with you after this? - A. We parted directly.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not say where it was he would accuse you of having committed this crime? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What time in the morning was it you parted? - A. About seven o'clock; he left me as soon as he had got the money.</p>
               <p>Q. This was only a ware-room? - A. No, an auction-room.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the key of the room? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. And nobody else was there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have let yourself into the room? - A. I cannot tell how I got home; I found the key in the inside of the door when I let him out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you tell whether you let yourself in or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not enquire how he came to be in bed with you? - A. I was so terrified, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not know that he was in bed with you till you waked in the morning in the way you have described? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Prisoner. Q. Do not you know you took me yourself to those premises that night? - A. I do not know; I was so intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, after you had got into bed, say that my head was too low; and did not you go and get a bolster to raise my head higher? - A. I did not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280024"/>Q. In the morning did I tell you I wished to see Mr. Gray? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell me you would certainly be a friend to me? - A. No; he said he was going of a furlough, and if I would give him that, I should never see his face any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not beg of me not to go away while the men were cleaning the carriages in the yard? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not then go down stairs, and lock me in? - A. When he told me he would take a guinea and a half, I had a two-pound note of my master's, and I went out to get the note changed, because I would not give him any more than a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you lock him in? - A. Yes, for fear he should take something out of my warehouse, and be off; I was absent about five minutes; I got it changed at Mr. Hall's gin-shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell me there would be a sale on the Wednesday, and if I would come, you would buy me a bed, if I would be honest and fair with you? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say it should be paid for at seven shillings a month, if I liked it? - A. I did not; that you will hear of hereafter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not look out at the window, and then call to me, and say, come down, now the men are gone? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not walk with me into Chancery-lane? - A. I turned him out of the room, and locked the door; I was obliged to go my master's, in Drury-lane, and as soon as the prisoner was gone, I went there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How near to him did you walk? - A. Not very near.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you walk in sight of him? - A. Not many minutes; he went down Chancery-lane, and I turned across for Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him after you came out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not take hold of my hand at parting, and tell me to come on the Thursday to the Yorkshire Grey, and call for a pint of porter? - A. No such thing ever was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you take hold of his hand? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first mentioned it to any body? - A. Above a week after; he had plagued me at different times afterwards, and then I mentioned it to a friend of mine, who is here, Mr. M'Kinnon.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended? - A. On Monday, the 12th.</p>

             sworn. - I am a baker: On the 30th of September, about half past seven o'clock in the evening, the prosecutor came into the Elephant and Castle, in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to frequent the Elephant and Castle? - A. Yes; he called for four-penny worth of gin and water, and while the landlord was making it, he was so much intoxicated, that he fell down on the bench; I took him up, and carried him across Holborn into Chancery-lane; upon going down Chancery-lane, he said, you shall not go any further, go back to your company.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. About eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was capable of holding conversation with you at that time? - A. Yes, then knowing he was very near home, and had no coach turning to pass, I left him; I never saw the prisoner till I saw him at Marlborough-street Office.</p>

             M'KINNON sworn. - I am a cabinetmaker and upholder: On Monday, the 12th of October, the prosecutor came to me; he seemed to be under a great depression of spirits; he told me the story, and then I advised him to take the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Biggs.) How came you to learn who the prisoner was, so as to apprehend him? - A. No more than his coming backwards and forwards to me in the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you apprehended him? - A. In Roll's-buildings.</p>
               <p>HART KEELEY sworn. - I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner on the 12th of October; Mr. M'Kinnon applied to me to be in waiting, and I went with him; I understood the prisoner was to meet the old man to have three pounds of him, and the old man brought him to the spot where he had been advised, and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Biggs.) Q. Did you not tell me when I was apprehended, that you were very sorry for it, and that you were forced to it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He had appointed me to meet him there to bid me good bye, because I was going out of town the next morning, and he gave me some gin and water.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, what have you to say in your defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing more to say than I have said; I know myself to be very innocent; I leave it to you, my Lord, as my friend, I have no other friend.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know it to be the same cover? - A. It is a very remarkable one, it is very old and cracked; I can assign no other reason, I should know it from five hundred.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I did keep a green-grocer's shop, in Fenchurch-buildings: On the 12th of July, about eight o'clock in the morning, my daughter informed me the kitt of salmon was gone; in consequence of information, on the Monday following I went to the prisoner's house in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is his house from your's? - A. About a quarter of a mile; Mrs. Beattie went with me; I saw, on the outside of his window, some thin salmon in a kitt, and on the window board, inside, I saw another kitt, the top of which, I believed to be mine; I went in to look at it, and asked the prisoner if he had no salmon thicker than that out of doors; I don't know that he gave me any answer; I lifted up the lid and saw some thick salmon under it; I knew the lid to be mine, it was a very remarkable one; I believe the salmon kitt and all to be mine, but that I do not swear to; I said to my lodger, good God, this is my lid; I was rather flurried, and I begged to sit down a moment; I then turned round to the prisoner, and said, good man, how came you by this lid of the kitt of salmon? it was stolen from my door last Friday morning, by seven o'clock; I said, I would not swear to the salmon, nor to the kitt, but if I were on my dying pillow, or in the East-Indies, I would swear to the lid; he made no reply; he then called a boy from some part of his house into the shop; he said to the boy, take this lid over to Issac's, the owner of it, of whom I borrowed it; I said, the lid was my property, and should not go out of his shop; the boy then got the lid out of the shop, and I was going to run after him; the prisoner laid hold of my arm to prevent my going after him, and said, go to hell and be d-d; I followed the boy across Petticoat-lane, and up an alley, nearly opposite the house; I followed him to the end of the alley, which brought me into the broad-way, then I lost sight of him; I was frightened, and could not run any farther; I was then surrounded by a very large concourse of Jews, three of them had the civility to take me into their house, and in about a minute or two, a number of Jews brought the lid to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had that lid? - A. About fifteen months; I have no doubt of its being mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You lost it on the Friday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found it on the Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore, there was all day Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for him to have purchased that lid of any body else? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was admitted to bail for this offence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he has surrendered here within this half-hour to meet his trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Lord-Mayor commit him to take his trial? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, upon your oath, he was admitted to bail by the Lord-Mayor? - A. I suppose so; I have received four notices of bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he was indicted at the September Sessions for a misdemeanor, only for receiving this cover, when the City chose to indict him for felony? - A. I suppose so, I don't understand it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had this cover fifteen months - be so good as tell the Jury the marks upon that cover? I can only describe it as an old cover, as being cracked in a great many places; there is no particular mark upon it, there is a little brass knob at the top of it; I used to wipe it myself, for fear my daughter should break it, it was so much cracked; it is not like the modern lids, they make the glass clear, but this is a much thicker glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see a salmon kitt with a thick glass cover before? - A. I never saw such a one as that before.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Vaillant. I lodged at Mrs. Taylor's house, in the month of July; on Monday the 3d of August, I went to the prisoner's house with her; Mrs. Taylor went in, and asked him whether he had got any other salmon than what he had there? I believe he said, he had not, when looking at the lid, she said, that was her's, she could take her oath it was her lid; she insisted upon having the lid, he took it from her, and said, is this her's and be d-d to her; here, boy, go and take this lid to Mr. Isaac's, where it belongs; I said, Mrs. Taylor, you ought not to let the lid go; he then put his hand out to prevent her going out; the boy then ran up the alley, opposite Mr. Abrahams's house; I lost sight of the boy, but saw the lid a few mi<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280026"/>nutes after, at the top of the alley; several people gathered round, and some Jews asked us to walk in, which we did; the lid was brought to us after we were there, but by whom I do not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This cover was lost on the Friday morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner admitted to bail by the Lord-Mayor? - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not committed for receiving, and is now indicted for a felony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. She cannot know that, we will admit that he was committed as a receiver, and he is now indicted as a principal.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the cloak here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. He is about the heighth; I cannot say more.</p>
               <p>JANE SWFFT sworn. - I live servant at the Catherine-Wheel, in Effex-street, Whitechapel; the prisoner Grover used our house: On Sunday, the 25th of October, the prisoner, the man that was tried this morning, and two others, came into our house, and left our house about a quarter before six.</p>

               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS sworn. - I am an officer of Lambeth-street: On Sunday evening, in consequence of hearing of this robbery, I went with Coomes to Whitechapel; we waited a little while in the street, when the prisoner, in company with a sailor that has been tried, past us, and walked as far as the Hat and Plough; then a third man came up, and spoke to them, about the heighth of the prisoner; they stopped together about a minute, and then went into the Plough; we followed them in, and the moment we went in, one man slipped out at the side-door. On the Monday I heard some conversation -</p>
               <p>Mr. Bevill. Q. Before he said any thing, did you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor threatened him? - A. No; I asked him how he came to be so foolish as to go with these men to commit this robbery; he said, it was the first time, and if he got over this, he would not do it any more; he said, they went from the Catherine-Wheel, in Catherine-Wheel-alley, about six o'clock, and going down Mile-End-road, towards Stepney-fields, he said they had neither of them, any money, and they agreed to stop the first person they met, and a young man and woman met them, and they agreed to stop them; they asked the young man for his money, but he got away from them, and then they took the young woman's cloak from her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bevill. Q. At first two persons passed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And after that you saw them go into a public-house? - A. Yes; after a third person had come up to them.</p>
               <p>Q. And that person was about the size of the prisoner? - A. He was.</p>

Yes, there were sixty floursacks on board; I put them on board about five in the afternoon, and covered them over with a tarpaulin; I slept on board the barge, but heard no disturbance in the night; I missed four sacks about four o'clock in the morning; I found the string of the tarpaulin cut, and the sacks gone; they belonged to Mr. Williamson, at Baldock, in Hertfordshire; Mr. Aylin had the carriage of them; I afterwards saw them in the possession of the watchman.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 23d of September, about half an hour after twelve o'clock, I was in my watch-box, about twenty yards from where the sacks were taken from, I saw the prisoner, whom I knew very well before, go on board the barge about half past eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing to do with this barge? - A. No, nothing at all; I saw him come a-shore with the sacks under his arm, and I stopped him; he jumped off the stairs into a ditch, and went along the ditch till he came out at Mr. Trappitt's whars, and then I took to him again till I secured him; I have had the sacks ever since.</p>

             sworn. - I am patrole of the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell, that part of the parish called Petonville; the prisoner was brought to me by another patrole; I took her and the prosecutor both to the watch-house; I asked him what he had to alledge against her; he told me, he had been connected with her in the fields at the back of Sadler's-Wells, and she had robbed him of a seven-shilling piece, a silver pen, a brass ink-stand, and iron nut-crackers; I searched her, but found nothing upon but a bad seven-shilling piece, that she said she had had ever since the 24th of June.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mann.) The seven-shilling piece that you lost was a good one? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming past the Woolpack, when that chap, and five or six more young lads, laid hold of my cloak, and said, I was the woman that robbed him; I am perfectly innocent.</p>

            , but I cannot say whether that was one of the notes that came from Mr. Drummond's, or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other five-pound notes about you, besides those you received from Mr. Drummond? - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you change that five pound with Jones? - A.Between one and two, on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. The same day that you bought this share at Mr. Drummond's? - A. The same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the shares of the lottery tickets? - A. Yes; one sixteenth Charles Everitt had, and I had the others; I had a quarter, and a sixteenth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the Everitts went to, after you had shared the money between you? - A. No; I was taken up the next morning.</p>

            's defence. On Monday morning I met Lovett at Queenhithe; he said he was going to buy some shares in the lottery; he asked me to go with him, I went with him to Mr. Drummond's; he was going to buy a quarter and a sixteenth; I told him, if he would buy a quarter, and two sixteenths, I would take one of them, and pay him for it in the afternoon; then we came back again, and I left him at the top of Bull-whars-lane, and agreed to meet him in Bishopsgate-street at three o'clock; he took me up a passage, and told me he had picked a gentleman's pocket of a fifty pound note, and some bills of exchange; there was to be a fight upon Wirtibledon-common, and I lent him four pounds near a twelvemonth ago, and he had not the opportunity of paying me; he gave me the fifty pound note, and told me to get it changed for him, and I was to pay myself the four pounds that he owed, and he was to give me six pounds more for getting it changed; I was to have ten pounds out of the fifty pounds; I thought I should not have got my money, unless I took the fifty pound note to get it changed, and I kept the whole of it; Lovell is swearing our lives away to save himself.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are, I believe, a pensioner in Chelsea-hospital? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a captain, I believe? - A. I am in that stile called a captain.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the unhappy man at the bar? - A. Yes, and have some years.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 2d of this month, did you go into the apartment of Lamb and the prisoner? - A. Yes, between seven and eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that particularly called you into the room in the morning? - A. As I was coming down stairs in the morning, I heard a noise; I stopped upon the landing of the passage, and heard a pistol discharged; I then went into the room, and saw the dead man laying on his back along-side of his bed, and saw the blood running through his shirt; I stood in amaze, and did not know what to say; the prisoner was then in his own bedchamber, but he came out of it, and said, I have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before those words were made use of by him, had you addressed any thing to him, or said any thing about what you had seen or saw? - A. No; he said, it is I that have done it, twice over.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come forth from his bed-chamber at that time? - A. Yes, when he said that.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he about him at that time? - A. I took a pistol from him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine that pistol, whether it was loaded or not, or whether it had been discharged? - A. It was a discharged pistol, with the cock down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a smell of powder in the room? - A.Surely there must be.</p>
               <p>Q. What further passed? - A. A little after, I found a broken pistol laying upon a chest of drawers; Charles Coates, the Governor's servant, was in the room just before me; I kept the pistol I took from the prisoner; the serjeant-major came, and ordered 
               <persName id="t18011028-39-person383">

             and me to stay, and take care of the prisoner, while he went to fetch somebody; Coates said to me, perhaps that pistol will shoot somebody; I took it up to see if there was any priming in it; there was some, which might have been in sometime, but am not sure; I took the ramrod, and put it in, and said, there is not much in here; then I turned the screw-end down, and drew out a little bit of white paper, and took out a ball, which I have got here; I then put the ramrod down again, and felt no powder in the barrel.</p>
               <p>Q. During this time, did any thing pass between you and the prisoner? - A. He demanded the pistols of me, and said, he would lock them up in his drawers, and that he had bought them; there was no more conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known them both for sometime? - A. Six or seven years, but knew nothing of their affairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of any existing quarrel? - A. No; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You said, this broken pistol had the appearance of having been loaded sometime? - A. From the pan, it seemed as if it had; if you understand the nature of powder, after it has been put in sometime, it will grow soft.</p>
               <p>- LAMB sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the wife of the deceased; tell the story of the melancholy event that took place on the 2d of October? - A. I got up in the morning a little before seven; Mr. Legg was walking about the common room, swearing, and quite in an ill humour, I thought; I asked him what was the matter, when he began to swear the more, and said, I will turn you out of the room, if you speak another work; my husband was then in bed and asleep; I thought I heard him stirring, and opened the door to see; he had just got out of the bed, when the prisoner rushed past me, and put a pistol into his hand; he took it, turned it about, and looked at it, and said, what is this for; the room was dark, and then he threw it into the common room; my husband had just put on a little flannel waistcoat, and stood up against the door; the prisoner then, after my husband had thrown the pistol away, rushed up immediately, and fired at him, as he saw him through the glass door; when he had done so, he looked at me, and said, I have done it; I saw the blood coming out of his breast, and I cried out, murder; he fell directly; and expired; he endeavoured to call my name, but could not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had known this unhappy man for sometime? - A. Yes, some years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lived with your husband, while the prisoner was in this common room? - A. All the while the prisoner was there, and sometime before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any ill-will between your husband and this man? - A. God knows what ill-will he had, but my husband had none towards him; I took him to be a very solid man, for he washed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280035"/>his own linen, cooked his own victuals, and took the sacrament regularly, so I thought he was a man rather better than what he has turned out.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Abbott. Q. Be so good as to tell us what you know of this affair? - A. I went into the deceased's room in the morning of the 2d of October, and found him laying quite dead on his back; I never perceived him move hand or foot; after I looked at the body, I was turning round, and the prisoner came towards the bed-room; he began to say, spreading his hands, I am the person; I immediately said, what, did you shoot him; and he said, I did, or to that effect; I understood him plainly that he had done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason why he had done it? - A. I said, good God, why you have killed him, he is quite dead, how could you do so; he paused, and said, I gave him a pistol in his hand, to come out and fight me like a man, he would not, but threw it down, then I tired.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any further observation? - A. When he first told me, he was very little agitated; I could almost have said, you are joking, but did not; afterwards, he walked up and down the room, and grew more agitated; he said a great deal more, but I cannot take upon myself to repeat exactly; he said, it is done, and so on; I overheard him say, I am satisfied it is done; that was some time after, or to that effect.</p>

             sworn. - I am the surgeon of Chelsea-hospital: I saw the deceased lying by the bed-side, and found the mark of a ball, which had penetrated on the right side, and satisfied me it must have killed him; I afterwards examined the body, and found the ball went in between the fifth and sixth ribs through the lungs, and through the large veins of the heart, and made its way under the shoulder on the opposite side, which was immediate death; the fifth rib was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A.Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever observed in his conduct any thing to induce you to believe he was deranged? - A. He never had the least appearance of it, in my opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - A.Ever since he has been in the hospital.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord - After repeated insults, I prepared a case of pistols, according to what I had mentioned to my adversary, that I would prepare for him at any time he chose, to make a decision of the quarrels that had been between us from time to time; in the morning, he came out to me in a tyrannical manner; I told him I was prepared with a case of pistols, and would give him his choice; I went to my drawer, took them out, held them at arm's length, and said, take your choice, which he did, by violently snatching it from me, and throwing it with violence towards me, on which I cocked my pistol, fired, and shot him; had he done as a soldier should do - have taken a pistol moderately, and made an agreement to go to a proper distance, requiring or agreeing which should give the word to fire, then it would have been done after another manner; he was a tyrannical tempered man, and not easy to deal with; from time to time he aggravated me so, and harrassed my life so much, that I was driven to silence or moderate him; there was not one person but the deceased's wife present.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Where do you live? - A.At Chelsea, and am a tobacconist; I have known the prisoner ten years, to the time of his being apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you observed lately any thing in his deportment to lead you to conclude he is not in his right senses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the 2d of October? - A. This year past, he used to buy tobacco of me; one day, about half a year ago, he talked very wild, and said he was going to have a company, and be in commission afresh, under Lord Cornwallis in Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be intoxicated? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more? - A. He asked what was the best way to destroy a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at the same time? - A. No, about seven o'clock in the morning; I told him, I thought shooting was the best, but if it was me, I should drown myself; I understood it, as applied to himself; I never saw him again till he was in Clerkenwell, when he asked me to bring him pistols, and I told him I dared not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Has any thing else occurred to induce you to keep that opinion? - A. I always looked upon him to be insane, but I remember nothing particular after that, or before it; he was always alone, never with any body, and I don't suppose that he would take any notice of the Governor of the College; he was always wild.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Attorney General. Q. He expressed a desire to have a commission under Lord Cornwallis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a captain now? - A. He is called a captain, but is only a serjeant.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe several of the invalids have been sent to Ireland during the late war? - A. I believe they have.</p>
               <p>Q. And he is of that country? - A. Yes; he said he should like to be in actual service again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any instance of a serjeant going out with a commission? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. He expressed a wish to be in actual service<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280036"/>again? - A. Yes, and I looked upon that to be great insanity; and wishing to have a company.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he talked about the most expeditious way of killing a man? - A. He asked which was the best way to destroy a man, and I took it to be himself; he did not say whether it was to destory himself or others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did those things impress your mind - have you mentioned it to any body in the house to take care of him? - A. I did not mention it to hardly any body at all, not thinking any thing would happen from the poor man.</p>
               <p>Q. If the derangement had appeared to be considerable, should you not have thought it your duty to have communicated it to some person in the house? - A. I thought it would go off again; he always walked in this manner, (with his arms across.)</p>
               <p>ANN GRANT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. About nine years; I am nurse in the Old Infirmary, at Chelsea; the prisoner was in the hospital, under my care, from the beginning of the year to the 10th or 11th of May; and, during that time, I saw a very great change in him, which I never saw before; a lowness, a melancholy and deranged state; knowing him so long, I took the opportunity of asking him what was the matter with him, and the reason of his melancholy; he told me his mind was confused; that he had no rest night or day; that he was hurried from place to place, and could not tell what he was doing; and I really was afraid he would make away with himself; I was always unhappy when he was out of my sight, for fear he should do himself an injury; I never mentioned it to the doctor, because he was harmless; after he left the Infirmary, I often met him in that melancholy state, and sometimes when I spoke to him, he would start like a person surprized out of a sleep; sometimes he would give me an answer, and sometimes only just a bow; I still observed that lowness and melancholy, and that his head was always confused down to the time of this unfortunate event.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. He was visited by the medical gentlemen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They had just the same means of observing his conduct as you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention it to them? - A. No; I did not like to do it, because I knew it would hurt his feelings.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on Saturday, the 17th of October, the deceased being at home? - A. I came home about a quarter before eight at night, and just after Mrs. Stark came into me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sober? - A. For what I know; she came in and out as usual; she did not appear to be drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state of health was she? - A. She said something laid very heavy on her; she was very low in spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. For what you know she was very well in health? - A. Yes, for what I know; the afterwards went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the prisoner come home? - A. I believe about twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came home, what was his appearance? - A. He was very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the deceased any child? - A. Yes, she was laying upon the bed with the child at half past eleven o'clock, when I went to hang up a frock and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she her clothes on? - A. Yes, she was laying outside of the bed next the door, and her child by her.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us all that passed when Stark came home? - A.

               <p>Q. What sort of noise was it? - A. She was crying out not to be beat so; he was beating her; the door was shut too; I asked him to open it.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect what you heard the prisoner or deceased say? - A.Only his swearing at her; I cannot tell the precise words; I told him to open<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280037"/>the door, which he did directly; I went in, and begged him not to beat his wife so; after he opened the door, he was at her again.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he beating her? - A. With his hands, but I cannot say whether open or shut; I asked him what was the matter? and he said,"she has pawned my breeches, Mrs. Paskins;" she begged him not to beat her, and she would talk to him in the morning; and I told him to look over it; I asked her to come down stairs with me, which she did, and he came after us directly; she just entered my room, when he knocked her down with his fist on her head; I said, for God's sake! don't beat your wife in my place, for I won't have it done; then he told me to turn her out; when she was down, he began kicking her; I took her up by the two shoulders, as well as I could, but she went on in so shocking a manner, making faces, that it shocked me very much; and I begged of him to take her up stairs; she had a curly head, and no cap on, and he came directly, and took hold by the hair, and dashed her out upon her head, very badly indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do that more than once? - A. Once or twice by the hair of the head, and kicked her very much on the floor; I begged her to go up stairs; she got up by some means or other, but I don't know how; I called for assistance, but nobody came; she got up stairs some how or other, and I went up after, and the prisoner too; when I got her up stairs, I put her on the bed; she fell rather heavy, and the child cried; I beaved her legs on the bed, and covered her up; I begged the prisoner not to strike her any more, for that I would not come up any more, but would call the watch; I then came down, as I heard no more at that time, and I went to washing again; the child cried, but I imagined it wanted the breast.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you see the prisoner again? - A. I saw him in the morning; I went to bed about two or three o'clock for an hour, and was ironing when he came down, a quarter before six, or a quarter after; he passed my door, and said, "Good morning." About half past seven o'clock, I sent my little girl, about eleven or twelve years old, to ask Mrs. Stark for six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what she told you, what did you do? - A. I went up to the door, and called twice, but nobody answered me; the door was open, and I thought she might be asleep; I looked in, and saw her on the bed; it is a large room; I came down to Mrs. Terry's room, who lodges on the same floor with me, under Stark's room; I did not see the deceased again till she was dead, and the surgeon had been there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You are a lone woman? - A. Yes, my husband is in the army, and has been gone from me a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in a state of voluntary separation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lodgers are there in the house? - A. There is myself, Mrs. Terry, and a man lodger underneath.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, when you saw her about eight o'clock, you cannot say whether she was sober? - A. I being in a hurry did not take much notice of her.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her again till half past eleven? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the interim there was abundance of opportunity for her going in and out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the habit of drinking? - A. I cannot say any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in the house? - A. Four or five months.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, do you not know she was in the habit of drinking? - A. I suppose sometimes she would have a drop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know she was frequently and continually in the habit of getting drunk? - A. I cannot say any such thing, because I don't think she had money to do it, and I am out a great deal.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not seen her repeatedly drunk? - A. No, I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying she had a drop or so? - A. She might; I cannot say, I am not much at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she laying on the bed as a sober woman would? - A. She was laying on the side of the bed with the child.</p>
               <p>Q. Not laying across the bed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said, that when you went up, before the husband returned, that, from the posture in which she lay, she appeared to be drunk? - A. No, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Barlett? - A. I know nothing more than his coming to my master's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about this business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Recollect yourself whether you had not? - A. No, because he was no acquaintance of mine; he was talking at my landlord's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, you were confident of your husband's return, and if you did not prosecute this man, husbands would treat their wives in any manner they pleased? - A. No, never; my husband never treated me ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you told us all that passed when he came down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said, that she came into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280038"/>your room, and tumbled against your bedstead? - A. No; her husband said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said, she threw herself with violence upon it, and hurt her side? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. After the deceased was gone up stairs, did not you and the prisoner drink together? - A. The prisoner says so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - A. Only a pint of porter with my supper and children before they went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not drank some gin with the prisoner after all this business? - A. I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you drink gin and not know it? - A. I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not yourself give him some money, and send him for gin; and did not you and he drink it? - A. I don't know as I did; I said,"you have frightened me almost to death."</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell whether you sent money for gin? - A. I don't know; but I know very well there was a bottle on my table.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not that had gin in? - A. I really don't know; for when she was taken in that manner, I scarce could stand.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, although you say you were sober, that you don't know whether you put your hand in your pocket for money for the gin? - A. If I was to swear to it, I should swear that I did not; but I said, I wish to God I had something, for you really frighten me to death.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, did you not desire him to go for the gin? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the gin? - A. I cannot tell, I was so bad; I set on my low chair, and was ready to drop; it was my bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you usually keep that bottle? - A. Not in any place in particular; it is the bottle my boy carries his tea in to school in the morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Does your want of recollection, whether you gave money for gin or drinking gin, arise from being drunk or from a confused situation? - A.From confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that arise from what you had witnessed between that man and his wife? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a man lodger in the lower part of the house during the time you were in the room up stairs, in the deceased's room, in your own room, or when she was dragged into the passage, did you see that man? - A. No, he is a clerk, and goes out, and we hardly ever see him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.What part of the transaction was it you said you wished to God you had something, for he had frightened you to death? - A. I don't know whether it was when she was so violently ill in my room or afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear you were perfectly sober? - A. Yes, I can with a clear and safe conscience.</p>
               <p>MARY TERRY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lodge in the same house with the prisoner on the 17th of October? - A. Yes, on the floor underneath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased on that night? - A. Yes, in the evening at six o'clock, she drank tea with me after she had been out at a day's work in Newcastle-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether she was sober? - A. She was very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her again? - A. At a quarter before ten she came into my room, and I lent her one shilling and six-pence; she was very sober then; she went up stairs, and I never saw her again till she was dead; I went to market, and returned about eleven o'clock; the prisoner came home at twelve o'clock exactly, but I did not see him; I heard him say very bad words; I knew him by his loud voice, but could not hear what he said; I heard, by the sound of the room, that he was beating and dragging her off the bed; I heard Mrs. Paskins go up, and say, what are you doing, Stark, but did not hear the reply; I then heard the deceased and Mrs. Paskins go down together, and the husband follow them; he began beating her again very much in the passage, and I heard him repeat very bad words; whether he pushed or beat her I don't know, but he knocked her against my door so, that I thought it would burst open; I did not hear her speak, but the same noise continued of his still beating or kicking her; then they all went up stairs together, Mrs. Paskins shut the door, and came down; and then I heard, by the sound, that Stark was beating his wife again; I heard her say,"Stark, beat me no more to-night, for God's sake! if I have done a fault, I will own it to-morrow." I heard no more, and thought they went to bed; between five and six, I heard him walking about in the room, for he gets up at that time to go blacking shoes, in Holborn, and I heard him go down a quarter before seven; in consequence of what I heard, I went into the room at ten o'clock, and saw her with one hand over her head, and the other under it, rather on her left side, and the child sucking the left breast, with a bit of bread and cheese in its hand; it was speaking to its mother; I put my hand to her cheek, and found she was dead and cold; I went down stairs, and the surgeon was sent for; she had her gown, petticoat, and stays on, but no cap, handkerchief, shoes, or stockings; she was on the bed covered over with a blanket; I afterwards saw the state of her body; there appeared to be a kick with the edge of a shoe on the side of her temple the length of my finger almost; her right foot was marked very much, very black all over; her left knee was black all over, and both of her shins had the skin kicked off; the tip of her nose was almost bit off, and there was the mark of two teeth on each side<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280039"/>of it; her arms, legs, face, and neck, and where I saw, was bruised; her arms were bruised all over, so that there was not a place so big as the palm of my hand without.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was she at six o'clock or half past ten, sober? - A. She was to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing lead you to believe she was not? - A. No, she was at work all day; she asked me at twelve o'clock if I would lend her a farthing, for she had only a penny to get her a half pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Paskins drunk? - A. No, for she had been at work at the cook's shop all day.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A. I was, for I had neither victuals nor money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had neither victuals nor money, and yet you lent her one shilling and six pence? - A. That was as soon as I got my husband's wages.</p>
               <p>Mr. CROWTHER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a surgeon, and was called in to the unfortunate woman on Sunday morning; I saw her with her arms up, and with many bruises about the head and face; I went again on the Monday to inspect the body, and Mr. Andre helped me; on opening the belly, I observed a great quantity of blood had been shed into that cavity, and on removing which blood, which in quantity exceeded above two quarts, we found the spleen had been ruptured in two places, and that the external bruises corresponded with the injury done to the spleen; we opened the head and chest also, and, excepting some external bruises, the contents of both those cavities were in their natural healthy state.</p>
               <p>Q. From those bruises about the head and face, you are not of opinion those could cause death? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. We come now then to the spleen and the outside bruises - are you of opinion that those bruises, externally corresponding with the injury of the spleen, occasioned death? - A.Clearly so; I do not know what caused the rupture of the spleen, but the injury done to the spleen was the cause of shedding so much blood.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing that external injury, which corresponded with the rupture of the spleen internally, should have been occasioned by kicking or dragging about the floor, would they have those appearances? - A. If done with sufficient violence to produce the effect.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDRE sworn. - I was with Mr. Crowther, and concur in what he has said.</p>

             sworn. - I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday morning, and asked him how he came to use his wife in that violent manner; he said, he did not intend to kill her, but did not deny kicking or beating her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Saturday, when I went home to dinner, my wife desired me to pull off my breeches and stockings, and she would wash them for me against Sunday morning, to put on; I accordingly did so, and went to my work as usual, till near twelve o'clock at night; when I came home, I found my bed-room in darkness; I went to Mrs. Paskins for a light, which she lent me, and I found my wife laying across the side of the bed asleep; I waked her, and she got up, and went to the other side of the room; I asked her why she did not wash the few things, as she told me she would, ready to put on; she says,"Stark, make up the bed." I accordingly did, and set the child on the floor, who was crying; on my making it up, I found my breeches and stockings gone; I asked her again; she said, "Stark, I have pawned your clothes, and spent the money." I put the child on the bed, and said, Mary, you cannot bide any longer with me, for I cannot support your pawning my clothes, and spending all my money as you do; I saw she was much in liquor; I goes to her to take her by the shoulders to turn her out of the room, and did not strike her, but she fell against the post of the door; she got up very fast, as soon as possible, and run into Mrs. Paskins's room, and fell across the side of the bed, and broke it; Mrs. Paskins then called to me, "Stark, come down, and pull your wife off, for she will kill herself, for she has broke down the side of the bed to the floor." I then came down to pull her up; I am not sure which way I pulled her out, whether by the hair, shoulders, clothes, or how, but I got her out, and I believe I struck her, but with no bad intention or design, for I had no malice; I took her in my arms, but was not able to carry her up, and she fell out of my arms on the floor in the passage. Mrs. Paskins there said, don't beat her any more, here go and get a quartern of gin for you and me; I did, and I took the bottle, and went and got a quartern of gin at that time; when I went out, my wife was laying on the floor where I let her fall, but when I came back, she was gone up stairs; I cannot tell whether Mrs. Paskins had helped her or not; I brought the gin home, and Mrs. Paskins and I drank it ourselves; I set down on the chair, and put the bottle on the table; I then went up stairs, and my wife said, "Stark, don't kill me!" says I, I will not; and I went to bed, with my baby crying, and then I went to sleep; what time my wife came to bed, I don't know; but at five o'clock she got out of bed, and then got in again, and took the child to give it suck; I said by her side till half past six; then I got up, the child was awake, and I gave it a bit of bread and cheese, and laid another bit on the table for the child, as it could get it itself; I put the child into bed, and she turned from her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280040"/>right side to her left, and gave the child suck; then, at half past six, I said to her, Mary, where is the little stool I sit on; she said, look on the other side of the room, and there I found it, and went and took it up; then she was suckling the child, and turned round again from her left side to her right; I went away when it wanted a quarter of seven, and did not see her after.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see him in the month of September last? - A. I did, on Friday, the 18th of September; I made an appointment, and told him I should be out on Saturday and Sunday, but would meet him on Monday by the side of the dead wall in Lincoln's-inn-fields; I communicated it to my friends, and Mr.

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say you did not communicate this particular transaction to any person, before the prisoner was taken up? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you communicate generally, that an exorbitant demand had been made upon you? - A. No, I did not in those terms; I told Mr. Parr about the rum and brandy; I said, a man had come, and got a gallon of rum, and a gallon of brandy, from me, and said, his name was Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him how he got it? - A. I did; he came one morning with two stone bottles, and said, he must have a gallon of rum, and a gallon of brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you give it? - A.Because I was alarmed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Though you told Mr. Parr<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280041"/>about a particular transaction about rum and brandy, you never told him that he had extorted twenty guineas from you last November? - A.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I kept a public-house, called the Dake's Head, in Phoenix-alley, Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor make any communication to you in September? - A. He did in January.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Lincoln's-inn-fields in September last? - A. I did, in consequence of his calling on me the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time in the morning did you go? - A. About eight o'clock; I saw the prisoner there at half past eight, under the dead wall, at the fourth post from the watch-box; he stood up for some little time with his arms across, looking backwards and forwards; I was sitting in the Star public-house, waiting for Mr. Spencer and his nephew to come; I saw him there till the clock struck nine; then he pulled his watch out of his pocket, got up, and went through Great Turnstile, into Holborn; I followed him, and met Mr. Spencer and his nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of any thing that had passed between you and him, apprehend the prisoner? - A. We met him plump, and took him by the collar in Holborn, opposite Mr. Corbyn's, the chemist's shop; we took him to the Star public-house, and from thence to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him to say any thing to you? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be worse for him? - A. No; he asked liberty to go to a place to evacuate; I told him if he did, I would go with him; I got a candle, and went down with him; says he, I wish you would take me to any place than to Bow-street, and I will give you forty guineas, if you won't take me to Bow-street; do you want to get me hanged instead of you, says I, what do you mean by offering me forty pounds, I will do no such thing; he said, that is more than I have had of Mr. Spencer; I did not know, says I, that you had had any money; he said, I had better let him go, why should I be so anxious to take his life away, that I must look very sharp to get the blood money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You and Mr. Spencer have been old acquaintances? - A. About ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. I have seen him five or six years back frequently; he was a soldier when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. He was intimate with the prosecutor, was not he? - A. Not that I know of; I have seen the prisoner several times, but the last time I saw him before I took him into custody was, as they were going up Holborn, in January; I did not see him with Mr. Spencer but that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How often, in the course of the year, had you seen Mr. Spencer and the prisoner together? -- A. Never, but in January, when I saw them going up Holborn together; that was the only time till I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had not seen them together before that? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. This conversation about the forty guineas, somebody else heard, I suppose? - A. I don't know, it was in the cellar; there was nobody there but the prisoner and me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you were not examined as a witness where you now stand? - A. What, in January 1799?</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not examined in that place as a witness? - A. Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been examined before as a witness? - A. I have been examined here several times as a witness, but not at that time.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Every word Mr. Parr has said, is false; I never mentioned a word, that he has mentioned, to him, either in the cellar, or any where else; when he said, I was his prisoner, I asked him by what authority; I said, I was not afraid to go, for I was innocent of what was laid to my charge; he went with me into the cellar, and asked me whether I had not better go away; I said, I would not, for I was innocent; I have a wife and family, who, I hope, you will think of; the Bow-street officers, after I was in custody, went and took fifteen guineas out of my box, and a watch, with a gold chain and seal, which I bought in Oxford-street.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. I cannot exactly tell; I agreed to give her two shillings; we slept together till between five and six in the morning; I had my breeches under my head, and in them a purse, containing five guineas; when I waked in the morning, between five and six, I searched, and found my money safe; I got up to evacuate, and while I was doing that, she got the money from me; I saw her take the money out of my breeches; I then laid hold of her, and had a struggle with her, to get the money back again, and she cried out, and a man came into the room with a knife in his hand, and swore, if I did not stand back, he would run the knife into my heart; I still kept in contention with her, and then a woman, that he called his wife, came up with a pair of tongs, and hit me with the tongs on my back; I took the tongs from her, and then the man said, if I did not lay down the tongs, he would surely run the knife through my heart; I was afraid of being murdered, and I put on my breeches, my waistcoat, and my jacket, and there came a black man behind me, he struck me upon my back, and I made resistance till I got out into the street; then the people gathered about, and they threw my shoes and stockings out at window, and I put them on; I then went to Lambeth-street, and got an officer.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Lambeth-street, Whitechapel: On Tuesday, the 20th of October, the prosecutor came to me, and said, he was robbed of five guineas; that he had been used very ill, and asked me to go with him to apprehend the man that had robbed him; he said, he saw the girl with the money in her hand; I went, and apprehended her; I searched her, and found upon her one shilling, and some halfpence; she said, she knew nothing about it, she had no other money; he told me, there was an old man drew a knife upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that man? - A. It turned out to be a man of the name of Stinson; he saw him in the House of Correction; he told me exactly the same story before I apprehended the girl, that he has now told your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he was quite sober at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Stinson not to be committed? - A. Before the girl had her last examination, he was taken in execution, and sent to the House of Correction.</p>

Five weeks ago last Sunday, between eleven and twelve o'clock; I told him I could not do it that day, because it was Sunday; I told him I would do it to-morrow morning; he said, if I could not do it before, that must do; he said, he had got a parcel just by, and asked me to put it in my place till to-morrow; I said, yes; he said, he had more to put to it, and they might be moved altogether; he said, will you come with me and fetch it; I said, yes; he took me down Sharp's-alley, across the sewer, near Chick-lane; he told me to stop a bit; I did stop a bit; he told the prisoner at the bar to bring a sack, which he did, and delivered it to me; then I took it home, and put it down in the shop just by the dresser; Barnet came to me a few minutes afterwards, and asked where I had put the sack, and I told him; he said, it would get wet there, and desired me to put it in my back room, which I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any nails? - A. No, it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. What nails were these? - A. They were Dutch filling nails, made in Holland; they are made into copperas; they are stripped from the bottoms of Dutch-Indiamen; I went with the officer, Brown, to the house of Henderson, on the 11th of September, with a search-warrant; his house is at Poplar, about half a mile from the copperas manufactory; we found two bags of nails, and a quantity lying on the floor loose in the back room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that search was the prisoner apprehended? - A. Not more than three hours, I imagine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he the servant of Messrs. Perry? - A. Yes, the nails in the manufactory were under his care.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I went with a search-warrant on the 11th of September to the apartments of Henderson; in the back room I found a quantity of filling nails in a basket; and, when I came to empty the basket, I found two parcels tied up; after these nails had been found, Sebley was brought to the office by Mr. Dalton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the Lebeck's Head before he went to the office? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he made acquainted with what had been found? - A. Yes, I brought the parcels, and put them down on the table before his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person make use of any promise of favour, or any threat, to induce him to give an account of those parcels? - A. No; he said the parcels then on the table were in the same state in which he had sold them to Henderson, and in the same manner in which he had brought them from Mr. Perry's premises; he told me he had sold more at different times; and we found a great many more.(The examination of the prisoner produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the Magistrate's hand-writing? - A. Yes, and I saw the prisoner sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any promise or threat made to induce him to confess? - A. None.</p>

             placed ourselves in such a situation where we could distinctly see the window through which the goods were taken; it is a moving sash; I kept my hand upon the bolt of the door which opens within half a yard of the window, while Mr. Rigden attentively watched the transaction; and, upon his making a signal that was agreed upon, I instantly opened the door, and the prisoner at the bar was taken upon the spot; I did not see him take the cloth, nor did not see it when the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window broke? - A. No, it was done by shoving up the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this cloth? - A. Full twelve guineas; I saw the cloth immediately before; it has never been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You had stationed yourself at the door for the purpose of detecting any person? - A. Yes, we were there expecting such a transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Your main attention, therefore, was towords something outside of your house? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this property of your's was taken from an outer window? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you had not applied your attenteion to see whether it might not be half an inch or a quarter of an inch wanting to be closed? - A. No, it was a sash without weights, and therefore it was quite down.</p>

               <p>Q. You had lighted candles, I believe? - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lighted candles a quarter of an hour before that? - A. I doubt whether it was so much, for we did not expect them quite so soon; our place is very noisy, and when it is so dark, we cannot see to do our business; we are obliged to light candles, it was not dark out of doors.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there light enough to see the features of a man out of doors? - A. Yes, perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of your family at home at that time? - A. Yes; myself, my wife, my children, and my shopman.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it day-light outside? - A. It was about six o'clock; I saw a man come to the window as though he belonged to the place.</p>
               <p>Q. What man do you mean? - A. The prisoner at the bar; he came up to the window, and, I think, said, here, Tom, take this cloth; nearly as loud as I speak now; he then lifted up the sash.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window quite close? - A. Yes, I looked at it before I stood in the passage; the prisoner at the bar pushed up the window very deliberately, as thought he had belonged to the house; I said to Mr. Muston, here are the men, do not be in a hurry, I will give you the word; there were three pieces of cloth, and he took out the middle, which was a superfine; he gave it to the other man he had called to, and said, go along; I instantly jumped by Mr. Muston, and laid hold of the prisoner; when I first ran up to him, the other man had got the cloth, and be tried to cover him; I laid hold of him; he tried to get away from me, and I tore his coat; I am postive he is the man; I saw his face when he took the cloth; he was some minutes at the window before he opened it; I delivered the prisoner to Mr. Muston's shopman; a constable was sent for, and he was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had been upon the watch with the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.These things were placed there for the purpose of giving persons an opportunity of taking them? - A. They were generally there; it is a counter that runs along.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a private passage? - A. When the shop is shut it is.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a public court? - A. Yes, the court is a public way.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it dark? - A. It was light enough to see the features of the prisoner; I was standing within my own door, I saw the prisoner go to Mr. Muston's window, and lift it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and say if you are certain? - A. I am very certain he is the same person; I turned round to call to my father, who was up stairs, and at that time I heard the cloth was missing, but I did not see it taken; I immediately turned round from calling my father, which was not a mintue, and saw Mr. Rigden take him; he was taken into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were there any lights in Mr. Muston's shop? - A. I believe there were.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you both undress? - A. Yes, entirely; I laid my clothes down upon the chair, and put my watch under the pillow; after we had laid awhile, we got up, and drest ourselves; she drest herself quicker than I did, and the old woman came up into the room, and kept me in talk while she went away with the watch; I saw the watch in her hand; it was a silver watch; I got up, and went after her as quick as I could, but she was gone in an instant; I could not find her till the next day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes, I had some acquaintance with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house is this? - A. It is a house of ill fame, and sometimes lodgings for single men without any women; the prisoner happened to be there, and I got into company with her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you feel your money last before you got into the house? - A. I felt it in my fob after I was in the house; the fourteen shillings were in my left-hand breeches-pocket, all the rest was in my fob; we went to bed together; she did not pull off all her clothes, I pulled off all mine; I put my breeches under my head; I awoke in two hours, and found she was gone; I missed all the money mentioned in the indictment; every individual farthing was gone, and the breeches lying upon the floor; I found the prisoner about three hours afterwards concealed in a closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking that day? - A. Very little, not above three or four pots of porter among two or three of us.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the first you saw of the porter? - A. He was going out of the passage; she was in the passage with a light; the prisoner came to me first, as a single woman, but I never saw any man after her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Collins gone before you weighed any part of the hemp that was brought by him in the waggon to your premises? - A. Yes, and the waggon gone away; but Armstrong and Ray went after him, and took him on the road; I went with the officers to Griffiths's house on the Saturday following, in consequence of information, and saw some hemp in his dwelling-house, and some in the adjoining house in the garret, which appeared to be of the same quality with the hemp I had lost; Griffiths was asked by the officer, whether he had a bill of parcels from where the hemp came; there was a file with bills of parcels; I looked over them, but there was nothing relative to my business, and he pretended he did not know the person who brought it to him; I was not present when the hemp was weighed into the waggon; Livingstone was the man who superinteded the loading, I trusted him with that business; I suppose the waggoner was to obey his orders; Livingstone has absconded; Griffiths is a twine-spinner.</p>

             sworn. - I am a carpenter by trade, and a porter, or what I can get to do: On Wednesday, the 2d of September, I was passing by Shoreditch church about three o'clock, and a man was trying to get a load on his back, but he could not, he was so much in liquor; there were two men, but I did not know either; the drunken man said, he would give me a shilling, if I would carry it into Cock-lane; there were two loads done up in mans, one of which I was to carry; we went up Church-street, and he could not find his home; he then said, it was in High-street, Mile-end New-Town; I carried one bundle there, and it was lodged at Griffiths's the prisoner; nothing passed between Griffiths and me, and help me to take the other bundle, which was left under a window in Cock-lane; we went back, and took it to Griffiths's; we left it in a room where they were drink<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280057"/>ing tea; I left them there, and the man paid me.</p>
               <p>JOHN RAY sworn. - I belong to Worship-street, and apprehended Griffiths on the 5th of September; I informed him I had a warrant to search his house for hemp; he went with me to his dwelling-house, and said, he kept none there, but in the next house; we went to the garret of the next house, where he dressed hemp, and we found a quantity which Mr. Allanson believed to be his, and we brought it away; he shewed me the place; there was some matting in the room.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKERY sworn. - I am a Police officer, and was with Ray; Griffiths, me, and his wife, were in their house, when Pike came in, and said, it was here that I left the hemp; the wife then said, it was not you that brought it, it was a drunken man; and Griffiths said to his wife, you say nothing at all; there was a quantity of hemp in a bag in the other house; it is what twine-spinners use.(The hemp produced).</p>
               <p>Q.(To Burton.) Was the hemp you saw at Griffiths's, in a dressed state? - A. It was just ruffed over a tool; that in the waggon was tied up in large heads, and this had been cut open, worked into handfuls, and laid down, but I take it to be of the same quality.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the business of a twine-spinner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hemp, at the time it came to your master's, in a state fit for the twine-spinner? - A. After being dressed; this is not in a state for use; a dresser does that, but some twine-spinners can dress.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allanson. I believe this to be of the same quality that I lost.</p>
               <p>Collins's defence. I can say no more, than I delivered it to Mr. Allanson's foreman; I had no note to go with it; I delivered those two mats to the foreman, and when I came to the warehouse, I unloaded about half the waggon; I said, I had delivered two mats of hemp, and the foreman said, who to; I told him directly, to the foreman that came with me to see it delivered safe; when I got it unloaded, I was going to get a pot of beer, when the officers came, and took me; I said, I had delivered it to two men, but they took me up.</p>
               <p>Griffiths's defence. I bought the hemp of a person over the water, who is come forward to swear to the bill of parcels.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. That which is worked up you don't mean to speak to? - A. I speak to the quality of this in my hand; I don't think this is of the same quality as the other.</p>
               <p>Q. That you had last in your hand appears to be dressed? - A. It is worked merely; but hemp is so much alike nobody can swear to it.</p>

             sworn. - I am headborough: I apprehended the prisoners the same night, about a quarter before eight o'clock; Hurley was with Darcey; I took Hurley to the watch-house, he said he knew nothing of it; I got another headborough and returned back, and found the door fast; I knocked, and was answered by Darcey's wife that he was not there; I then broke the door open, I searched the room, and found him under the bed in one corner, with the bed-clothes over him, he was rather in a slate of intoxication, I took him to the watch-house.(Robert Brown confirmed the evidence of the last witness.)</p>
               <p>Darcey's defence. I was drunk on Sunday afternoon; I was going home and met these two women, and they began to abuse me; I was going over to strike them, that is the truth, and I fell into the kennel; they went in to get the poker, and I followed; that is all the harm I did.</p>
               <p>Hurley's defence. I was at home eating my supper, I heard a wrangle in the street, but never went near the door.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HART sworn. - I was near Mrs. Corker's house on Sunday evening, when the noise was, it was about dusk; I heard Darcey coming down the street, in liquor; I was right opposite the door, and I turned into the door for fear he should see me; there were a good many people in the street; he went to his brother Riley's house, just opposite Corker's door, and Mrs. Corker came out and said, you nastly Irish b-r, what business have you there; he went into the middle of the street, and said, he never offended the woman; she said, you lie, you Irish b-r, you did; she run into the door, he was going to take up some mud to throw at her, but fell into the mud; she fetched out a poker; then his wife came out, and sung out, murder; and another woman assisted her, and they forced the poker away from Mrs. Corker; I did not see the other lad concerned in it; that is all I saw. I work on board a ship, and was applied to when I came home from work; I am not related at all to the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Clarke). Does Corker keep a house of good reputation? - A. To the best of my knowledge, I know but little of them, I never saw them half a dozen times before this, I live about twenty-three doors from them; if they kept a bad house, I think I should hear of it; I don't know a soul in the house; it is possible girls of the town might live there, but I don't know it; they have been there but a very little while.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Featherstone-street, am a dealer in slates, and know the prisoner; he called upon me in May, I believe, and said, I have bought a lot of sugar, being just married, I thought to go into business, but I should be glad now to dispose of it, for I have altered my mind, and will thank you to take a few loaves of sugar of me; I am not sure whether he mentioned the number or not; I said, a few loaves were no object, as he had them upon hand, he might send a few; he said I should have them at a fair market price, but no price was mentioned; about a week after, when I went home, there was the sugar in a bag; there were ten loaves of sugar, my wife paid for it, and I shall know the receipts.(The receipts and bill produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the receipts and list you saw? - A. I cannot swear to the hand-writing; I believe this list is the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you to say, that the sugars were to be sold to you at a fair market price? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. He did not sell them like a thief? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he is a respectable young man? - A. I understood he lived with a merchant, but did not know where; I considered him as a respectable young man.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said he would let you have them at a fair market price, your ideas of his respectability did not vanish? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not take upon yourself to say you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280061"/>know any thing about the receipts? - A. I don't know that I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the signature? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you spoken to this list from belief, or from certainty? - A. Only so far, that when I went home there were some numbers and the list, the numbers and the list tallied; I believe it to be the list of the sugar I saw in the house, but have no other opportunity of knowing it, as I did not tally it with the weight.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of Mr. Harris, and know the prisoner Jones: I received some small loaves from a porter, and the prisoner came some night after and weighed them; he reckoned how much they came to at his own price upon paper, which Mr. Echalaz has got, (the list produced): this is the list he made, and I paid him about a fortnight after, according to his calculation, 5l. 16s. it was rather late, and I thought he wanted the money; so he wrote receipts on four pieces of paper as we could not get a stamp; the list was made out the same night the sale was made, I believe it was in April; we used several of the loaves, the rest were taken away; they were the same we bought of the prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - I lived servant with Messrs. Ives and Echalaz last April with the prisoner; I was clerk, and he was warehouseman; sugars were deposited in the warehouse in Thames-street; on the 24th of April Jones opened two hogsheads and took out thirteen loaves of sugar, without authority, belonging to Messrs. Ives, and sent them by Job Dawson, a porter, to the house of Harris, in Featherstone-street: Jones told me they were paid for, and gave me 3l. for my share: in about two months I was accused with it; in order to hide the deficiency in weight we put in a pavement stone and some bricks. and the hogiheads were sent to Hambro'.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The prosecutors have the good fortune to have you as a principal clerk in their business? - A. I am one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. It was your duty to superintend and watch over the conduct of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The story you have told to-day you have told at two different times in this Court before, have you not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Whether you have not, upon two different trials, given evidence against the prisoner, and he has been acquitted? - A. I have not only once.</p>
               <p>Q. And then the Jury acquitted Jones? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give your evidence before the Grand Jury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the bill thrown out? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood that you said not a word of this till you were accused of the felony yourself? - A. I was accused.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you say a word about this business until you and the prisoner were accused of stealing the sugar? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have received the money however? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no harm in that I suppose? - A. Yes there was.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you pocketed the affront and the money, and thought no harm in putting pavement stones and bricks into your masters' hogsheads that were to be sent abroad? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did think it harm, but you did it, and played a fraud on those who were to receive it abroad, yet never mentioned it till you were charged with it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you still clerk in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I give them joy of you. -(Job Dawson was called upon his recognizance.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I will not trespass long upon the time of the Court. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I stand here the object of most inveterate malice, grounded by the means of Bircham, who, to avoid the arm of justice himself, has taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280062"/>advantage of my unfortunate situation, and has endeavoured to saddle me with his guilt; the malice is evident, from the proceedings of the prosecutors last Sessions, who brought forward that young man to swear that two bags of cotton were missing from their warehouses; when, upon a question being put by my learned and able Counsel, Mr. Knapp, he confessed he knew nothing of it, but that his masters told him to swear so; it is clearly malice; also Mr. Echalaz deliberately and coolly told me, Jones, I'll hang you, if it costs me twenty thousand pounds; if there is any greater instance of malice, I don't know what it is; and if this don't do, says he, I will find a method that shall; those were his own words, confessed before every Gentleman on the Bench; I humbly submit, therefore, in consideration of the length of time I have been in trouble, having a pregnant wife, and being myself reduced to the last extremity, from the stigma brought on me, that you will be convinced and satisfied I am not the person they wish to represent me; notwithstanding Bircham has confessed to his robbing them to such an extent, still they retain him in their service, and I, who am innocent of every charge, am become the object of prosecution.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was not you who were to purchase the half-guinea, but Mrs. Smith? - A. It was me she made the bargain for both.</p>

               <p>Q. What way of life are you in? - A. I am Mr. Smith's house-keeper, who is a waterman and lighterman, and lives in Warwick Place, Stepney; I do this for the public good only; Mrs. Smith has not told me I am to have any thing; I don't know there is a farthing; I have not been told I shall be paid by any body, I give my time for nothing; Mrs. Smith applied to me, not I to her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How do you know this was on the 29th of August? - A. I kept an account of it; I did not say it was the 21st.</p>

Not particularly; she asked for the half-guinea, and made the bargain for it, and not me; I first asked for it, and she was to have it; an application was made to me by a woman of Bermondsey about bad money, and I understood the prisoner went about with bad money, so I was willing to see into it, and asked Gordon to go with me on Saturday; I mentioned it to Mr. Rogers, and he said, I had better go, and make a purchase; I never told Gordon she was to get any thing by it, I never expect a farthing, or she either.</p>

            ; I saw him on Saturday night, the 10th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock, coming from my master's yard with a sack on his back; I followed him down the street, when I lost him; but saw him again the next morning, about eight o'clock, in my master's yard; I attacked him with stealing corn, but he denied it; but he afterwards owned it; I told him it lay with my master to deal with him as he liked; he cried, and said, he took the provender out of the stable at night, and he gave it to a man, near the Green Dragon, at Poplar, with a horse and cart; and that it was put into the cart; and the man offered to give him potatoes or onions, or what he wanted; I took him into custody, and Brown, the constable, was sent for; and we went to the house of Skinner, but he was not at home; we found him at a public-house, and he was asked where his stable was; he said, he had not any; Brown went to find it, and left me to take care of him; Brown searched him, and found a key of the stable in his pocket; when Skinner was left with me, he wanted to get away, and collared me; but Brown returned in about a minute, and handcuffed him, and took him to the stable, and searched it, and found a sack full of horse provender, composed of bran, beans, and hay; I knew the sack.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. When Hollis confessed, was he drunk or sober? - A.Sober; I sent for the constable in about a quarter of an hour; he was a little intoxicated at the office, but sober when he confessed; we missed the sack the next day.</p>
               <p>- BROWN sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Shadwell-office; I was sent for to Mr. Bough's, at Poplar; I went and found Hollis a prisoner in the watch-house; I asked him where the person lived who received it; he said, a little above No. 40, in Rosemary-lane; that he kept a little house, and went about selling greens; I went to the house of Skinner, but he was not at home; then I went to the King's-arms, in Blue Anchoryard, Bough's servant was with me; as soon as Skinner saw me, he held his head down on the table; I took hold of him, and said, it is you I want, you must go with me; he pretended to be much in liquor; I took him to the Windmill public-house, and left him with Norton while I found the stable, which I did, and found the door locked; I went back to the Windmill, and searched Skinner, and found this key, (produces it;) I was going along the passage, and heard a cry out; I went back, and found he had got Norton against the door, and had almost throttled him; the publican stood at the door to keep the people off, and we were five or six minutes before we could handcuff him; I went to the stable which he said was his, and found the sack and provender; I locked it up, being Sunday, and on Monday morning went with Mr. Bough to Skinner in the watch-house, and then he said he bought it of a man facing the Green Dragon, Poplar, between ten and eleven o'clock at night; and they confessed it before the Magistrates.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. In what state were they? - A. Hollis appeared to be sick from liquor in the outer office, but he was very well when he went into the Magistrates; I cannot say whether he was sober or drunk; he answered every question put to him very well.</p>

               <p>Q. Where about in the street was it that he took the money out of your pocket? - A. Near to Mr. Philips's brewhouse-gate, a couple of hundred yards from Fairclough's; I saw the money not half an hour before; I was afraid to cry out, thinking, if I did something, worse might happen; it is a public street, but I saw nobody; I never said I gave it him, upon my oath; I then went home; I did not go to Smith's again that night, but, on Sunday, I did, and asked him if I had left my money there.</p>
               <p>Q. If you knew the prisoner had taken it all from you, how came you to go there? - A. I did not thoroughly recollect.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. The prisoner was not by when the prosecutor received the change? - A. No, he was at the other Smith's; the prosecutor called on me on Sunday morning, before I was up, and asked me if I had any money; I said, I had; says he, I want a little; I asked him what he had done with all his money; he said, he had lost it; I asked him where he parted with the prisoner; he did not say where, but said, he had been drinking at Fairclough's and Smith's, and two or three more houses; we then went about to enquire after it; I asked what time he had been at Smith's, the liquor-shop, on Saturday night; he said, he had been there sometime at night, and had something to drink, but he had no money; I then went to Smith, the publican, and asked when the prosecutor went from his house; I heard they both went away together; we then went to Mr. Donnell's, the Black Bull, New Gravel-lane, to enquire after the prisoner, where we heard the prisoner had wanted change for a ten-pound note; then the prosecutor said, "Anthony had his money."</p>
               <p>WILLIAM FAIRCLOUGH sworn. - I keep the Swan and Lamb, and know the prosecutor and prisoner; they came to my house about ten o'clock on Saturday; they were rather fresh in liquor; they had some beer, and Martin sent for steaks; after dinner, he called for the reckoning; they had two pots of beer, two half pints of gin, and four or five half pints of rum; they gave some of it away; he gave me a two-pound note, and Kidman asked me for the change; I told him Martin gave me the note, and I should give him the change; I saw Martin was so much in liquor, and that he had a seven-shilling piece and half-a-crown, I thought it was money enough, and told him to call to-morrow for the change; I saw no more of them that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. The prisoner was not so drunk as Martin? - A. I have known the prisoner some years; he is very well when solid and sober, but, when drunk, he is like a mad fellow.</p>

               <p>- WATES sworn. - I am an anchor-smith; I was at Donnell's house on Saturday night paying my men; the prisoner tendered a ten-pound note to Donnell for change; he could not, and I gave him two five-pound notes for it; he asked me to take care of one for him, for he should lose or spend it; but his wife took it; he took it from her, and brought me both of them to keep for him, for fear he should spend or lose them; I put them in my pocket book, and have them now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. I have known him eleven years; he has worked under me when I was journeyman to Mr. Perry; I have trusted him with above a thousand pounds of stock around him, and always found him honest; when drunk, he collects the boys together, and exercises them.</p>

               <p>ANTHONY BURTON sworn. - I keep the Ship, at Blackwall; I asked Martin how he came to lose his money; he said, he had treated the prisoner with beef steaks, and they got in liquor together; and he did not know whether he did not give him the notes to take care of for him; when he spoke of the prisoner, he called him mad Anthony; I have known the prisoner twelve or fourteen years; he is a hard-working man, and is considered as an honest man.</p>
