            . I was in the shop that Evening, and when it was almost dark, I went into a Back-room to light a Candle. When I returned, a Gentleman came in, and asked for a Sheet of what we call Double-Penny . I went behind the Counter to serve him, and saw the Prisoner lying down by the side of it, next the Door, with the Till under her Arm. Upon this I called out to my Fellow-Apprentice, and the Prisoner attempted to run away, but he stopped her.</p>

I was sitting by the Fire in a Back-Office belonging to Mr Hughes, where we usually fit to write; and Halton (who was then in the Shop) calling to me, I ran out, and saw the Prisoner crawling towards the Door. Halton had taken the Drawer from her, before I came into the Shop, and she told me a Gentleman had given it to her, to hold for him. <rs id="t17400227-1-verdict4" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Mr Stacey. On the 20th of November I was going towards Temple-Bar, and the Prisoners followed me, and asked me to give them a Quartern of Brandy, or Gin. I did not value such a little Matter, so I followed them into Needham's House, at the <placeName id="t17400227-2-crimeloc8">Rose by Temple-Bar</placeName>

Then they came round me, and began to be sweet upon me, but I said, - stand off, I want nothing with you, nor will I be concerned with you, on any Account. Whitney said, 'tis very hard with us, Sir, and I hope you'll give us something. And a small Matter I did give them; - I believe it was 2 Six-pences, and I paid for what we had had in the House, and was going away. But getting off my Chair, both of them took hold of me by Force of Arms, and held me so, that I could not help myself. I was a little in Liquor, but not much. I knew very well what I did, and I stood upon my Feet for some Time before they got me down; but at last they did get me down, and I cried Murder! Help, for God's Sake! Whitney told me, if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174002270003"/> cried out, she would cut my Throat. They gagged me; and my Mouth was so full of Blood, that I could not speak; and Blood likewise gushed out of my Nose. Then they took from me all my Money; 30 Guineas, and upwards, a Moidore, and a Thirty-six Shilling-Piece. Upon my crying out, Assistance came, and the Door was got open; and then the Landlady of the House and the Drawer came in, and saw me in this Condition. They were both bound over by Colonel

When the Prisoners were taken, we found 25 Guineas in Nash's Bosom, and one in her Hair; and they both cried, and said they had no more, but I lost a great deal more. The Moidore, the Thirty-six Shilling-Piece, and all the rest of the Money was gone. After this, there was a Man in the House pretended to be my Assistant, and to right me; and he said, - You brazen faced Sluts, I'll see you tied up; so we went to see for a Constable, but there was none to be got, and the Man of the House rescu'd the Prisoners away, since which, he is not to be found. The Prisoners were taken some Time afterwards before Colonel De Veil , upon another Account, and he knowing them, I was sent for, and bound over to prosecute them. I never saw the Prisoners, (to my Knowledge) before I took them to Needham's House that Night, - 'twas about 7 or 8 o'Clock. I had nothing to do with them, - I did no Harm with them, only gave them a little Gin; and 'tis no Crime to do that.</p>
               <p>Whitney. Was any Thing found upon me?</p>
               <p>Mr Stacey. No, I believe not; but she was a Party concerned: her Hand was in my Pocket, as well as Nash's. They both attacked me; one of them throtled me, and the other robbed me.</p>
               <p>Whitney. Was not you in Needham's House before I came in?</p>
               <p>Mr Stacey. No; I was not, I followed you in.</p>

             , eating Salt-Fish and Potatoes. I went thither, and as I was cutting a Potatoe, I heard a Man cry, - Lord help me, I am going to be murdered. Speedily he cried out again, - Murder! Murder ! Lord help me! Lord, says I, don't you hear somebody cry out Murder! Phoo, Phoo, says one, 'tis nothing at all. But I took the Candle, and run into one Room, but there was no body there. Then I went to another Room, (a back Room) and found there was a Chair, or something, set against the Door, but I push'd it open, and saw Mr Stacey upon the Ground, the Blood running out of his Nose; and Whitney had her Right-Hand in his Left Pocket, dragging out his Money, and Nash held him down with her Right-Hand on his Throat. I told them they would certainly kill the Man, and ran directly to Mr Bird the Fishmonger, and informed him, that a Man was likely to be kill'd at the Rose. He bid me get a Constable, and accordingly I gave Two-pence to two Boys to get one, but there was none to be found. When I got back again to the Rose, I met Nash coming out of the Door, and opposing her passing by me, she flew upon me, but I struck her down to the Ground with my Hand; then she got up, and made at me again, and Whitney coming up, I defended myself, till Mr Stacey came to my Assistance, and struck at them, and so we took them. From Nash there were 25 Guineas and a half taken; and tho' they were stripped naked to their shifts, we could find no more. Nash call'd for all the Vengeance of God to seize her, if she had any more, but I unpinn'd her Cap, and found another Guinea in her Hair. The Gentleman said, He still miss'd 6 or 7 Guineas, and upon my asking what they had done with them, Whitney said, - You Bitch, I will swear a Robbery against you, for my Hood and Cloak, which she herself had hid by the Fire-side. Nash would have made herself an Evidence that Night, and declared that Whitney gave her all the Money.</p>
               <p>Whitney. Are you sure you saw my Hand in his Pocket?</p>
               <p>Scot. Yes. I saw her Right-Hand in his Left Pocket, and was afraid to assist the Gentleman, tho' I saw her pulling out his Money.</p>
               <p>Nash. Did she see me pull any Money from the Gentleman?</p>
               <p>Scot. No. Whitney took his Money, while Nash held him down by the Throat, till he was perfectly spent. Afterwards I saw Nash pull the Money out of her Bosom, and lay it down on the Table. I never saw the Prosecutor before that Night in my Life.</p>
               <p>Whitney. I was going that Night to see the Entertainment, at the Old House , and thinking it too soon. I went to the Rose-Alehouse at Temple-Bar, and sent for Mrs wood in Sheer-Lane, to go with me. When I went into the House, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174002270004"/> Gentleman was there, and asked me to drink with him. I refus'd at first, but after some little Perswasion, I drank with him; and then he wanted to be rude with me, and he pull'd me about, and tore Hales's Cloak almost off her Back, so I did not care to stay with him, he hall'd us about so. About a Fortnight ago, I was set upon by a Man and three Women, and went to Colonel De Veil for a Warrant against them, and then this Gentleman and the Woman (Scot) was sent for to prosecute me.</p>
               <p>Nash . When we went into the House the Gentleman offered to treat us, and called for a Glass of Wine, and said, If we would drink with him, he would give us what we should require.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stacey . We went into the House all together; I was not there before them, nor had we a Drop of Wine, for they did not sell Wine; - 'tis an Alehouse.</p>

               <p>Magdalen Fleetwood . My Kitchen-Window was broke open, and I lost the Goods mentioned in the Indictment. The Prisoner now will not deny the Fact. I was call'd out of my Bed, about 7 o'Clock the next Morning, by a young Man who lodges in my House; but I rais'd my Servant first, who told me the House had been robb'd and when I got up, I found a Pane of Glass had been taken out of the Casement, by which Means it had been opened, and I found it open. There are no iron Bars in the Window-frame, and when the Pane of Glass was taken out, any one might put their Hand in and unhasp the Casement. When I went to Bed over Night, at 11 o'Clock, I am sure the Casement was shut, and the Shutter, which slides up and down before the Window on the Outside, was up; but I had lost the iron Pin which fasten'd the Shutter at the Bottom, so we used to push it up, and let it rest on a Skewer in the Pin-hole, thinking no one would find the Way into my Kitchen. This Shutter I found down in the Morning, and the Casement open, and a pane of Glass out. It must have been done between my going to Bed at 11 o'Clock, and my rising next Morning at 7; but it was broad Day-light when I got up. I was fretted at the Loss of my Goods; but as I sat at Breakfast, the Watchman, and one Miller, (who belongs to New Prison) came to me, and ask'd me if I had not lost such and such Things? I told them I had; and they bid me come along with them. Accordingly I went with them to the Constable's House, in Brooks-Market, where I found the Prisoner, and all my Goods, after I had told the Constable the Marks of them; and then we all went before a Justice in Kirby-Street, with the Prisoner and the Goods, where he owned every Thing, and said he had taken the Goods out of my House. 'I ask'd him how he could serve me so? and he said he believ'd he was be witch'd.</p>

Ho said, he had only got two or three Plates, and a Pewter Dish. But I found the Bundle very heavy, and hearing the Copper and Pewter rattle, I told him there were more than two or three Plates and a Dish, and I ask'd him from whence he came?

When the Prisoner was before Mr Poulson, he said he let down the Window-Shutter, and took a Pane of Glass out of a Window backwards, and open'd the Casement, and so got into the Kitchen; and he told us he got out again the same Way he got in.

Mr. Brathwaite's Servant having told me he knew where the Man liv'd who brought it to their Shop, I went with him the next Day to the Prisoner's Lodging, and call'd him out to me, and having a Constable ready, we took him, and brought him to my House; where he confess'd he convey'd the Spoon from off the Bar, on the 4th of Feb. in the Evening, and that he carry'd it to Mr Brathwaite , in order to sell it. He was carried to the Counter that Night, and the next Morning my Lord Mayor committed him. This is the Spoon.</p>

Jarvis went up one pair of Stairs as soon as we went in, and I follow'd her. When we were got into the Room, she called for a Quartern of Rasberry; and after we had drank the Rasberry, I call'd to know what I must pay for it? they told me, 6 Pence. I said it was too much, and was not willing to pay 6 Pence for it, but they swearing I should pay 6 Pence, I paid it, and was going away about my Business. Then Jarvis and Humphreys stopp'd me, and Hales coming up Stairs at the same time, they all three insisted on my staying longer, and that I should give them a Shilling a-piece. I told them I had made no such Agreement with them, and that I had only promis'd to give Jarvis a Dram. On my refusing to give them a Shilling a-piece, Jarvis and Humphreys took me round the Body, and flung me upon the Bed; then Hales got upon me, and held me down, and almost throttled me. I turned Jarvis and Humphreys off from me, and at last I got off the Bed from Hales. They were all three upon me at the same time, on the Bed; but when I had disengaged myself from them, and was got off the Bed, they all three came about me again, and swore they would have my Waistcoat, and Hales tore open the Buttons both of my Coat and Waistcoat, and Humpbreys swore, if I made any Resistance, she would rip me open. Then they took from me my Coat, swearing by their Eyes, that it was better than my Waistcoat; they likewise took my Hat, my Stock and a Bath-metal Stock-buckle, and a Pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174002270006"/> Gloves They unbuttoned my Breeches next, and ransack'd all my Pockets, and took five Pence halfpenny from me, which I have not put in the Indictment.

While we were talking to Hales and Humphreys, some other Friends came from the Place where I found Mr. Yates, and they brought a Watchman with them. After they were come in, Hales fell down upon her Knees, and protested that she knew no more of the Affair, than my only having had a Quartern, and paying for it; afterwards they both pretended that I had promis'd them a Shilling each, and that I had left my Coat for one Shilling, and my Hat for another. We then took them both (Hales and Humpbreys) to St. Bride's Watch-house, and had them secur'd.

             had thrown a Coat into our House. I went out to see after her, and found her by St. Bride's Watch-House . I asked her how she dared take the Liberty to leave such Things at my House? Lord, Mr. Gordon, says she, there's no Harm in it, for the Man left it with me for 2 Shillings. I had heard that Dickerson had been robbed of his Coat, so I told her, I cared not who left it with her, nor what it was left for, she must go with me; so I took her to the Barley-Mow in Salisbury-Court, and enquired for the Man who had lost his Coat. The Prosecutor came out to me in his Waistcoat; I asked him if he knew that Woman? He said Yes, and told me he had got the other two in Custody, and now he had them all. I told him, I had got his Coat safe, and took him and Jarvis with me to my House, and when I produced the Coat to the Prosecutor, I asked him if that was his Coat? He told me it was. - (I believe he has got it now upon his Back) - Upon his owning the Coat, I gave it to him, and said, - there's your Coat, and there's the Woman that left it in my House. Then we carried her to the Watch-house, and the Prosecutor charged her in Custody with the other two, whom I knew nothing of. The Coat, which the Prosecutor owned, was the same which Jarvis acknowledged she had thrown into my House.</p>

             . The Prosecutor, I, and others had been in Company together, that Night, at the Barley-Mow in Salisbury-Court: He left us there something after 10, and told us he would go home; but he returned to us again, in Half an Hour, without his Coat and Hat, and said he had been stripped in Hanging-Sword-Court. By the Advice of the rest of the Company, I went with him to the House, to see if we could recover his Things. He shewed me the House, and I knocked at the Door; Hales opened it, and I saw all the 3 Prisoners in the Room; but Jarvis leaped away [thro' a Passage which is wainscotted off] the Minute I got in. The Prosecutor followed me into the House, and Humpbreys pretending to be asleep, I asked Hales if they knew what they had been about? I bid them give the Man his Things again, and said, - You'll get no good by what you have done, for he'll certainly prosecute you. Hales pretended at first, that she knew nothing of them: afterwards she said, he had left his Coat and Hat with them for 3 Shillings. We had not been long in the House, before 3 or 4 Men, whom we left at the Barley-Mow , came after us: I opened the Door and let them in. Then Hales fell down on her Knees, and said if the Man would stay a little while, he should have all his Things again. Accordingly we staid, but she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174002270007"/> being dilatory, we charged a Watchman, (who came with our Friends) with both Her and Humpbreys, and they were sent that Night to the Counter. When we had done this, we agreed to go and have one Pot more at the Barley-Mow , and while we were drinking it, Mr. Gordon came with Jarvis, and asked for the Man who had lost his Coat? The Prosecutor knew her again, and we all went to Mr. Gordon's House, and the Coat being produced, the Prosecutor owned it, and Jarvis acknowledged she had left it there: Upon which she was carried to the Counter with the other two Prisoners.</p>

Upon my telling him I did not know the Sign, he asked me if I was a Stranger thereabouts? I said, Yes: - for I live in Dirty-Lane, in Long-Acre. There were 2 Women came out of Earl's-Court, while he was speaking to me; else I believe he would have put his Design into Execution there: but being prevented, he followed me close to my Shoulders, and asked me, if I would go and drink part of a Pint of Beer with him? I told him I was not such a Person as he took me for; upon which he damn'd me, and put his Hand to the Inside of the Neck of the Cloak which I had then on, and tore it. The String being hard to break, I was almost choak'd, which obliged me to secream out very much: but he never quitted his Hold, till he got it off, and then he put it under his left Arm, and ran away. Mr. Russel a Tallow-Chandler came out, and asked me what was the Matter? I told him, a <rs id="t17400227-6-deflabel36" type="occupation">Soldier</rs>

After the Prisoner had robb'd me, he ran up Earls-Court , and Mr. Russel pursu'd him directly, with Mr. Roberts the Apothecary, and they took him behind a Door. I follow'd Mr. Russel and Mr. Roberts, and was close to the Threshold of the Door, when-they took him. At Colonel De Veil's, he used both him, and the Gentlemen that seized him, in a very vile manner, and swore he would hamstring me, whenever he met me. He own'd the Fact; and Mr. De Veil told him he had a great deal of Impudence: upon which he said, Yes, and he could own the Fact before him, and could deny it when he came before the Judge. - I was put in so much Fear when he robb'd me, that I did not come to myself for several Days afterwards.</p>

I pursued him thro' Earl's-Court, and Red-Lion-Court, into Fountain-Court; at the Corner of which Place Henley told me where the Prisoner ran. There was no one with me at this Time, but a Fellow-Servant of mine, so I did not care to go any farther; but as the Court was not a Thorough-fare, I stood at the Entrance of it, and bid Henley go and call somebody to assist me. He went and brought Mr. Roberts and Mrs. Cockram to me. Then we went into the Court, and seeing a Door stand open, we found the Prisoner concealed behind it, and carry'd him before Colonel De Veil, where he told Mr. Roberts, he wanted a new Perriwig, and now by his being apprehended, there would be Money for him to buy one.

            ) the Prisoner stood at the Door, and asked me to give her something. It was about 8 o'Clock at Night, and I told her I could not stay. She ask'd me to give her a Quartern of Brandy; I comply'd, and went into the House (the Rose) with her; and she took a Candle off the Bar, herself, and carried me into a Room up two pair of Stairs. The Drawer brought up a Quartern of Brandy, and I gave him 6 d. for it; then he retired, and left the Prisoner and me together, and she told me I must give her Half a Crown for obliging me with her Company. I gave her 6 d. but she thinking that too little, I believe I gave her another. I was sober, tho' I can't be sure how much Money I gave her, - I believe 18 d. was the outside. While we were together, I put my Hand in my Pocket, and miss'd my Purse. I charg'd the Prisoner with having pick'd my Pocket; and she said, she had none of my Purse, she would assure me, nor my Money neither. When the Drawer came up, I told him she had robb'd me: He said, he did not understand the Nature of it, - as we came in we must go out, and so the Prisoner went down Stairs with him into the Kitchen. I follow'd, and told the Landlady, that she had pick'd my Pocket: She said - Perhaps you have dropp'd it above Stairs, go up with the Drawer, and look for it, and I'll be bound for the Prisoner's staying here, till you come down. But while I was hunting about the Room for my Money, she let the Prisoner escape; and as I imagined they had it among them, I offered them a Guinea to let me have it again. When I found there was nothing to be done, I went home; and the next Morning I told my Master's Landlord (where we lodged) what had happened; and we went directly to Col. De Veil for a Warrant to take the Prisoner; but not knowing her Name, we came away without one. Afterwards, as I was coming along Covent-Garden, I saw the Prisoner and another Woman with her in the Street, and told our Landlord, that was the Person who robbed me. I crossed the Street in order to pursue her, and a Cart coming by at the same Time, she turned to avoid the Cart, and came directly upon me. Then I caught hold of her, and said, Now, Madam, I have you. Both she and the other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174002270009"/> Woman immediately desired me not to expose her, and I should have my Money again, but as she had squandered some of it away, they hoped I would allow her something hand-some, for herself. Upon this I went with them again to the Rose , and asked her to give me my Money; but there being 3 or 4 Bullies in the Kitchen , one of them, - a Great Fellow, - said the Prisoner was his Wife, and that he would knock me through the Wall; and immediately they sell upon me, 2nd the Man that was with me; but I got out of the House first , and he got from them afterwards. Then I stood at the outside of the-Door, while my Friend went for a Constable; and as I stood at the Door, the Landlord of the House would have fain persuaded me to come in again, and drink with him: I refused, and when they found I would not come in again, one of the Fellows in the House cried, - d - mn you, Madam, come out with me: which she did, and I followed them cross the Hay-Market, and he put her up a pair of Stairs; then he came down to me and said, - there, d - mn you, now get her if you can. People about me said, she could not get out from that Place without being seen, so I got my Land-lord to stand at the bottom of the Stairs, while I went to Mr. Justice Frasier for a Warrant. After which we took her, and carried her before Colonel De Veil, who committed her. She made no Confession at all.</p>

               <p>Neal. I might say so, because I did not care such Company should know what I had about me. I had a Moidore, 5 Guineas, and some odd Silver in my Purse, which was in my Pocket when I came from my Horses, for I had some Beer at that Place, and saw my Money when I paid for it: and when I gave the Prisoner some Silver in the Room, I fumbled in my Pocket, and pulled out a Six-pence or two from the Gold, without pulling out my Purse. While I was with her, I felt her Hand in my Pocket, and bid her keep them above board.</p>

            . On Sunday Evening last, I had been at Church; and as I was going home I met a young Woman in the Street, about 9 at Night, and she asked me to give her a Glass of Wine at the Prisoner Bignell's House. Accordingly I went with her thither, - it is the <placeName id="t17400227-9-crimeloc53">Rose in Oxendon-street</placeName>

We went up one pair of Stairs, and called for Wine, and when the Reckoning was to be paid, I told the Drawer, I wanted Change for half a Guinea. He bid me give him the half Guinea first. I said, I would not trust him with it, but bid him bring me the Silver, and then I would give him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174002270010"/> the half Guinea, Upon this the Landlady came up, and bid me give her the half Guinea, that she might see whether it was good. I then pull'd out my Money and put it into my Hat, telling her if she would tell down 10 s. and 6 d. on the Table, if the half Guinea should not be good, she should have the Guinea, which I had in my Hat. She refused to do this, and while we were disputing, the Prisoner Bignell came up, and asked her why she did not go down Stairs, when she was wanted below? Says she, the Gentleman won't let me have the half Guinea. Bignell immediately thrust his hand into my Hat, and damning me for a Rascal, he snatched away the Guinea, and 2 s. &amp; 6 d. in Silver. My Hat, and the half Guinea fell down upon the Ground. Ford, who was still in the Room, pick'd up the half Guinea, and gave it to his Master Bignell. Upon this I pulled out a Penknife, and clapping my Back against the Door, I swore I would kill or be kill'd, before I would lose my Money: Then Bignell knock'd upon the Floor with his Heel, and cried Murder; immediately three or four Bullies came up, and swore they would knock my Brains out, if I would not get down Stairs, d - mning me, and asking me, what Business I had there? and they took up the long-back'd Chairs to knock my Brains out. I thought best to go down Stairs, and Bignell came down likewise; but being unwilling to lose my Money, I went into the Kitchen, or back Room. There they d - mn'd me again for a Rascal, and bid me get out; so I went out telling Bignell, I would make him suffer for it. He bid me do my worst, telling me his Name was Bignell, and that he lived at the Sign of the Rose. When I came out, I enquired after his Name, and finding he had told it me right, I got a Warrant and apprehended him.</p>

             . I keep the Red Lion Alehouse near the Haymarket. Bignell came last Sunday Night to my House, about 6 o'Clock, and staid in my House to drink Part of 6 Pots of Beer. To the best of my Knowledge, he was never out of the House, (except when he went into the Yard to make Water) till he went home, - and that was at about 11 o'Clock. Oxendon-street is about four Stones-throw, or hardly three, from my House, but he could not go out, for I was never out of his Company all that Time, but when I went to draw a Pot of Beer, or so. - I think I went out twice with two Pots of Beer just cross the Way, but I did not stay above a Minute. - I was not longer in going and coming. - Not two Minutes I am sure. I dress Buttock of Beef on a Sunday, and give a Bit away to my Neighbours. I ask'd him if he would eat any? He said no, but desired me to send a Bit to his Wife, I have known him four Years; and have been out with him this late frosty Weather a shooting, with Money in my Pocket, and never saw or heard any thing ill of him.</p>

I went to Mills's to see for 2 or 3 young Fellows that belong to the Market, for I am a Poulterer's Son, and keep as good a House as any Man in the Parish. - I had as much Victnals drest that Day, as cost me 30 Shillings.

             . About 4 Months ago, the Prisoner and I broke open Mr Lane's Garden Gate, at Hackney, between 11 and 12 at Night, and we both got into the Garden: then he lifted me up on the Top of an Arbour joining to the House, and I got out 2 Pins belonging to the Window-Shutter, and the Shutter fell down: then I try'd to get into the House, but I could not get thro' the Window; upon which the Prisoner bid me come down, and pull my Cloaths off; which I did, and then got in and open'd the Back-door, and then let him in. We took away 2 Quilts, a large Copper, 2 Curtains, 2 Blankets, and 3 Saucepans, which we ty'd up, and carry'd off in 2 Loads (between us) to the Prisoner's House. The Copper we sold to one Birch , a Smith; the other Things we shar'd between us: there were several other Goods taken, which I have not mentioned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lane. I have a House at Hackney, which is lock'd up when we are in Town. The beginning of November the Garden-Door, which we left locked, was broke upon; a Window-Shutter one pair of Stairs, and a Sash-Window, were broke, and the Things mentioned in the Indictment were taken away. The Gardiner, who looks after the House, brought me Word the next Day, that my House had been broke open and-robbed, and these 2 Pictures, which have been in my Family these 100 Years, were sent to me, by the Evidence Lipscomb.</p>
               <p>Lipscomb. I know the Pictures very well: one of them is cracked in the Frame. I took them off the Chimney when we robbed the House. Some of the Goods we sold; and some of them the Prisoner has now got at home. The Copper and the Saucepans we sold together, but the Persons who bought them are run away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lane. The Persons who bought the Goods are gone off.</p>

The Parlour-Window was broke, and 2 Bolts wrenched off, with which (I am sure) the Window was made fast at 10 o'Clock at Night. I found it broke about 7 in the Morning, and the Sash stood up. All the Goods mentioned in the Indictment were taken away, and were my Property, except the 8 Yards of Cloth, which was my Brother's. The Breeches and the Shoes were in the Entry, and all the rest of the Things were in the Parlour. The Tea-kettle I remember to have seen at 10 o'Clock at Night. - It was break of Day when I got up in the Morning, and was light enough to distinguish one Man's Face from another's. I advertised the Goods immediately, and the Monday following one Mr Bowler came and told me, he believ'd his Son had bought the Fender and the Tea-kettle of

I went down to Bowler's, and swore they were mine: then we went to see after Birch in Bluecoat-fields , but not finding him, I was advised to lie still for some Time, But about three Weeks afterwards, we found a Piece of the green Cloth pawn'd at Mrs Dodgings , in Bluecoat-fields : we took her before a Justice, and she informing us, that the Cloth was pawned to her by the Evidence's (Lipscomb's) Wife, we got a Warrant for her, and took her: she was committed to Prison, and the Prisoner was taken as he was carrying Victuals to her in Goal, and this Gun screw, which I swear is mine, was found in his Pocket.</p>

            , and I broke open Mr Crane's House, the 29th or 30th of December, - the Sunday-Night after Christmas Day, - between 12 and 1 o'Clock. We took Wick's Lathing-Hammer, which he carried out in his Apron, and wrenched open a Window-shutter, which had 2 Bolts upon it. 'Twas a Parlour Window next the Street-door, going into the Yard. Then Wicks lifted up the Sash, and took out a Pewter-Plate which stood within his Reach: after which, he lifted me in at the Window, and I handed out a Tea-kettle, a brass Fender, a silver Coral engraved, a large silver Spoon, with a Scallop-Shell upon the Heel of it. A silver Tea-Spoon, 7 pieces of pickled Pork in a Pan, a pair of Stockings, and a China Saucer. These Things I found in the Parlour. The Breeches hung upon the Bannisters of the Stairs, in the Passage, and the Shoes were under the Stairs. Among the things we carried away, there was a Gun-screw, with a bit broke off from the sharp End of it. - This is the same. The Tea-Kettle we let fall, as we were carrying the Goods away upon our Backs, and it being bruised, Birch beat it out upon his Anvil, and then carried out that and the Fender, and sold them for a Crown, as he told us. Mrs Birch pawned the Spoon for a Crown and brought us the Money, and we had Twenty-pence a-piece. The Pork was divided among us; we had 2 Pieces each, and the odd Piece we eat among us. The Cloth was likewise shared, and each of us had a Piece. The Prisoner Love bought the Coral for 8 s. and a Quartern of Brandy. Wicks and I have been acquainted 7 or 8 Years; he worked with the Master to whom I served my Time: and I have known Love about the same Time, he sells a Dram at St Giles's, but I believe he knew nothing of my Life and Conversation. I was speaking to my Sister about the Coral, and she told me Mr Love would buy it of me. Accordingly I offere it to him; he asked me if it was safe? and I told him yes, and that I did not care to offer it to a Silversmith for fear he should doubt me. All the Money we sold the Goods for, was divided etween Wicks,

               <p>Lipscomb. My Sister shewed him the Coral, but she told him 'twas mine, and I was in the Room at the same Time. 'Twas in a Room he calls his Kitchen, and he was a-bed when it was offered him. He ordered me a dram of Gin, and asked me what I would have for it? I asked 12 s. for it, then I came down to 10 s. 6 d. and at last to 8 s. which he consented to give me, and a Quartern of Brandy. I had not seen Love for 5 or 6 Years before my Sister carried me to him with the Coral. As to Wicks he wanted to be made an Evidence, and went with that intent before Mr Justice Priestly, but the Justice would not admit him.</p>

            . My Husband is ill, and cannot come out. All I know of the Matter is, that about 5 Weeks ago, I lock'd my Door with a Padlock and went up Stairs to pass my Time with a Lodger above Stairs, because my Husband was then abroad. I came down again in half an Hour, and found the Door broke open, and the Padlock taken off; and I missed several things, - a Damask Gown, which cost me 50 s. a black quilted Coat, and other things, which all belonged to me. When I fastened the Door and went up Stairs, it was not Daylight, not yet Candlelight, as one may say, for it was between 6 and 7 o'Clock. I believe I could have distinguished a Man's Face, if I had seen it. - I never was in such a Broil as this in my Life before. <rs id="t17400227-15-verdict91" type="verdictDescription">

I know this Note; it is a Bill for 5 Quarter Barrels of Beer, and the Receipt at the Bottom of it is for 12 s. and 6 d. which the Beer comes to. I paid the Money to him for the Use of Mr. Little in full of all Demands. About a Fortnight before this Receipt was given me, Mr. Little's Clerk brought me a Bill for Beer which I knew nothing of; I told the Prisoner of it the next time he came, and he told me it was a Mistake, and that the Bill was intended for one Allen who lives at Westminster. However, to prevent Mistakes, I told him I would have a Receipt from his Matter, in full of all Demands, the next Money I paid him. Accordingly he brought me this Receipt, and said it came from his Master. I afterwards observed the Receipt was not dated, and in about three Days time the Prisoner coming again, I asked why it was not dated? He told me his Master did not use to make such Mistakes, so he took a Pen and put a Date to it, telling me he believ'd he could not write so well as his Master. He told me the Receipt was signed by Mr. Little, and I had never seen Mr. Little's Hand-writing in my Life, as I know of, so I took it as a Receipt from his Master, who had given me Orders to pay the Prisoner, and had told me he was an honest Man: So I used to pay him, and take his Receipts for the Money, for the Use of Mr. Little. I have six other Receipts which the Prisoner has given me at different Times, and Mr. Little never saw any of them, till I demanded this Receipt in full from him. The Bill was read.</p>

He told me he did not owe so much Money, for he had paid the Drayman every fourth Barrel, and he shew'd me some of his Receipts. I said I would speak to the Drayman about it. I did so; and the Prisoner then told me, he had seen Mr. Allen, and he (Allen) was now satisfy'd that my Bill was right, and he would pay me whenever I went that Way. The whole Account of Mr. Allen, as charged in our Ledger, and in the Runner at Home, is 1 l. 17 s. 6 d. 27 Shillings of which is still due, by our Books, from Mr. Allen: for we have receiv'd no more than 10 s. since he dealt with us. This Receipt, now in question, is none of Mr. Little's Writing, nor any Part of the Note; nor is this 12 s. and 6 d. discharged in our Books, and the House-Clerk always enters the Money that is receiv'd.

On the 18th of January, as I was coming from my Bed, to come down into the Bakehouse, my Apprentice called, and told me he fear'd the House was broke open. I immediately went up a Ladder into the Kitchen, to the Place where my Money lay, and saw the Corner Cupboard broke open, and the Money gone. There was 18 l. 17 s. in it, but it was all taken away. One Piece was a Moidore, the rest were Guineas, half Guineas, and Silver, and among the Gold were 6 half Guineas. I went down immediately to the Boy in the Bakehouse, and told him I had lost my Money; and seeing a Faggot mov'd, and set in the Place where the Prisoner used to set them when he lived with me, I suspected him to have done it. When I came to look farther, I saw a Hole broke in the Wall in the Bakehouse, big enough for a Man to creep through. There is a Pair of flat Doors which lean against the House, and under these Doors there is Brickwork of 18 Inches or 2 Feet high: the Frame of the Doors is laid upon this Brick-work, and these Doors open into the Bakehouse. The Hole was made through this Brick-work; therefore I thought it must be somebody that knew the House as well as I; and I told my Boy, that I believ'd it was the Prisoner who had done it; and upon making Enquiry in the Country after him, a Countryman of his told me, he saw him the very Day before I was robb'd in a very mean Capacity, and that the Shoes on his Feet were not worth 3 Pence. After this I had a Messenger came from Watford to tell me, he was seen there the Monday following, with a great deal of Gold and Silver in his Pockets, by

One principal Reason of my suspecting the Prisoner, was the placing the Faggots: for they lay upon the Stairs at Night when I went to Bed: but when I got up they were moved, and set against the Wall, on the Right-hand of the Stairs, where the Prisoner always placed them, when he lived with me: besides, he had been lurking about the Country, and never had been in any Business, since he left my Service. I am sure the Faggots were moved, and that the Hole in the Wall was not there when I went to Bed, over Night at 9 or 10 o'Clock. I got up the next Morning between 5 and 6; 'twas the 17th of January, and I believe it was not Day-light when I 'rose: but I can't be particular, whether it was Day-light, or Moon-light: 5 o'Clock is our usual Time of rising, and I believe it was about that Time. The Boy lies in the Bakehouse, and called to me before I came down Stairs, to tell me he was afraid the House was broke: and I saw the Hole the Minute I came down Stairs.

I lie in the Bakehouse, and remember I saw Light come thro' the Hole; I thought it was Daylight, for I saw a Woman (thro' the Hole) lighting her Fire on the other side of the Way. I think it was quite Light.</p>
               <p>Jury. Can you tell what Month it was, when this was done?</p>
               <p>Clark. No; but I believe it was 5 or 6 Weeks ago: and I believe it was between 5 and 6 in the Morning when I saw the Hole, so I was 'frighted, and lay till I heard my Master come down; then I told him I was afraid he had been robbed. 'Twas about 6 o'Clock when he came down. He uses to get up between 6 and 7, that is his usual Time. When I told him the House was broke, he ran up into the Kitchen, and returned and told me he had lost 18 l. 17 s. and looked at the hole in the Wall. I am sure it was not there when we went to Bed. I heard a Noise twice in the Night, but I was not thoroughly awake, nor did I imagine any body was in the House, nor did I see the Hole at either of those Times when I heard the Noise. The first of my seeing the Hole was when the Light came in from the Woman's Fire in an opposite House. When the Prisoner was taken up, he said, he had a Bank-Note from his Father for 15 Guineas, and he had changed the Note at a Banker's, but he would not tell the Banker's Name, he said he would take another Opportunity for that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mention one Time when you saw me loosening the Bricks.</p>
               <p>Clark. I can't say what Day, or Month it was, but I have seen him doing it several Times.</p>
               <p>Jury. What did he loosen the Bricks with?</p>
               <p>Clark . With nothing but his Hand; and I observed they were loosened by his pushing them. I did not tell my Master of this, for he saw him as well as I.</p>

            . I keep a Shoemaker's Shop, at Pinner, two Miles from Harrow. One Thursday in January, (but I can't tell the Day of the Month, to the best of my Knowledge, 'twas the 17th) the Prisoner came to my Shop, and asked for his Countryman, who had lived with me. I told him, he had been gone from me 3 Weeks before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That's the Man that told Mr Vincent, I was in such a mean Condition.</p>
               <p>Howard . He was then in the same Cloaths, that he's in now; only he had Boots on then; and when he was before the Justice he was in his Shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Time did I leave you at Pinner?</p>
               <p>Howard. Between 11 and 12 at Noon: He staid with me about half an Hour, and whither he went, when he left me, I know not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Discourse passed between us?</p>
               <p>Howard. That which I have mentioned. He likewise asked me when I saw Nan Wood, because (said he) I was to have been married to her last Monday, and instead of that, I came to London, and left her waiting at Watford , to be married.</p>

            . I was drinking with the Prisoner at Haddington , about 5 or 6 Weeks ago, and he pulled out some Gold, and offered to lend me a Guinea. I thanked him for his Love, and told him, I did not chuse his Money. Then he pulled out some Silver, and offer'd me a Crown, a Half-crown, or a Shilling. I thanked him, and refused his Silver likewise. To the best of my Knowledge, he had about 8 or 10 Guineas in a Paper, and about 30 Shillings in Silver. He wanted me to come to London with him, but I told him my Money proved short, and I would go Home.</p>

He lodged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174002270017"/> with me a Night or two at the Coach and Running Horses in David-street. Then I missed him 1 or 2 Nights (I can't tell which) out of my Company. I can't tell what Nights they were, but when he returned, I saw a pretty deal of Money, 9 or 10 Guineas, and a Watch in his Pocket, and he had none when he left me, for I had paid 16 d. for him. He told me he had the Money from a Friend in Town; and the Watch he said he had had these 7 Years; but I never saw it before. I believe it was the 17th or 18th of Jan. when I miss'd him, but I cannot be sure.</p>

            . I thought the Prisoner had been an honest Man: He has borrow'd Money of me several times; he has had different Sums of me, from 10 s. to 20 s. never so much as 14 or 16 l. nor any at all in Jan. last.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was to have been married to her; but I came to Town with some young Fellows, instead of going to be married. She knows I went to my Father's in the Country, and brought up Money to be marry'd to her.</p>
               <p>Wood. He went down into Northamptonshire about Michaelmas, and came up again after Christmas, with some Money; but I know not how much. The Sums I lent him, were some before he went to see his Father, and some after, but none in January.</p>

On Thursday the 24th of Jan. between 8 and 9 in the Evening, as I was coming down Sheer-lane, I saw a young Woman very genteelly dress'd, and I stopp'd to look at her. Some Conversation pass'd between us, and I asked her to drink a Glass of Wine. She seemed a modest Woman, and said, No, she did not care for drinking, - she must go home. While we were talking together up came the Prisoner, and said she was going home, and if I pleased, I might go home with them. So we all went together to the Prisoner's House in <placeName id="t17400227-19-crimeloc117">Green's Rents</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17400227-19-crimeloc117" type="placeName" value="Green's Rents"/>

There was no Wine in the House, but she told us we might have a Tiff of Punch, but nothin g less than a 2 Shilling Tiff, and I paid for one Bowl before ever I tasted it. After this we had 5 or 6 more, and when it was between 12 and 1 o'Clock, I called for the Reckoning. The Prisoner told me she was a poor Widow-woman, and it would be Charity to assist her. I told her, it was late, and I did not care to go home, and as the Reckoning came to 12 s. if she would let me have a Bed, and a clean Pair of Sheets, there was a Guinea for her; but, says I, if I want another Bowl, you will not stand with me for that. She was thankful, and told me she would not. Between 2 and 3 I went to Bed, and I am sure I had my Watch and Snuff-box then, for I took several Pinches of Snuff, and never went out of the Room, but into the Bedchamber, which was on the same Floor. I believe it was between 1 and 2 when I went to Bed, - near 2. Between 3 and 4 I waked, and wanting a Pinch, I felt for my Coat, and searched my Pockets, but my Box was gone. This alarm'd me, and made me turn about and put my Hand under my Pillow to feel for my Breeches, and I found my Watch gone. Then I felt in my Side-pocket, where I had crammed down my Purse with my Money, and feeling the Strings of it, I imagin'd my Money was safe, but I afterwards found that was gone too. I told the young Woman, that her Landlady had robb'd me. I can't imagine (said she) how the Woman could serve you so, - I always took her to be honest. Upon this I knock'd with my Shoe upon the Floor, and a little Child came up and told me her Mother was gone out of Town. Why, says I, she was here an Hour or two ago, is she gone already? Yes, says the Child, she is gone into the Country. I was in a good deal of Confusion and laid me down again, thinking I would stay till Daylight. About an Hour afterwards, I thought I heard somebody come in,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174002270018"/> so I call'd again, and the Child came and told me her Mother was gone. I questioned the young Woman about it; but she cry'd, and said she never knew her guilty of such a Thing before. In the Morning I went away, and the Prisoner absconded: she never came to the House, except it was at Midnight; for I set a Porter, who lived at next Door, to watch for her, and got a Warrant from Sir

             to apprehend her, if I could light of her; but hearing nothing of her, I advertised the Things, and about a Fortnight afterwards, I had 2 Letters sent me to Will's Coffee-House , and upon the Receipt of them, I went down to the Fleet, and saw the Prisoner coming to her Husband in the Prison, but she ran away as soon as she saw me. I knew her again, and by the Direction of one in the Prison, I took her next Morning at the Queen's-Head Alehouse , in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Was the Door of the Room you lay in lock'd, when you went to Bed?</p>
               <p>W - . No. - When I took the Prisoner, she cry'd and wrung her Hands, and said, - You're a good-natur'd Man, - you'll not prosecute me if you have your Things again, and I have 5 Beds which I will sell, but you shall have Satisfaction. This was at the Justice's Clerk's House.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I make the first Tiff of Punch for you?</p>
               <p>W - . You brought it up, - I don't know who made it. I own I had drank freely, and was a little elevated; - I can't say I was drunk. I am certain I had the Things in my Pockets when I went to Bed.</p>
               <p>Mr Murden. I am a Prisoner in the Fleet. The Prisoner's Husband was a School-Fellow of mine; and he coming into the Fleet short of Money, I took him into my Room from Saturday to Tuesday. In that Interim the Prisoner often came to him, and I found he had got a Gold Watch in his Pocket. I knew he never was capable of wearing such a Thing, so I ask'd him how he came by it? Phoo, says the Prisoner, I mason'd a Cull, and the Fellow has advertised it; but the Scoundrel was drunk, and did not know how much Money he lost. He advertised but 7 Guineas, and the Scoundrel lost more. She said the Scoundrel was drunk, and she mason'd him, and stole the Watch and his Snuff-box out of his Pocket. As soon as I heard this, I bid them get out of my Room; telling them I would harbour no Thieves; and I went down to the Turn-key, and desired him to send for a Constable to secure them, telling him I had Thieves in my Room, and I had discovered Villany; but there was none came, because Constables are afraid of being ill used in the Fleet. When I went up again into my Room, the Prisoner's Husband (who wore the Watch in his Pocket 2 Days) fell down on his Knees, and begged I would not turn them out of my Room, nor expose them: But I insisted on their being gone, and turned them out by Force. Both the Prisoner and her Husband told me the very Day when the Watch was first advertised, - the 6th of February. Upon the Discovery of this Villany, I went down to the Coffee-House in the Fleet-Prison, and found the things advertised on the 6th of February, and that they were lost at a Pretended Attorney's House; so I wrote a Letter to be left at the Coffee-House mentioned in the Advertisement, and the next Day the Prosecutor came to the Coffee-House in the Fleet, and the Prisoner was taken up. The Day I discovered the Villany, she came to her Husband and said, I met the Scoundrel in Carey-street , by Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, with his Horse in his Hand; and she described him and his Cloaths so well, that the Minute he came into the Coffee-House, I knew him and went up to the Table where he sat, and asked him if he had not lost a gold Watch?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr Murden what I pawned on Saturday?</p>
               <p>Murden. She came to her Husband, and said she had no Money; and she went out. When she returned, she said she had pawned a Ring off her Finger.</p>
               <p>Mr Richardson. There was a Gold Watch offered to be pawn'd at our House, (I think) by the Prisoner, but I can't be positive: I had seen her before, but I would not take it in, unless she could convince me she had a Property in it. She told me it belonged to a Gentleman of Ludgate, and upon my refusing it, she took it away again.</p>

Accordingly I agreed to it: but when that was out, I found myself in such a prodigious Disorder that I could not get up, nor go; but the Gentlewoman at the Bar kept me from falling, by sitting in my Lap. I found she began to be busy with my Pockets, so I covered them, with the Flaps of my Coat. As soon as I came to myself, I went Home to put my Money up; I had 8 l. 12 s. in one Pocket: 2 l. in Silver, in another; and some more Silver in another. I had three Pockets with Money in them; - but 'twas all gone, and I had no more than Eighteen-pence left in all my Pockets. As to the Liquor I drank, had it been honestly brewed, I could have drank it all up myself and have been sober, but I believe there was Opium, or something put into it, which disordered me for about 15 Minutes, and during that Time I felt the Gentlewoman's Hand in my Pocket. There was 3 of them in all, but no Utensils or Household-Goods in the House.</p>

            . I saw the Prisoner put her Hand into Mr Kent's Pocket, and pull out a handful of Money, - half Crowns and Shillings: but as for Gold, I saw none. This was taken out of his right Side-Pocket; 'twas done in the Kitchen, upon the Ground-Floor, and she was sitting upon his Knee, at the same Time. Furthermore, I made the Hot-pots; and the Prisoner grated something into them, which got into my Head, I believe it was Opium, for I had like to have fallen off my Chair myself. I saw her hold the Gentleman's Money in her Hand, but he and I were so disordered, that we took no notice of it. I am Landlady of the House, and one of my Lodgers brought the Prisoner in, for 2 or 3 Nights unknown to me. I am sure I saw her pull out the Money, and put it into her Pocket, and moreover, she paid me 9 s. in part of the Reckoning. She gave it me for the Hot-pots; I did not take notice of above 2 or 3 Hot-pots, and the Price of a Hot-pot is but a Shilling, and moreover she gave me 6 s. and 6 d. besides, what it was for, I can't tell; the first and second Hot-pot, was enough to turn my Head: whether the Reckoning came to 9 s. or not, I can't tell. There was more than 2, or 3, or 4 Hotpots, but the first two turned my Head so, that I can't tell where she put the Money when she had taken it; but she took it openly and held it in her Hand, but whether she put it in her Bosom or Pocket, I know not, and to be sure she took it in a clandestine Manner, for I believe the Gentleman did not know it. <rs id="t17400227-21-verdict127" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Alexander Grey . On the 14th of January, I came from Blackwall , and about 10 o'Clock at Night, I was coming up the Minories, and asked Robinson the Way to Aldgate. She asked me if I was not a Yorkshire Man , I told her yes, and that I came from Scarborough . She said, she came from Whitby , and after some Talk, she asked me to make her drink. I let her know I had no more than 5 d. in my Pocket , but I would give her a Pint of Beer, and accordingly we went in at Mr Goodchild's , and while we were drinking , Hill came in. I was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174002270020"/> above 10 Minutes in their Company, but in that Time Robinson picked the Watch out of my Pocket, either at the Door, or in the House, and then they both went off directly. On Thursday the 17th, (between Eleven and Twelve at Noon ) I found the two Prisoners a-bed in their Lodgings, according to the Directions they gave me while I was drinking with them. They deny'd the Fact, and I could not get a Constable, nor a Warrant for them, till the Monday following, and then their Landlady, an Irish Woman, told me they were gone over the Water. But in a Week's Time (the Monday following) I got a Constable and took them, and they were a-bed together then likewise. Robinson got out of Bed, and hit me a good Slap in the Face, and ask'd me whether I had the Impudence to charge her with taking my Watch? But when we got them to the Door, she told me if I would give her something to drink, she would let me have it again. So I went in and treated them with a Bottle of Wine mull'd; and then she told me her Landlady had pawned it for a Guinea to the Man I bought it of; tho' when I went to enquire after it, I found it had been pawn'd for 30 s. When they were before Justice Dennet, they confess'd every Thing, and the Justice said he would be here, and bring their Confession. The Man they pawn'd the Watch to is here: he has got it; but I know it again, there's E D in the inside Case, and was made by Freeman. This is the Watch; and Hill confess'd she had part of the Money it was pawn'd for.</p>
               <p>Robinson. He gave me the Watch to raise Money, because he had none, and Hill carry'd it to pawn. When she returned, he gave us half a Guinea a-piece.</p>
               <p>Gray. Upon my Oath I did not, I did not give it them to raise Money. I was told this would be the Story when I came here. I am positive Robinson was the Woman that took it, for the other was never near me. While we were drinking in the House, I pulled it out to see what o'Clock it was, after which I did not stay a Minute, but went to the Door and missed it immediately.
