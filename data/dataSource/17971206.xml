             Foy, the captain, he immediately ordered all hand to be called on deck, to be mustered, to give an opportunity of seeing the person; in a few minutes, before half the people could get on deck, Mr. Franklyn came on the quarter-deck, and North, the waiter, exclaimed, that is him; whether Mr. Franklyn heard the exclamation or not I do not know, but he immediately went down below; Sir Francis then called to the master at arms to go and secure Mr. Franklyn, I also followed below; the master at arms went one way, and I went the other, and he got to Mr. Franklyn first; I then asked Mr. Franklyn which was his birth, which he very readily pointed out to me; I then asked him which were his trunks or boxes, he also readily pointed them out to me; I then asked him for the keys of the boxes, and he gave them me out of his jacket pocket; I think then, before I opened either of the boxes, I asked him if he had got any Bank-notes; he replied, none but what I should find in the trunk; I opened the trunk, and in searching, I found a purse containing small Bank-notes to the amount of one or two and twenty pounds, and some gold, the gold I returned to him, and kept the notes at that present time; I asked him afterwards what he had done with the five hundred pounds worth of Bank-notes that he had brought from London; he hesitated a little, and at length replied, that he had no other; I had some further conversation with him which I do not immediately recollect; I told him he must go on shore with us, that I must take him to town; he then sat down on his trunk to dress himself for that purpose; I again asked him if he had not got some more Banknotes; he then says, yes, I have, and I will tell you where they are; but before he could tell me, Rivett came with the parcel in his hand, and said, I have found them; that parcel contained Banknotes, they are here, they amounted to four hundred and fifty pounds; we, as soon as we conveniently could, brought him on shore, and took him to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Four hundred and fifty pounds was the whole that Rivett found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had asked him before what he had done with the five hundred pounds worth of notes? - A. yes; I took the notes I found in the trunk to the Bank, and had them examined, they were good; I have since returned them to a friend of the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any examination of him taken in writing? - A. I believe not.</p>

             sworn. - I was in company with Mr. Lavender, on board the Hydra frigate; Mr. Lavender stated to the captain the circumstance of our coming there, and in consequence of that, he ordered the boatswain to pipe all hands; the prisoner at the bar came upon deck, and immediately returned below again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to go below again? - A. I do not know; the captain desired the master at arms to secure him, and I went below and searched the prisoner's trunks, but there was nothing particular found; in the place where I supposed his bed would be, in searching a locker, in the prisoner's birth, a little place like a cupboard -</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked? - A. NO, it was not; it had a place to sit down upon it, and behind some old biscuit bags that were in the locker, I found a pocket handkerchief rolled up, and in that handkerchief there were some Bank-notes, they amounted, I think, to four hundred and fifty pounds; I immediately called Mr. Lavender into the birth, and told him I had found these notes; I kept them till we got to town, and then I gave them to Mr. Lavender; I marked them all before I delivered them to Mr. Lavender.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the apparent value of them? - A. The lowest, I believe, is fifteen pounds, and the highest one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had found these notes, where did you go? - A. I told the prisoner I had found these notes in the place that I supposed was his birth; he made little or no answer at first; sometime after, he said, he had received them from a man who had robbed him, and we then brought him up to town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe, in point of fact, you understood the prisoner had not been on board the Hydra till within a day or two? - A. Something of that kind.</p>

               <p>Q. You said properly, you supposed it to be his birth? - A. I could not know it myself, and the prisoner did not chuse to tell me; he said he had no birth, or something of that sort; I have no birth; where is your bed, or your cot, says I; he told me it was upon deck; I then went to the first lieutenant, and asked him, and he shewed me the birth.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was his cot upon deck? - A. Yes, it was; as I understood it was not in the birth, I asked him where his birth was, and his bed; says he, my bed is upon deck; says I, where is your birth? I have no birth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Then he referred you to the cot which was upon deck? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said he had no birth, did he not add, that he had no birth particular to himself, that other persons occupied the same birth as well as he? - A.Certainly, I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he added nothing more than that he had no birth? - A. I do not recollect that a word passed more than that he had no birth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know, that the birth that you afterwards found this locker in, belonged to five other persons? - A. I understood there were some other young men that messed with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now, that he had only come a day or two before - A. I understood so on board the ship.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I was waiter at the George-Inn, at Rochester, in October last.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the young man at the bar? - A. I recollect the prisoner very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the arrival of Lavender and Rivett at your house? - A. Yes; I think it was on the 5th.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with them on board the Hydra frigate? - A. I did; I saw the prisoner there; it was intimated that I knew the man, I knew him the moment I saw him, I said, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q.Then what became of him after? - A. He went down below immediately, upon that I staid upon deck.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him before, in what place had you seen him, so as to know that he was the person? - A. At the George, at Rochester, on Wednesday the 27th of September, to the best of my knowledge; he came to our house in the evening, he enquired of me for a place in the mail-coach to London, that very evening; he had a sailor with him at the time; he ordered supper, a roast fowl and some other things; he eat his supper, drank two bottles of Lisbon, and then a bowl of punch; he then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060006"/>came out into the kitchen, and said, he had got some notes in his pocket, and a pocket-book that he had had the misfortune to drop into the sea coming from abroad, the leaves of the pocket-book were edged with green, which had stained these Bank-notes; he asked me if I could give him cash for a note or two; I told him that I could not; he asked me, if my employer could do it, I told him, I would enquire, and then I told him that he could not; he afterwards paid me for his supper in cash, and he had in bulk, as near as I can imagine, thirty guineas in cash.</p>
               <p>Q. That was, he had asked you, if you could exchange him a note? - A. Yes; he afterwards came to the bar, and asked it as a favour to give change for a note; I told him he did not want cash, for he had got plenty of cash; I told him, that when he took the place in the mail-coach, probably the book-keeper might give him change for it; he afterwards appeared much disguised in I quor, and about half-past eleven o'clock he desired to go to bed; I told him it was of no use to go to bed, for the mail-coach would be in about half after twelve, and he would have very little time, if he meant to go with the mail-coach; he said. he would go when the mail-coach came in; the chamber-maid went to call him, he slept in a double bedded room, when the chamber-maid went up, he had his coat off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you happen to see any thing of him afterwards? - A. He did not go by the mail; I was desired to call him at six o'clock, I called him about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person in that room when you called him? - A. No; he ordered coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come down out of his room when the coffee was ordered? - A. Yes; the coach came to the door, and I put the things in; there was a bundle tied up in a white handkerchief, a brace of pistols, and a hank whip; when I had put them in the coach, he came running back, exclaiming, that we was robbed; I asked him what he was robbed of; he told me, that he was robbed in cash and notes, to near the amount of forty pounds; I said, possibly, as you were very much in liquor, you might have shook it out of your pocket; and he desired I would take the things out of the coach, for he would not go on; then the things were taken out, and put into the room again; I begged of him to go up stairs with me, and to shake the bedclothes, I called the chamber-maid up with us, and we shook the clothes, and took the bed off the bedstead, but could not find any thing; he said, he would advertise, and a suspicion fell upon two men that had slept in that room the night before; he staid till near two o'clock in the afternoon; some time after he made himself very easy, he said, it would not ruin him, and he should make himself easy till he got to London; when Mr. Lavender and the other officer came, I went with them on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. All this part of the conversation, about the notes, was after they had drank two bottles of Lisbon, and a bowl of punch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what propostion of the liquor they had had? - A.After the second bottle was in; and, I believe, three parts of it was by that time drank.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the punch in too? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>GARNETT TERRY sworn? - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are all engraver, employed by the Bank of England? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that parcel of Bank-notes, are they, in your opinion, printed at the Bank of England? - A. NO, they were not; these are forged prints; here is not one of them that was printed at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been engraver to the Bank? - A. About two years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that ten pound note? - A. This is a forged note; I have no doubt but they are all of one manufactory.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You seem to have some difficulty; you took some time to look at them? - A. You saw the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Having take some time to consider whether they were good notes or not, they might quite as easy come into a sailor's possession without his knowing them to be forged? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, in attending to the evidence. you see that both marriages are proved, therefore he must be convicted; at the same time, I have seen enough in this case to convince me that it is not one of those cases in which severe punishment ought to be inflicted; you will therefore find him guilty, and leave the punishment to the Court.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Goddard; I was informed, by a farmer's man, that my horse was gone, and I went and looked at the gate; the gate was broke open with a stake, the stake lay just by the gate, and then I went off to London in search of him; bills were printed, and he was advertised; in consequence of a letter sent to me, I went after him; I stopped at Rygate, and had some information there; in consequence of which, I went to a place called Blythe, there I had further information, and went to a place called Bofield, and we went from place to place, till we came to a place where there had been a fair about six days before, and there I heard that the prisoner had parted with the horse, and we traced him to a place called Bentley-green, and from thence to Tunbridge-wells, and then to Trowbury-gate,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060010"/>near Cuckfield, in Sussex, and we got nearer to him then.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of all the information you received, did you at last come up with him? - A. Yes, at Trowbury-gate, there he had pitched his tent; Mr. Homewood, who was with me, asked him what he had done with his grey horse, and he said, he had parted with him; I then got off my horse, and took him by the collar, and told him, he must go with me; he asked me for what? upon very strong suspicion of horse-stealing, says I.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him from whom? - A. No, I did not; he asked me where my warrant was, I told him I had none; he rather scrupled going, and I told him he should go; I went to the public-house, and got some ropes to tie his hands; I went with him to one Mrs. Burt's, and sat up with him all night; I heard him talking to himself, he said, Goddard, Goddard, he appeared to be dreaming, that he had sold horses for Goddard about forty years ago.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. By a fair blow, or did he shove you down? - A. A fair blow; he struck me somewhere about the breast; then I caught him again, and knocked him down; he had then got into Thames-street, there I got assistance and secured him; he had left the bladder behind him, it was fixed to the cask; I went after the bladder, and there were seven pints in it; it was then in the custody of Mr. Gower.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bladder that you saw when you came back, like that which you first saw in the prisoner's hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it fixed to the cask? - A. There was a plug put into the cask, and a quill fixed in the neck of the bladder, and put in where the plug was, and then there was another hole made at the top of the cask for vent.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This was a passage leading into George-yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is pretty dark there? - A. It is very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner before that day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were a little alarmed, were not you? - A. No; I have gone through there five hundred times, and never was alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not this passage so narrow that it is impossible for two or three men to pass without rubbing one against the other? - A. Yes; that is the reason why I discovered my pocket-book was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that man had his hands in your pocket? - A. I have sworn it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you lay hold of his hand then? - A. I would if I could, but he was too quick for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched afterwards? - A. Yes; before the Lord-Mayor, at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet, though you knew the other man had the pocket-book, you suffered him to go away? - A. The pocket-book was brought to me.</p>
               <p>Q. And you charged the man that brought you the pocket-b with being the man that took it? - A. No, I not; it was brought to me at the Jamaica coffee-house; there were a great many conjectures about it, how I should come by it again so suddenly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a wet or a dry day? - A. It was a very dirty day.</p>
               <p>Q. Your pocket-book was quite in the same state in which you lost it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Do you know upon what occasion she was sent for, or what she came about? - A. No; I do not know any thing about it; she came and knocked at the door, and asked for Mrs. Benson.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the prisoner go by the name of Benson? - A. Yes. I told her she was at home, she went up stairs; Mrs. Benson came down to me in a few minutes after, and said to me, Mrs. Munday, will you do me a favor, to get me half a pint of brandy, and change for a guinea, which I did; when I came back, I opened the door, and let myself in with the key; I came to the foot of the stairs and called, Mrs. Benson, here is the stuff; Mrs. Benson said, I am not ready for you yet, I will call when I want you.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you next observe? - A. I heard a great groaning, and a rattling in the throat, and a scuffling in the room; I went and called my opposite neighbour, of the name of Macdonald; she came back with me, and I called out to know what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the noise continue when you returned? - A. No; the groaning had then ceased.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been absent? - A. As near as I can recollect, about ten minutes; Mrs. Macdonald staid in the house while I went to call Miss Eyles, and she followed me immediately as fast as she could come; we all three went up together, and I insisted upon knowing what was the matter; Mrs. Benson said, nothing at all was the matter, the woman was only in a sit; I still insisted upon knowing what was the matter again, and I would go for a doctor; she said, there was nothing the matter, she was recovering, she was rubbing her by the fire.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the door shut, so as to prevent you from making your own observations? - A. The door was shut, it was locked; but afterwards, in about five or ten minutes, she opened the door a little way, so that I could see only a small part of her face, and the skirt of her gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it open sufficient for you to gain admittance? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner's face and skirt that you saw, or the deceased's? - A. The prisoner's; when she opened the door, she said, you may come in, Mrs. Munday, but nobody else; I was terrified, and flurried, and did not go into the room; I then went out for a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who mentioned your going out for a doctor? - A. Miss Eyles; I then went for a doctor, and left Miss Eyles and Mrs. Macdonald up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you procure a surgeon? - A. He was not at home, he followed me soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the doctor's name? - A. Pearce; when I returned to the house, I saw Mrs. Benson walking about the passage, holding of her singer in my passage, just by my room door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make use of any expression? - A. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else come with the surgeon? - A. Yes, the beadles of the parish, Dunbar and Grey; they came all together, as near as I can tell; I saw the deceased standing in my kitchen, with her head supported by her hand on the table.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did she make use of any expression? - A. When I went in, I asked her if she could speak, or make any motion, when she shook her head, her throat was cut on the right side.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. She did not speak? - A. No; she made a motion with her hand, across her throat, and pointed up stairs, I saw no more; a surgeon came in, a coach was called, and she was taken to the Hospital; Mrs. Macdonald's daughter came in just before she was taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. There were a great many people, I take it for granted, flocking to the house? - A. The whole neighbourhood surrounded my door.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the same instant, when you entered, other people got in to see what passed as well as yourself? - A. There was Mrs. Macdonald, and her daughter, and my relation Miss Eyles, nobody else to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You were extremely flurried from the moment you went out, till the time you came in again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.You yourself did not attempt to put any further question to the poor creature in that situation, than asking whether she could speak, and she making that motion, you declined asking any further questions? - A. Yes; I then went into my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Leaving the surgeon and the other people in the kitchen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mrs. Cox was in the habit of visiting Mrs. Phipoe before? - A. She often came to my house, once a week, or once a fortnight, and sometimes twice a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear her speak of Mrs. Phipoe's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060014"/>kindness to her? - A. I knew nothing more of her than letting her in.</p>
               <p>Q. You never perceived any thing like ill-wi between these two persons? - A. I never heard a word of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day that she called, Mrs. Phipoe had not sent for her, by your knowledge, at all? - A Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. She staid some time, and you did not hear any anger? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out, you did not take up many minutes before you returned? - A. Near about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your return, you heard something that appeared like a groan? - A. Yes; a groaning and scuffling in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What flurried you at that time? - A. Hearing the noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask what it was? - A. When I told her I had got the stuff, she said, not ready for it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was but a short time, from the time you went out for Miss Eyles, till you returned? - A.About a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how long was it before Miss Eyles came? - A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what passed then, Miss Eyles desired you to go for a surgeon, therefore it could not be very long before the surgeon, and the beadles came? - A. They followed me as soon as they came home; they were not at home.</p>

               <p>Q. Then there had not elapsed, from the first arrival of Mrs. Cox at your house, till the surgeon and headles came, above half an hour? - A. I really think it could not be more, or three quarters at most: but I had no clock. and was very much flurried.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you saw Mrs. Phipoe, she was extremely bloddy? - A. Yes, very bloody, and her singer bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she then complain? - A. Yes, she said, oh my finger.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the deceased, when you came in, after she had got down? - A. The kitchen is just as you enter the house.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner was walking in the passage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was passing between the deceased and her? - A. No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask Mrs. Benson any question upon your coming in? - A. She went up stairs; I was flurried, and went into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. You and the other women were gone out for a surgeon? - A. I went out; they remained in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Phipoe the first person you saw, when you came in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the street door open or shut? - A. I cannot say, but I think Mrs. Macdonald opened the or to me.</p>
               <p>Q.You heard a noise, that seemed to you like a scuffle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you heard no cry out at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Something that appeared to you like a scuffle, and an, but no cry out? - A. No, none at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever observe any thing odd about her behaviour? - A. she and I had some words once, about some china plates; she was very hard I thought upon me, as though I had broke them.</p>

             M'DONALD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. I live facing Mr. Munday's house, No. 1, Garden-street, St. George's in the East.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, on the 25th of October last, Mrs. Munday's coming to you? - A. I do; I went immediately over with her; I asked her what was the matter, I saw there was some trouble in her countenance; she left me in the passage for some time, whilst she went to fetch Miss Eyles, and a little before Mrs. Munday's return, the first thing I heard was, a heavy groaning, as if some person had been taken very poorly; the next thing I heard was Jesus Christ -</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The expression of Jesus Christ, did you know from what person that voice proceeded? - A. I think it must have been from the prisoner; because the other person was not able to speak; on their return, I was just running to the door, we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060015"/>went all three up stairs, I was hindmost, the two women went to the door of the prisoner; Mrs. Munday asked Mrs. Benson what was the matter with the woman, Mrs. Benson made answer, and said, nothing at all, that the woman had been i sit, but was quite recovered; Mrs. Munday said, she would go for a doctor, to which the prisoner answered, you may; Mrs. Munday again insisted upon having the door opened, what was the matter; the door was then opened the prisoner a little way, and the prisoner said, you may come in, Mrs. Munday, no other person has any business here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You say, when Mrs. Munday said she would go for a doctor, the answer of the prisoner was, you may? - A. Yes, as nearly as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. She did open the door immediately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did not I understand you, that the prisoner replied, Mrs. Munday, you may come in, but nobody else has any business here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Was the door opened wide enough for any body to go in? - A. No; the prisoner held the door with her hand; I was so situated I could see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You attempted to open the door? - A. I opened the door; the first thing that occurred to my view, was the prisoner in a very shocking condition, standing before the door, holding up her finger with a white pocket handkerchief all over blood; I said, Oh Lord! Mrs. Benson, what have you been about; she wanted me to come in, and made mention of something about money; and then I ran down stairs calling out murder.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did you perceive the deceased? - A. I did, I looked at the deceased; she was between the fire-place and the bed, the bed was pulled down upon the floor; she had one hand under her head bleeding like an ox, and holding her apron with her other hand to the side the would was; every thing was bloody in the room, and the woman especially.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was she sitting upon a chair or upon the ground? - A. Upon the ground; she had an apron holding to the wound, and it looked so ghastly that I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could she speak at that time? - A. No; I said to the prisoner, good God, has the Lord left you; what have you been about, Mrs. Benson, that your passion has over-ruled reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make you any reply? - A. She said, my dear Mrs. M'Donald, look at my finger, see what she has done; I immediately ran down stairs, and left them both in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing further? - A. Not a word, till I went down stairs; before I got half along the passage, Mrs. Munday went out for somebody; I ran straight to shut the door, as I was left in trust of the house; the deceased followed me down stairs, and she took hold of me by the two hands, she was in a shocking condition; Mrs. Benson came down, and I was between the two; the deceased made a noise like t-t-t-t-t, and wanted to go out of the house; Mrs. Benson came beside me. and said, take this woman away; I got her into the passage, whether Mrs. Benson helped me or not I cannot tell, I got her into the kitchen; Mrs. Benson said, come away, Mrs. Cox; no, she says, I will not come up stairs; and then I went house and washed my hands from the blood; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You assisted the deceased in getting her into the kitchen? - A. I did, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner followed her down stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say, when you opened the door, and was going into the room, the prisoner desired you to come in? - A. She did; and told me to look at her finger, and see what the woman had done to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked the prisoner to help you to assist her, in getting the deceased into the kitchen? - A. Yes; the Lord enabled me some how or other.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What kind of noise was it? - A.

I have had it in my possession ever since; I asked her who had served her in this manner, whether it was the wo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060017"/>man up stairs, and she said, oh! oh! when I went up stairs, I opened the door, I believe the door was shut, and the first thing that presented itself to me, was the prisoner at the bar, she was sitting upon the end of the bed, and I said, God Almighty! what have you been about, what could induce you to serve this poor woman below in the manner you have done; says she, I don't know, I believe the Devil and pashon have bewitched me; I saw a case knife with a green handle lying up the table, and part of a finger; I asked her when she that was her finger, she said, yes, that the woman below, Mrs. Cox, bad cut it off.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you examine her hand to see if corresponded with the truth? - A. Yes, I did; she held her hand up, and I saw the first finger of her left hand had been cut off. The prisoner said, that there was some money lying about the room, and I looked for it, and I found, I think, three or four guineas, and there were two notes, a one-pound-note and a two-pound-note, which I found lying upon a trunk.

               <p>Court. Q. There was a guinea found in addition to the four guineas you speak of? - A. When I found the four guineas, the prisoner at the bar seemed to say that it was not all that belonged to her, a desired me to put my hand into her left pocket, and there I found two guineas, half-a-crown, and the amount of sixpence halfpenny in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you were in conversation with the prisoner in the room up stairs, did she appear to you to have her understanding? - A.Perfectly, my Lord; I saw no appearance of insanity.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner make any excuse for her conduct and behaviour towards this poor woman, or did you perceive any disorder upon her arising from insanity? - A. Nothing at all of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Matthews. Q. You don't know whether any thing else happened in Mrs. Munday's house? - A. There was one thing I should have mentioned; when I came down stairs, I asked the deceased, below, whether she had cut the prisoner's finger off, and she said, oh! oh! which I understood to be, no.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to the hospital, were you present when the prisoner was searched? - A. I was not; there was an observation I should have made of searching the prisoner before she went; there were some ladies in the room, and they said they would search the woman, but I don't know if that was done; the prisoner said, I am ready to be searched, if you will, I have got no knife about me.</p>

I am a surgeon; I was called in to the deceased; I saw her sitting in the chair with her hand up to her head, mangled in a most terrible manner; there was a cut across the throat, and four or five stabs or incisions, and several wounds on her hands and body.</p>
               <p>Q.Were they near her breast? - A. The upper part of her breast.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Were there any wounds that were likely to endanger her life? - A. I considered the wounds mortal; I conceived that the woman would die in consequence of the injury she had received.</p>
               <p>Q. By what instrument did you conceive those wounds to be made? - A. They appeared to have been made by a sharp cutting instrument.</p>
               <p>Q.Could the deceased speak? - A. She could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060018"/>not speak intelligible, but she was very eager to make signs; I offered her a pen and ink, but she was not able to write; she made a kind of uttering, but not to be understood, and then shut her mouth and threw off a quantity; of air from the wind-pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the prisoner? - A. I did; I examined her hands, she had cut off one of her fingers; at least, one of her fingers was lying upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you collect from the appearance of it, how it could have happened, whether it could have happened by fighting? - A. I conceived it could not, the bone was cut-quite across; I told them I could not conceive it could be cut off by fighting; it was cut strait across, exactly in the kind of way as if you would lay it down upon a block. I sent them to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. In fact, you saw the prisoner had lost a finger? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, of course, there was a quantity of blood proceeded from the wounds? - A. There was a quantity of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. And you observed, likewise, upon the hands of the deceased there were wounds? - A. I saw three or four; the principal wound was here, (pointing to the back of his hand); which seemed to be inflicted with great violence; and if it had been all flesh, I should have conceived the hand must have been cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see the deceased? - A. I saw the woman, the first time, below stairs; at that time there was not a table spoonful of blood, she was without pulse, she had none whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue with her before you left her? - A. I sent her away to the hospital; she left the house prior to my going away; it must have been about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the difficulty of her conveying articulation more difficult the second minute than the first? - A. I was surprised to find a woman, who had lost so much blood, capable of holding up her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. According to the appearance of the wound, the difficulty of conveying an articulate found, would of course have been less a quarter of an hour after the deceased received this wound? - A. It might have been so.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, from the description you have given of the wound, you could not conceive that a person would be able to express herself? - A. There is an operation which we frequently perform, by which to dislodge any thing that may have collected in the throat.</p>
               <p>Q.But did you hear this woman speak any thing? - A.I think the found nearest resemblilng a word, was, look! look! she took a great deal of pains to convince me what instrument it was this woman had used to inflict these wounds, and some of the persons about her asked her whether it was done by a knife; I immediately desired a servant to get some knives, and three or four were brought down, these were produced to the woman, and I understood from her, that these were not the knives; by the noise, she uttered as if the prisoner took it from her pocket and ned it.</p>
               <p>Q.Then to understand you, that she herself was cap answering in that kind of way? - A. Yes.</p>

             being sworn.) - Says, I live in New-gravel-lane, in the parish of St. Paul's, Shadwell; the prisoner, Mrs. Benson, sent for me to her house, that I continued with her untill night; yesterday, about one o'clock, I went to the prisoner's house in Garden-street, I gave her about eleven pounds for a gold watch, trinkets, and other things, which I had purchased from her; there was some china upon the mantle-piece, there were three coffee-cups; I said to the prisoner, give me one of those cups: the prisoner said, take one, and while I was taking one of these cups, she came to me with a knife, and stabbed me in the throat, and I was under her hands for an hour; she had locked the door, I called out, murder, nobody came to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060019"/>assistance; the neighbours broke open the door, the prisoner said, I was in sits; I never had any quarrel with her; that I paid her six guineas and a half, a two pound note, and a one pound note; that Mr. Dunbar, the beadle, has the watch, he put it into his pocket; I don't know how the prisoner came by the watch; I have known her about three months; when I was upon the bed, she said, you bitch, I will kill you out, that you shall not be able to tell your own story.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Wednesday morning, about eleven o'clock, the deceased called upon me, and found me on the bed, she came up stairs to my apartments; I went down stairs to Mrs. Munday, when I returned, I gave her a guinea, and desired her to get me some brandy; she then shewed me a white dress, which she wished me to purchase; I gave her a guinea for the dress, and she returned me half-a-crown; she asked me if I would sell her some articles I had to dispose of; I said, if she would take the whole, she should have them, that a small sum was not an object, I wanted to make up my rent; afterwards, she asked me about my watch, and ear-rings, and I said, if you will not take the whole, it is not an object to me, I shall not give you the ear-rings nor the watch; upon that the deceased said, I suppose you want to go to London to be Mr. Courtoy's whore again-you lie, says I; to which she says, it is truth, for it was proved at the Old-Bailey, and she said, why did you not go into Devonshire to a convent, upon which nt words ensued; I was standing close to the there was a knife upon the table and she took up a green handled knife, and cut my finger off; I did not know (such was the quickness of the transaction,) what had happened, till I picked my finger off the ground; with this, I snatched something from the table; a little while after, I found myself alone in the room, covered with blood, and on the table I perceived my finger; I had some kind of a recollection, and I went down stairs, there was the deceased sitting on a chair; Mrs. Cox, says I, what made you cut off my finger? my dear, says she, it is what pleased God, and I hope God will forgive me; I looked at her, I saw her bloody, I was conscious it was her that had mangled me in this manner; then somebody about me put some questions to me; then there was a cry out, that I wanted to make my escape; I went up to my room, it was all confusion; they told me, I had murdered the woman; I recollect somebody asked me for notes, but I cannot give an accurate account about it; some woman searched me, and changed my bloody clothes; when I found myself in this situation in the room, the people dressed me, and took me to the hospital, and a little time afterwards, they put a strait waistcoat on me; I enquired repeatedly how the deceased was, and they told me she was quite out of danger, and that she said, if she recovered, she would take care that nobody should hurt me; at four o'clock I was told, there was a gentleman coming to me, a clergyman, and that the commitment was going to be made out, and I was taken up; I was told she was quite out of danger.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know when? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, on the night of this quarrel, he left your house? - A. Yes; I do not know whether it was the Friday before the 3d of October, or the Friday week, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again? - A. On the Friday morning after, he called for a shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come on the 3d of October? - A. Yes; I w the fore parlour with the deceased, George W.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he about? - A. Only sitting in the chair; I was busy at work; Stubbs came in and said, he was come to his lodging, and I told him he must not come there any more; he said, he would; I told him he should not; he said, he should, for where his work was, he would be; he said he had left a black handkerchief; I told him I did not know any thing of it, if he had left it, to go and look for it; he went to look for his handkerchief; says he, I thought I had not left it here, or else I should have found it, but I must have lost it. He used to make his wigs in the back room; when he came out of the back room, the deceased was sitting in my room, and he was rather angry with my denying him his lodging, and said, rogues and thieves could sit there, although he could not sit there; then he went round to the back of the seat, where he was sitting, and I was standing just by doing my work, and he went out; I was watching to see if he would go out at the door, and I saw his hand go gently, not, knowing he was going to hit him; he gave him a blow, with his hand only indeed; his hand was open when I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q.When he struck him, was his hand open or shut then? - A. That I cannot say; I suppose it must be shut.</p>
               <p>Q.The right hand or the left? - A. The right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that he struck him? - A. Near the middle of his forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, had Ware interfered at all in the dispute between you and Stubbs? - A. Not that I heard, I do not think he said much; if there was any words passed, it is more than I know.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Stubbs then? - A. He directly went out of my apartment; I went to the street-door myself to look after him, and when I returned into the room,

             was standing up; I observed his forehead to blood in that part where Stubbs's hand had been, and I said to him, Lord bless me, does it bleed; he said, Yes; and I told him I would get a little flower, and stop it if I could; he said, do not mind it, let it bleed, he would not have any thing; in the course of a little time it stopped of itself.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a wound did it appear to you to be? - A. It was a very small wound, to look at it it was nothing, it was like a scratch of a pin more than any thing else; nobody could have thought it would have ended in the manner that it has.</p>
               <p>Q. The skin was broke? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen, before this time, that piece of iron last? - A.Indeed I cannot particularly say, it might be a day or two, or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you seen it then? - A. It laid in the window till he took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you examine the wound? - A. The next morning; I advised him to get a little warm milk and water, and bathe it with; it then looked like a deepish scratch, and bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear then in a mild, or an angry state? - A. It looked reddish; I put a plaister upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it, or dress it again? - A. I do not know whether it was the next day or the day after; when I saw it again, I thought it did not heal well, and I drest it once after that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after that? - A. Four weeks, and I believe he died the third day; four weeks and three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Stubbs came to live with you as usual? - A.Yes; I think it was a week after the 3d of October.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Nobody looked upon this as any thing at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The poor man, who died, thought nothing of it? - A. No, he did not.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060022"/>Q. Before the poor man died, they were as good friends as ever? - A. Yes; Stubbs sent for him into my room to make it up with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Stubbs advise him to go to the doctor's? - A. Yes; he said, I won't make it up unless you will make it up with my wife too; he said, he had not the least objection to that.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, they were all as good friends as usual? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As your plaister did not quite cure this, did not Stubbs advise him to go and have some little advice? - A. Yes; and about a fortnight after,

             came down, and he and Stubbs had two or three pots of beer together; and Stubbs said to him, as your forehead does not seem to get better, you had better go to surgeon Potts, in Pall-Mall, and I will go with you; Ware said, it did not signify, and therefore he did not go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. At the time he struck the blow, do you know whether he used any words, or what he said? - A. No; there were no words at all that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether or not, from that 3d of October, the deceased frequently complained of his head? - A. He did not make any complaints till he got worse and worse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he or not frequently complain of his head? - A. When I have asked him about his forehead, he said it did not mend, and it was very sore, he could not beat his hat on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of his head frequently? - A. He used to say his head was very sore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of any pain in it? - A. Yes, certainly; I dare say he had a pain in his head.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I tell you the reason why I ask you, I want to know whether the Magistrate has put that in your examination as true, which was false; I have it down here, that you said, he frequently complained of a pain in his head? - A. Yes, he did, no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the soreness increase? - A. I believe it did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he afterwards so ill, as not to be able to leave his room? - A. I do not know that he was confined to his room, because I was not always with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a person coming to him to do something to his head? - A. No; there was nobody came to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you remember a surgeon coming? - A. Yes; that was on the Tuesday night, that he died of the Friday morning.</p>
               <p>Q.Do not you remember, before the surgeon came, he was so ill, that he could not leave his room? - A. Yes; he grew so very bad.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. On the 3d of October in the evening, I was washing for Mrs. Smallman, down stairs in the back kitchen; my husband and I, and Mrs. Smallman had supped together in her parlour, and I left him in the room; I went into the room where he was, between eight and nine o'clock, my husband had cooked some fish for supper in my room, and brought it down there; I was in the back kitchen, washing, I heard the voice of Mr. Stubbs, but what he said, I do not know, he seemed as if he was not very well pleased; I went up stairs; in about a quarter of an hour after that, I saw my husband sitting in the great chair with his arms on his knees, and his head held down and bleeding; I said, what is the matter, Mrs. Smallman answered, Stubbs has struck your husband when he never spoke to him; I then said, by God, he has murdered my husband; Stubbs was then gone out, he seemed to have bled a great deal, by the floor, it seemed to be trod about; my husband got up to go out, but Mrs. Smallman would not let him; my husband went to bed, and I went down to my work, and it was two o'clock before I had done my work, and then I went up stairs to bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Smallman examine or dress this wound? - A. I did not see her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see the wound? - A. In the morning, before I got out of be.</p>
               <p>Q.Describe its appearance? - A. seemed like two cuts, with a dent in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say to you what he was struck with? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue to go out as usual, after that? - A. He continued to go out for almost three weeks, but sometimes, may-be, he would lay a-bed a couple of days, or a day, he complained terribly of his head; the first time he entirely took to his room, was, the day three weeks that the accident happened at night, it was on the Tuesday night, he never came down any more, but once; him and Mr. Stubbs had drank two pots of beer together that day, he had dined there that day, and had eat a bit of mutton.</p>
               <p>Q.You lived in Mr. Smallman's house, did not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did he appear when he took to his bed? - A. The next morning he seemed very poorly indeed, and every day he seemed rather to get worse.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first send for a doctor? - A. On the Tuesday following, that was that day four weeks that the accident happened, at four o'clock in the morning, he got out of bed, and the use of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060023"/>his right side was taken away; he retained his senses to the last word he spoke. I sent for Mr. Russell first, and he would not come; then Mr. Perrin came on the Tuesday evening, he is an apothecary, he took off the plaister, and said he would go and fetch another gentleman, which he did; and Mr. Thomas came.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, in short, the surgeons trepanned him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that operation had been performed, what state was he in? - A. He seemed to rest a great deal better that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did any alteration take place after that night? - A. The next day he seemed to get worse, and I went for a clergyman, that was on the Wednesday, I locked my door, and left the key with Mrs. Blythe, and begged her to look at my husband while I was out, to see if he wanted any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did he seem sensible of the danger of his own situation? - A. He seemed to take very little notice of his situation; I told him, I thought he was dying, and he said, then I must die.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know that you were going for a clergyman? - A. NO.</p>
               <p>Q. did he use any other expression, slating whether he thought himself in danger or not? - A. No. I could not get a clergyman, they were both gone out; this was on the Wednesday, and on the Friday, he died, about half past one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Court Q. You saw the wound the next morning, and it seemed like two scratches and a dent in the middle-were those two scratches opposite to each other? - A. Yes; it was wider at the top than it was at the bottom.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE BLYTHE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I lodge in the same house; my husband is servant to Lord Ashbourn; I was present just after the quarrel between Mrs. Smallman and Stubbs; she cried out, murder! and when I came down, he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the night the accident happened? - A. No; he said he was very sorry for the accident, and turned into my room; he pulled the plaister off himself; I saw it was a very bad wound in his forehead, and his face was grazed with; the handle of the iron that he had struck him with; it appeared to me as if it had been struck with something sharp; it appeared to me like a dent in the middle and a scratch two ways; I thought it must be struck with an instrument, as it appeared to me from the wound.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.You are clear it could not be a wound given with the open hand, or with a clenched fist? - A. No; it could not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you went for the doctor? - A. Yes; three weeks after the blow was given, the Tuesday before he died.</p>
               <p>Q. During the operation by the surgeons, had you any conversation with the prisoner? - A. Yes; on the Tuesday I went down and tapped at the window where Stubbs was at work, and I asked him how he could strike Ware such a blow, for the surgeon says it will be his death; he said he was frightened, and he was never frightened at any thing but this; he said, he was so savage to see him sitting in the chair, that he had not cared if he had killed him outright; but, says, he, I could not be in my right senses, for just before I came into the house, I had a sit in the street; and I said, if any thing happens of this, you may bring the man that picked you up; and there was no more passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when Mrs. Ware went for the clergyman? - A. Yes; while she was gone, I went up into the room of the deceased, and asked him if he wanted any thing; he told me he would be glad if I would bring him a cup of tea; I immediately returned into my own room, and got it; I carried it up, and put my hand under his head, and he drank it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem at all aware of the opinion of the surgeons; did he seem to think himself in danger? - A. I will tell you what passed.</p>
               <p>Court. q. Did he seem to think that he was in his last moments? - A. Yes; it appeared so to me when he had drank the tea; I asked him if he wanted any thing to eat; he said, no, I thank you; but if you will bring me a bit of bread and butter, an onion, and some salt, for my supper, and some of Flowers's small-beer, I shall be obliged to you; for, says he, what a person fancies when they are ill, does them more good than doctor's stuff; says he, my father fancied-toast and cyder, they would not let him have it, and he got out of bed, and drank it, and mended ever after; I told him, I am sorry to see you suffer so on such an occasion; ah! says he, and never spoke to the man when he struck me; I said, the gentlemen are for taking Stubbs up, are you willing for it; the deceased said, the parish will see to that, for he has murdered me with the same iron that he beat Mrs. Smallman with, the Friday night before; when he struck me, he said, you b-r, I have done for you; that was all that passed; then I was obliged to go to my children; I never spoke to him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Stubbs was in the house at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Stubbs and the deceased dining and drinking together? - A. No; I never went into their apartments.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am an apothecary: I was called in to the deceased, on Tuesday the 31st of October, by Mrs. Blythe; I went to him, and I judged, from the symptoms, that there was a fracture; I only<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060024"/>took off the plaister, the wound was upon the right side of the forehead, and it was nearly healed, the scalp did not adhere to the skull, and the opposite side to where the wound was, was quite useless; he complained of a violent pain in his head, his wife first informed me so, I asked him, and he put his hand up to his head; from this symptom, and the appearance, I judged it was a fracture, and called in Mr. Thomas, a surgeon, he came with me immediately.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You know something of surgery yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you observe whether it was done by an instrument? - A. It was impossible I could judge from the appearance at that moment, there was such a quantity of stuff about it that it was impossible; Mr. Thomas came, and judged as I did, that there was a fracture, and he performed the operation of trepanning; I attended the trepanning.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon seeing him trepanned, you could form some judgment probably by what that wound was occasioned? - A. Most undoubtedly, by some piece of iron, or some instrument; it is impossible I can say what.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It was not such a wound as could be given by a flat hand or a fist? - A. No; it is impossible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. What was you observation after the operation was performed? - A. I supposed the man would die from the appearance of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any particular observation upon the part? - A. There was a great quantity of matter issued out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you tell him the danger he was in? - A. I told his wife; the man himself was insensible during the operation; he was somewhat relieved from the operation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attribute his death to the blow? - A. Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>- THOMAS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I was called in to the deceased, on Tuesday evening, by Mr. Perrin; I found that he had lost the use of the right side entirely.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whether, in point of practice, it does not frequently happen that the person who has received a facture may lose the use of the opposite side? - A. Very frequently.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. How did you find the wound at that time? - A. It was nearly closed; but upon introducing a probe, I found a roughness upon the bone; I immediately laid open the skin, and perceived a fracture, with depression of the skull; I then applied the trepan, and immediately a large quantity of matter issued out; the patient appeared to be perfectly insensible of pain, but the following morning seemed somewhat relieved.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the blow had been given by the hand, or by an instrument? - A. I should suppose, by the appearance, it was given by a sharp pointed instrument.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Could you judge whether the instrument was a very sharp instrument, or a blunt instrument, square or round? - A. I should suppose it had been the end of a poker, or something of that sort would have made a similar indenture.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. To what did you impute his death? - A. In consequence of the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem to have been taken proper care of? - A. I should suppose if he had been taken care of in the first instance, it might have done very well, allowing for the danger of the operation itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you to be a kind of wound that would of necessity have required the operation? - A. Most undoubtedly it would.</p>
               <p>Q. That is always a hazardous operation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you visited him again, had he recovered his senses? - A. In part, he then answered some questions, but rather incoherently, he said he was easier, and he said he had slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend him afterwards? - A. Yes, twice a day; he never recovered his senses completely afterwards, nor the use of his side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. From the time you were first called in, to the time of his death, you did not think he was perfectly rational? - A. No.</p>

I am the beadle of St. James's parish; I apprehended the prisoner, I supposed him to be the man, I met him in Jermyn-street; I came up to him, and asked him what his name was, he said, my name is Stevens; I asked him to let me look at his right hand, he had both hands in his coat pocket; he pulled out his right hand, and shewed it to me, and according to the information I had by the public advertisements, he was the man, he had got the first joint of his left thumb off; I told him, he must go along with me; he said, Lord have mercy upon me, I hope you will not hurt me; says I, I will not; I took him, and put him in St. James's watch-house: I went up to the office, and enquired for the coroner's warrant and commitment, in consequence of which it was that I apprehended him; I had an order to take him to Bow-street, I took him to Bow-street, I laid down the warrant, and informed Mr. Bond, and he said, he did not see occasion to hear any of the matters that had been heard before the coroner; he said, here is your commitment, take him to Newgate; I called a coach, and took him to Newgate, going along, I asked him how he came,o do it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you tell him it would be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060025"/>better for him? - A. No; I did not hold out any threat or promise; I told him it was a shocking thing; he said, why did not he take care of it in time; I offered to take him to Dr. Potts's, says he, he is an acquaintance of mine; that is the principal of what I know about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You did not go after him, till after the coroner's inquest had been taken? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. One of the gentlemen, the the surgeon, said, if he had come to him sooner, he might have been as well as any man; I told him, I would go with him to Mr. Potts's, he said, he never would, but he never came down, and I never saw him up after; about a fortnight after the accident happened, I dined with him, and drank with him, till ten o'clock at night; his wife had given him a violent blow or two upon the part where he was wounded, and he never got up after.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Ware.) Q. The prisoner says, in his defence, that you gave your husband a blow or two upon that part of the head where the wound was, is that so? - A. No; I was one day putting on my cap, he was standing very near me, and I touched his head with my hand, as I was pinning my ribbon, and the matter came out of the wound, I told him, I was sure, I could not have hurt him so much; I said, his head could not be so bad as he made of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is a person in the Court that Mrs. Ware told so.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the Angel and Crown, in Eaton-street; I have known the prisoner two years since Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a character has he bore for good nature? - A. I never heard any thing to the contrary; in the morning that this accident happened in the evening, Ware came from the country, and he came over to me, to ask me to lend him a hat, he had lost his hat the night before, coming with the conch; in the evening, Mrs. Ware came over, and said, Mortlake, we have had such a row over at our house -</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell what she said? - A. Next morning I saw Mr. Ware, he told me, that Stubbs and he had had words, and that he had received a blow; he shewed me the blow, and I said, I thought he was able to defend himself against Mr. Stubbs, and he said, oh, I will make him come down for this.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Ware consider this at all as a serious thing? - A. No; only he said, he would make him come down for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, from what you saw at that time, think it at all a serious thing? - A. Not at all; it appeared to me to be only a graze on the temple, just about the eye; Ware came constantly to my house for a fortnight or three weeks after, and I went over with some beer for both of them to drink, the beer was set down to Stubbs, and they seemed very good friends.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What are you? - A. I keep a public-house, the Angel and Crown.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.The prisoner was your customer? - A. Yes, both the prisoner and the deceased.</p>

About four miles, as near as I can guess; I asked her to come home with me, and she said, she could not come home with me; I did prevail upon her to come home with me; I called to my little boy to give me the key out of the window, this was between seven and eight o'clock; I asked her to get a light, my little boy went out and fetched a light, and, upon taking the infant off the bed, I missed the sheets; I asked her where the sheets where; she said they were on the bed; looking further about my dirty linen, I missed a pair of white cotton stockings; I asked her for the new shift, if she had finished it; she said, no, it lay upon a chair in the parlour; I said, Molly, I am certain you must have taken these things, and if you will deliver them to me, I will not hurt you; she said she had got them, and she would keep them till I paid her her wages; I prevailed upon her to stop with me till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any wages due to her? - A. No; I did not agree with her for any; she came to me as charity, and I told her I would satisfy her for her trouble; she came to me out of charity, for victuals and drink; she came to town with me, and said, when she came to town, she would deliver them voluntarily up; she would not deliver them when I came to town; I searched for them, and found them at a tea-dealer's, in Drury-lane, where she lodged; she lodged there a good while before; I found the things named in the indictment in her room.</p>

I had this apron from the prisoner, which Mr. Newman has sworn to be his property. (Produces it).</p>

               <p>Q. The ingots are delivered to you in bars? - A. Yes; we have the charge and custody of it, and are responsible for the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner? - A. What they call a sizer, he oils the guineas, and carries them in various states from one room to another.</p>
               <p>Q. Having access to the different commodities that are there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there, on the 3d of November, or before that, golden blanks for guineas? - A.There were, on that day, and the next, I believe, I cannot speak exactly, we missed them frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say there were some taken away? - A. Yes, certainly, I should think so; this is the blank that I received from Cuff, the pawnbroker's man, it has the assay mark upon it, but I should have known it without.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner when he was apprehended? - A. Not till he was before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. A number of men are employed in the same office that this man is? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not your duty to inspect the office he belongs to? - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, you do not know any thing about any loss, except by the comparison of some books? - A. Yes; I have missed blanks several times, but could not tell how they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How often? - A. I cannot say, every day almost.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a great number of men employed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No individual man has any particular charge over any particular portion of it? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. There are six monies of the Mint? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any superior officers to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of commission have you? - A. A commission from the Crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the capacity in which you are authorized to dispose of any of the property that comes into your hands, is merely a capacity of so many persons, moniers in the Mint-when you undertake to perform any particular act, you must perform that act in your capacity as moniers, and in no other capacity? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060030"/>Q. Therefore, any other act which is not done by you, as moniers of the Mint, must be null and void? - A. I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose five of you were to do an act without the sixth, that act must be null and void? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular Act of Parliament by which you have authority to act? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the authority you have got, giving you a privilege to act, is that a joint authority, which says you shall do so and so? - A. I neverread the authority under which I act.</p>

             sworn. - I live with Mr. Fullwood, pawnbroker, No. 30, Barbican; the prisoner came to our house on the 3d of November, between two and three o'clock; he offered for sale eight gold blanks, nearly the size of a guinea each, and several small pieces of gold; he wished to know the value of them; having bought two small parcels of gold of him in the month of July, it gave me to suspect he had not come by them honestly; I wished him to leave them and call again at five o'clock; he would not leave them without my putting down the weight, two ounces, sixteen penny-weights, which I did, and gave him the paper, he said he would call at five o'clock; I then sent them by the lad who was in the shop with me, to my master, the boy's name is

            ; my master returned between four and five, and the prisoner came again between five and six; Mr. Fullwood, Mr. Mason, and the boy were then in our house; he wished to have the value of the gold, Mr. Fullwood then came out of the parlour with the constable, and took him into the parlour, where he remained till the gentlemen came from the Mint; I went into the parlour with the gentlemen, and they seemed very much surprised, and said, Ball, is it you? there were several words passed, and he was taken to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the blanks you had sent by Notley to your master? - A. I received them from Mr. Fullwood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How many are concerned in the shop besides yourself? - A. The boy Notley.</p>
               <p>Q.What time did the prisoner bring these to your shop? - A.Between three and four.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it you that entered into the treaty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever bought any gold in the shop before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Something similar, I suppose? - A. Something similar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not your master been in treaty with some persons, that, before the Magistrate, he said, were coiners? - A. I did not hear any such thing; I remember his saying, he did not know whether somebody had not tried to make a Yorkshire guinea, and failed in the attempt, and sold it.</p>
               <p>Q.Sterling gold you know, is what they call Yorkshire gold? - A. We did not know it was sterling gold.</p>
               <p>Q. You a pawnbroker, and not know sterling gold; do you not try every bit of gold before you deal about it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These being Yorkshire guineas, was his honest excuse for purchasing such a commodity? - A. I left it to my master.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am a pawnbroker: The boy came to me on the 3d of November, and brought me eight blanks of gold, and some other pieces; I was at my uncle's, No. 70, Leather-lane; I returned them to the man again in the same state that I had received them from the boy.</p>
               <p>Cuff. These are the pieces I had from Mr. Fullwood.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Notley). These pieces that you received from Cuff, you gave your master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicholl. I had these from Cuff, before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Cuff. That is one of the parcels that I received from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Fullwood. Before I got home, I had applied to a person in Leather-lane, Mr. Aspinshaw, who is a smith in the Mint; I then went home, and had got Mason, the constable, ready to take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner came into the shop, did he apply to you, or to the man? - A. He applied to the man at the door; I did not hear distinctly what he said, but hearing something, I went out, the constable followed; I produced the pieces, and he said, what will you give me for them; I told him, I thought he had not come honestly by them, and I should give charge of him; the moniers of the Mint came, and so did Mr. Aspinshaw; before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060031"/>they came, I had asked him if he sold them for himself, or for any one else; he said, he had brought them for no person but himself, they were his own property, and so he should make it appear; we expressed surprise that the parties were so long in coming; he seemed to wish to know who the parties were that were coming; Mr. Aspinshaw came about five o'clock, or it might be something more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a pawnbroker? - A. I am a silversmith and salesman.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a pawnbroker? - A. Yes; but not in that shop; it is my uncle's shop; I have the management of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he manage the pawnbrokering business now? - A. I am obliged to mind that for him.</p>
               <p>Q. These blanks had been in a good many hands besides yourself? - A. Yes; I gave them first into the hands of Mr. Aspinshaw's father, and he shewed them to his son; but they never passed my sight; the time Mr. Aspinshaw wanted to take care of them, I would not leave them.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen Yorkshire guineas? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And these are very small to Yorkshire guineas? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were very much like Yorkshire guineas? - A. I went to a refiner for his opinion; if I had known it had been stamped for gold, I should not have let him have them for three guineas; it would have puzzled a refiner in that state.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there not been something before the Magistrate about guineas? - A. What Magistrate? I have heard nothing about it, except before the Lord-Mayor, in the present business; I never bought any like this.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know about Yorkshire guineas? - A. I had taken them in the way of trade.</p>
               <p>Q. And you a silversmith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Not till the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you would purchase one hundred pounds worth of such goods, if they were brought to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were at Mr. Aspinshaw's? - A. His sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear these pieces are the pieces that came from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you buy silver, do you always go to a refiner's, to see whether it is gold or silver? - A. Yes; but when gold is in this state, it is impossible to tell what it is.</p>

             sworn. - I went to the house of Mr. Fullwood, and saw Cuff, to take charge of a person they expected to return about six o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it that you saw the prisoner at the bar? - A. About five o'clock in the evening, being in the parlour, I waited for a signal to know when the man was come; he was pointed out to me; I went into the parlour, Mr. Fullwood came into the room; the prisoner seemed very sorry for what had happened; and I desired him to sit down, for I expected a gentleman to call; Ball sat down in a chair, and wanted to know how long it would be before the gentleman came; I talked to him, and endeavoured to persuade him to be satisfied for a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before any gentleman came? - A. About half an hour; while I was in the parlour, I asked him if it was his own property, or if he sold it for any body else; he said, it was his own, he had bought it of a man; I asked him who that man was, and where he lived; he could not tell, but said it was his own property; I asked him if he had got any more; he said he had got no more at all; still he was very impatient; he threw this piece of paper on the fire, accordingly I picked up the piece of paper; after that, Mr. Atkinson and a Mr. Gregory came into the house, with some other gentlemen; soon after that one of the moniers gave me charge of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there was a little contest between you and Mr. Nicholl, about this gold, whether it would be identified? - A. No; the man never said what gold it was, I was informed before that they were blank guineas.</p>
               <p>- ASPINSHAW sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are employed in the Mint? - A. Yes; I went to Mr. Fullwood's house in consequence of his calling upon me, I saw the prisoner there; I asked him how he came by them, and whether there was any other man concerned besides himself; but he said, it was all his own doing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he had got them? - A. No; he had hid them in various places, and that no one was concerned with him.</p>
               <p>Q. In various places where? - A. In the building.</p>
               <p>Q. You meea in the Mint? - A. Yes; I asked him how he got them; he said from different places, some were taken from the size-room, and others were taken from the Mint office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that where the blanks are lodged? - A. No; the pieces of cecil are.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. In what state do you receive the gold from the moniers, is it not in bars? - A. No; they receive it in bars.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it in bars when the moniers give it to you? - A. Yes; it goes through various processes.(Mr. Nicholl proved the blanks having come from the Tower).</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How does the money come to you? - A. It goes in ingots to the melter, and from him to us; and we return it to the Bank of England weight for weight, as we receive it.</p>

               <p>Q. You cannot swear to the identical coin? - A. No; we found two half-crown papers in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This indictment charges the man with stealing your money in your dwelling-house, in the parish of Stepney; is it not in the parish of St. Lawrence, Stepney? - A. It is in the parish of St. Dunstan, Stepney.</p>
               <p>Q.Of these halfpence, a great many were bad? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say there were forty shillings-worth of Tower halfpence? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Twenty shillings-worth? - A. That is hard to say, Tower halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q.And you will not swear, I dare say, that the mere weight of the other halfpence would have sold for twenty shillings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his wife never come to the house? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Might you not have changed these bundles of halfpence? - A. I do not think I have changed any more than four bundles for these two months past.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: On the 17th of November, I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's lodgings, No. 6, King-Edward-street, Mile end, about half a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house; the prosecutor told me if there were any halfpence, they were bound up in paper in the form of one that he shewed me; the prisoner was not at home; after waiting a little while, I told his wife my business, I had not a search-warrant, I desired her to open the drawers; in the drawers I found this double paper, and these two half papers, the twine and the paper, and the manner of tying up, corresponded exactly; I saw her with a paper in her hand, and I went and took it from her; under the pillow of the bed, in this handkerchief, in two corners, I found a quantity of halfpence, (producing them); and over the fire-place, in a coffee-cup, I found a quantity of farthings; in different parts of the room I found a great many more halfpence, loose, and the same kind of paper about the room that the halfpence were packed up in; when he came in, I searched his person, but found no money but one halfpenny upon him; I took him, and his wife and all to the office.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness: I let the first floor of our house to the prisoner, on the 16th of September last, at a guinea a week, she came in that morning after ten o'clock; she came there as a captain Wilson's wife, from Yarmouth; she said, she had come that morning to the Golden-cross, Charing-cross, at seven o'clock, by the Yarmouth coach; that captain Wilson was to be in town on the Friday, that he was to come in his own vessel, and she could not travel by water, she came by land carriage; she desired to have a pair of sheets aired, and a bed made, as soon as possible, she had been travelling two nights, and was very much fatigued; I sent my servant for the sheets, and put them to the fire immediately; she asked if I would be kind enough to let her sit down by the fire; I said there was none but in the kitchen; after she had sat down about a quarter of an hour in the kitchen, she begged to have a card of our address to leave at Charing-cross, that captain Wilson might know where to find her, she went out and returned about one o'clock, she might be gone about half an hour, or something better; she desired me to get her a bason of soup, and a threepenny-loaf; I gave four shillings and sixpence for a sack of coals and sixpenny-worth of wood; the servant went to the Spring-garden Coffee-house and got a bason of soup, and a threepenny loaf, she took up with it a silver table-spoon; after she had eat part of the soup, she went into the bed-room, as we thought, to go to bed; while she was in the bed-room, the girl went three times into the diningroom to see how the fire was; we heard nothing more of her till, as near as I can recollect, about five o'clock; she came down stairs from the diningroom to the top of the kitchen stairs, and called the servant, she told her she was going out to order some things in, and desired she would take them in when they came; I went to the kitchen stairs, and desired her to let the servant go as she felt so much fatigued; she told me, no, she was obliged to go out herself, and desired the kettle might be got boiling, and the tea-things carried up, by six o'clock; she then left the house, having been there about half an hour; the servant went up to see how the fire was, and the dining-room door was locked, she came down and told me the door was locked; she did not return at six o'clock, and when seven o'clock came, I was very much alarmed; I sent the girl to the Golden-cross, to know if a person of the name of Wilson, captain Wilson's wife, had come with the coach that morning, and to know if she had left a card of our address there, that the captain might know where to find her; she brought word, for the answer, that there were only two gentlemen came in the Yarmouth coach that morning; and by the time the girl returned, captain Leicester, that lodged in the parlour, came in, and we tried to open the door, and could not; we got a ladder, and got in at the window, backwards; we found a pair of sheets gone, and a counterpane, a tablespoon, and the key of the door; by the time we had done it it was almost eight o'clock; I sent for my husband, and we went to Bow-street, and gave information; I called at Mr. Salkeld's, the pawnbroker, the corner of Bedford-street, and two others, but nothing had been pawned of that kind then; in the evening, the pawnbroker at the corner of Bedford-street, came to tell me his young man had recollected taking in these things, at six o'clock that evening; I described her dress, and her person, and he said, it was exactly the person I had described; she had pawned them in my name, and told them that she was the mistress of the house, that she kept the house; the next morning I went to Bow-street, and informed them we had found some things; they told me, at Bow-street, that unless I found the person I must take the things out, and pay a guinea for them, that they had advanced; I saw no more of her till the 29th of November, I was going up to Newport-market, and at the corner of St. Martin's-lane, there is a woollen-drapers, she saw me, she ran up a court, and I went after her, seeing me coming after her, she returned; I asked her if she did not know me; she told me she did not, that she had never seen me before; I told her I was confident she had; she asked me when; I told her I thought she could recollect where as well, as I could tell her; I told her if I must have the trouble to tell her, that I was the person where she took the table-spoon, and the counterpane, and sheets from, in Northumberland-street; she told me I had mistook the person; I told her I was confident to her person; she said, if I took her up, she would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060034"/>take me up; I told her I should not take her up myself, but if she offered to stir till I had assistance, I should cry stop thief; she told me, she would not be detained in the street; there was a great mob of people gathered round; I desired a young man that was there to get somebody to take the prisoner, for she had robbed me; he brought the beadle of the parish, and they took her down to the watch-house, and from thence to Bow-street, where she was examined; my servant girl went to Bow-street, and she knew her as soon as ever she saw her; when she was searched, she had two guineas and a half in gold in her pocket, six shillings and six-pence in silver, and three shillings in halfpence and farthings, and a great number of duplicates, but not the duplicate of the spoon.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. You never saw the person of the prisoner before the time she came to your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She sat in the kitchen? - A. A quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the gentleman in the parlour? - A. No, nothing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say that you supposed it was a man in woman's clothes? - A. I said, I thought so; because she was such a large featured woman, but I am sure she is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that she was gone about half an hour? - A. I saw her go.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you or your servant saw her all the time? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. The spoon was there when she returned at one o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your servant made the bed, between the time of her leaving the house, and coming home, at one o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you a great many lodgers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not very nice in your lodgers, I see, to take people without characters? - A. I told her, I wished to have some account of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her when she came back again at one o'clock? - A. No; the girl did.</p>
               <p>Q. But you yourself did not know who that was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think it was, before the person who went up stairs, quitted the house again? - A. About five o'clock, as near as I can tell; I saw her go out myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the person? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

             sworn. - On the 16th of November, the prisoner was at Mr. Bailey's house between the hours of ten and one, I cannot tell exactly the time she first came; I do not know any thing that passed before one o'clock, she came in at one o'clock; I went and fetched her some soup, she asked me to fetch her some, and she gave me one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Only one shilling? - A. Only one shilling, and a three-penny loaf; I took the soup up to her, with a silver spoon, and the loaf; I asked her if she wanted any thing else, she said, no, she did not want any thing else; she said, she was very much fatigued, and she would go to bed; she went into the room to go to bed, as I thought, I went into the room three times, to look at the fire in the mean time, and to take the bason and the spoon away, but it was put in the cupboard, with the bason half full of soup, I saw it there; I did not see any more of her till five o'clock, she called to me at the top of the kitchen stairs, to ask me to take in the things that she should send in; I saw her go out at the door directly; in about half an hour after, I went up stairs to look at the fire, and the door was fastened; I went down stairs and told my mistress of it, I made the kettle boil and set the things ready to take up stairs; I went up again to see, and I could see no fire through the key-hole; it went on till about seven o'clock, then we began to be very uneasy, and my mistress desired me to go to the Golden-cross, Charing-Cross; I went there, and asked the landlady of the house, if a Mrs. Wilson had come there from Yarmouth, that morning, and the answer was, no, there was no such a person came there; I returned back again, and told my mistress; when I returned, there was captain Leicester in the house, we tried to open the door, but could not; I went down into the kitchen, and got a table to set a ladder upon to get in at the window; I got in myself at the bed-room window, and saw that the quilt was gone off the bed, and we looked, and found the sheets were gone; we went into the dining-room, and saw that the table-spoon was gone out of the bason, that was at eight o'clock, and my mistress ordered me to fetch my master from the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you see her? - A. Three times; I am sure she is the person, I am quite confident she is the person.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Bailey.) Did you take particular notice of her? - A. Yes; when she took the lodging, when she agreed for the lodging, when she sat in the kitchen, at five o'clock, and when she went out of the house, at the top of the kitchen stairs, she was dressed in a cotton gown and petticoat, a large pattern; I could as positively swear to her, as I could to any of my own children.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her again in St. Martin's-lane? - A. Yes; and I knew her again immediately, and she knew me, for she ran up the court immediately, I was confident to her face.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Peat. Q. How long was it before you saw this person again? - A. The 29th of November, when my mistress sent for me to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have told his Lordship, that you are very confident she is the woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you had never seen her before she came to the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you would have known her if you had met her in a hop-garden in Kent, or in Cork, or any where else? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you apprehend he had any other habitation? - A. None whatever; he left me this day week; last Thursday I went into the country; on the 20th I had missed several things but did not suspect him; after some time I had occasion to suspect him, and I applied for a warrant to go to No. 10, Artillery-street, the house of Mrs. Barry, he went there by the name of Fish, two Police-officers went with me; I found a large trunk of things, all of which came out of my shop, and some of which, I can positively swear to be my property; I found also, between eighty and ninety pounds, in money and Bank-notes; and I know, when he came to me, he was not worth a groat; he was in great distress, and was recommended to me as an object of charity; the things are here.</p>
               <p>EDWARD SMITH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a Police-officer: I went with Mr. Bulmer to execute a search-warrant at the house of Mrs. Barry, No. 10, Artillery-street, I went up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, during the time you staid there, see the prisoner at all? - A. I did; when I went up stairs, Mrs. Penti was sitting by the fire; when I communicated to her our business, she seemed very much alarmed, indeed; this trunk was standing by the window, I asked her for the key; she said her husband had got the key, and he was out, and desired us to wait till he returned, before we searched the room; I took the poker, and by force, broke open this trunk, and in it was most of those things that are here.</p>
               <p>Q. How many articles have you put in since? - A.This gown, and a gown that Mrs. Penn had on her back; this gown, I believe, lay on the bed; I put all the property into the trunk; Mr. Penn then came home, and I took hold of him, and secured him; she exclaimed, my dear Mr. Penn, what shall I do; he was then taken to the office for examination.</p>
               <p>Q.Coomes was the other officer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He knows nothing more than you do? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say this young man seemed very much alarmed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not at all unlikely that any person may be alarmed at two Police-officers coming with a search-warrant? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060038"/>Balmer. This piece of linen I can swear positively to, there is my own hand-writing upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that? - A. Two pounds sixteen shillings it cost me; I left London on the 20th of last month, and I then had seen this piece, it is a remarkable piece, it is much cheaper than any of the others; on my return, on the 27th, I missed this along with some others; here are some handkerchiefs that have got my shop-mark upon them; and a piece of nankeen which has my shop-mark in my own hand; and the fag-end of this gown has my own mark upon it; and the neck-cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you permit him, while he was with you, to deal in any thing of this sort? - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you keep one shop in Margate, and another in London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A considerable part of the summer you were at Margate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know about these things are, that they were in your shop at some time or other? - A. I swear that this piece of Irish has been stolen out of my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that was not stolen out of your shop in your absence? - A. I will; I have examined my books.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear, that in you absence, it has been the uniform conduct to put down every article in the hurry of business? - A. We do not put down every quarter of a yard, but they are put down sundries; and I have looked, and there is not twenty shillings in sundries put down.</p>
               <p>FRANCES BARRY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I live at No. 10, Artillery street: The prisoner came to lodge with me about the beginning of August; the young woman took the lodgings, I did not see the young man for two days; she took them in the name of Fish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring any goods with her, or any property? - A.Nothing but what she brought in an handkerchief; the trunk had been about six or seven weeks in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was full or empty? - A. I have reason to think it came from the trunk-maker's shop to our house; after that, this young man frequently came of an evening, and at two, three, and four o'clock, on Sunday mornings; she made up this gown while she was in my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You believed them to be man and wife; they cohabited together as man and wife? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long before had you seen the handkerchiefs? - A. I missed the Bank-notes on Wednesday, so I looked if I had lost any thing else, and the same day, I missed the neckerchiefs.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure he said finely darned? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether Mrs. Baines was a washer-woman? - A. I understand she took in mangling. (They were deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

               <p>Q. The letter F would do for any other person's name as well as your's? - A. Yes; but there were two initial letters to my linen; I did not like two letters, and I scratched one out, and there is a mark of it being scratched out.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did they appear to be recently killed? - A. Yes. They were warm; I sent for Wild, the constable of the parish, and secured him; I charged him with it, and he told me, that what he had done, was through distressed circumstances, and I told him I was very sorry for it; I thought from that he had a very large family, but on enquiry, I find he had but one child.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q.You say you did not perceive he was drunk the first time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.But he was the second time; now do you mean to say that he had been out long enough to have got drunk? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.How long have you been in the habit of frequenting this public-house? - A.Some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a person of the name of Mackley? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He had a sudden death, had not be? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was hanged, was not he, for the murder of Mr. Fryer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Clinch, did not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for him to have taken this pot without your seeing him? - A.It might be possible.</p>
               <p>Q. It was just possible, if you shut your eyes, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not if you did not shut your eyes? - A. No. he could not.</p>
               <p>Q.Then as soon as the men came in the second time, you poured your pint into the quart pot? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What might that be for? - A.Because I had some other liquor in it, and did not choose to drink out of two different pots.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you, or some of your comrades, been playing tricks with that man, pulling his coat, and telling him he must give you some beer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not tell him, if he did not give you something, you would play a trick upon him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did not one of your company put the pot in his pocket? - A.No.</p>

               <p>JAMES HENSHAW sworn. - I keep a public-house in Skinner-street; me last witness told me the prisoner had taken a pint pot; I went after him but could not find him; a little while afterwards the last witness informed me he had taken another pint pot.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see the prisoner return? - A. Yes, I did; I immediately got up, and the prisoner was going out, he wished me a good night; I told him I believed he had got something belonging to me, and I stopped him, and took him into the parlour, I sent for the watchman, and the watchman said he could not search him; Sapwell, the officer, then came, and searched him, he found a pint pot in his pocket, and the key of his room, which is in Lamballey, in Bishopsgate-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the day closed? - A. No, it was not, it was rather dusk; I passed two men together, one a great deal taller than the other; and a few yards further, a third man; they were on foot at that time; I did not see the fourth, which I say was Bradley, but instantly as we had passed them, they must have returned upon us, for somebody came up immediately and laid hold of the horse, they all came by the side of the chaise; I was going to drive on, when one of them stepped his foot upon the chaise-step; as he got up to me, another immediately got up on Mrs. Brown's side; a third got across the shafts, behind the horse, and presented a pistol, while the fourth was at the horse's head; the one on my side had no pistol; the man on the other side was presenting a pistol at Mrs. Brown's breast all the time; the man on my side unbuttoned my coat, and felt on both sides, and in my inside pockets, for my pocket-book, and my watch; he demanded my money, and felt my small clothes, he felt that there was money and notes in my left hand breeches-pocket; the cash was, six guineas, I think, and six half-guineas, two two pound notes, and a one pound note; then he felt that there was something more in my right hand pocket, he demanded that, which was silver, and I gave it him all; the other on the other side, demanded the money of Mrs. Brown; the man on the shafts only held the pistol while the others robbed us; Mrs. Brown gave them all the silver she had, and they demanded her cloak, "your cloak,"Ma'am;" I said, my brave fellows, do not treat us ill, I will give you all the money that I have; we gave them all, and they did not take the cloak; then they got down, and told us we might go on, and they would not hurt us.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they dressed? - A. They appeared to have all great coats and crapes.</p>
               <p>Q.What hats had they? - A.They had all flapped hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was the one that you thought was Bradley? - A. The fourth man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that it was Bradley? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060047"/>A. I have not, nor never had, from the moment I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife was ill in consequence of it afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Bradley was bailed, and now comes surrendering to take his trial? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you have not a doubt, as to Bradley being the person? - A. I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. The persons that robbed you had crapes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you could not see their faces? - A. I saw the face of him that looked at me, when he took the money.</p>
               <p>Q. So as to distinguish the features? - A. I really thought it was Bradley, from the features, for it was double over his nose, and single below.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you said before, upon your oath, that the only means you had of knowing him, was, by his voice? - A. No; I knew him personally, as well as any man in England.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not said so before upon oath, in your examination at Bow-street? - A. I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you did not say that at Bow-street? - A. I do not recollect that I said any such words.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear you did not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This much, however, you will insist upon, that there was a crape over the whole face? - A. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you, at that hour of the night, undertake to swear, with a crape over his face, that you could distinguish the features of any man? - A. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, at that late hour of the night, with a crape over the face, could you, by that light, distinguish the features of a man through that crape? - A.Certainly, I might distinguish him from another man, knowing the stature and features of the man, it is possible to see features.</p>
               <p>Q. You may see flesh, but not features; where was the crape double? - A. Over his forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet, through the double crape, you could see his features? - A. I know him as well as I do any man in England.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you prosecute that young man till you were served with a copy of a writ, and an action for slander? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, three days after you had been served with a copy of a writ, you instituted this prosecution? - A. I do not know to a day; for I did not think any thing about the writ.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the robbery, it was circulated throughout Hounslow town, that Bradley was the man - did he not wait upon you, and proffer to satisfy you by reference to witnesses, that it was impossible he could be the man? - A. He said, he could bring witnesses.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he not refer you to the persons? - A. I told him I was confident he was the man, and should say so to the latest day I had to live.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he not refer you to those witnesses? - A. He said, he could prove he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who they were? - A. I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Indeed you are exposing yourself most miserably-did he say by whom he could prove that he was not the man? - A. I cannot tell that he mentioned any name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that upon your oath? - A. I do not recollect that he did tell me any names; he said, he was at Cranford-bridge, and that he could bring witnesses; he said, he was drinking with some post-boys, or horse-keepers, or something of that sort, I don't recollect who.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he mention any names? - A. To the best of my recollection he did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But, surely, after the man told you, you having been robbed, that he would produce witnesses, and mentioned their names, one would have thought you would be very glad to have had it cleared, I think I should not have forgot it? - A. I do not think he did mention any names.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that he did not mention any? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. As he did not refer you to any name, how came you to go to Hawkins the coachman? - A. He did not tell me about Hawkins to my recollection, but I spoke about the robbery the instant I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he not tell you of the man that had driven him from Hounslow to Cranford-bridge that night? -(Hesitates.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Now be cool, and give a direct answer, did he mention Hawkins to you? - A. I do not know that he did at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon your oath, will you say he did not? - A. I asked Hawkins.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Now do answer the question, you are disgracing yourself most miserably, it is a plain question-did he mention Hawkins or not? - A.Upon my soul, I cannot say whether he did or not, if I was to die this moment.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask Hawkins? - A. A neighbour of mine said he went down by such a coach, that same night.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Now tell me, after being reminded of it, how came you to ask Hawkins? - A. I cannot say, if I was to die this moment.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Never mind dying at present, that may be a very serious question by and by, upon your oath, did he mention Hawkins? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe he did? - A. He might, probably.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060048"/>Court. Q. Why might he probably mention Hawkins? - A. I suppose he might mention Hawkins.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do not you believe he did? - A. I really cannot say; I would not say it for all the world; I cannot say it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he did? - A. I cannot answer you whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean to say, you have no belief upon the subject? - A. I would believe right things, but I cannot say what I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, just now, it seemed probable, do you believe that he did mention it? - A. As I said before, if I was to drop down dead, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me an answer, one way or the other, do you or not, believe that he mentioned Hawkins's name, and refered you to him? - A. No, he did not; I do not think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you are sure he did not? - A. I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Court. I think the Jury will hardly depend on a man who gives such evidence as this; for the sake of the prisoner, you may go on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I thank your Lordship. - Q. Was George Such, Bush's ostler, at Hounslow, present when that young man made this application to you? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. As you do not recollect Hawkin's name, do you recollect Goddard's name, of Cranford-bridge? - A. I asked Mr. Goddard.</p>
               <p>Court. For shame, is that an answer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Upon your oath, did he not at that time mention Goddard, of Cranford-bridge, to you? - A. He said he was there at Cranford-bridge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I thought you mentioned just now that he mentioned no names? - A. He said he was at Cranford-bridge.</p>
               <p>Court. Oh fie.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Did you not make enquiries in consequence of the reference of this young man? - A. I did ask Mr. Goddard about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you again distinctly-In consequence of the reference made you by this young man, did you not make enquiry of Hawkins and Goddard, and the servants, at Cranford-bridge? - A. I did not ask any of the servants.</p>
               <p>Q. It was about the eleven mile-stone that this transaction took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is about a mile and a half from Cranford-bridge? - A. About a mile and a quarter, I cannot say to a mile and a half or a mile and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know it to be more than a mile and a quarter? - A. I have not measured it.</p>
               <p>Re examined by the Court. Q. You asked Goddard and Hawkins? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask them? - A.Because I had heard that he had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to them in consequence of the prisoner having mentioned their names? - A. I cannot say whether he mentioned Hawkins or Goddard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention either of them? - A. He said he went to Cranford-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he mention neither? - A. I believe he did mention Goddard or Mr. Goddard, or Cranford-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention Goddard? - A. I cannot say whether he did or not; I believe he did mention Goddard.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why did you tell me he mentioned no names? - A. I cannot say particularly whether he said he was at Mr. Goddard's, or at Cranford-bridge.</p>
               <p>Mrs. BROWN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were coming from Windsor to Hounslow, do you know any thing of the persons who attacked you? - A. I cannot say I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Under this evidence I certainly do feel it too much to call upon a Jury, when a man's life is at stake; from the beginning I have had my doubts whether it was such a case as was fit to be supported.</p>
               <p>Court. The prosecutor has acted very abominably, and I could say something further, but I will not; the character of this young man will certainly stand as fair as ever it has done at any one period of time.</p>

               <p>Q.Did he remain in the lodging with her all this time? - A.

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060052"/>Q. Do you know Taylor and Finch? - A. I know Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from Nixon, whether, before this transaction, he was acquainted with Smith, or Taylor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long he had been acquainted with them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had been acquainted with them any time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were Smith and Taylor? - A. I have had them in custody several times for thieving. In consequence of some information that I received, I went to Nixon's house, on Sunday, the 7th of August, 1796, upon a charge of another robbery; he keeps the Swan and Pike, at Enfield Lock, in the county of Middlesex; I found there these three pieces of muslin under the bed, between the bed and bed-tick; I asked him how he came by them; at that time he did not tell, for they were under the maid servant's bed; we searched the house for other things, and we brought him and a man of the name of Akenhead, who was tried at Chelmsford, upon the charge I went down upon, and executed; Nixon gave evidence against him; they were brought up to Bow-street, and on Monday, he was examined; I do not recollect that any thing passed in the way to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when Mrs. Gibbons was taken into custody? - A. I was at Peterborough at that time; I went down there by the direction of Nixon, where Smith and Taylor were gone to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. This direction was a part of the examination? - A. I believe it was at the beginning of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. He did not say a word till he was admitted an evidence? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Was he not in the act of giving information? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. In consequence of what passed, did you find Gipsey Tom? - A. I did, at the Fighting Cocks, at Peterborough, on the 9th of August, in the morning; I found Taylor also, but he made his escape; when Fugion and I took Gipsey Tom, he searched him; Fugion and I went together; in his pocket was the key of a room door; I searched a room in which he had slept, and there I found forty-five pieces of muslin, in a pair of saddle-bags; we brought Gipsey Tom to town, and he was tried at Hertford.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with Nixon, since he gave his information at Bow-street, respecting this robbery? - A. Yes, frequently; he said, that Smith, Taylor and Finch brought the whole of the muslins there, I forget the exact number that he said; it was one hundred and something; he said, he had brought them to his house, at Enfield-Lock, and that it was a very rainy morning, and that Smith sent his (Nixon's) son to Mrs. Gibbons; that she came down, and the pieces were told out to her; he said, he saw them told out; he said they were put in a sack, all but forty-five pieces, which were Gipsey Tom's, and he kept his part; Gipsey Tom said, he knew how to make as much of them as Mrs. Gibbons, for he was a pedlar, and travelled with a licence; he said, Mrs. Gibbons was gone away, and one of them said, fetch her back; she came back, and she took the sack away with what was in it, which contained Taylor and Finch's share, but not Smith's; with respect to the three pieces that I found concealed in his maid's bed, he said, one was given to him by the other two; two were to be sent to Finch's wife, or to Finch's house, I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You say this was private conversation between you and him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did it take place? - A. Many times; we had been at Hertford and Chelmsford, and other places, and I had given him good advice to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose? - A. That if he did not tell the truth it would fall upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. You know at that time he was admitted an evidence for the Crown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you know also that all this had been taken down upon oath, at Bow-street? - A. Yes; I told him so, that what he had said at Bow-street, was taken down, and sent to this Court, and if he did not stick to that, it would fall upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had heard what had been taken down at Bow-street? - A. Yes; I heard the evidence read.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him something like this, you at Bow-street, said, so and so? - A. No; I said, you know what you swore at Bow-street, if you do not stick to the truth, it may fall upon you.</p>
               <p>Q. Understand me, and stop before you answer, we know what he swore at Bow-street; you have seen him frequently, and talked about the business, was it not in this way, you have said so and so, stick to that, or it will fall upon you? - A. I have repeatedly said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did he shortly say, that is the truth? - A.Just so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This conversation you talk of having had with Nixon since he was at Bow-street; have those facts that you have now related been related by him since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Do you mean that he has told the whole story over again to you? - A. Yes; as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. At those times you always exhorted him in that way, at the introduction of such a conversation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. That it would be better if he did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060053"/>stick to the truth, and if he did not, it would fall upon him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He was, at that time, not charged as a criminal, but admitted as a witness? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Gipsey Tom took his share away? - A. Yes; they were divided in three.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these three were no part of the forty-five? - A. Not of the forty-five that were at Peterborough.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LAVENDER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk at Bow-street; I was present when Mr. Nixon was examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Since the examination have you had any conversation with him relative to this? - A. I have had many conversations with him since his examination was taken, but I cannot recollect the particulars.</p>
               <p>Q.Nixon was admitted a witness against Gipsey Tom, and was afterwards admitted an evidence against Mrs. Gibbons? - A. He certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me if you know that letter? - A.It is a letter I received from the prisoner, Nixon, it is a letter addressed to Nixon, from Smith. (It is read, addressed Mr. Nixon, at the Swan and Pike, Enfield, Marsh, Hertfordshire, dated Peterborough, August 1st, signed

             sworn. - The last witness is my servant: Last Saturday week, the last witness said there was somebody robbing Mr. Field's warehouses; I went to the counting-house door, and saw a man with a bag upon his back, moving very quick; Thomas said, that is the man, I first saw him about twenty-five yards from Mr. Field's warehouses; as soon as I saw him, I cried, stop thief; the man immediately dropped the bag; I did not see his face, he had a blue wrapping great coat on; I cannot swear to the man; he ran along the middle of the street, and I after him, crying, stop thief; he turned up Fish-street-hill, I then lost fight of him; when he made the angle, I followed him as fast I could, and saw the same man in the middle of the street on Fish-street-hill, running as fast as he could; I then repeated the cry of stop thief; when he had nearly got opposite the Monument, he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man that was stopped the same man that you saw near your own house? - A. I cannot say that, he had very much the same external appearance; the patrol stopped him, his name is Cork, and we brought him back; we searched Mr. Field's warehouses all over, to see if there was any body else concealed; we saw another bag packed in the same way as this close to the door on the inside, ready to be taken away, and at the upper end of the warehouses, two other bags packed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went into that house to get change for half-a-guinea, on the 6th of November, about twelve o'clock; Mrs. Field was not at home; I stopped about ten minutes till she came in, she said, she could give me change, if I took half-a-crownsworth of halfpence; I said, they were no object, if they were good; I said, suppose, mistress, you give me eight shillings and sixpence, and two shillingsworth of halfpence; I laid the half-guinea down, and counted my money, and I went to the orderly-room, I had just come off a marching party, with a deserter; Mr. Field came down in a great passion to the orderly-room about it, I told him, as soon as I had settled my business with the major, I would go with him, but he took me away to Queen-square Office; I never defrauded any body in my life to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, and four other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When you left the house at nine o'clock, it was quite dark, I suppose? - A. Yes, it was; I lost the things named in the indictment, (repeating them); the box-coat I have had ever since I have been with my master, which is not quite a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any bargain with your master, that you were to be answerable for them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The coat, waistcoat and breeches, had you had them a year? - A. Yes, nearly; all the rest belonged to me; the other things were all kept there ready to put on when I was going out; I never recovered any thing but one shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to be taken up? - A.I was coming down from my master's house, three weeks and three days after, I heard, in Cheyne-row, a cry of stop thief, and I ran down to the stable as fast as I could go; after I had got my stable-door open, I heard them run past the stable-door, just as I was trying to undo it; when I got it undone, they had stopped him, and were bringing him back again; when he was searched at the watch-house, he had got a shirt of mine upon his back; I said, before he was searched, I thought it was mine; I went up to Marlborough-street, and there I took notice of it; the constable has got it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You say it was three weeks after the time she burglary was committed, that the prisoner was apprehended? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you apprehended him, nothing was found upon him but this shirt, which you suppose was your's? - A. No; he was not searched till the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course, he might have got rid of it before the next day? - A. He might, no doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060057"/>Q. But he continued with this shirt on his back till he went to the Public office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing broke, except the box? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not make the stable fast when you went away? - A. Yes, as fast as I could make it.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you venture to swear that? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. And you thought you left it fast? - A. I know I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body left in the stable after you went out? - A.Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Galloway lives in Gower-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This stable is at the end of a garden? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you upon board wages? - A. No, I board in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he rent that stable? - A. No; it is his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not given it to you for you and your family to live in? - A.No; I have no family.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, after a certain length of time, the livery would have become your own? - A. Yes; if I had lived there a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it made for you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in his service? - A. Better than three quarters of a year, not quite a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any communication from the house to the stable, or do you go into the street? - A.There is a communication through the garden to the stables by one wall.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAVIOUR sworn. - I am servant to Barrington Bergen, Esq. On Sunday night, the 12th of November, I was going out, being a very foggy night, I took a lanthorn; going down the Mews, just as I got to the stable-door, there was the prisoner and two other men standing against my stable-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that near Mr. Galloway's? - A. I believe it is half a surlong from Mr. Galloway's; it is a street that runs across the Mews; I called out to know who they were, and what they were, but they did not answer me; I suspected they were thieves, and I went up to the next stable-door, and called the coachman; he got up, I told him, there were three thieves; I said, there goes two; he ran after them, I went after the prisoner at the bar; he was going down the Mews, I pursued him, and he was taken; I gave charge of the prisoner to the watchman; the next morning, I went with Brazier to see the prisoner; he said, he thought he knew the shirt that was upon the prisoner's back; I saw the shirt taken from him, and Brazier said it was his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You do not mean to swear that the prisoner at the bar was one of the three men? - A. Yes, I do; I held up my lanthorn to his face, and spoke to him; and he then ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was standing quietly, doing nothing, and you had the impudence to hold your candle and lanthorn to his face, and because he ran away, having done nothing to you, you charged the watch with him? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE ROMLEY sworn. - I am watch-house-keeper of Sr. Giles's: On the 12th of last month, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house; Brazier and Saviour came to the watch-house the next morning to see the prisoner at the bar; Brazier touched the frill of his shirt, and said, I think that is my shirt on your back; then I said to the prisoner, strip; he pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and I assisted in taking the shirt off his back, (produces it); I have kept it ever since; the prosecutor said the shirt was marked, and described the marks with the two first letters of his name; and when he looked at it, he said it was his.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the keepers of Bedlam; I know the prisoner very well, I have had twice the care of him, it was almost a twelvemonth last time, but he was very bad indeed a great part of the time; afterwards he got well and was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt, whether he was in a situation fit to be put there? - A. He was as bad as a man could be at times, both times that he was put in.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the father.) Had he at any time received any injury in his head? - A. Yes; his master at Cheshunt happened to hit him with a heel of a shoe, and made three marks of the nails in his head, and after that be was sent to Bedlam.</p>

             sworn. - I am assistant to Mr. Jeremy; the prisoner was our porter, he was taken to Bow-street on the evening of the 7th of November; on the morning of the 8th, I was desired to go up stairs with the prisoner, and another person, he opened his box, and there I found the goods named in the indictment, which are now in Court, they have been in our back shop ever since; I wrote my name upon the end of each of them that I might be able to swear to them again, (looks at them); all these articles were taken out of his box, I missed them, they exactly correspond with the number of yards in the indictment, I know we had the same patterns in the shop; all the printed callicos I can swear to, they have Mr. Jeremy's private mark upon them; and the handkerchiefs have Mr. Jeremy's private mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Are you a relation of Mr. Jeremy's? - A. Yes; a nephew.</p>
               <p>Q. Your's is a very considerable shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And a shop for fashionable articles? - A. If the ladies that come to the shop think them so, we are very well contented.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon do you put your private mark upon your articles, when they come into the shop? - A. The day they come in, if we have time, unless they are goods that Mr. Jeremy has printed himself, and they have his name upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, the private mark is delivered to your customers with the goods? - A.Sometimes we cut the private mark off.</p>
               <p>Q.And the same patterns you have delivered out to customers before now? - A. I dare say we have.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not cut off your private mark? - A. Not always, it is not a rule with us.</p>
               <p>Q. There were more of the same patterns in the shop? - A. There might be another part of the piece.</p>
               <p>Q. A part of the same piece you might have sold before? - A. It is not impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you have not sold some of the same pattern of the pieces you have produced? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I take it you might have sold it? - A. It is impossible in our line of business to know all these things.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible for you to know exactly, till you count up at the end of the day, how much you have sold of each piece, you having a very large business? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell at the end of the next day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How often do you take stock? - A. Once a year.</p>
               <p>Q.Is there any thing in any of these patterns, that you can tell me you had sold no part of the pieces to which they belong? - A. Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a very uncommon pattern, is it not? - A. Not so uncommon but there may be more in London.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing particular in the pattern, is there? - A. No; it has two sag ends to it, therefore we have never sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with Mr. Jeremy? - A. I came to him in June last.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that time, have you seen but one piece of that pattern? - A. Yes; more than that, two or three, perhaps.</p>

               <p>Q.When did you last take stock? - A. In July, 1790.</p>
               <p>Q.So long ago as July, 1796? - A. I have within theses three months taken stock, I think it was the seventh of October.</p>

             sworn. - I am a gangsman: we take care of merchant's property; and what deficiency there may be, we must make it good.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you responsible for the sugar in the cellar the last witness spoke of? - A. Yes. There is no communication with the cellar but through this slap; it had been wrenched, and the man must have been there all night, for he could not get out when the man locked up the gates.</p>
               <p>Q.When had you last seen the cellar safe? - A. Not for two or three days before; that cellar was fast, and nobody goes into it but me; there was but one hogshead in that cellar that was drawn, and we do not go there for a fortnight together, sometimes; the next morning, when I came, after this happened, I missed two hundred weight and three quarters; we found a quarter of a hundred in a bag in the cellar. (The constable produced the bags and the sugar).</p>
               <p>Blake. This is the sort of sugar that was in the cellar; all the bags that we found had had sugar in them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went down to ease myself; I was very much in liquor, I did not see this place broke; I fell down the cellar, and there I lay as I fell, for three hours.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Spinney). Was he in liquor? - A. No; he was perfectly sober.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the window safe before you heard the glass fall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen it before? - A. About before an hour, or perhaps more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any glass about it? - A. I saw the glass in the window when his hand was in the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Was there any body else in the shop but yourself? - A. There was a little boy, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. You can see into the shop from the street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a light in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore he must have seen every body that was in the shop? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if the prisoner had broke your window with intent to steal, he might have an opportunity of running away, upon seeing you come out to the door? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. The foot-way is always very dirty, slippery, and narrow? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not happened continually, that people slip down and break the windows? - A. Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. These things were not in his hand, but upon the ground? - A. They were in his hand when I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not swear that before the Magistrate? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body had fell against the window, these things would have fell into the street? - A. No they would not, they were lying upon the window-board.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they an inch from the glass? - A. I cannot swear how far they were from the glass; they were upon the window-board, I am sure it is impossible they could have fell out.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this is charged as a burglary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the County are to pay you forty pounds, if the prisoner is convicted? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard such a thing? - A. Yes; I have heard such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect it? - A. I expect a share of it, if he is convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have taken you some time to have come round to the shop-door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he had abundant time to have run away before you could have come to the door to catch him? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Warner any partner? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a patrole belonging to St. Sepuichre's: I was going up Snow-hill, the prisoner was then in custody in the shop; a charge was given to us, and we searched his pockets, and found some watch-materials in his pocket, which proved to be his own property; he went very quietly with us to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. Was he in liquor, or not? - A. I cannot say whether he was or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he appear to be in liquor? - A. He seemed to me to be quite sober.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Upon your oath, was not the man drunk? - A. He did not seem so to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was he sober enough to get up and run away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Robert Warner.) Q. Did he appear to you to be in liquor? - A. A little, but not much; he seemed rather heavy about the eyes, and said he was in liquor; I am an officer in St. Sepulchre's parish, and I took charge of the prisoner, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went out on the Monday after my work, I met with an acquaintance of mine, who said, trade was so slack that he was going to Coventry; it was about four o'clock when I met him, and I staid till eight with him; when I came out of the house, I found myself very much gone in liquor, and upon Snow-hill a man laid hold of me; when I was taken I had my work in my pocket, and the key of my box; I was going home to my father's.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - On the 3d of December I apprehended the prisoner, in the parish of St. John's, Wapping; I had heard of his being transported, and I thought he was come back before his time; I asked him if he had any thing to shew why he was at liberty before his time; and he said, no, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A Trinity-officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any reward in this case? - A. I never had any; I have heard that there is.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his answer when you asked him how he came at liberty? - A. He said, he had been taken prisoner in his passage to South Wales, and carried by force to a French prison; and he said, he had made his escape from there to America, and from there he had come to England.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire whether it was true? - A. No; I did not know that that was a duty incumbent upon me; I heard that he had been here five or six weeks, I did not enquire any further; I took him to the office in Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. In 1795, I was pardoned upon condition of serving his Majesty King George, in the sixtieth regiment of foot, to go in the capacity of a soldier; I embarked the 14th of April, 1795; I had the misfortune to be taken by the French, and carried into Guadaloupe; they wanted to force me to serve against my country, and rather than be a traitor to my country I was determined to get my liberty, or die; here are two shots in my neck that I got as I was making my escape.</p>

             sworn. - I was standing at my door; there were three men at work in the warehouse, one of them brought a piece of rope from the middle of the shop, and laid it down by the street-door; after he had laid down the rope, the prisoner was standing outside the door, and he took it up; I followed him about twenty yards, and stopped him; I told him he had stole the rope, I took him by the collar, and he threw the rope down, and then hawled me down; I got up, and took hold of the rope, and called out stop thief, and he was taken. (Produces the rope).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose property that rope is? - A. Yes, Mr. Scofield's.</p>
               <p>Scofield. This is my rope, to the best of my knowledge, I had cut off several fathom the day before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Scott was not present when I was taken.</p>
               <p>Scott. I was the man that took him, with the rope upon him; only my being in another dress, very likely he does not know me.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q.Perhaps you were at the bar of this Court? - A. Yes, I was.</p>

               <p>Q. What trade were you carrying on at that time? - A. No illegal trade, nor no practice.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you charged with, it was very wrong I know? - A. If my Lord says it is lawful for me to tell you, I will.</p>

               <p>Q. Not long, though it seems - may-hap you have lodgers in your house at this time? - A. How should I know at this time in the evening - brow-beating me in this way, after I have been robbed and stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me a direct answer, have you any lodgers in your house? - A. No, I have not.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you never at the bar but that time, when you and your wife were tried for robbing a countryman of Bank-notes in your house? - A. You will recollect it was by Clerkenwell-green that he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Oh, I beg your pardon, you took him upon the green to frisk him, did you? - A. The plain story is, I have been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q.Let us see whether you are or not, that plain sort of man-how many times have you been at the bar of this court? - A. That is not material.</p>
               <p>Q. Oh, yes, it is, very material, you may depend upon it? - A. I should be glad to know when you will have done with me.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you would, but I have not done with you yet? - A. You will not get any thing out of me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been at the bar of this Court? - A. I shall not tell you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then I must apply to his Lordship.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp Q. But you must? - A. Why, I have been here twice, and if I had not been acquitted, I should not have been here now.</p>
               <p>Q.Then what did you mean by telling the Jury you had been there but once? - A. You want to expose me.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it always been your good luck to be acquitted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round a little to the right - do you know Mr. Townsend? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a very remarkable man - upon your oath, do you mean to swear that you have never been convicted? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that, in the face of Mr. Townsend? - A. Yes - the fact is, I have lost my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not you been convicted? - A. I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not you been convicted? - A. If you talk to me for an hour, it is of no use.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems to be of very little use, for your character is sufficiently exposed? - A. That is very immaterial to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you never been convicted? - A. To please you, I will say, I have been convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, you have indicted this man at the bar for a burglary, did not you? - A.I know the man is indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that you have indicted him for a burglary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps, as you have been here before, you know the slang phrase a little? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know, that for a burglary, there is a little trifling reward of forty pounds? - A. I never had an instance of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had the luck of it yet, and you won't to-day, I promise you-You never heard of a reward upon the conviction of a man for burglary? - A. I must be stupid if I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You came here for the public good, no doubt? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM GOODING sworn. - Examined by Mr. Ward. On the 26th of October last, the prisoner came to me, between six and eight o'clock; I had often seen him before, and dealt with him a great many times; he came to buy a peck of oysters, the price was half-a-crown; he gave me a straight new half-guinea, and I gave him change out of it; in a short time after, he came a second time, for another peck of oysters, they were natives, the price was seven shillings and sixpence, and he gave me another new half-guinea, which was crooked; I gave him three shillings in change; and he came again a third time, for another peck of oysters, at half-a-crown, he gave me another new crooked half-guinea, and I gave him eight shillings out of that; he came again, a fourth time, for another peck of common oysters; he gave me a half-crown piece, which was a bad one, I returned it to him again, and he gave me another half-crown in the room of it, immediately, which was good; I cannot be certain whether it was two shillings ans sixpence or half-a-crown; I saw nothing more of him, but I went about eight o'clock to breakfast, and then we always take an account of our money; upon looking over them, I found three half-guineas that were bad.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how much money you had first in the morning? - A. No; we always begin afresh in the morning, with an empty bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much you had at eight o'clock? - A. I cannot say, it might be two or three pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How many new half-guineas had you? - A.Only three; I had but two more, and those were old ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that these three half-guineas were the half-guineas you had taken of the prisoner? - A. I knew them directly, when I came to overhawl them again; I immediately went round Billingsgate, to look for him, and saw him standing upon the quay; I went to him, and asked him how he came to give me so much bad money, and he said, he had given me none; I told him, he certainly had; the oyster-meters came up, and Mr. Parrot, an oyster-porter, who searched him, had found a bad half-crown upon him; and then they sent for an officer, and took him away; I saw a bad half-crown found upon him, and some silver and gold, and a Bank-note; I do not know how much; the bad half-crown was found in a paper by itself; the officer can give a better account of what other money he had than I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the half-crown that was found upon him, was the half-crown that he had offered you before? - A. It was very much like it; there was no other half-crown found upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner is what is called a bobber? - A. Yes; people who do not know the way to go down, employ these men to buy them for them, and they give them a penny a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there was nothing wonderful in his comeing to you for a second, third, fourth, or tenth peck? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a pretty brisk market that day? - A.No great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold a great many oysters to other people, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All the money you receive, you put indiscriminately into your bag? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This poor fellow has been long employed upon the quay, you had no suspicion of him, and therefore you put them into your bag? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this half-crown in the paper in his breeches pocket, or his fob? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say that he had put it there, wrapped up in a paper, because he would not offer it to anybody? - A. He might, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to breakfast, and when you returned, you found him at his work upon the quay? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he time to shift any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He had while you were gone to breakfast? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. But not after he was apprehended? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many half-guineas had you taken in the course of that morning? - A. Only five.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell where you got the other two from? - A. One of them I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the bag yourself, or did you deliver it to your partner? - A. No, I did not; we count the money and put it down upon a piece of paper, to see how much we have taken.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known this man upon the quay many years? - A. I have not come there above a year.</p>
               <p>Court Q. Are you certain that the prisoner is the man you took the three half-guineas of? - A. Yes; I am.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PARROTT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I measure oysters for the meters: I was coming up the ladder, and Mr. Gooding, and a meter, had got the prisoner talking to him about some bad half-guineas; the prisoner said he did not give them to him; I searched him, and found this bad half-crown wrapped up in a piece of paper, in his fob.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the rest of the money you found about him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060072"/>good? - A. I believe it was; I returned it to him; I kept the half-crown till I got to the Lord-Mayor, and then it was given to the constable, Giles Bolland.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You found the half-crown in his fob? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he has been a long time on the quays? - A. Yes; two or three days one week, and two or three days another.</p>

            , you were tried in July last, upon an indictment for maliciously and advisedly endeavouring to seduce Matthew Lowe, he being a person in the King's land service, from his duty and allegiance. There was a Second Count for endeavouring to incite the said Matthew Lowe to commit an act of mutiny, and to commit traiterous and mutinous practices.</p>
               <p>This indictment was laid in the very words of the Act of the 37th of his present Majesty, chap. 17. Upon a full and impartial trial, you were convicted of the offence, but your sentence was respited, on account of your Counsel taking several objections in arrest of judgment, which were to be decided before that sentence could be passed, and I am now to deliver the opinion of the judges upon that case, which has been argued before them very learnedly by your Counsel, before all the Judges in the Exchequer Chamber in Westminster-Hall.</p>
               <p>In this case, three objections were taken in arrest of judgment, First, that the indictment does not state in what manner, and by what means you did endeavour to seduce, to entice, and to stir up Matthew Lowe from his duty and allegiance. The second objection was, that it should have been averred in the indictment, that you knew that Matthew Lowe was a soldier. The third objection was, that the second Count of the indictment comprehended the other two, that is an endeavour to entice, and stir up to commit mutiny, and to stir up, to commit traiterous and mutinous practices. These were the several objections in arrest of judgment, and the Judges have delivered their opinions upon those objections. The first is, that the indictment does not state in what manner, and by what means you endeavoured to seduce, entice, and stir up Matthew Lowe, from his duty and his allegiance.</p>
               <p>In the argument of this case, on your behalf, this was spoken of as a supposed analogy to the case of false tokens. The answer to this objection is, that the endeavour to seduce, to entice, and to stir up, though it is a conclusion from an infinite variety of facts and circumstances, is but a conclusion of fact, which in itself admitted of no definition or description, that the fact is fully expressed by the mere word endeavour, and can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060073"/>only be expressed by that word, like the words conspire, maintain, aid, and abet, which in indictments for conspiracies sufficiently express the offence charged in the indictment, without circumlocution, and without shewing by what manner, and by what means the conspiracy, maintaining, aiding, and abetting, and so forth, was produced. We are therefore of opinion (and there was no diffension among the Judges) that this objection is not sufficient to arrest the judgment.</p>
               <p>The second objection was, that it should have been averred in the indictment, that the prisoner knew that 
               <persName id="o17971206-1-person572">
                  Matthew

                  </persName>
             was a soldier. The argument urged by your Counsel, in support of this objection, that the prisoner could not be guilty of the offence charged, unless he knew that the man was a soldier, suggests an answer to the objection that is necessarily included in the charge itself, of endeavouring; but a full and satisfactory answer to the Judges, is, that the word advisedly is in the indictment, which is at least equivalent to the word scienter, and several cases were cited to shew that the word advisedly was sufficient without any circumlocutions therefore, we are of opinion, that this objection cannot hold.</p>
               <p>The third objection is, that in the second Count in this indictment, are comprehended two distinct offences. It will be found a sufficient answer to this objection, that the charge might have been branched into several offences, the whole may be no more than parts of one fact of endeavouring, which must be stated in the manner in which it is stated; but in the circumstances in which you now stand convicted upon the first Count of the indictment, to which no sufficient objection has been takes, and upon which, judgment must be pronounced against you, it is not absolutely necessary, that the Judges should have decided upon this last objection.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, we are of opinion that there is no sufficient ground to arrest the judgment, and that, consequently, sentence should pass upon you.</p>

               <p>The Jury found Parkes guilty of signing the note in question, and you of uttering it, knowing it to have been forged, with intent to defraud

            , is a real name; that it was not a forgery in Parkes signing the name of Brown, with Brown's consent; that if Parkes was not guilty of forgery, Brown could not be-guilty of uttering, knowing it to be forged; that the representations of Brown ought not to affect Parkes, who was not acquainted with the circumstances under which he uttered the note.</p>
               <p>With respect to you, the questions are simply two, the first is, whether the note mentioned in this case was a forgery, and if it was, whether you uttered the note knowing it to be forged; for, undoubtedly, there was no evidence at all to go to the Jury that you forged it yourself; therefore the questions are, whether the note was forged, and whether you uttered it knowing it to be forged.</p>
               <p>Now as to the first question, the definition of forgery is the false making a note, or other instrument, with intent to defraud; the false making may consist either in putting the name of a man upon a note, who does not exist, or of a man who does, as was the case of Bolland in the year 1772, and was the case of Tust in the year 1777; or putting the name of a man who does exist, without his consent, and uttering it as his, with intent to defraud. The present is among the first class of cases. A note is produced, dated Ruighton, Salop, supposed to be drawn by one Thomas Brown for himself and Company, by which he promises to pay five guineas to the bearer, at Messrs. Down, Thornton, and Co. bankers, London. The note is found in your hands, and you paid it away for a valuable consideration to Hulls, the shoe-maker, not as your own note, but as the note of a brother of that name. Now, no such brother exists; then it is the false making of a note of a non-existent person; and it is equally a forgery, whether the non-existing person is described as bearing the name of the person uttering the note. or another name, as a man of the name of 
               <persName id="o17971206-2-person577">

            , uttering a forged note, describing it as the name of another, is equally guilty of a forgery, as if he had uttered one signed by any other name whatever. This is an answer to the first objection that the name is your name.</p>

               <p>The second objection is, that it was no forgery to sign the name of

             with Brown's consent; the answer is short-no such person existing, there could be no such consent; I say, no such person existing, for the Brown, whose name is to the note, according to that note, was resident at Ruighton, Salop, was a correspondent of Down, Thornton, and Company, and had money in their hands. Now there is no such person resident at Ruighton; there is no such person of that name who was a correspondent of Down, Thornton, and Company, and no person of that name who had money in their hands; therefore no person appears to exist, such as was described by you; on the contrary, as far as the evidence goes, it appears that no such person did exist; and your obvious intention was to get by fraud a quantity of boots and shoes for this note, from a man of the name of Hulls; therefore this, according to the true definition of forgery, is the false making of a note, in the name of

               <p>The only remaining question is, whether you uttered it, knowing it to be forged; that you uttered it, is proved by Hulls; that you knew it to be forged, all the evidence is strong to prove, or else why did you say it was your brother's draft - that he was an agent in the 17th regiment - that you should see your brother presently - that the note was to be paid out of the money lodged in the hands of Down, Thornton, and Free, when no money was there lodged - and why did you appoint Hulls to meet you at three o'clock in the afternoon at Mrs. Drummonds, No. 10, Hart-street, Bloomsbury, no such person existing. These, however, were facts for the consideration of the Jury; the Jury have taken them into consideration, and they have, as it seems to all the learned Judges, drawn the right and proper conclusion - their conclusion is, that you are guilty; but it is said, that if Parkes is not guilty of forgery, you cannot be guilty of uttering, knowing it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060074"/>be forged. The count, in the indictment, does not charge you with uttering the note, knowing it to be forged by Parkes, but only knowing it to be forged; therefore whoever it might be forged by, you uttering it, knowing it to be forged, are guilty of the offence charged, and the opinion of all the Judges is, that you must receive the judgment of the law</p>

            . cap. 47. sec. 15. - The 15th section of that Act has these words: "That from and after the 1st of October, 1784, if any officer or officers of his Majesty's Navy, or in the service of the Customs or Excise, being on shore, or going on board, or being on board, or returning from on board any ship, boat, or vessel, within the limits of any of the ports of this kingdom, or within four leagues from the coasts thereof, shall be hindered, opposed, obstructed, or assaulted in the due execution of his or their office, or duty, by any person or persons whatsoever;" then it says, "such persons may be taken up, and conveyed before a Justice of the Peace, and if convicted, is to suffer the punishment assigned in the statute." This is obviously intended to prevent smuggling, and in every respect protect the revenue; it says, "The laws are not sufficient to prevent the clandestine importation of prohibited goods, and goods liable to the payment of duty; it recites, that the mischief had increased to the great prejudice of the revenue, to the detriment of the fair trader, and to the endangering of the lives of the officers of the revenue acting in the due execution of their duty." - Then there are a number of clauses all made for the purpose of increasing the revenue, and benefiting the fair trader; at the end of those clauses comes the 15th section, (which is the subject of our enquiry) for protecting the officer in the execution of his duty, and punishing such persons as are guilty of obstructing them. The persons to be protected, are any officer on board his Majesty's Navy, or in the service of the Customs, or of the Excise. The these words, "Being on shore, or going on board, or being on board, or returning from on board any ship, boat, or vessel, within the limits of any of the ports of this kingdom, or within four leagues from the coasts thereof." And the time when they are not to be obstructed, is when they are in the due execution of their duty.</p>
               <p>The first question then is, whether this officer was on shore within the meaning of the statute. It is said, that the Act was not meant to be extended to officers in the execution of their duty anywhere on land, but that on shore, according to this statute was to be confined to officers of the Customs, in the execution of their duty near the sea, and to prevent smuggling, that is, that it was to prevent offences against one part of the law, to secure the revenue by the customs, but that it did not meddle with that part of the law that secured the revenue by the Excise. But the Judges are all of them of opinion, that the general words in the enacting clause are not to be restrained, and that they are to be taken according to their general import, that the intention of the legislature was, that all officers on board the navy, in the Customs, or Excise, anywhere at land or on the sea, or within four leagues of the coast, are within the clause, when they are in the due execution of their duty, whether it is in preventing smuggling, or securing the duties upon soap, or other articles of excise, by which the public revenue may be increased, such is the natural import of the words, and any other construction would do violence to the words, and defeat the intention of the legislature who were in this act anxious to put an end to all the mischiefs that prejudiced the revenue, of which mischiefs the clandestine removal of soap is undoubtedly one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys as Counsel for the Crown, observed very properly, that the Excise is an inland duty on shore, and if it were not taken in the sense in which the Judges now give it, it would be extraordinary that Excise-officers should be mentioned at all; for the construction put upon the statute by the Counsel for the prisoner, makes it a protection for Custom-house-officers only, and not for Excise-officers. This seems a strong argument to prove, that in the use of the word shore, the legislature meant land generally, and to comprehend officers appointed to secure the payment of the inland duties, as well as of the customs.</p>
               <p>The only remaining question is, whether Mr. Whateley was in the execution of his duty. The answer is this, and it is a short one, that the soap duty is under the officers of Excise, that he was an officer of Excise, that this soap was forfeited, was on shore, was in the predicament of being illicitly removed, as an officer of Excise; he, together with those who were with him (for they were officers of Excise too) were bound to seize it, because, by the Act of Parliament it was forfeited; they were in the act of seizing, that is, they were in the act of executing their duty, they were obstructed by you and others in a most forcible, violent, and lawless manner; that obstruction is the very offence mentioned in the 15th section of this act, and is contained precisely in the charge in this indictment. The Judges are therefore of opinion, that you being convicted of this offence, are subject to such punishment as the Court may think fit.</p>
