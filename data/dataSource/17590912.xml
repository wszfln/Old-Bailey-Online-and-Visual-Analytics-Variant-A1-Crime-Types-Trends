            , my servant, came before I was up between seven and eight o'clock, and asked me if I knew any thing of two silver tea-spoons, and the silver cover of a tea-pot, they being missing from the beaufett in the parlour, the usual place for them to be in; we were a little alarmed at it; upon looking further we missed out of the cupboard in the hall, almost all my old shoes, I can be certain to three pair, and a couple of old cloaks; they had been used the night before, it being wet, for my children to come home in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your outside door fast over night?</p>
               <p>Pine. As I came in, I either put the chain up or saw it put up, I do not know which, and my servant told me it was down the next morning. We found one of the sashes in the one pair of stairs room was up, which window the lower part of it was use to be blinded, for the conveniency of my business and very seldom opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that sash up when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Pine. I cannot say whether it was or not, not seeing it, that window opens into the street, and no outside shutter; I was very thoughtful, whether it might not have been done by some of my own people, and who might have opened that sash as a blind, so was the more curious in inspecting the place. I observed upon the window-seat the print of one foot, which I look upon to be not occasioned with the dirt of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175909120003"/> street, but the print of the foot on the dusty seat; and upon examining the other windows, on two of them on the outside, were the marks of two fingers in the dust on them, in endeavouring to get the sashes up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Pine. He was my <rs id="t17590912-1-deflabel5" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

               <p>Q. How came you to take him up?</p>
               <p>Pine. He was taken up for another offence about two months ago, and it being rumoured about of his having been guilty of several such like offences, I went and saw him at Justice Welch's. There I asked him if he knew any thing of my things, or was in my house at this time. He owned he had taken the things, and mentioned the places where he had disposed of them; he said, he had sold the two tea-spoons and the lid of the tea-pot to Mrs Granvil, a Silversmith in St Martin's-lane, and that the shoes he wore himself. I do not remember any notice was taken of the cloaks, they were old ones and little worth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he came by the things?</p>
               <p>Pine. He said, he got in at the window that we found open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention what time?</p>
               <p>Pine. I think he said, about two o'clock. I know he did mention that hour to some of the facts which he was charged with, but can't be particular as to the fact now before the court.</p>

            . I am Servant to Mr Pine. I know the street-door was shut when we went to bed that night about eleven o'clock, and I found it undone in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it fastened?</p>
               <p>Olivant. It was fastened with the chain put up a-cross the door, and the chain was down in the morning, then I missed the two silver teaspoons and the top of the silver tea-pot.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were in your master's house over night?</p>
               <p>Olivant. I am sure they were in the beaufett: upon further search we found some of my master's shoes were missing, and two cloaks; my master and I found a sash up in a one pair of stairs window.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether that sash was down over night?</p>
               <p>Olivant. That is hardly ever up, but I did not observe it over night.</p>
               <p>Q. How could a man get up to that window?</p>
               <p>Olivant. There are large rails on the outside the window, from the top of which he might get to the place over the door, and so to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the window that the sash was open next to the door?</p>
               <p>Olivant. No it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Have you got any of the things again?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have seen the two tea-spoons in the custody of Mrs Granvil.</p>
               <p>Mrs Granvil. (She produced two silver teaspoons). These I bought, I believe, of the prisoner at the bar; I know nothing of the top of the tea-pot.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live, and what is your business?</p>
               <p>Mrs Granvil. I live in St Martin's-court, and keep a Silversmith's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy them?</p>
               <p>Mrs Granvil. I believe about four or five months ago.</p>
               <p>Mr Pine produced a fellow-spoon which was compared with the other two.</p>
               <p>Mr Pine. I am sure these are my spoons.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

I went to bed on the 18th of July about eleven o'clock, and when I got up the next morning, between seven and eight, going to put my cloaths on I found my pockets had been robbed. I missed from my breeches pocket a 36 s. piece, two guineas, two half guineas, and some silver. It was in a green purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you put your breeches over night?</p>
               <p>De la Fountain. They were lying in a chair by my bed-side. I missed a pair of bags and a shirt; a pair of thread stockings that hung on the back of a chair. My metal watch was taken from out of my breeches pocket, and a hat was taken from out of the room, but can't tell whether it was lying on a table or chair. There was a a paper snuff-box taken from out of my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What room in the house did you lie in?</p>
               <p>De la Fountain. In a back-room up one pair of stairs. There are three rooms on a floor. It appeared the thief came in at the dining-room window, then through the antichamber to my room. I immediately called the servant, and ask'd who had been in my room that morning? he said nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether any window in the dining-room was open over night?</p>
               <p>De la Fountain. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>De la Fountain. No, I did not. About four or five days after I heard there had been some robberies<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175909120006"/> committed in the neighbourhood in the same nature; and was told, the prisoner was committed to the Gate-House. I went there, and asked for the person; I was informed he was gone to be examined before justice Welch. I went there, and found he had been examined, but was gone back. I told the justice of what had happened. He said the prisoner was to be examined that day again at five o'clock, at which time I went again. I charg'd him with taking my things. He denied it. The justice told him he had better own it, it might be of service to him. He would not own any thing. I was going to take my leave of the justice, and looking hard at the prisoner observ'd a hat in his hand; I took hold of it, and found it to be the hat which I lost, producing it. The prisoner seemed a good deal confounded; and when I swore it was my hat, he owned to every article. Then the justice told him, if he had told the truth before it might have been much better for him. The prisoner said, he had given the snuff-box to a woman in the prison. I asked him which way he got into the house; I think he said he came in at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whether it was open or shut?</p>
               <p>De la Fountain. No; I did not,</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say which way he went out again?</p>
               <p>De la Fountain. No; the door was found chained the next morning, so I imagine he went out at the window again. The snuff-box was returned me again by the keeper of the prison. The prisoner told where he had pawned the watch. Mr Welch sent away for it, and it was brought in about an hour's time. Produc'd in court and depos'd to.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the Pawnbroker's name?</p>
               <p>De la Fountain. Jourdan: he lives in the Strand. The prisoner owned he took my leather-bags, and the linnen in them; and said, he took a boat to go somewhere by water, and that they were lost in the river Thames.</p>

               <p>Walthoe. I will not be positive of that.

She seemed to turn from the door, and I went down into the kitchen. I had been down but a very little time, before a young man came and told me, he believed a person had taken something out of the parlour. We both ran and took the prisoner in Cornhill, and took her back, and found the waistcoat in her apron.</p>

            . I live at the George in St Giles's: the prisoner and I were together at the Castle and Falcon on the 8th of September, between six and seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that?</p>
               <p>Haselham. In <placeName id="t17590912-3-crimeloc31">St Giles's parish in Holborn</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17590912-3-crimeloc31" type="placeName"

               <p>Q. How came you, after you had been drinking so long there, to go to the Castle and Falcon?</p>
               <p>Haselham. I was a little in liquor. There were four of us; we had been all together; there were serjeant Coles, he belongs to the Guildhall subscription; he is now out of town. I believe we were all four together at the Castle and Falcon about half an hour. I laid my head on the table and fell asleep; they were all there then but the serjeant, he was gone out. I believe I slept about an hour. When I awaked I found myself alone. When I went to sleep I had 4 l. 5 s. and 9 d. about me; three guineas and a half in gold, the rest in silver, and 3 d. in half-pence. He left 18 d. in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How much silver?</p>
               <p>Haselham. I can't tell justly how much silver, having changed a guinea just before. We paid 8 d. each, but the serjeant, at the Castle and Falcon, but do not know how much I spent at the George. I lost a pair stockings, which were afterwards found in the prisoner's pocket: they were taken out of my right-side pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you awake?</p>
               <p>Haselham. I believe about half an hour after seven.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Haselham. Because a person that is here told me, he saw him take my things out of my pocket, upon which I took him up, and charg'd him with it. I took him before the justice, there he denied it. The stockings were found in his pocket when I first took him up. The shirt was found at his cousin's in Gray's-Inn-Lane. I was at the finding of it. We went there by the direction of a man that was with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175909120008"/> him when he left it to be washed, but he is not here. A shirt and stockings produced in court and depos'd to.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>Haselham. We took him up on the Sunday, at the George in St Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What did the landlady of the house say to you when you miss'd the money?</p>
               <p>Haselham. She said, the prisoner had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether or not the landlady did not say she heard me say, that I, as a friend of your's, took it by way of security?</p>
               <p>Haselham. She did say so; but before the justice he denied it, and said, he knew no more of it than he did of his dying day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your money again?</p>
               <p>Haselham. Yes; he confessed the fact in the Round-House, and returned four guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. What did you do with the four guineas and a half?</p>
               <p>Haselham. The Justice ordered it into the hands of the Serjeant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There is ten shillings and threepence due to me out of the money.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is that due to him; he could not give him exact the money, not having change, the ten shillings and three-pence is his property.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had been in your power when that four guineas and a half were delivered to the Serjeant, you would not have prosecuted, would you?</p>
               <p>Haselham. No, I would not have hurt the man.</p>
               <p>Thomas Green. I was in the room when the prosecutor fell asleep: I saw the prisoner put his hand in his right-side pocket in a very private manner. I was within about four yards of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in his hand when he withdrew it?</p>
               <p>Green. No, I did not. After that I saw him put his hand in his left-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you one of that company?</p>
               <p>Green. No, I am servant in the house: the prisoner and prosecutor were drunk, but the prisoner was the soberest I think of the two.</p>

               <p>Q. How much had you?</p>
               <p>Davis. I had four half guineas, seven half crowns, and some other silver; the half crowns were in my coat pocket, and my half guineas in my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober when you went into that house?</p>
               <p>Davis. I was middling; I can't say I was quite drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to get in liquor so early in the morning.</p>
               <p>Davis. I had been up drinking all night, and could not get into my quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to you after you was there?</p>
               <p>Davis. I told her not to rob me, because I knew her before; I paid for my bed and went to bed and nobody was with me but she; and when I awaked she was gone, and my money also.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you awake?</p>
               <p>Davis. I slept about three or four hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you laid your cloaths?</p>
               <p>Davis. I had laid my breeches under my head, and my cloaths about my face upon me; when I awak'd, I cry'd to my landlady, what is become o f the woman that was along with me; here she is, said she, and the prisoner came up along with her; she ask'd what was the matter with me; I said, I was robb'd; she took three half crowns out of her pocket, and was putting them down her bosom; I could take my oath they were mine; and she was shifting the gold under her apron-string; and two bullies broke into the house, and came up and broke one of my ribs, and my landlady saved my life, or they would have murdered me and robb'd me of what I had about me; they and she all made off together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any of your money again?</p>
               <p>Davis. I got only the three half crowns out of her bosom?</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know those three half crowns were your's?</p>
               <p>Davis. I have had them some time; they were remarkable pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks had they?</p>
               <p>Davis. One of them was a Queen Anne's half crown; but what business had she to shift them out of her pocket into her bosom if they were not mine.</p>

               <p>Davis. Nobody robb'd me but she I am sure.</p>

               <p>Young. His father says he is sixteen years of age. (The movement and part of the dial-plate produced in court) This is all I have got of it; I had it from the prisoner.</p>

            . On Saturday the 21st of July about four in the afternoon I was in Mr Smart's field, and went with Mr Smart pretty near a rick of hay that was making; there were some men he had employ'd to unload some trusses of hay out of a barge to carry upon the rick.</p>

             was bringing a truss of hay to the rick.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was the rick at that time?</p>
               <p>Baston. It was about 9 feet from the ground. Smith went up the plank about 14 or 15 feet long. When he was got upon the top of the rick he went cross the rick; there was the deceased on the other side the rick, Smith pitch'd the truss of hay directly at the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do it on purpose?</p>
               <p>Baston. On purpose, that is certain, with design to hit him; but I do not think it was with a design to kill him.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you think he threw it purposely at him?</p>
               <p>Baston. By his manner of throwing it; and having crossed the rick to where Hillar was. Hillar was within about 3 feet of the side of the rick. The truss hit Hillar and knock'd him over the rick; he being a very tall man could not recover himself, he came down head and shoulders to the ground, and lay as dead on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to the deceased when he threw the hay?</p>
               <p>Baston. No words passed on either side; there was no appearance of ill or good-will. Mr Smart stood just by me; he call'd out to the other people on the rick, for they all had their backs towards him, and said Smith had murdered the man; he had knocked him off the rick. Smith came down from off the rick and said, he hoped not, and seem'd to be in a very great confusion, and was much frighted. He said, if Mr Smart would send for a surgeon, he would make good the damage. The men jump'd from the rick, and went to help the deceased up. The deceased went by the nickname of Pash. Mr Smart called out, Pash; to hear if he could speak. Hillar spoke, but I can't tell what he said. He was taken up and carried into Mr Smart's house and set in a chair.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175909120013"/> Mr Smart sent for a surgeon. The deceased complained of his legs, and had quite lost the use of them. We lifted him up in the chair. When the surgeon came he found there was nothing broke. He lived about three quarters of an hour after, and died in the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Baston. I do not suppose that the fall of the truss of hay upon him kill'd him, but that his death was occasioned by his fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any previous circumstance between these two people that could lead to this?</p>
               <p>Baston. No. The prisoner was attending the deceased, and seemed very much concerned, and did not go off after the man died; the young man went to his friends, and so surrendered.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there on the rick besides the deceased?</p>
               <p>Baston. I believe there were three people there besides him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner employed about?</p>
               <p>Baston. To carry the trusses of hay out of the lighter to the rick.</p>
               <p>Q. How large might the top of the rick be?</p>
               <p>Baston. I can't tell; it might be 20 or 30 feet square.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased standing or stooping?</p>
               <p>Baston. He had been stooping; and I believe he was rising up to receive that truss that came from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did the truss hit the deceased?</p>
               <p>Baston. It touched about the back part of his shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the truss hit any body besides the deceased?</p>
               <p>Baston. I do not believe it touched any body but the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these people been making merry on the hay-stack?</p>
               <p>Baston. I do not know; it was all done in 2 or 3 minutes time.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the expressions that the prisoner made use of when he found what had happened?</p>
               <p>Baston. He said, he hoped he had not killed him; if they would send for a Surgeon he would satisfy him.</p>

            , they had been throwing one another down on the stack.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any quarrel, or bad words?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you look upon it to be done in play?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I do. I threw hay upon them when they were down.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did the hay hit the deceased?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It grazed my shoulder, and turned me about a little, and hit Hillar on the hams, as he was stooping.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the deceased from you?</p>
               <p>Taylor. About half a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you imagine, if it had not hit you it would have hit Hillar ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. That I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the prisoner intended it for Hillar?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I can't say that he intended to hit him.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you stand?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I was between Hillar and Smith, I saw Hillar fall from the stack.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the truss of hay hitting Hillar was accidental?</p>
               <p>Taylor. That is what I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion of it?</p>
               <p>Taylor. My opinion is, I heard no bad words upon the stack; what past below that I cannot say; he might design to throw it at me, or him, or down: it might be accidental.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not a truss of hay, sometimes, roll out of the place where it falls?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Very often.</p>
               <p>Q. If it might be accidental, how came it over your shoulder; could that be by accident?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I did not hear any bad words; I stood with my back towards Smith; I do believe it was accidental.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the deceased doing when the truss hit him?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He was just turning the corner of the stack.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the blow a slight or a violent blow?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It graz'd me pretty hard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you imagine he would have fell with that blow had he not been at the edge of the stack ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I said, if you do not draw that corner in you will have it too far out, and he was stooping down. I believe in the position he was in, the value of a pound weight would have thrown him off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner after the deceased fell down ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him jump off the stack?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No: I saw him go to the deceased, but do not know what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. What is th e prisoner's general character?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I never heard any thing of him but that of a good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a quiet, well-behaved, man?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He always behaved well to me, and was in friendship with all the others as far as I know.</p>

            . I was upon the hay-stack, a little before the accident happened; but was not there at the time; we had been at play together; Hillar pushed me down, and I happened to turn him; he took hold on my chin, and after that my throat, but in no anger, neither he with me nor I with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was your grandfather at that time?</p>
               <p>Higgs. He was out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your mother?</p>
               <p>Higgs. She was below stairs in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him your key willingly?</p>
               <p>Higgs. Yes: but I did not know what his intent was?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think there was any thing of his in that bureau?</p>
               <p>Higgs. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask him what he wanted there?</p>
               <p>Higgs. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him when you saw him take the guinea out?</p>
               <p>Higgs. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any part of that guinea?</p>
               <p>Higgs. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make you no present?</p>
               <p>Higgs. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it that you told your grandfather of this?</p>
               <p>Higgs. Three months, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue working for your grandfather after he had taken this guinea?</p>
               <p>Higgs. Not above two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to go away?</p>
               <p>Higgs. My grandfather turn'd him away.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he turn him away for?</p>
               <p>Higgs. For some misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to tell it sooner?</p>
               <p>Higgs. He gave me a strict charge never to tell it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175909120017"/>Q. Did you love him better than you did your grandfather?</p>
               <p>Higgs. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep him company after he went away?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I did, for about three or four hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever take any money besides that time?</p>
               <p>Higgs. No, never but that time; he obliged me to murder my grandfather and mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Why?</p>
               <p>Higgs. Because they were against my having him.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Higgs. This was in December, betwixt the 18th and 19th.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first time the prisoner was in the dining-room?</p>
               <p>Higgs. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever in that room afterwards?</p>
               <p>Higgs. He was: he came in a second time to take an inventory of the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your grandfather ordered him to take an inventory of the goods?</p>
               <p>Higgs. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he want to take an inventory of the goods for?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this second time of coming into the room?</p>
               <p>Higgs. It was past two o'clock.</p>

            . I thought I had mis-told my money, but could not tell how it was; then the girl told me the design was to murder me and her mother, and take possession of my effects; I miss'd money at several times about Christmas last, and thought I was strangely mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own knowledge, of the prisoner's taking your money?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. No, I know nothing of his taking the money, besides what my grand-daughter told me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. About a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. When did your grand-daughter tell you of it?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. She told me of it about a month before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to take him up sooner?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. I was afraid to hurt the man; but the iniquity was so great I thought I must take him up.</p>
               <p>Court. The iniquity was as great, a month before as a month after.</p>
               <p>Jourdan. I can't justly swear to the time; I would not have appeared against him, but from what I had from the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your money?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. I missed my money about December last.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of what the girl says against me: after the last day of the last year Mr Jourdan had no work for me. He did not discharge me because he did not like me, but he had no work; he kept one man that did jobbs for him, and if he had work or not he paid him. After I was gone this girl broke out into her loose tricks as she use to do. On the Wednesday at twelve o'clock, a fortnight after New-Year's-Day, she came and called me, and said, I believe my grand-father wants you. I used to cut for him, and manage his business as well as I could. She told me there was some cloaths come in to be done. I went and knocked at his door: he said, I am glad you are come to assist me. I went up stairs and cut out the body of a frock for him: just as I had done he asked me to drink, and insisted upon it, I should drink either a dram of rum or brandy. The rum was fetched out, and he drank to me and I to the girl; then I went away.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not know of any iniquity then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She is a wicked girl; she went and bought a suit of man's apparel and put them on, and came on horse-back with a letter to her grand-father, and he gave her sixpence for bringing it, he did not know her. She nor he neither will not deny this. She will swear any thing.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>John Hall. I worked with the prisoner eight days for Mr Jourdan. The grand-daughter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175909120018"/> lived upon her grand-father's bounty. I have seen her have plenty of money, but how she came by it I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner's character?</p>
               <p>Hall. I never heard any thing of him 'till now but what was honest.</p>

            . On the 12th of July the Porter belonging to the Lincoln-Coach came to me and told me, the Coachman had lost some money at the Four Swans. Mr Grice, the master of the house, was not stirring. I desired he might be called up, for by the account the Porter gave, I thought it must be among the servants. Mr Grice got up, and we examined the Hostler's room and all the servants.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Norman. I keep the Bull-Inn in Bishopsgate-street, the coach comes one week to my house, and the other to the Four Swans. We could not find it. The Coachman offered a guinea reward, if they would let him have it again. The prisoner was examined, he said, he knew nothing of it. After that, Mr Grice desired the key of his room: then he and I went up stairs to the prisoner's room: he followed us. Mr Grice was examining the shoes and boots, to see if the money was there. The prisoner kept tumbling them about in a sort of confusion, flinging things about, and he hit me three or four times over the head with things. I said, what are you about, and looking up I saw a swelling in the bed's-tester. The prisoner was got up there. I saw him as it were pulling something towards him. I said, Harry, what have you got there. I know nothing at all of it, I know nothing at all of it, (said he) I never saw it in my life, upon which I snatched it from him. It was a bag. I delivered it to Mr Grice, he untied it, and there we found the money the Coachman had lost, with the paper it was in. I paid it away immediately to Mr Weston, at the Sun-Tavern, Milk-street, it was sent up for him. Here is a paper that I made a memorandum on of the particular pieces, forty-five guineas, four moidores, three thirty-six shilling-pieces, and five shillings. He produced the paper it was in.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bennett. Look at this paper. -</p>
               <p>Bennett. This is the paper that the money came up in (holding it in his hand).</p>

               <p>Bennett. He was at his work opposite the warehouse door; and when I returned, I asked him if he had seen any such thing on the bench, he said, no.</p>

            . Mr Norman sent my servant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175909120019"/> up to me to tell me the Coachman had lost some money. I came down and went to examining my servants. I asked the prisoner for the key of the Boot-Room, he being Chamberlain, keeps the key of that. We went up there. I told the prisoner I did not want him, but he followed us. He got up and flung something from off the bed's-tester, which hit Mr Norman's head; then Mr Norman jumped up on the side of the bed, and said, Harry, what is this here. Said Harry, I know nothing of it; I know nothing of it. Mr Norman took a bag from Harry and delivered it to me. It proved to be that paper that has been produced here and the money, which I told over and found it was all there.</p>
               <p>Mr Weston. The Coachman brought this money from Peterborough in Northamptonshire, in order to pay it to me, fifty-eight pound, six shillings: it was paid to me, and Mr Norman in my presence, took down on a piece of paper the Number of pieces, forty-five guineas, and four moidores, three thirty-six shilling-pieces, and five shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming down stairs between seven and eight o'clock; the coachman came down on one side and I on the other; he bid me, good morrow; and I the same to him; he sat down upon the threshold of the door slipshod; he pull'd out an old glove and a parcel of money, and laid it by his side while he put his glove on; I did not see him pull out the money, neither did I see the money, but this he told the Alderman; I went up stairs to fetch a pair of shoes from a gentleman, when I came down he ask'd me if I had seen any money; I told him, no; presently my master ask'd me for the key of the room; I gave it him; my master searched the room all over; I never saw the money.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr Starr. I live at the Vine, in Bishopsgate-street; the prisoner was servant to me five years; three years at one time, and two at another; he behaved extreamly well, and did not go away for any dishonesty; he behaved to the satisfaction of all the guests; he has very often brought things to the bar that gentlemen have made a mistake in, both money and other things.</p>
               <p>Mr Lloyd. I lodge at Mr Starr's; I have trusted the prisoner with bags, containing bills and effects of three or four hundred pounds value at a time, and always behaved honest to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to call Mr Grice and Mr Norman.</p>
               <p>Mr Norman. I always had a very good opinion of the prisoner for his honesty.</p>
               <p>Mr Grice. The prisoner lived with me about six or seven months, I had a very good character with him from Mr Starr, and looked upon him to be a very honest man?</p>
               <p>Q. Is the room, where the prisoner used to keep his things, always lock'd?</p>
               <p>Mr Grice. Nobody ever had the key but himself; if he left it open, so be it, not else; it is common for him to keep it lock'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it lock'd over night?</p>
               <p>Grice. I cannot say whether it was or not, I found it lock'd.</p>

He ask'd her where she came from; she said from Chelsea. I ask'd her where she was going; she said, to Newtoner's-Lane, but could not get in. After that, she said, she was going to an acquaintance in White-Friars. When before the justice, she said, she came from Holloway. These were the things mentioned in the indictment in her bundle, mentioning them by name. She was asked how she came by them, she said; she was walking in the highway, and tumbled over them.</p>

               <p>Q. How near the prisoner's house?</p>
               <p>Hampton. It was a great way from his house, about a quarter of a mile; he has a garden; he has two pear-trees, a damason-tree, and two or three apple-trees in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you boys to his garden?</p>
               <p>Hampton. It has been measured; it is 70 yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of you boys been in his garden that day?</p>
               <p>Hampton. No, not as I know of; I was but just come from work.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Hampton. This was about 4 in the afternoon; the prisoner stood in his own garden, and shot through the hedge at us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him?</p>
               <p>Hampton. We did not, but we saw the gun move; he put it into the hedge, at one place, and then at another.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he point the gun?</p>
               <p>Hampton. He pointed it towards us, but he could not fix it at the first place; so he went to another place, and shot off directly.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner stand at the time ?</p>
               <p>Hampton. He stood on the inside of his own garden.</p>

               <p>Hampton. I believe we had been there about an hour.</p>

               <p>Hampton. I believe there were a dozen of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they bigger or less then you?</p>
               <p>Hampton. They were all bigger than I am, except one.</p>

               <p>Hampton. No; in that time we had neither of us been near his garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call to you before he shot ?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go near his garden afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Hampton. We had our eye and leg dressed before we went that way again; I believe that was a quarter of an hour before we went up to his ground, then he was just coming out of his garden into the street: his house is not by his garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him then ?</p>
               <p>Hampton. No, I did not; the gentlemen ask'd him, how he could do so, to hit this lad just in the eye, and another on his leg. He answered, he would shoot any body that went to touch him.</p>

             the elder. The evidence that has been examined is my son; I was at home that Sunday. They sent for me when the accident was done. When I came to the place where it was done the prisoner had loaded his gun again, and said, if any body offered to meddle with him he would shoot him.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you said to him?</p>
               <p>Hampton, sen. I ask'd him how he could do so?</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether your son had been in his garden?</p>
               <p>Hampton, sen. No, I do not know that he had. I went for a constable, and when I came back again they had got him in custody; and bringing him from his garden. He had got his gun with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is he?</p>
               <p>Hampton, sen. He begged at the pissing-place going to Brentford.</p>

               <p>Hampton, sen. He said but little there: he was hardly examined there at all.</p>

               <p>Hampton, sen. He has. (There was a cloth about it, that it could not conveniently be seen.) There is a shot in his head now, the Surgeon says. We brought him out of St George's hospital yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any marks of shot in his face?</p>
               <p>Hampton, sen. No; there were shot taken out of the other boy's leg.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is it from the place where the prisoner shot, to the place where the boys were playing ?</p>
               <p>Blake. It is 70 yards, I measured it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in your yard?</p>
               <p>Blake. I had been there upwards of an hour, and had seen the boys at play there upwards of an hour. I saw the prisoner come to his garden, and I heard him swear, as he walked along, that he would shoot the boys.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say this to?</p>
               <p>Blake. He said that to himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of the boys been in his garden that afternoon?</p>
               <p>Blake. I can't say none of them had not been in at all; but none of them had been in that afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him put the gun through the hedge?</p>
               <p>Blake. I saw him put it through the hedge and fire: he shot one boy in the eye, he fell to the ground; and another in the leg.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Blake. I was within about thirty yards of him. I saw him charge the gun immediately after he had shot, and he swore he would shoot any body that should attempt to take or meddle with him. There happened to be a Surgeon coming by; we told him what had happened; he insisted upon our taking the prisoner up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he point the gun at any body, when he said he would shoot any body that should attempt to meddle with him?</p>
               <p>Blake. Yes, he did. The Surgeon was so enraged, that he ordered him to come out of his garden; and there came a great many people about him. When he came out we followed him 'till he came to his own door at his house, which is better than a quarter of a mile.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175909120026"/> There we would not let him go in, but got his gun from him, which was then loaded, cock'd and primed. A long gun produced. This is the gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the charge drawn?</p>
               <p>Blake. It is not.</p>
               <p>Court. Take it out, and draw the charge.</p>
               <p>Blake. (He takes it out, and returned with some large duck shot in his hand.) These I drew out of the gun, and after that some powder. The Surgeon took some such shot as these out of the other boy's leg; the boy is here.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Blake; I was at our own gate, and saw the old man go to the garden with his gun in his hand. He said he would shoot the boys when he came up to his garden. He said he saw three boys in it. I went and looked, and there were none in it. I told him there were no boys in it; and he damned me, and said, he would shoot me if I said ever a word more to him.</p>

               <p>Inglefield. No; he had been in the garden, I believe, about a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Inglefield. They were just such as these. The boys two mothers asked him how he could do such a thing, as to shoot the children? he swore he would shoot them through the body too, if they said a word. He said, he had not hurt them, for it was nothing but a little sparrow shot. This he said to all of us.</p>

            . I am the constable. The gun was delivered to me on the 12th of August before the justice; it was then loaded, and I kept it loaded in my possession ever since, 'till it was drawn here.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was then loaded?</p>
               <p>Croft. Because I put the rammer down and found it so. I was charged with the prisoner at the bar, and he went very quietly along with me, and said, he did not shoot the boys.</p>

She delivered to me a guinea, the clasp, and stock, at her house, the Plough in Drury-lane; then I took up Ann Riley, and had her before Justice Welch, and told him what she came upon to me. He told her she was compounding of felony, and if she did not tell where Mears was he would commit her; then she said, Mears was at her house.

I had been out from betwixt 7 and 8 in the afternoon with my two children, on the 12th of July, and returned about 10. I locked the door at going out, and tried the door to see if it was fast with my knee. When I returned I went into the house, and was looking for my nightcap, and heard some rustling in the room. I said to my children there was some body there. At first I thought it might be a cat. I got a candle, then I heard somebody getting into the chimney. I desired the children to stand and see that nobody went by; they were affrighted, one crept under the bed, and the other flew towards me; the watch was going by; I went out, and one of my children cried out, here is a thief. I came back and catched the prisoner at the bar about six yards from the door.</p>

               <p>Green. No, I did not: my child did, and the prisoner owned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon her?</p>
               <p>Green. She had a pair of leather-breeches, a copper tea-kettle, and two pair of stockings in her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any part of the house broke?</p>
               <p>Green. I cannot tell how she came in: the windows were shut and all the shutters fast, and the door fast. She desired me to let her go; she said, she had been in my house, but had not wronged me of any thing. I was with her before the Justice: there she acknowledged she was in the house and took the things, but said, she did it for want.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Green. I had seen her two nights before lurking about.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a husband ?</p>
               <p>Green. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose breeches were they?</p>
               <p>Green. They are my son's breeches, a little boy; the tea-kettle and stockings were mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when you went out that day?</p>
               <p>Green. They were all in the fore-parlour. When she was examined before the Justice, there was found in her pocket a key, two gimlets, and a knife. Produced in court.</p>

            . I was at my master's, at the next door. I heard Mrs Green's little boy cry out, mama, mama, here is a woman in the house. I ran out, and Mr. Bond had stopped the prisoner with the things in her apron. The prisoner said, what things I have taken you may take again if you please. She behaved in a very wicked manner as we were taking her to the Round-house. She said, she would hang or make away with herself, that Mrs Green should never have the reward.

A man on horseback came out of the road just upon us. I imagined I saw a pistol. I got up and said, Fellow, what is it you want? - Your watch and your money, or I'll blow your brains out. I put my hand to my pocket, and said, Really you put me in a fright, you must give me time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a pistol in his hand?</p>
               <p>Whitbread. He had, but he did not care to show it much. I had 23 s. in a paper by itself, a guinea, and 2 s. He said, If you secrete any, I'll blow your brains out, come give it me. I thought I would have some discourse with him first, that I might take some notice of his face. I said, I never deliver my money without telling it. He said, come give it me. No, said I, I'll tell it first. - Come give it me. - Here it is. He said, what is in the other paper. I said, that is a ring. - Come give it me. - No, you shall see it first, what should you do with the ring. - It is my trade, come give it me. Said I, it is a wretched one, I kept still looking him in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a ring was it?</p>
               <p>Whitbread. It was a mourning ring; then he said, Let me see your watch. - Must you have my watch too. Then I took it out and looked at it, and said, Here it is if you must have it. He said, yes. I gave it him: it was a silver one. Then he went round the chaise to my friend Mr. Howard, and to him said, Your watch and money, or I'll blow your brains out, where is your money and watch. Mr Howard took his watch out, it was a tortoiseshell one, and said, Here it is in my hand, can't you see it is in my hand. He gave him his watch and three guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his pistol in his hand when he talked to Mr Howard?</p>
               <p>Mr Whitbread. To the best of my knowledge he had; he told Mr Howard, as he had me, if he secreted any he would blow his brains out; and added, Is this all, turn out your pocket; Mr Howard did, and said, see here is but six-pence; then he turn'd away and went towards London; then we turned into the road directly; there were half a dozen people coming towards London; I said, gentlemen, stop all of you this minute, we have both of us been robb'd, if I had but a horse I could take the fellow, he is just gone on upon a grey horse; he had on a red lappel waistcoat, a blue coat, remarkable dark eye-brows, a large black beard, pale complection, and I'll warrant him to be either a Blacksmith or an Hostler at an Inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing over his face?</p>
               <p>Mr Whitbread. No: one of them said, Pray, what is your name; my name is Whitbread, you may remember I was formerly Sheriff of London; then said he, I know you; then they went on after him for Highgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, is he the man?</p>
               <p>Mr Whitbread. That is the very man.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was you robb'd?</p>
               <p>Mr Whitbread. It was a little after five in the afternoon, about the eighth mile-stone; I rode on to Whetstone, and wrote a letter to Mr Fielding; but the prisoner was taken that night; I was robb'd on the Friday and did not return to London 'till Monday night following; then I had a letter from Mr. Fielding, that the man was taken and the things found.</p>

Enquire at the lamp in Clifford's-Inn passage, St Dunstan's Fleet-street. I went there, to the prisoner, he said he was to sell it for another man, that the salary was 35 l. per year, and in the whole it was worth 60 l.; I agreed with him for a hundred and twenty guineas, he insisted upon five guineas down; I gave him five guineas in part, it was four guineas and two half guineas; he wrote a paper, and I set my hand to it, to pay the remainder in fifteen days or to forfeit the five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What place was this?</p>
               <p>Clark. It was a Tide-waiter's place; he said it would be two or three months before I should have the place; then I went to my master, Mr Green, of Chelsey; he told me he did not like my bargain, and bid me go to his son, an Attorney, in Crane-court; I went there and told him the affair; this was the same day, the first of June; he went with me to look at the paper that I had set my hand to; but told me, before I went and after, that I had been trick'd out of my five guineas, for those places are not sold but given; then I went to enquire of a friend at the Customhouse; he was not in the way; but I ask'd others that I met with about it; they all said I was a fool, and had been trick'd out of my money; after this I went several times to the prisoner's office, but he was never to be found, 'till he was in the Compter for debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your five guineas again?</p>
               <p>Clark. No: nor no place, neither.</p>

               <p>Q. Are there not warrants from the Lords of the Treasury?</p>
               <p>Howard. There are: I received mine from them. It is a warrant sent down from the Lords of the Treasury to the Commissioners of the Customs, appointing a man in such a station.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you sell your place?</p>
               <p>Howard. No: I never knew such a thing in my life; the prosecutor came and ask'd me if there was such a place to sell; I told him there was no such thing; I advised him to go to Justice Fielding and take the man up that had imposed upon him; the prosecutor is a stranger to me, I accidentally heard his case at the Custom-house.

Then there was no fighting. Presently Lamb made a push with his right-hand towards the wall at Kendall's belly, and said, D - n you, I have done for you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the blow hit Kendal?</p>
               <p>Strutham. By the words that were spoke it must.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lamb give a step either forwards or backwards?</p>
               <p>Strutham. I did not observe that?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing in Lamb's hand?</p>
               <p>Strutham. No; it was dark at that time. Immediately Kendal clapped his hands to his belly, and turned round, and said, Lord, or Lord have mercy upon me, I am stabbed. I saw he was stabbed; his bowels were out when he lay on the step of the door, about the size of the knob of this stick (producing an oak stick, the knob about the size of a large walnut.) I helped to carry him to the hospital belonging to the soldiery. We laid him on a bed there; this was about 15 minutes after the wound was given. He died the next day about two o'clock. I saw him after he was dead. As we were coming back from the hospital we went in at the Justice's, and saw Lamb searched; there was nothing found upon him but half a guinea and some half pence in his waistcoat pocket. I said he had committed a murder. He answered, how did I know that? that was all he said.</p>

            . I was in at the three tuns at that time serving an halfpenny worth of grey pease. There was the prisoner, a young woman, and a young lad. Kendal and another soldier came in, this was about nine o'clock. The landlady said to Kendal, Do you want any thing? he said, no, nothing. Then she said, get out of my house. She got up, and push'd him and the other soldier that came in with him out at the door with great violence. They turned in a second time, then the landlady and Lamb, and a woman that was drinking rum and water with Lamb, set upon them to turn them out again, when Kendal, and the other soldier, and Lamb, were got just by the door they gave Lamb a haul and 2 or 3 hard blows. Lamb struck again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Kendal's companion do?</p>
               <p>Wagg. I believe he was upon Lamb also. Then Doleman and another man came up, and went between them, and parted them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they fight with when fighting?</p>
               <p>Wagg. Nothing but their fists. After they were parted Kendal was standing by the window, Lamb turned towards the door, and went about halfway in. Kendal's companion stood in the middle of the mob; there were a pretty many people there, when they had stood some minutes -.</p>
               <p>Q. How many minutes?</p>
               <p>Wagg. Near two minutes; Lamb stepp'd forward and gave a push against Kendall's belly, near the navel, and said, D - n you, I have done for you. Immediately after I saw him put his right-hand a-cross his belly, to his leftside, and went in a-doors. Kendal clapp'd his hands cross his belly, and said, I am stabb'd, I am stabb'd. Then I call'd out murder. I saw the cut in Kendal's shirt, his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175909120032"/> waistcoat being open. Kendal went to the other side of the way and fell down. I walked after him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the cut in his shirt?</p>
               <p>Wagg. It was about an inch wide. It is my opinion he designed to have gone up the steps, and in at the ale-house door cross the way, but he fell down on his back. Then I ran away for a little time; after that I came to him again, then I saw his bowels out as he lay.</p>
               <p>Q. to Strutham. Did you see the cut in the deceased's shirt ?</p>
               <p>Strutham. No, the shirt had been torn down when I saw it, and a woman had laid her apron on the wound.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Upton. I was in at the 3 tuns ale-house that night. About 9 o'clock Kendal came in. There was the prisoner and one Moll Smith. Kendal said to Moll, You said I was at the Round-house last night. She said she did not say any such thing. He had a pennyworth of beer, and went out and came in again, and brought Archy Noak with him. Then he said, you did say so, Moll Smith. She said, she did not. Then they made a scuffle, and got all out at the door together. How they got out I did not see, neither did I see them in the street: I kept my place. Presently I heard the windows breaking, then my landlady ordered me to go and call her husband down stairs, and when we came down they said, The man was stabb'd, the man was stabb'd. I saw Lamb come in at the door, but I was so affrighted that I did not look about much. In about a quarter of an hour there was constable came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any weapon that Lamb had?</p>
               <p>Upton. No, I did not. I have seen him at that publick house many a time, but I never saw any knife that he had, but what he borrowed. He was searched but none found upon him; he had been backwards before he was searched, but what he did there I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. to Doleman. Who searched the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Doleman. I did: I searched his side pocket and all his other pockets, but found no knife. This was about a quarter of an hour after. He had been and washed the blood off his face and hands before that.</p>

            . I am a Surgeon. I saw the deceased on the first of September about the 11th in the forenoon, in the Infirmary. I was informed the accident had happened over night, and he was brought in with his bowels out; he was alive, I saw a large quantity of intestines lying on his belly, and the man in great agony. I could not see the wound then, but when I replaced the intestines I saw the wound, it was about an inch in length, about an inch to the right of the navel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a cut or a blow?</p>
               <p>Carson. A cut it must be, by the appearance of it, by a sharp-pointed instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cut cross or up and down the belly?</p>
               <p>Carson. It was up and down.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had it penetrated?</p>
               <p>Carson. It had penetrated the cavity of the belly by the intestine's making it's way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you call it a mortal wound?</p>
               <p>Carson. It is my opinion that was the cause of his death; he lived about an hour and a half after I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not always a Surgeon there to attend upon people that are brought in?</p>
               <p>Carson. Yes, there is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the intestine replaced before you saw him?</p>
               <p>Carson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could this man's life have been saved had the intestines been replaced at his first being brought in?</p>
               <p>Carson. It is impossible to say that.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the Surgeon of the Regiment's name that took him in?</p>
               <p>Carson. His name is Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find no bandage upon the wound?</p>
               <p>Carson. No, but a vast quantity of intestine out, which then had not mortified but it was pretty near it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you an appointed Surgeon to this Infirmary?</p>
               <p>Carson. I am.</p>
               <p>Court. It is your duty to advise your superiours of this neglect of Mr Davis's. You will not do your duty to the publick if you do not.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Did Kendal refuse to have his wound enlarged?</p>
               <p>Carson. He did not when I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the wound had been enlarged, what would have been the consequence of that?</p>
               <p>Carson. That was the only way to have him do well; that would have been the proper treatment of it, so to return the intestine, had that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175909120033"/> been done at his first coming in, there might have been a possibility of saving his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the intestine wounded?</p>
               <p>Carson. No, not as I saw.</p>
               <p>Court. We hope you think as we do, that the superior officers of that regiment should be informed of the treatment that poor man met with, from that Surgeon belonging to the Infirmary.</p>

            , a Surgeon, being in court it was desired to have his opinion of the case. He was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr Martin. You have heard the description of the wound, and that it is supposed to be given at 9 at night, and that at 11 the next morning there was a great quantity of intestine came out; if proper care had been taken of him at half an hour or an hour after the wound was given, whether or not there was not a probability of his doing well?</p>
               <p>Mr Martin. If the wound had been enlarged immediately, and the intestine returned as it was not wounded, it is very probably the man might have done well.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it more than probable?</p>
               <p>Mr Martin. It is, he might.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you belong to the army?</p>
               <p>Mr Martin. No.</p>

               <p>I was drinking in that publick-house; there came two men in and dragged me out, and knocked me down once or twice, one of them I never saw before to my knowledge, the other I have known a long time.

I know nothing of any weapon that I had about me; the landlord of the house knows I had been dragged out of the house by them.</p>

            . I keep the Three Tuns in Wild-street. I was on the bed when this terrible affair was; the window being broke, the woman came and called me. When I came to the bottom of the stairs, there was a woman came with great surprize, and said, Lamb has stabbed Kendal. I saw no instrument that Lamb had; he came into my house just afterwards, and asked for a bason of water, and went backwards, and washed himself, for his face was very bloody, and his nose cut. I never saw him with a knife of his own in my life; he has used my house two years; he always behaved well in my house as any man need to do, never made any wrangle, but paid for what he had. I do not look upon him to be a quarrelsome man. I do not remember I ever heard him swear twice in my life. Serjeant Noaks that came into my house with the deceased, has made riots, and I believe did bear the prisoner a grudge concerning the woman.</p>

I went for a constable and when I came back the thing was done. The prisoner was searched, but no knife found upon him before the Justice. He was eating some oysters when they came in, but I saw no knife in his hand. I have seen him many a time at that house, but never saw him quarrelsome.</p>

            . I am father to the deceased; I ask'd my son, after the accident happened, how it began; he said, he hit the prisoner over the arm with a brush; and the prisoner said he would do him a mischief, and flung the knife at him immediately. He had a Surgeon to attend him, but he died just about a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Archer. I believe the wound he received on his belly.</p>
               <p>Mr Seirs. I am a Surgeon; when I saw the deceased, on the first of August, his hands were on his bowels covered with blood; there were a prodigious quantity of his bowels out; I imagine the wound was given with a sharp instrument; the wound was about an inch and half wide, and had past through into the cavity of the belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you, from the kind of the wound, that it might be done by accident, by falling out of a person's hand, or done by force?</p>

               <p>Mr Seirs. It appeared to me to have been done by force; that as he threw it over-hand, by it's striking him so low, it was on the descent, having taken, as it were, a circle. He lived 'till the eighth day and then died. There was another accident happened after the wound was given, he ran between two and three hundred yards with his bowels in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he might have lived, had proper care been taken?</p>
               <p>Mr Seirs. Yes: I do.</p>

Ruskins struck Bonner two blows. Then Cantrell came out, and asked Ruskins, If he was not ashamed to beat an old man? upon which words arose between them. Ruskins challeng'd Cantrell, and they agreed to fight. Then Cantrell declined it, and came into the house. Ruskins followed him to the door, and look'd in at the window, and said, I am now ready, and went backwards 7 or 8 yards and stripp'd. Cantrell went out, but I was about my business, and saw no more of it. Ruskins was a very quarrelsome, troublesome fellow, subject to drink, and then would abuse any body. Cantrell always behaved peaceable and sober.</p>

            . I was at Mr Tanner's, setting on the bench, and had call'd for some beer. Ruskins ask'd me to drink with me; I said he might. He flew in a violent passion at the landlady at the door, and said, he would throw her into the pond. I said, it was unbecoming to use a woman with such words. He gave me a kick on my backside, and struck me on my stomach with his fist. Cantrell came out, and said, it was a pity to use an old man so ill; upon which words arose between them, and there was a challenge made, but I know not which made it. After that, Cantrell went into the house, and Ruskins came, and call'd him out, saying, he was ready; then they went to fighting, and had 3 set-too's; at the 2 d set-too, Cantrell struck Ruskins on the side, and he fell. He was taken up, and a third set-too, but in that I saw no blow at all. The deceased died the day following: he was always a very quarrelsome man.</p>

            . On the 3 d set-too Cantrell gave the deceased 3 or 4 blows on the body; one blow was on his face, then Ruskins fell and could rise no more. We put on his cloaths, and gave him some water. He could then speak. He was carried to his lodgings, and he died the next day. I saw him dead, but no marks of violence upon him, only a bruise on the left ear, which he got by the fall.

My lodger saw her come out of my room from behind the shop; she told me. I miss'd a shift; we went to take hold of her, she ran up the street.

It was brought them in a pewter pint mug. When they were gone I miss'd a silver pint mug. Holford used often to be at my house, being an apprentice to a neighbour of mine. They offered it to sale to a silver-smith in Leaden-hall-street, and he brought them to me. We took them before my Lord Mayor, there they confess'd it. Holford confess'd, Dickinson reach'd over the iron rails at the bar and took it out, and concealed it under the table, 'till such time as they had an opportunity to go out with it; then they went to the half-way house between Stepney and London, and stole a hammer and a knife, with which they cut the mug to pieces, produc'd in court in pieces, and depos'd to. Here is my name at length, and sign, upon the pieces. Here is all within the value of about half an ounce.</p>
               <p>Job Tripp. I am a silver-smith, and live in Leadenhall-street. Dickinson brought this silver handle of a mug to sell to me on the 31st of

             being broke gave me a suspicion that it was stolen. I tax'd him with it; he began to want to go away; I laid hold of him, and examined his pockets, and found the remainder in pieces there (the same as produc'd). There came in two gentlemen, the prosecutor was one of them; I desired to know if they had lost any thing. I show'd him part of the silver; then we went before my Lord Mayor, and he swore to the silver by his name being upon it. The prisoner Dickinson there said, he had been on board a French privateer, which he was at the taking, and he and others had taken this mug, and shared it amongst them. He struck in this story about an hour; and after that he owned he took it from the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of the other prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tripp. He was waiting in the street when Dickinson was in my shop; but upon my looking out he ran away down Duke's Place.</p>

I am certain I had my watch, money, and buckles, at going to bed. I got intelligence of her, and found her in bed at the Peacock in Charing-cross, and the watch, and a guinea and half, and 4 s. and 6 d. were found upon her.</p>

            . I am a Constable; I was sent for by the prosecutor; he said he had been robb'd of 6 guineas, a watch, and some silver; and he was informed, the person that robb'd him was at a house near Charing-cross: we went there, and found the prisoner in bed. I took hold of her pocket, and in it found this silver watch, producing it. The prosecutor said it was his watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch which I lost at that time.</p>
               <p>Pryer. I examin'd farther, and found a guinea and half, and 4 s. 6 d. and about 3 d. in half-pence. There was a woman by, which I looked upon to be a bad woman; she told me she had got some of the prisoner's money, and she gave it me; it was a 6 s. and 9 d. and 3 s. She said, she had been to a Pawn-broker's at the corner of St. Martin's-lane, and had taken out a gown. The prisoner said she had bought a gown; this was between 9 and 10 in the morning.</p>

               <p>I happened one night to be in a house in St. Giles's; I went with a person a little in liquor; this happened to be a night-house; she would not part with me without drinking; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175909120039"/> had a pint of beer; the prosecutor came in and sat down by me, and ask'd me if I would eat a piece of bread and butter; I eat part of it; so did the other woman that I was drinking with; then he said, I am going into the country and I want a wife, and if you have a mind to be my wife I will cloath you; it is not a great way that I am going, and I am going to receive a sum of money, I have money enough; I said, if you have, you know how to make use of it; he said, here is my watch, do you keep that, and deliver it to me there; I look'd at it; soon after the constable of the night came in, he happened to know the prosecutor; he said what brought you here; said he, I have left my master, and am going into the country; another-man, that was there, said to him, as I had his watch in my hand; is this your wife; he said, this is one that I am going to make my wife; I gave him his watch again in the house, and we had two or three pots of beer together; he and I went out; the woman of the house bid us good by; we came near St. Gil es's church; he said, he was much in liquor, and he would lie down 'till morning; I said, I did not chuse any man should come into my room, I had nobody but myself; he would go up into my room; then he said, he would give me two shillings for the use of my bed; I said, I do not want any thing for that, for I am going to Convent-Garden; he took the watch out of his sobb, and said do you take that and lock the door and take the key; which I did; as for money, I had none; he said he had no more then two shillings about him. I went to Convent-Garden, and had not been there long before he broke open the door and came after me; and he and the constable came to me at the house of my acquaintance; there was nobody with me, but a woman I met with in the market; she said, Peggy, come and lie down on my bed; I was in liquor, I thought to lie till I was sober; I lay down, and while she was making the water boil for tea they came and took me, and robb'd me of my gown, my money out of my pocket, and other things; they never ask'd me any thing; then they took me to the Round-house; the constable persuaded the young man to swear against me; the young man said, I have no occasion to do it, for if she gives me my watch I have nothing to do with her; he swears his buckles were silver and they were nothing but metal.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She left me her metal buckles, which I put on, and she took my silver ones away.</p>
