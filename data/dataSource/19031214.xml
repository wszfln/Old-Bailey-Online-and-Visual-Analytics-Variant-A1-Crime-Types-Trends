I am the wife of Adolph Dresel of 76 Thicket Road Anerleyâ€”on September 29th I received this letter from the prisonerâ€”I did not know him beforeâ€”in response to that letter I met him outside Mr. Colman's office in Leadenhall Street next day at twelve o'clockâ€”Mr. Colman is my solicitor and manages an estate which I have an interest inâ€”this is the letter: "24 Aldebert Terrace Albert Square Clapham Road September 29th. Dear Madamâ€”I am very sorry to have to inform you that your husband has this evening been taken to the Wandsworth prison for a term of twenty-one days for debt amounting as you will see by the enclosed memorandum to Â£18 5s. 6d. which your husband gave me to hand to you so as to enable you to obtain the amount to get him released. I am well known to your brother and sister-in-law Mr. Villiers Hamilton Pauley and they will tell you who I am. I will do my best to assist you in your time of trouble if you wish me to do so and if you will wire me on receipt of this letter I will keep any appointment at your sister's Mr. Colman's 57 Leadenhall Street to explain matters to him as suggested by your husband <hi rend="italic">to be</hi> before being taken away to Wands<lb/>worth. We ought to be able to obtain his release. Please wire me before nine o'clock if you require my assistance.â€”Your's faithfully Louis D Waterman. Mrs. Dresel."â€”I did not know my husband had been taken thenâ€”he lived with meâ€”he was sent to prison on a County Court judgment on a billâ€”I went with the prisoner to Mr. Wilkinson a solicitor and asked him to lend me Â£15 on some furnitureâ€”he advised me in a friendly way to go to my brother and explain the matter to himâ€”I went to my brother who is an architect at 25 Victoria Mansions with the prisonerâ€”my brother advised me to write to my sister who is the trustee of the estate and ask her to advance me the Â£15â€”the prisoner suggested that I should advance him Â£4 to renew the bill on which my husband had been taken up and that he thought he could renew the bill which would obtain the release of my husband who had been imprisoned in default of payment of the bill which he had been surety to for a friendâ€”I thought that would be a very good thing so I gave him the Â£4 and I also gave him 5s. for expensesâ€”I thought he was acting as a friendâ€”the amount of the judgment was Â£17 5s. 6d.â€”we parted then and next day I received this letter from him: "September 29th. Dear Madam.â€”I have done every<lb/>thing as promised also written governor of prison at Wandsworth copy letter which I enclose. I should show this letter to poor old Mrs. Dresel. Will meet you at twelve o'clock as arranged to-morrow.â€”Yours faithfully <hi rend="smallCaps">LOUIS WATERMAN</hi>"â€”this is the enclosure to the governor: "September 29th.

Florrie Gue. In about two minutes I found the child was dead. My sister the mother of the deceased came in soon. I told her and she began to cry She had only been away four or live minutes to get the milk. The doctor came in and said the child was dead. The child seemed to me to be quite well when we took him out first. "When my sister came to me at noon she looked as if she had had too much to drink, but she had no more to drink all day while with me. She was carrying the child and seemed to carry it all right. He had a hat on and a shawl over him, but his face was not covered over. My sister was carrying the child all the time herself while we were out of doors.

She was going out to get a tin of milk.' The child was all right then. I carried it on my arm: the face was not covered. At the top of the stairs the child did a kind of a flutter in my arms; I looked at it; it seemed rather pale and I placed my hand on Its forehead and I found it cold. I thought it was dead.
