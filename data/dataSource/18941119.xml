I did not strike him, and I did not rob him; in fact I know nothing about it"—when I came round the corner into Arlington Street, the three men were seven to ten yards from me—I followed them 150 yards before they came to a turning—I kept John Davis in sight until I arrested him—I know the prisoners well by sight—I have known them for five years; I am positive they are the men.</p>

I am a licentiate of the College of Physicians of Dublin, and practise in Roman Road—on October 13th I was called to a man lying in the road outside the Hand and Flower—Perry and a constable were with him—I examined him, but it was quite dark; he was suffering great pain in his side—he was sensible; I directed that he should be sent to the hospital—I saw him next day, and found him suffering from shock and great pain in his side and back; his passing blood indicated damaged kidneys—that is well now, but he is still under my care—his injuries are not permanent.</p>

The man who has gone out?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You know it is stolen?"—he said, "No; I don't know"—I said, "Will you fetch me a policeman?"—he went to the booking-office door and returned and said, "I cannot see one"—I said, "I shall take charge of the fish, and you will hear further of me"—I took it on to Mr. Smithers' shop, and I there arrested Newport.</p>

I wish I had done it"—at the station I searched him, but found no knife, only a piece of brown paper folded up and a small piece of Indian ink and knick-knacks, pieces of dirt, and a button—I afterwards looked on the pavement for a knife; I found nothing—I inquired if anyone had picked up anything; a man said he had found something like a table-knife—that man is not here—he accompanied me to the station—a knife was found and lost again; it was picked up and put under an orderly bin, in which they put dust and rubbish from the street—I did not see it; I only say that a man said it was found.</p>

I understand you want me"—he spat in my face, and struck me with his fist on the right cheek—I retaliated by giving three or four punches at him at the back of his head—then I saw him put his hand in front of his trousers, and draw out a long knife with a white handle—I ran about twenty yards and fell down, and while I was on the ground he was going to strike me with this knife in the stomach, but he struck me on the shoulder; then came a lot of friends and protected me, and a policeman came and arrested him, with the knife in his hand—I had an overcoat on my left arm, and he struck me also with the knife through my overcoat—I fell down, and defended myself with my feet while he was striking me—I was with my face towards heaven—I felt the blow in my shoulder, and I felt the blood running on my body—I saw him strike, and he said, "I will murder you," and he repeated the same thing before the Magistrate, saying. "I am very sorry I did not kill you"—all the people came and took hold of him to protect me, and took away the knife from his hand—he struggled, and would not relinquish it—Domenico Barzoni was one of those that came up—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife, and that was the way he held it (<hi rend="italic">Describing</hi>)—this is the sheath—I saw it when he drew it out—it had not the sheath on it when he drew it out.</p>

I was in the kitchen of the same house—No. 21, Duff Street, Poplar. Shortly afterwards Chandler came back in an excited state, and said to Montgomery, who was also in the kitchen, 'Come along, Arthur.' He made no reply, when Chandler again said, in a louder tone of voice, 'Come along, Arthur.' They both then left the house, In about ten minutes afterwards Chandler rushed back to the house, and seemed to be looking for something. He then left, with an article of wearing apparel in his hand. I then had my supper, and was in the act of going upstairs when I saw Chandler and Mont<lb/>gomery come into the house. Chandler was carrying a large bundle con<lb/>taining boots or shoes, which were exposed to view. They entered the back room downstairs, and Chandler said to Montgomery, 'Why don't you close the door, Arthur?' and it was then closed. I then went up<lb/>stairs to bed. I did not see Montgomery when he came to bed. I know nothing about the boots being in my box. They were not there when I went to bed, as I had occasion to go to my box.

I bought them of a dealer in Johnson's sale-rooms"—at the station he handed me from his pocket this bracelet and pair of glasses, and said, "Here are the others. I bought the things in the Sherwood Arms for 8s. 6d. ten minutes before I was arrested"—I searched the house, and found this piece of wood—I find it matches exactly the piece where it has been cut through with a saw; it has been one piece of wood—I showed it to the prisoner at the Court, and he said, "You do not call that a match, do you?"—I found four or five shillings on him.</p>

About fifteen minutes before he was arrested he was joined by another man, who I only know by sight. I saw Weaver show the other man a small pair of opera-glasses, and afterwards put them in his pocket. I did not hear the conversation; when I first saw the glasses Weaver was taking them from his pocket, and he then passed them to the other man. He had hardly put them in his pocket when he was arrested. Since Weaver has been arrested his wife has been to me and asked me to attend the trial and say I saw Weaver buy the articles of a man ten minutes before he was arrested.")</p>

                  </hi>. Prior to 31st July I had been living with the prisoner at 65, Egerton Gardens, as man and wife—he is an American lawyer—I am English—we were in the habit of using rifles in various rooms of the house, including the bedroom—on the morning of 31st July I directed the prisoner's attention to a defect in a revolver—there were two revolvers; one a little bright one, and one a black one—the defect was in the little bright one—this was in the bedroom—he endeavoured to see to the defect; it had got fixed—I think he went down to the dining-room; I was in the bedroom—after he returned to the bedroom we had some words; they were only casual words—the temper was mine; I was angry with him because I asked him for some money, and he could not let me have it, and I was rude to him—it did not continue any time—I cannot remember what I said—I was angry with him because he did not give me money that I wanted—he had not the bright revolver in his hand at the time; it was under the pillow—the black one was in his pocket—I don't think the bright one was fixed, but I don't know—he did not express any intention of doing anything to me or himself—I do not remember what was said—he did not say ho would cut his throat—he said he would shoot himself—I do not remember whether he had the revolver in his hand when he said that—he said it because I was angry with him—about half-past twelve that morning I was going out, and I left the bedroom to go and see my doctor in the drawing-room; after he left I was going up to the bedroom again—the prisoner was at the top of the stairs—I merely looked at him; you could hardly see on the stairs, it was very dark; if he was there I must have seen him; I did see him—I did not see whether he had anything in his hand—I left him in the bedroom—I said to him, "Good<lb/>bye, I shall not be long"—I don't think he made any reply—I opened the door to go out, and as I closed the door I heard a revolver shot; at the same time I found that my face was cut with glass—the door had two panels of stained glass—I screamed and rushed out of the house—I met Mr. Leslie and went into his house—I made a statement to him—I said I had been shot—I remained in his house for two or three hours—then the police came—I went to the Westminster Police-court, and there swore an information—this was on the 31st July—I did not give any evidence till the 11th September—to the best of my belief the shot was an accident—I think so—at the time I left the flat the prisoner was standing at the top of the stairs, by the bedroom—there was about ten minutes between seeing him at the top of the stairs and my leaving him in the bedroom—I left him in the bedroom, not in bed—he was not dressed; he was in his pyjamas—I don't know that he was practising with the revolver; he had it there; I think one was in his trousers pocket, the other was under his pillow—I am quite sure he was not going up to the bedroom when I left him—I left him in the bedroom</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189411190033"/>
               <p>—when I left the flat he was standing at the top of the stairs—he was not going up the stairs, I could not exactly tell—when I was in the drawing-room speaking to my doctor the prisoner came down—I saw his hand on the drawing-room door, just opening it, and he went down again—I did not see where he went to—the last time I saw him he was at the top of the stairs—I don't know whether he was standing on the stairs—he had seen to the mechanism of the revolver in the dining-room—I can't say whether it was in good order when he took it upstairs—he had endeavoured to see what was the matter with it—it had become fixed as we were practising; I can't say how—he used a little file to it in the dining-room—I can't say whether it was rectified—I had no conversation with him about it—I wanted to take it away from him, that was the way it became fixed—I took it away from him because he threatened to shoot himself in the bedroom—I was not trying to discharge it—I did not take it from him; my recollection is clear as to that—I did not say at the Police-court that I took it from him—I was very agitated—I don't recol<lb/>lect saying so—I made a statement to the policeman when I first saw him that day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been under the same roof with the prisoner for eighteen months; during that time he treated me with the greatest possible kindness and affection—I had every reason to believe that he was devotedly attached to me—the tiff we had on this day was of a very slight character; I was very fond of him, and he of me—we were on the best possible terms—we had both been in the habit of handling firearms, he had taught me to do it—it is a fact that on this morning the bright revolver had got out of repair—the last I saw of him was when he was approaching the top of the stairs leading to the bedroom—as far as I know, he had nothing in his hand—the door was wood at the bottom and thick, dark glass at the top—as you come out of the room you turn slightly to the right—the glass was very slightly injured.</p>

I am the housekeeper of these flats—I used to work for Mr. Bennett and Miss Andrews—on 31st July, shortly before half-past twelve, I had not heard anything; they were always on the best of terms—there was a slight difference that morning—I never heard any angry words before that—about half-past twelve I was in the kitchen, and heard a report—I came out of the kitchen, and went towards the drawing-room—I saw a slight smoke in the passage and steps below—I did not see where Mr. Bennett was—after going to the drawing-room I returned to the kitchen—I then met Mr. Bennett—he came down the stairs leading from the bedroom—he went towards the drawing-room—I don't remember whether he entered it—he was only dressed in a pyjama suit—he then returned and went upstairs—he said nothing to me, or I to him—hearing the door bang I looked up—I heard Miss Andrews scream after he had returned to the bedroom—I heard the electric bell at the street door—that was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after Miss Andrews had left—a policeman came after that—the bedroom bell rang, and I went up, leaving the policeman downstairs—I found the bed-room door shut and locked—I turned the handle, but could not get in—Mr. Bennett said, "Open the door"—I said, "I cannot"—he said, "Get it open"—at that time the policeman came up—I then went down to the kitchen, leaving the policeman there—I was not there when the door was opened—the door was always locked when they were there together—I could not say that it was when he was there by himself—he generally got up early, and went out about half-past nine.</p>

I am a solicitor's clerk, and live at 8, Darley Street, King's Cross—about one o'clock on the morning of 2nd November I was passing down Pentonville Road—when about 150 yards of the prosecutor's shop, I heard a smash of glass—my suspicions were aroused, and I hurried on sixty or seventy yards nearer, when I saw two men running from the house across the road in a straight line—I pursued them; they ran along till they came to York Street, where I lost sight of them—I came back to Pentonville Road—I met an officer, and told him the facts—we went to Mr. Linden's, and called him up—the window was broken—the clothes immediately behind the window were not disturbed, but at the back they were taken away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an iron merchant, of 2, Billiter Street—on October 22nd, about five o'clock, I was walking in Whitechapel—I went to call on a customer—he was not in, and I walked across to Belmont's gunshop—I stood there about five minutes, and looked at my watch to see the time, and then walked across the street slowly and carefully, when Hammerman went for my watch—it nearly paralysed me—I saw him running up George Yard—Schennick then came up, and gave me a smack and knocked me down—it was quite daylight—I informed the police—Hammerman ran away at once, and Schennick, after knocking me down, ran in the same direction—I went to the station next morning—I identi<lb/>fied Schennick first as the man who struck me—I was not so sure of Hammerman, but no man could be more like the man that stole my chain—I said he was as like him as two peas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a very lovely afternoon—I was crossing the street at the time this happened—the first thing in the way of violence was snatching the chain, then the assault—that person came to me face to face—I had no difficulty in seeing him—I don't remember whether the lamps were alight—I went into a bootshop to have my coat and hat brushed—a policeman came, and I gave him a description of the two men—I went to the station immediately after—I said I had been robbed of my watch and chain, but my watch remained—the value of the bit of chain was 2d.—I identified the prisoners next morning—the inspector said, "I think we have got the men, from your description"—I was, of course, prepared to find them there, but I should know that long fellow (Hammerman) from a hundred—I can't remember how many people were there; a dozen or fifteen, perhaps—I made a mistake; I picked out one other man first, but when I saw this man afterwards I was sure of him.</p>

I am a son of the last witness—I went to Feltham on this day to see my young brother—I am not certain what time we got back, but me and my uncle took the trap to the livery stable in Bartholomew Road, a turning out of Islip Street, that is about two miles from Seaford Street, St. Pancras—we saw Holt, the horsekeeper, there, and put up the trap, and the three of us had a drink at the Garibaldi tavern, and then we went back and bade my mother good night, and then we went and had another drink and went to the Eden Palace of Varieties—it was past twelve when we got there, we asked the time because we wanted to know whether the boxing was over, and it was not over—we stayed till 1.20, and he saw me on a <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> at Charing Cross.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Clark and I are great friends; he is very little older than I—I know the time we came home because a <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> next door was minding my mother's keys, and she gave them out at the window, and my mother went in and laid the baby on the bed, and I looked at the clock</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189411190049"/>
               <p>and it was 8.15—the baby was with us all day—I have seen Clark since he has been in prison, and asked him about the case.</p>

I did not know that Carter said that this was at eight o'clock—I was very much astonished at my brother being locked up when I had been with him all day—I live with my mother, and am a good deal at home of an evening—I have spoken to my mother about the time we returned home—I have also talked to my sister and to Holt—it is possible that my uncle may have been at the Eden Music Hall that night—I was not near Seaford Street that night; 140 not know Jacks—I have heard that Carter says there was a fourth man, who got away—I do not know whether my brother is under restraint at Feltham; we have to give a number every time we go—they take down in a book the names of persons who visit the house, but he did not take Clark's name—he said, "How many are there?"—I said, "Four"—he said, "I don't count the child"—Clark did not stop outside—there were two more little ones—the officer did not say that there were too many of us—he did not take Clark's name—we only said that it was a brother and sister.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I believe no names were given to the officer—he said, "Who do you want to see?" and we told him, and gave a number—he does not ask every member of the party their names—he allowed us to go in on this occasion, because we had not been there for three months.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ANNA SERJEANT</hi>. I am a daughter of Mrs. Hulth—I went to Feltham on October 29th; Clark was with us—we got back at 8.15—there was a clock on the mantelpiece—Mrs. Cox, the next-door neighbour, was keep<lb/>ing the keys—they took the trap home, and came back at 8.40, and then left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My mother told me that my brother had been taken for acting violently to a gentleman, and I should have to go up as a witness—she did not tell me what time we came home; I Knew that because I had to go back to my place—I have been in service two months—I have a day off every month—my mother told me to tell the truth—they asked if I remembered the time we came home—I left home at five minutes to nine, and I had to be back at my place at nine—my brother and Clark went away with the trap, and came back—it would take them five minutes—if my mother says it was a quarter of an hour that is not correct—I was in the Police-court—I did not hear the Magistrate ask if the prisoners had any witnesses—I am still in the same service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. COX</hi>. I live next door to Mrs. Hulth—they left the keys with me that morning, and when they came home at night, at 8.15, I threw them out at the window—I saw Clark in the trap, and the mother, son and daughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said nothing to Clark that night—I fix the time because I looked at the clock—I said, "Have you had a good day?" and they said, "Yes, we have"—I have never spoken to them about it since—I was not at the Police-court—Mrs. Hulth asked me what time I threw the keys out, and I said about half-past eight—her son did not speak to me about the case.</p>

               <p>Town, about half a mile from where Mrs. Hulth lives—on October 29th I let out a trap, and Mr. Serjeant and the prisoner Clark brought it home about 8.25 p.m.—Mrs. Hulth's house is nearer to Seaford Street than mine—after they returned the trap we went and had a drink of beer, and I saw no more of them.</p>

When I heard of the robbery I went to the station and said, "I hear you have been inquiring for me about a robbery which I know nothing about." My eye cannot be noticed much in the daytime.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, in partnership with Mr. Ledsam at 3, Abchurch Lane—we act for Nicholson and Son and J. D. Watson and Co.—both are wine and spirit merchants—in 1893 we acted for them both in respect to a proposed loan to Mrs. Roberts—we had absolute authority to make a loan as we chose, subject to the first reporting—letters passed, and then I saw Mrs. Roberts—she was described to us as about to take a club in Paternoster Row—she wanted £150—there were further negotiations, and then this agreement was drawn up—it purports to be executed by Mrs. Roberts. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated October</hi> 31<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, 1893, <hi rend="italic">between Elizabeth Roberts, and George Nicholson and J. D. Watson, the two latter agreeing to lend</hi> £150 <hi rend="italic">to the former on the security of the eleven years' lease of premises at Paternoster Row, to be repaid in four quarterly payments, with</hi> £5 <hi rend="italic">per cent, interest. Two receipts for</hi> £75 <hi rend="italic">each were also produced, signed</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ELIZABETH ROBERTS</hi>)—I saw Mrs. Roberts twice at my office with a man who she said was the secretary of the proposed club—she did not mention his name—Mr. Edward P. Trot<lb/>man, who witnesses her signature, was the solicitor acting in the matter—I wrote this letter to him. (<hi rend="italic">Requesting to be informed of Mrs. Roberts' name, and that of her husband, who had recently died, and whether she was able to carry on a club; whether her furniture had been paid for, and asking for an epitome of the lease</hi>)—this is their reply. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Mrs. Roberts was the sister-in-law of Roberts, the billiard champion, referring to Leggatt and Co., of Cheap side, and Dean and Co., of Falcon Square, and stating the lease had eleven years to run.</hi>)—I believe those letters were written before I saw Mrs. Roberts at all—she called soon after the letter of October 18th—I relied on the statements in Mr. Trotman's letter—I never saw her without the secretary—she either produced this receipt or sent it to me. (<hi rend="italic">Dated September</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> 1893, for £100 <hi rend="italic">for work to be done at</hi> 59, <hi rend="italic">Paternoster Row, on contract For</hi> £150—<hi rend="smallCaps">C. SMITH</hi>.)—I believed that to be a genuine receipt, and that it truly recorded the fact that Mrs. Roberts had paid £100; and on November 4th, 1893, this cheque for £75 to Mrs. Roberts or order was drawn by my partner by my directions—it is endorsed by Mrs. Roberts, and has been paid by our link, and on November 11th my partner drew a cheque for £72 8s., payable to Mrs. Roberts or bearer, which was given to Mr. Hurd, the clerk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I got Mr. Trotman's name either from a message sent to me by Mrs. Roberts or given to my clerk—up to the time the letter was written I had not seen her, and she could not have made any repre<lb/>sentation to me—I knew that the club was not open, and I mentioned the security of the lease, and said, "Although the furniture has been paid for"; that was all I wanted—I wanted also to be satisfied that money had been paid for the furniture—I believe it has not been paid</p>

               <p>for—there was one thing in Mr. Trotman's letter which I did not like, which caused me to ask for the receipt for the repairs; that was not about the furniture—I did not reply to the two references given to me; I was satisfied with the solicitor's reference—I should not have been satisfied with an abstract of title, I should have investigated it—if I was acting for a client I should examine the original deed—I know that the club was opened afterwards—Mrs. Roberts got behind in her payments, and was made bankrupt by my client under my advice—the Registrar went into the question of damages, and gave him £20, but before that she summoned a meeting of her creditors and said that she was insolvent—he was made bankrupt about April this year—this receipt was not sent to me by post, I believe it was handed to me, because everything sent me by post I put on it, "Received so-and-so"—I got the lease from Mr. Trotman—it was not sent by post; I believe it was sent in the ordinary way to Mr. Trotman's office; that would be the ordinary custom.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I drew these two bills for £25 on Mrs. Roberts and one for £50 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) because I could not get any money—the £25 bills were both dishonoured—this bill for £15 was also given and can<lb/>celled—I received exactly £100 in bils from Mrs. Roberts, but I gave them back to her three or four days afterwards, and she promised to tear them up, as I could not do with them—a friend discounted two for £25—</p>

I am a member of the firm of Ward, Williams, Witham, and Lambert, 1, Grays Inn Square, solicitors—our firm acted for the defendants in an action that was brought in the name of Dow Hagar Lawrence against Lord Norreys—Lord Norreys was the first de<lb/>fendant; another was added afterwards—the action was commenced on 9th June, 1886, by writ. (<hi rend="italic">The writ stated that the action was brought to claim the Towneley estate, and was issued by Howell Thomas, 40, Chancery Lane, solicitor for the plaintiff</hi>)—the statement of claim in that action was delivered on 12th July, 1886, by Thomas—it alleged that the plain<lb/>tif was entitled, as heir-at-law, to these estates—that was the substance of it—no fraud was pleaded—on the face of the claim the Statute of Limitation would appear to be an answer—on the 21st October Lord Abingdon was added as a defendant in the suit, and on the 29th October 1886, I took out a summons at Chambers to strike out the statement of claim, on the ground that it disclosed no cause of action, and that the action was shown to be frivolous and vexatious—that summons was re<lb/>ferred to the judges, and by them to the Divisional Court—while that decision was pending, on the 22nd November I took out a summons for leave to amend that statement of claim—that was referred to the Court, and both were to come on together—on 6th December, 1886, that amended statement of claim was delivered to me—it alleged a fraud, which, it was suggested, would be an answer to the Statute of Limitation—the two applications, namely, the application to strike out the claim, and the amendment, came before the Divisional Court, con<lb/>sisting of the late Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Day, and judgment was given on the 24th of June, 1887, deciding that the action was frivolous and vexatious, and refusing leave to amend—after that, on the 29th November, 1887, a fresh action was commenced in the Chancery Division</p>

Mr. Justice Stirling, on the materials before him, refused to strike out the statement of claim—on behalf of the defendants I appealed to the Court of Appeal, and on 15th June 1888, the Court of Appeal, consisting of Lords Justices Cotton, Bowen, and Fry, gave judgment, dismissing the action as frivolous and vexatious, reversing the decision of Mr. Justice Stirling—thereupon the plaintiff appealed from the Court of Appeal to the House of Lords—this book of the House of Lords was used on that appeal—it does not contain their lordships' judgment, but the House of Lords affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal on 22nd April, 1890—I acted as solicitor for all the defendants in the action: at the first stage of the proceedings I did not represent Lord Abingdon and Lord Norreys, they were represented by their own lawyers, but eventually they left it to me—the costs of the defendants have been paid—the amount paid to me in all this litigation was £679 7s. 1d.—there were other costs paid to Messrs. Markby and Co. and Norton and Co., who represented other parties, amounting to about £200—I think £1,000 would cover all the costs which the plaintiffs had to pay to the defendants—the value of the property in question is between £60,000 and £70,000 a year—acting as solicitor for the defendants throughout the whole course of this litigation, no suggestion of a compromise was ever made to me, or ever came to my knowledge—I never heard of any suggestion of compro<lb/>mise—there is no truth in the suggestion contained in the letter of 11th August, 1887, that the defendants had offered to forego their right to the estates if the plaintiffs would undertake not to appeal or to bring a fresh action—I know Colonel Jaquess by sight—I recognise him as the person who was acting for the plaintiff in the action—I always saw him in Court—I never spoke to him—I never spoke to him or Thomas, who was then acting as solicitor for the plaintiff—I recognise him as the Howell Thomas who was solicitor for the plaintiff—I never had an interview with him in which a compromise was discussed—we have spoken about this litiga<lb/>tion—he said that he knew his client had no case at all, and he had told him so—I never at any time expressed myself satisfied that they had a complete case, or any case—I never showed the slightest sign of</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">objected to the evidence of this witness, as it related to matters occurring some fifteen years before the earliest date of any act of conspiracy alleged in the indictment, and further that everything said and done between the witness and Jaquess took place in America, and was not subject to the jurisdiction of this Court. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>me this, which purported to be a genealogical tree of the Lawrance family—he said the estates were in Lancashire, that there was large real estate besides the money in the bank, that the heirs were quite old men and very poor, not able to prosecute the claim for the estates—Jonathan S Jaquess, the prisoner's eldest brother, in the colonel's presence, said to me that he had investigated the matter, and that there was no question of doubt of the correctness of the claim—I replied that I did not know Colonel Jaquess, but that I was willing to trust him, the brother, with a million in the wilderness—I had been his partner and knew him well, and had confidence in his integrity—Jonathan Jaquess said the two brothers Lawrance, for whom the colonel was managing the matter, had issued bonds, which they had signed, and that he had sold quite a number of them about New York and Boston at the rate of five cents on the dollar face value of the bond, but that the colonel had permitted him (Jonathan), to take a lot of the bonds at two cents on the dollar, and that as an old friend and partner he wanted me to invest in the bonds at the same price—I told them I would invest 500 dollars—before that he showed me the bonds and what was printed on the backs of them—I paid him 500 dollars in cash and he gave me these 25,000 dollars worth of bonds.</p>

When the colonel showed in the bonds he called my attention to the statement on the back, which I read—I paid for the first lot of bonds that I took by a cheque for 500 dollars, on W. and J. Sloane, of New York, and he and his brother went with me—that cheque has since been destroyed—I applied to the house for it, and they wrote to me "Destroyed"—I was with Colonel Jaquess when he cashed the cheque—it was necessary for me to identify him because they did not know him—on that occasion I got three bonds for 1,500 dollars, two for 1,000, and one for 500—about ten days or two weeks after that, he and a Mr. Carr, an attorney from Buffalo, came to Evansville, a city on the river in some part of Indiana, and a meeting was held there—I was invited to attend, and I went—I heard the colonel speak; his brother Jonathan was there—the meeting was held in his office; perhaps twenty or thirty persons were present, among them several brothers of the colonel, and an uncle of his—the colonel spoke on the subject of the bonds—he said that they would unquestionably be collected—it was then said by someone in the meeting that they did not know Colonel Jaquess, but they had every confidence in Jonathan Jaquess—the colonel spoke at length—he was a good talker, and did a large amount of talking, and after that, I, in connection with a brother of mine, took some more bonds—the colonel did not want all the money down, but he wanted to know where he would get it in case of need—I and my brother took 125,000 each—I may say, however, that for my first lot of 500 bonds I paid the full amount at 2 per cent.; that would be a penny</p>

               <p>a dollar—that would be a very good percentage if collected—one-fifth was to be paid in cash—he would take notes for the balance, to be paid into the hands of Jonathan Jaquess—we executed notes for the balance not only myself, but nearly all the parties there, fifteen or twenty, per<lb/>haps at the meeting—(the notes were not paid)—they were put into a tin box, and placed in the hands of Jonathan Jaquess, and he deposited them in a safety vault, with a contract from Mr. Jaquess, Colonel Jaquess, and Mr. Carr to be paid back—my contract is not here; it was lost—I have the notes—the contract was signed by Colonel Jaquess and Mr. Carr—I saw the contract—I had a hand in getting it up—I can tell you what the draft of it was—it began, "August 8th, 1871. Evansville, Indiana 5,000 dollars. On demand after date, I promise to pay to the order of L. G French 5,000 dollars, etc., with interest at 10 per cent, per annum"—on the back was, "Received 1,000 dollars, "signed," Carr and Jaquess agents," endorsed "French"—it was a joint note—it represented the 500 I paid him in Buffalo, and the other 500 my brother paid him, leaving 4,000—the 5,000 represented the price of 250,000 dollars—Mr. Carr fixed up the note for both—the colonel was doing the collecting,. Carr did the writing—the 125,000 included the 500 bond that I had already taken—the other people at the meeting took bonds on the same arrangement, everyone there; they had no hesitation in doing it—Jonathan Jaquess called on me twice after that, and collected small amounts—this book had been lying by for twenty years, and I never thought of the bonds till the officer called for them—here are two receipts which I had from Jonathan Jaquess; each is for sixty dollars—he is dead, and my brother also—his bonds and mine were all put together in my safe—I had forgotten all about them until the turned up when they were called for; I did not remember much about them—the money was to be collected when required for the litigation, provided the colonel and his friends satisfied them that everything was proceeding right—my brother's bonds came into my possession; these are them (<hi rend="italic">Producing them</hi>)—they all bear the date, 28th August, when the arrangement was come to; they are all in the same form, with the same endorsement on the back—after that meeting I don't think I ever saw the colonel again at Evansville, but I was in New York with a friend Judge Dyer, of Evansville, and he told me that the colonel was in the city, and I told him if he saw him again to invite him to dinner at the Metropole Hotel; that was several years afterwards, about 1874,1 think—those dated the 17th August were what I first took, the next was on the 28th—the colonel did come and take dinner with us—I had some conver<lb/>sation with him on that occasion about the property; that was the object—we discussed the condition of the suit, and the fund, and what he had done—Judge Dyer also had a lot of bonds; we took them from anybody—think he had 50,000 of bonds—the colonel said that the prospect of recovering the estate was safe, first class, and they were doing everything in the world to accomplish that end, a little of which we believed, we discounted it; we were suspicious—after that dinner I never saw him again till I saw him in the dock at Bow Street—after 1874 he never in<lb/>formed me how the litigation was going on, not directly—he wrote to his brother repeatedly—Jonathan Jaquess died six or eight years ago—I came over from America with three other gentlemen, representing bond</p>

Lawrance by power of attorney—all through the colonel spoke as simply an agent for the sale of these bonds—he did not give a receipt for the moneys we had paid; he gave us the bonds—the bonds I bought were for 25,000 dollars; I paid 500—it was not to Carr that I gave the cheque on Sloanes; it was given to the colonel, because he took it to New York with him, Q. Just let me remind you, is it not a fact that that cheque, if it was a cheque, was made payable by you to Carr? A. Well, it is twenty-three years ago; I can't say positively to that; it might have been; he was the cashier of the party—I know Mr. Sloanes's signature—this is W. J. Sloanes's signature; I wrote to them for the cheque, but they had not got it—since yesterday I received a letter from him, in reference to that very cheque—from this I am doubtful whether it was drawn in favour of Carr; it was not cashed by Carr, because he was not in New York to cash it—he may have endorsed it to Jaquess—I think probably it was made payable to Carr;.</p>

deaths, and fully concur in the opinion of the able Counsel expressed in writing, which you have shown to me, that William Towneley Laurance traces his line of descent clearly, fully, and without a missing link in the chain of evidence back to his ancestor John Laurance, and Mary Townley his wife, through whom he claims the above-named estates and properties. And I further state that with the record of the marriage of Mary Townley and John Laurance, now in your possession, and which you have shown to me, the proofs of pedigree are now complete; and as. Requested by you I shall proceed at once and without delay, availing myself of the work heretofore done, to prepare the case in conformity with recently obtained facts and records for presentation to the proper tribunal for adjustment and settlement, with certain prospect of a speedy hearing, and reasonable and encouraging probability of a decision in favour of your client, the afore-named William Townley Laurance, or those claiming under him." To Colonel Jaquess, February 2nd, 1886—"My dear Sir,—Referring to our interview this morning, the points to be enumerated in the statement to be made by yourself and to be pre<lb/>sented to my friends in America for their consideration and action occur to me in part as follows, to wit: A trial since my return in Court, in which our strength was manifest and the weakness of the defence pain<lb/>fully apparent. The practical results, growing out of this trial, viz.:—Request of defendant's Counsel for terms of settlement without further litigation, and which proposal has resulted in a meeting of yourself, a Counsel of the plaintiff, with defendant in presence of his Counsel, and definite proposal for terms of settlement as follows, to wit: £5,000 cash payment to be made by plaintiff and divided among all the defendants, and an additional sum of £60,000 to be paid to defendants out of and from the estate when same shall be recovered by the plaintiff. And while the forms of law must be observed in prosecuting the cause of plaintiff, defendants are not to defend but to confess his or their inability to meet, disprove, or overcome the claim and proofs presented by plaintiff; and further the case of resistance to any claim set up by plaintiff, defendants are, as best they can under the conditions and circumstances of the case, to aid and join with plaintiff in meeting any and all objections raised or put forth by the Government. This proposal was rejected on the ground that the cash payment was unreasonable, but was consented to as to deferred payments as reasonable and just. You (Mr. T.) still consider the terms as to the cash payments unreasonable, and so informed the defendant and Counsel in most emphatic and positive terms, but con<lb/>sidered the other terms reasonable. You, therefore, adjourned the meet<lb/>ing for the purpose of consulting plaintiff—leaving them with the under<lb/>standing that you had a complete case with ample backing, etc., etc., and should prosecute the same vigorously, etc., etc. You think you may be able to reduce the cash payment to four thousand pounds, and possibly still lower, etc. Nevertheless, taking into account the great advantage to be gained by accepting even these terms, we must not pass them by without due consideration. Here, please name some of these advantages, and among them time, with none to oppose us we may avoid and escape</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189411190068"/>
               <p>much of the law's delays. The points on which you desire most to con✗ plaintiff is—since it will not be safe to encroach to any great extent, even to meet terms of a reasonable compromise upon the fund so nobly and so promptly furnished by your friends for the prosecution of the case; seeing that we must pass the case through legal requirements, the question still remains for plaintiff to answer—viz., If no better terms than a cash pay<lb/>ment of £5,000 can he had, can we venture upon that sum with safety, etc., etc., etc.—Truly and faithfully (signed) <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES JAQUESS</hi>, for plaintiff, 47, Woburn Place.—H. Thomas, Esq, 40, Chancery Lane—November 15th, 1886" "40, Chancery Lane, London, W.C, November 19th, 1886. My dear Sir,—Laurance <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Norreys and others. The Earl of Abingdon, father of Lord Norreys, has obtained leave to appear and to defend as to a part of the property claimed in this action. This is presumably done to aid Ncrreys, who is unable to defend. To avoid the disclosures which they so much dread and with a view to nip our action in the bud, and so prevent a public trial, their solicitors took out a summons to strike out the claim, and to stay the action, which summons was heard on the 1st inst. Before Master in Chambers, at the Royal Courts of Justice, Strand, who refused to make the order they asked for, and in doing so, added that he thought our cause of action was good, and that the claim was sufficiently set out, and was a reasonable one. From this order the defendants appealed to the Judge in Chambers, which appeal came on before his Lordship Baron Pollock, on the 3rd inst., who again refused their application, and con<lb/>firmed the Master's order in our favour. His Lordship further ordered that, as the matter was a most important one, and the interests involved were very great, the matter should be adjourned into the Divisional Court, there to be argued before two Judges. Two other defendants have endeavoured to embarrass and delay the plaintiff; but his Lordship, on our request, stayed their summonses, and directed them to stand adjourned until after the argument in the Divisional Court, and so their hands are tied up. I have all along thought that the defendants were wrong in taking this course, and told them so, and that their summons was strong evidence they had no case to go to trial, and so far both the Master and the Judge have confirmed my view of the case. The real and substantial question to be decided is the one of the Statute of Limitations, and that I have months ago offered the defendants to submit to the Court for argument; but they, being afraid, have declined to do so, although it must ultimately come to that, and the Judge so intimated, too, when we were before him. We shall undoubtedly stand or fall by the Statute, as to which I think, together with our Counsel, that we are right in our view, and will so argue before the Court with every confidence and prospect of success. So far we have scored two victories, which, although they are of a pre<lb/>liminary nature, yet they are satisfactory (and tend to disclose our opponents' case, if they have any, and to dishearten them), and I trust we shall continue so to the end. They have, however, had this further and more important result, that the defendants' solicitors have approached me with regard to proposed terms of settlement, and have offered to accept a sum of. £60,000, to be divided between them, out of and from the estate recovered by the plaintiff, on the plaintiff suc<lb/>ceeding in the action, with a cash payment of £5,000 down, in which case</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189411190069"/>
               <p>the defendants are prepared to stand by and undertake not to raise any technical objection or obstacle to the plaintiff's case, but let it be fought on its merits, so that all he will have to do will be to satisfy the Court that his claim is good, and that I think we can do. The cash payment down I have objected to, and think they may be got to accept a sum of £4,000, being £1,000 (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>). Looking at the immense advantages which the plain<lb/>tiff would derive in accepting their overtures, I think it wise that he should seriously consider the improved prospects of his case in so doing, and make every effort to accept same. I am, however, diffident in con<lb/>sulting the plaintiff upon these terms, since I see that they exceed the limits of the funds which his friends have hitherto so nobly and promptly furnished him; yet, under the exigencies of the case, I think it most desirable to comply with the terms, and so aid in bringing to a termina<lb/>tion, and successfully, I earnestly hope—a long-pending and very eventful case. If the terms are accepted, we have practically <hi rend="italic">carte blanche</hi> as far as the said defendants are concerned, who know they have no case, and are trying to make the best they can before it is too late; and in that event we ought and will, I believe, prove our case, and I therefore invite you to put these facts at once before your friends for their serious consideration and prompt reply. The action will be over considerably within the time I have previously mentioned to you. Awaiting your immediate reply, yours very truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">H. THOMAS</hi>. "</p>

I am an outfitter, at 126, High Street, Deptford—last Friday week, 9th November, I went to bed about twenty minutes or half-past twelve, leaving everything quite secure—at half-past three on Saturday morning I was disturbed by the police—I came down, and found the door had been broken, and wrenched right off by the hinges, and the upper part of the shutter was splintered up, and I missed seven coats, worth £5 18s.—I found the prisoners in custody of the police when I came down—I afterwards saw the coats, and identified them as mine.</p>

I am a farmer, living at Franklin Farm in the parish of Wonersh, county Surrey—the prisoner married my sister, and she came with her daughter in May to reside with me—the prisoner also came in May—I had a conversation with him on Sunday evening, November 4th—I had to go some distance to milk the cows and he was with me—I was shifting from one farm to the other and I said that so many of us could not go to one house—I told him he had to clear out, or something like that—that was on Sunday morning—we dine at one o'clock, and my sister had an apple tart made—after dinner I sat in my chair with my hat on and went to sleep, and received a blow on my head, and then a second blow—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner before that—I got out of my chair and saw him walk away, and through the wash-house into the house—I saw Mr. Brown and gave information to him, and he com<lb/>municated with the police—they were two heavy blows—I do not know what he did it with, but I had two cuts through my hat—the wounds bled—I was attended by a doctor—I had given the prisoner no provoca<lb/>tion.</p>

I am a surgeon, practising at Bramby, in the county of Surrey—on November 4th I saw the prosecutor; he was suffering from an incised wound on the back part of his head, and one on the side—one was two inches long, and down to the bone—I cut away the hair, and found another wound further forward, only just breaking the skin—the first was a clean-cut wound—a blow with this bill-hook (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would produce the wounds, but it would require some force—if the prisoner suggests that he gave a back-handed blow the wounds are not consistent with that—he must have been standing directly behind, and the blows were downwards—the wounds were serious, but not dangerous—his hat was cut.</p>

On November 4th, at three p.m., Mr. Deane came to the station with this hat, and made a complaint to me—I noticed a cut in the hat, and saw one wound on his head—I bandaged it and sent for a doctor—I went where he lives, and found several chairs overthrown and this hand-bill on the floor in the front room—I saw the prisoner about an hour afterwards—he said, "This is a bid job," and then he said that he had been injured in a scuffle, and in the scuffle he threw the hook at the prosecutor Deane, back-handed in self-defence, and it stuck in his head, and that he threw the hook as he was falling over the chopping-block—after examining his shoulder, I said, "It appears to me you have got all your injuries in a fall"—he was freshly bruised—this was about four o'clock—it was rather quick for the bruises to be discoloured—he said that he had thrown the hook back<lb/>handed, or under-handed, as he was falling—I said, "That appears im<lb/>possible, because that would be a horizontal cut, and this is on the top of the man's head;" and afterwards I said, "The doctors have found two cuts"—he said that his wife and daughter persisted in living with the prosecutor, and Mr. Deane wanted to get rid of him.</p>

When the case was brought before the Magistrate my solicitor did not say a word about the commencement, and they would not allow me to speak, consequently I decided to come here and wait, that the point should be heard. This is the first time that I have had a chance. My brother-in-law was sitting in an arm chair apparently asleep, and I went to the mantelpiece near him to get a boot lace. I put my foot on the rung of a chair in looking for the boot lace, and I had the hook in my hand, and in the act of getting back I slipped from the rung of the chair, and the second mark on his head was caused by the hook, and then the hook fell on the chair. I seized the hook; he did not speak, but took the file and threw it at me. He did everything he could to upset me. It is true that he was asleep, but I did not attack him, it was a pure accident.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a banker—in April I and my family were occupying The Ledgers at Chelsham, which is six miles south of Croydon—that house is a one-storied building, with a ground floor and one floor above—I had one or two visitors staying with me on April 5th—on that day our dinner was over about nine or 9.15, and then we all assembled in the drawing-room—there was a large party of children, my own eight, and one or two visitors' young children—they were playing about, making a noise—the servants at that time would be at supper at the other end of the house—the drawing-room and library occupy the ground floor at one end, and on the floor above is a short passage with a bedroom at each end, and two dressing-rooms in the middle, between the two bedrooms—each dressing-room has two doors, and communicates with the passage and with a bedroom, but not with the other dressing-room—it is an oddly-arranged, old-fashioned house—to get to the dining-room you have to pass through the conservatory—the dining-room is same little way off; it was added by Mr. Baron Cleasby, who used to live there; there are no rooms over it—the servants' quarters, where they were at supper, are on the ground floor beyond the dining-room, and over their room are the servants' bedrooms, approached by another staircase at the back of the house—the end of the house where the drawing-room and library are faces due north; the front door faces west, and the other part of the house, looking into the garden, faces east—a ladder was found against a dressing-room window, on the north side of the house, the side from which the wind blew very strongly that night, and made a noise with the trees, and so on—the bedroom and dressing-room windows face north—the dressing-room, against which the ladder was placed, was not occupied that evening; to get into Mrs. Buxton's bedroom it would be necessary to come from that dressing-room into the passage, and along the passage to her room—in consequence of something I was told I went up<lb/>stairs, and found the window of the unoccupied dressing-room had been broken open—there was a circular fractured hole in the glass, just sufficient to admit a hand, by which the latch was opened—on the glass was a good deal of sticky substance, which we afterwards found to be Iiebig's extract of meat—on the window-sill was some thick brown paper covered with this sticky substance—the window was a French lateral window, and was open—I saw a ladder against the wall just outside the window, a person could step from it into the window—it was pitch dark—the prisoners had no right to be on or near my premises—I did not see them till they were in custody—Mrs. Buxton lost ten or twelve different articles—I went into my wife's bedroom to see what had been taken—I did not find that room in confusion; everything was left as it was before, with the exception of the jewellery—Mrs.</p>

               <p>Buxton came up immediately, and we missed a pearl necklace, a gold watch with a gold chain and trinkets attached, another little gold watch which she wore on her wrist, set in diamonds, a small amethyst and diamond brooch, a small antique miniature set in pearls, and another pearl brooch—I don't think we missed anything but that property, which was lying about on the dressing-table—of that property I have only since seen the amethyst and diamond brooch and the small miniature set in pearls—they are my wife's property, and are of the value, roughly speaking, of £10—the pearls round the miniature have a certain value, and the miniature is beautifully painted—about a week after the burglary, and when I was abroad, an envelope came for me containing one of Mrs. Buxton's small gold trinkets off her watch-chain—it was only worth a few shillings, but bore an inscription in memory of a deceased friend—that inscription only gives initials—in the interval the police had advertised our loss, I heard—I afterwards went outside, and found, at the foot of the ladder, an old stocking, with some cardboard at the foot end—it could be put over an arm and hand.</p>

I conducted the inquiry before the Magistrate—I was in attendance last Session—I found that Godden was ill—he is very ill indeed now; I saw him last Saturday lying in a bath chair; he could not stand—he was a gardener in Mr. Buxton's service—I have not seen him since; he was suffering from some spinal complaint—about two a.m on 6th April information was given to me of this burglary—I got to The Ledgers about five a.m., and examined the premises—I found that the dressing-room window on the north side had been broken—there was a hole large enough for a man's hand to go through—brown paper was adhering to the glass with some paste that had the appearance of Liebig's extract of meat—about thirty yards off, under a tree on the lawn, I found more brown paper and paste similar to that on the glass—the ladder had been taken away at that time—I saw the place where it had been—there were several footprints there, footprints of two or three persons—I am quite certain two persons had been there, and I think probably three—the ladder, when I saw it round by the farm build<lb/>ings, was 150 or 200 yards from the place where it had been used—one man could carry it, but it would be a good load for him—I circulated the description of the lost property at Scotland Yard and throughout the country in the <hi rend="italic">Police Gazette</hi>—that included the trinket with the inscription, and connected it with the burglary at Mr. Burton's—on 6th April I received information that three strange men had been seen—only a very vague description was given of them—I saw Godden, the gardener, on the subject on the following day, I think—he gave me no description—he said he should know one of them—after the case was closed at Godstone I knew of Matthews, a labourer—I did not know he was in Court when the case was on there—he was there—he is a witness now—he made a statement to me—I instructed Mr. Hood, the solicitor for the prosecution, to send an account to the prisoners of what Matthews said—I have general authority from the Godstone Bench to have legal aid and instruct a solicitor, and I laid this case before Mr. Hood—on 25th June Gilmour was brought in custody to Godstone—Ward was brought there on 28th June—when Gilmour was brought in I said to him, "You know what you are charged with?"—he said, "Yes"—when Ward was brought in I said, "You know what you are charged with?"—he said, "Yes"—the charge was not put on the charge-sheet then.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUTTON</hi>. On July 2nd, the day of the Police-court proceedings, I saw Matthews after the hearing—he was having a general conversation with other constables and myself respecting the two prisoners—I have had charge of this case from April 6th—I had made inquiries, to endeavour to get a description, of three men all over the neighbourhood—Godden was in Mr. Buxton's employment at that time—I had a conversation with him after the burglary—I had not seen Matthews then—I think I saw all Mr. Buxton's servants—Matthews was not one of his servants; he was working on the highway—I had seen Matthews before, but never had any conversation with him—between April 6th and July 2nd this burglary was well talked of in the neigh<lb/>bourhood; I read about it in the local papers—Matthews is sixty years old, I should say; he works on the road for the parish.</p>

               <p>Chelsham—I and my men, from the moment we got the information, were making inquiries in and about Chelsham—I saw various people—no one else was arrested on this charge to my knowledge—Matthews lives in Warlingham, I believe, the parish adjoining Chelsham—at this time he was working on the road near The Ledgers—he first spoke to me on 2nd July, after the case had been closed, and the prisoners committed for trial—I did not take any statement from him then—I took a statement from him about three weeks ago—I had not taken any statement from him when this case was coining on for trial last Session—I should not have taken it now if Godden had been able to be here—it was because Godden was ill and not able to be here that Matthews was brought as a witness—the case would have been tried last Session, but, owing to Godden's illness, it was postponed, in hopes that he would he well enough to come and give evidence—I first wrote to Mr. Hood, the solicitor for the prosecution, and put the case into his hands, on 2nd July, I believe, after the committal—I don't think I wrote to him later than the 3rd—Mr. Hood's office is at Croydon, seven miles away; a letter from me would reach him in a few hours—Mr. Hood there and then consented to take up the prosecution—I saw him some time afterwards at the Petty Sessions—he did not then tell me that before I had written to him, and after, he was in communi<lb/>cation with Ward, and was likely to act as his solicitor—he told me last Session that Ward's wife had been to him—he did not tell me that he had had an interview with Ward in Holloway Prison on 3rd July—all he told me was that he had seen Ward's wife—I last saw Godden on Saturday—I have no medical knowledge—I have not brought any doctor who has seen him—I told Godden he must get a certificate—he was sit<lb/>ting in a bath chair outside to get some air last Saturday, and I could see that he was very seriously ill—he was suffering from spinal disease he told me; I could see he could not stand on his legs—I do not know from my own knowledge what he suffered from.</p>

                  </hi>. I have-worked for many years, without having any regular engagement, for Mr. Daniels, a stockbroker, and the owner of The Ledgers—Mr. Buxton occupied that house up to April this year—he did not employ me—I was employed on the road—I knew the premises and the outbuildings well when I worked there—I do not know the ladder that was used to get in at the window—a ladder used to be kept by Mr. Daniels in the hay barn in the stack yard—on 5th April I was working all day up to five p.m. on the road; not at Mr. Buxton's, but not half a mile away—while I was at work I saw two respectable-looking young men coming up past me, at something past two, I suppose—they walked beyond me, it might be nearly 100 yards; they did not walk out of my sight—at the end of about 100 yards they sat down on the grass for about half an hour, I should say—I could see them all the time they were sitting there—they had come from the direction of Mr. Buxton's lodge past me—when they got up from the grass they came down the road again, and stopped by me, and one of them with brown clothes asked me the time, and I told them a quarter past three by my watch—they were side by side, and one heard the other; they were standing still, close to me—I cannot say a quarter past three was the exact time; I gave it to them by my watch, which I took out and looked at—they then went down the road again towards Mr. Buxton's place—on 2nd July I went to the God<lb/>stone Justice Room, when Mr. Glyn had the two prisoners before him charged with this burglary—I saw them brought out into the Court, and I knew they were the two men who came to me in the road at Chelsham—I recognised them at once—I was standing in Court when they came out of the cells—after they had been committed for trial I spoke to several policemen in the hearing of Brice outside the Godstone Justice Room, and</p>

The Chelsham policeman brought me word that I had to go to the Justice Room—I did not know whether I was going to see two men tried for committing a burglary on the 5th April—I told the man at Chelsham next day that I had seen two young men—I saw Godden and Mr. Buxton's servants—on 5th April Gilmour had no beard—he had a moustache; I did not notice if he had whiskers—he had not the same hair on his face when he came to me in the road as he had at Godstone—I gave a description of the men next day to Mr. Buxton's servants—the only policeman to whom I gave a description before 2nd July was the Chelsham policeman; he talked to me about them—I told him no more than that I should know the men again if I saw them—I cannot say what he asked me—the Chelsham policeman is my neighbour; I know him quite well—I saw them at the Justice Room, and heard they were charged with committing burglary on 5th April—I had given a description of how the men I saw were dressed—Gilmour had brown clothes and a hard billycock hat, and Ward had dark clothes and a light cap—I cannot say what coloured tie Gilmour had—I did not tell all that to the police that I know of—I and the Chelsham policeman talked together—I took great notice of the men when they came by me—I cannot say how they were dressed when they were in the dock at the Justice Room; I did not go by the dress but by their features—I did not notice if one of the men had a beard—I did not say I thought it was them; I knew they were the men who came to me at Chelsham—I looked at Gilmour's face—he had no hat on when he came out of the cells—I did not notice if he had a beard then—he had altered about the face, but I at once recognised him as the man—the Chelsham policeman brought me word to go to the Justice Room; he did not tell me anything about the men, only that I had to go to Godstone—I did not ask him what for—I did not know then what I was going for—I did not know till I got to Godstone—the man that fetched the prisoners out of the cells said, "You come with me into the Court"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "You look at these two young men when I bring them out, and see if you know them again as you did on the road"—no one asked me anything—I was told to observe the two men as they came out—I did not know what they were accused of.</p>

I was repairing the road, working as usual—I work by the day—one of the two men had a moustache—I don't think the other had much, if he had any; he was younger, and had not much hair on his face—he might have had a little—I did not take particular notice of the men on the 5th April; I looked at them, and when they came back and spoke to me, of course I did notice them—they were not speaking to me for very long—neither man had a beard; one had a moustache, I cannot say if the other had; I did not go quite close to him to see—I heard about the burglary the next day—Mr. Buxton's servants came up the road where I was working, and they told me of it—I had not heard about it till then—I told them about having seen two men the day before—I might have told the Chelsham policeman that I had seen two men; I did not do so that day, because I did not see him, or the next—I saw a policeman come down there the next day, but I did not</p>

I had information of burglaries at Watford and Tunbridge Wells—I was present when Gilmour was taken into custody on suspicion of other charges, not this charge, on May 29th—I went with him to King Street Police-station, Westminster—Ward was brought in in custody there—I did not hear either of them say anything—they were detained and put up for identification, but witnesses failed to identify them, and they were discharged the next day—I saw Sergeant McCarthy search Ward and take from him this key—I had had both prisoners under my observation for two or three months before May 29th—I had seen them together on three occasions—on May 24th I saw them in Hyde Park, close to the Marble Arch; Ward came up from Hyde Park Corner and joined Gilmour in a crowd at a sort of meeting there—they walked together to the middle of the Park where there was no one, and had a consultation for five or six minutes—I was not near enough to see if they were speaking, but they were close together and remained stationary for five or six minutes—then they separated; Ward came away first, and Gilmour walked forty or fifty yards behind him, and then one of them took a seat—on April 4th I saw them standing still together at Hanway Street, Tottenham Court Road—then they called at a place for letters—one went into a shop, and one stood outside; then they walked to Hanway Street, where Gilmour went on and Ward remained—I have no note of the third time I saw them together; but I followed them then from a house near the Elephant and Castle to Liverpool Street, where they took train to Newmarket; that was before April—I was present on June 28th when Ward was arrested on this charge as he was going into his house, Este Road, Battersea.</p>

Gilmour was arrested on the first occasion about nine a.m., and I think he was released the same night—about three or four people were called for the purpose of identification—I don't think a great number of detectives were called in to see them—I was at Scotland Yard that morning, except for about five minutes when I was at the station for the identification—the prisoners were under my observa<lb/>tion in Hyde Park for between half an hour and an hour—they were under my sight from five to ten minutes in Hanway Street, and for about</p>

               <p>half an hour on the third occasion—those were the only occasions I saw them together, and those were altogether under two hours—any detectives could come and see them when they were at the station, and anyone could come across from Scotland Yard and see them; but, notwithstanding that, they were released the same night.</p>

I don't know him"—I said, "That is between yourselves; I don't know anything about that"—I am not sure Gilmour heard that; he could have heard if he was listening—when we spoke about the key Ward said, "That key I found in a train with an old pair of gloves; the gloves I threw away"—Gilmour could have heard that; it was said audibly and not in a whisper in the charge room at King Street—they were detained till a quarter to ten p.m., and then discharged—in the interval we had sent to Tunbridge Wells and Watford—I afterwards arrested both prisoners—Gilmour, I and Brogan took in St. George's Circus, close to the Surrey Theatre—at that time I had had a conversation with Ryan—I said to Gilmour when he was in custody, on 25th June, "You know who I am; I am going to arrest you now for being concerned in a burglary at Chelsham on 5th April. The pro<lb/>perty we found in a safe in Chancery Lane has been identified as part of the property stolen"—Ward's name was not mentioned then—I said, "The key opening the safe that has been found, we have ascertained belonged to you"—he made no reply of any kind—I think he knew the key had been found on Ward—he was present on 29th May, and saw it found on Ward—I said "The key found on Ward opens the safe; we find it belongs to you"—he made no reply—I was with Gough when Ward was taken on 27th June as he was about entering his house at Este Road—I wrote down his statement—he said, "I will go with you, but if I had</p>

               <p>there is some foreign mark upon it, but no English hall-mark—I tested it by rubbing it on a stone and putting acid to it, and it stood the test for fifteen carat gold—I then filed it and found base metal under a coating of gold—this is the file mark; I made two—I told him it was not gold, and I should detain it—he asked me for a receipt for the chain—I told him I could not give him one, but if he liked to fetch a constable in I should hand it to him to make his own inquiries—he went out and in about a quarter of an hour came back with Bryan—I explained to Bryan, and showed him it was not a gold chain—I handed it to him, and they left together—its value is about a sovereign.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Card read</hi>: "J.

I did not tell Lay<lb/>man it was filled with silver. The gold chain in this case was offered in pledge to defendant by my son; he trades under the name of J.

I told Bull that this was a gold chain. I did not say anything about this chain being silver inside. I showed him the invoice produced. Defendant showed me where the chain was filed, and he put some acid on it; he said it was brass. I said it could not be so. I know nothing about the action of chemicals on gold. During the conversation I translated the invoice; at the top are the words, 'filled with silver inside.' This is the translation, 'Gold filled with silver: One gentleman's chain with swivel and bar, 18 guilden; one ditto with ring, 28.50; one ditto, 27; one ditto, 25.50; one ditto, 29.25—128.25.' He declined to give up the chain; he said, 'I should summon him.' I have one of these chains left, No. 5 on the invoice. I have pledged No. 1 chain at a pawnshop in the Borough for £1 10s.; it cost 18 guilden. I did not tell that pawnbroker that the chain was silver inside.

I am assistant to Mr. Layman, a pawnbroker, at High Street, Borough—on 7th December, at eleven a.m., the prisoner called, and showed me this chain, and asked for a loan of £2 10s. on it—I asked him if it was gold, and what carat it was—he said fifteen—I weighed it, and tested it on a stone, and lent him £2 10s.—I did not know it was only plated with gold, and full of base metal—I have since filed and tested it, and find it is metal, cased with gold—I cannot say what metal is inside its value is about £1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot say if any other customer was in my shop when the prisoner came in—no other person was speaking to me—I had every opportunity of examining the chain without anyone else taking up my attention—he gave me this card, "Mr. Leek, 5, St. Martin's Road, S.W."—that is Stockwell—he gave his right name and address—I tested the</p>

               <p>chain with nitric acid after tiling it—I should not like to say what is inside—it turns green with nitric acid—silver turns a very dirty grey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Waterfield, a pawnbroker, of 18, Newington Causeway—on 17th September the prisoner pledged this chain with me in the name of Leek, 5, St. Martin's Road, Stockwell—he asked £2 10s.—I tried it on the stone in the usual way—it stood the test, and I lent him £1 10s.—I have since tested the chain by filing it, and find it is loaded with other metal—I think there is about fifteen shillings' worth of gold in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The pattern is uncommon—I do not think we should allow anything for the workmanship or pattern; we look at the gold—in selling to a customer we should charge not only the absolute cost of materials, but also the workmanship—if the chain were fifteen carat solid gold all through we should charge a customer about £2 for it—it is very common for people to ask more than we give, on jewellery as on other articles—he came about two o'clock—he was in one of the boxes—I was alone—I had full opportunity of examining the chain—no person came up and tried to attract my attention from what was taking place between me and the prisoner—with the most brilliant light in the world I could not have found out that there was base metal inside without filing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Swinfen's executors, pawn<lb/>brokers, in the Kingsland Road—on 10th September the prisoner called on me and showed me an Albert chain, and asked for a loan of £3 10s. on it—I asked him what it was—he said it was fifteen carat gold—I tested it with <hi rend="italic">aqua fortis</hi> and a file, and found that under the surface it was brass—I told him I should detain it—he said again it was fifteen carat gold, and that he would go to the police—this is the chain; it has been in custody of the police—as near as I can tell, the value of it is something under £1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He came about three p.m.—he was in one of the boxes—another assistant was in the shop with me—when I had examined the chain and said it was filled with base metal, he gave me his card, and said he would go to the police-station—the address on his card was 5, St. Martin's Road, Stockwell—I believe he went to the Police-station, which is nearly opposite our house—in superior English chains every link is marked—I saw at once it was a foreign chain—the amount of money we advance depends on the weight—gold, next to platinum, is the heaviest metal—<hi rend="italic">aqua fortis</hi> turns base metal green, and silver dark grey—this turned green—I was rather suspicious of it when I first saw it, and before I tested it—to an outsider there was nothing to suggest that it was filled with brass—it might have been filled with copper or resin.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Constable</hi>). On September 13th Leek came to Scotland Yard and saw me—he said he came to inquire about a gold chain that had been detained when offered in pledge to a pawnbroker the chain was then in my possession, and I said we had received a chain from Mr. Swinfen, a pawnbroker in Kingsland Road, but it was not a gold one—he said, "I bought it for gold from a firm in Holland, and I thought it was gold"—he produced this invoice, and said the second item on it related to the chain in ques<lb/>tion, and I marked it in his presence—I told him his application would have to be laid before the Commissioners, and asked him whether he would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189411190101"/>
               <p>call next day—he said, "No, I cannot as I am going to Holland to-night to reccover the money I paid for the chains"—I said, "Then you consider you have been defrauded?"—he replied, "Yes"—on 21st September another man called on me, and gave the name of Isaac Leek, and said he called on behalf of his father, Joseph Leek—he said he passed under the name of Isaac Georger—I asked him whether he was the son known as Georger—he said he had called to know whether in applying to the Magistrate at Bow Street in regard to the chain, another chain that I had received at the Guildhall the day previously might be included in the same summons; I referred him to the Magistrate's clerk—on 21st September I was at Bow Street, when the prisoner applied for a summons against the police for detaining these chains—Georger was with him—in the course of conversation the prisoner said he was his son, and had had some dealings with one of the chains, and that was the reason of his coming to the Court—the summons was heard the week following, and adjourned <hi rend="italic">sine die</hi>—on 18th October I went with Croston to 5, St. Martin's Road, where I saw the prisoner—he asked me whether I still had his invoice—I said, "Yes." and asked him whether he had a receipt—he said, "No, he had not paid for the things yet"—I am sure he said on the first occasion that he had paid for them: that led me to ask whether he had been defrauded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi> The prisoner won in the hands of the police on a charge of fraud on 18th October—that was by warrant—I ascertained that Georger left the country the same evening; I swear that—we went to his house about nine p.m.—I believe Croston has made inquiries about the prisoner I do not know if he is a man of irreproachable character—the invoice, with the address of the maker of the chains, was left at Scotland Yard on 13th September—I am not aware if detective officers at Scotland Yard are in communication with the detective police of Amsterdam—I know they have means of doing so—I am not in the Foreign Department, but in the Convict Supervision Department, which deals with prisoners' property and property detained by pawnbrokers—the prisoner was not arrested till 18th October—he went to Bow Street about the chain offered to Swinfen; he applied for a summons for that and another chain—I know now that when the prisoner was questioned about these matters he gave information about the chains pawned in the Borough; I believe he gave the addresses at which he had pawned them—I don't know if it was entirely through the information he gave that I traced the chains to Layman—it was not from information that I received elsewhere that I traced them—we have not been able to trace the fifth chain—I don't know that he has not attempted to pawn that after going to Scotland Yard and receiving warning—I did not remark that he spoke with a strong foreign accent; I understood him very well.</p>

               <p>and I had sent if to Scotland Yard, where he would have to apply—he said it could not be worthless as it bore the Dutch hall-mark and was fourteen carat gold, and he pointed out the mark—he asked me to send it into Scotland Yard as soon as I could, as he wanted to go to Amsterdam to see the makers about it, and get back by Sunday—I said I would send it in at once—he said, "If the chains are worthless I have already pledged two over the water"—I asked him "Where?"—he said, "Near the Elephant"—he said he had a good posi<lb/>tion in the City and was well known at the Dutch Consulate; he did not want to get into trouble over the chains—I told him to go and see the pawnbrokers, and he left with the intention of going there, I believe—I bent the chains to Scotland Yard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have to make special inquiries among pawnbrokers—until the prisoner mentioned that he had pawned two of the chains near the Elephant and Castle, I knew nothing about them; so that the information about the pawnings with Layman and Waterfield came from the prisoner—I have not made inquiries in the City, or at the Dutch Consulate; I cannot say if anyone has—the prisoner spoke in a strong foreign accent.</p>
