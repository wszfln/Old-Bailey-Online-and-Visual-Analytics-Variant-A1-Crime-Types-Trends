They showed us the keys and said, 'We have clicked'"; that means they had effected a robbery, "and treated us; in fact, we had no money, and if you make inquiries at the coffee stall outside Whitechapel Church, you will find we had refreshments there and ran away, without paying. I have not done anything for a long time"—Parks said, "That is right"—he said he was at the lodging house all that night, but he afterwards said that he was at the coffee stall—we arrested three men altogether.</p>

                  </hi> (473 <hi rend="italic">T.</hi>) On March 1st was on duty at Kew Bridge in the afternoon, when Lake made a. communication to me, and pointed out Jones, who was twenty to twenty-five yards from the post office, 627, High Road, on the same side, but nearer London—I communicated with another constable and kept observation—I saw Worth leave the post office, 627, High Road—he was arrested—Jones looked at me and the other constable (<hi rend="italic">Calmer</hi>), and then beat his horse and went off full gallop towards London—I ran about 200 yards, got on a tram, rode some dis<lb/>tance, then hailed a passing motor car, and followed on that for about a mile or three quarters of a mile, when I got down and stopped him—I said, "I shall arrest you for being concerned with another man, in custody, for attempting to utter counterfeit coin at Twickenham and High Road, Chiswick"—he replied, "What do you want me for? I do not know the other man. If you think I have got anything search me"—he had in his hand a parcel, which I put back into the cart—it contained the articles produced (<hi rend="italic">Two packets of envelopes, three packets of cigarettes, a little memorandum book, a knife, and a pencil case</hi>)—these things were produced on the remand—at the time I caught the prisoner they had not been touched, and looked as if they had been purchased that day—all are new except this key—I told him he would get the parcel later on—I took him to the station, and, with the assistance of a private person, the horse was led behind—on searching him at the station, I found upon him 10s. silver and 9d. bronze, good money—he made no reply to the charge—when asked his address he gave it as Rowton House, Vauxhall—he was <hi rend="italic">strictly</hi> searched.</p>

               <p>had seen him go—before I arrested him I saw him throw a coin away, and Mr. Lake went into a garden and brought me back this coin—it is perfectly Hat—I took him to the station—I searched him on the spot—he was afterwards <hi rend="italic">strictly</hi> searched at the police station—that means that all his clothes were removed—I made him open his mouth—I did not find this bent coin (<hi rend="italic">The bent good half crown</hi>)—I found in his pockets on the spot, 7d., two halfpennies, and one florin—after the first remand before the Magistrate, from Wednesday to Friday. Jones told Worth to produce the half crown out of his pocket—Worth then produced this good, bent half crown from his left waistcoat pocket, and handed it to the assistant gaoler of the Court—he was then wearing a different coat and a different hat.</p>

I am Inspector of Coin to His Majesty's Mint—this bent half crown is good—this unbent half crown is bad—the good half crown, in my opinion, has not been bent in this tester pro<lb/>duced by Mr. Lake, because it docs not seem to have received the grip or bite of a tester of this size, and there is a mark on the milling about 3/4 in. long, whereas this is a in. tester—the notches vary in size according to the coin tested—it requires immense force to bend a good half crown; it will bend back without breaking, but if you try to bend a bad one back you break it—a bad one bends easily—this one is rather thicker than usual, and might require a little more force, but not very much in a tester—I will bend it—the coin is put in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> way—the tester is fastened tosomething.</p>

Statement of Leon Pinkerwitz says: I am an interpreter. I have up to this morning been residing with my brother, Alexander Pinkerwitz, 34, Boulevard de Sevastople, Paris; I mean that I had a room with my brother, but have not slept there for two nights. On Monday last, about 2.30 p.m., I was in the Cafe Miller, at the corner of Boulevard des Italiens, Paris, when a man whom I have been associating with for about four days, and whom I knew by the name of Alfred, came into the Cafe Miller with the young woman whom the police have found me in company with. I do not know her name, I do not know her age, but she told me that she was nineteen. We stayed together in the cafe for about ten minutes, when Alfred left, with the young woman. Before he left he asked me to meet him at a cafe in Paris, I do not remember the name, at 9 a.m., to take the young woman to Dover. He said when I got there I should meet a big, fair man who would take her to London, and I would receive 50 francs. I agreed to do this. At 9 a.m. this morning I met Alfred and the young woman, as already arranged, at the cafe. He gave me the ticket, No. 207. and said.' There is your ticket to Dover and back,' and gave the girl her ticket to London. I do not know why the young lady came to London; I did not ask her, and she did not tell me. The young woman and I left Paris by the 9.45 train, and arrived at Dover at 1 p.m. When I got there I could not find the man. I waited till 5 o'clock, then accompanied her to London. When we were at Dover the young woman said,' You have been so kind, Leon, to bring me to Dover, and now that the man who should have met me is not here, will you be kind enough to take me to my friends who live</p>

That is all I know about the girl, except that I lived with her at a hotel in Rue Summarta. Paris, for one night, and that was Wednesday night last, hut I had no business with her.—Leon Pinkerwitz. This statement, on being read over to me, I desire to give further explanation. At the hotel in the Rue Summarta, Paris, occupied a room by myself, and She occupied another room with Alfred. I have no home in London. This statement that I have made is purely voluntary.—<hi rend="largeCaps">LEON PINKERWITZ</hi>. With regard to receipt No. 3137, it refers to a wooden box at Calais which I believe belongs to the young woman. The man whom I know as Alfred asked me to go to the Registration Office and ask them to send it to London I took no notice of his request as he told me I was not to open the box at the Customs House and I thought there was something wrong with it"—there was a box in Paris—the ticket 3137 found on the prisoner is here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the General Relieving Officer of the Hackney Union, and live at 62, Christie Road, South Hackney—about 1235 a.m. on March 9th I was in Amhurst Road. Hackney, accompanied by Mr. Coffee. who is an assistant of mine—we were going towards home—just as we had got to Manor Place four men came across the road—when they got within striking distance the prisoner said, "Now then." and made to strike me with a heavy stick or some instrument of that description—I put up my hand and received the blow across my fingers—the blow just caught my nose and caused it to blood—I struck out at once, and the prisoner stumbled—I do not know whether I struck him fully or not—I said, "Come on" to Cottee, and found that he was on the ground—the three other men were attacking me, so I backed away, when they all ran away—I think they must have seen a policeman coming as I was backing away—we told the policeman who came up about it—Cottee was covered with blood and badly hurt, so we took him to the hospital—when we had got past Hackney Downs Station, which is about 400 yards from Amhurst Road, we heard a shout of "Help!?"—the policeman and I ran in the direction from which the shout came, and we saw a man running through Navarino Road into Graham Road, being followed by another man—when we got to Graham Road we found the prisoner being stopped by a short man, a private individual—I said to the policeman, "That is the man who assaulted my friend"—I went to the station with them, and was examined by the divisional surgeon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say when we came up to the prisoner, "I think this is one of the men"—I certainly did not hit the prisoner on the head when he was in custody—I may have been a little excited, but I do not think the constable told me to keep cool—the prisoner is a perfect stranger to me—Amhurst Road is a road of private houses lit up in the ordinary way—the four men came up as if (hey were going to</p>

Stratford, and the prisoner there—I examined them—Watson was suffering from a lacerated upper lip, which had the appearance of being transfixed by his teeth—I also found contusions which may have been caused by a blow—Cottee had a laceration on the left side of the bridge of his nose, exposing the left nasal bone, and on the right side the nasal bone was fractured—he also had a contusion on the right side of the back of his head—a very severe blow must have caused them, probably from some blunt instrument—the prisoner had a contused upper lip and a slight abrasion on the right side of his neck, apparently nail marks—on the fore finger of his right hand were two or three small wounds, apparently teeth marks, and on the second knuckle of the same hand was a slight abrasion—the wound on the mouth had probably been caused by a blow.</p>

I am cashier at the London and County Bank, Lombard Street—the Union Insurance Society of Canton, Limited, have an account there—Mr. Douglas Jones, for the Society, signs cheques and documents which come to the bank—this document marked "A" purports to be a bill of exchange dated December 19th, 1903, drawn by "J. H. Marshall &amp; Cow" on the Union Insurance Society of Canton, Limited, payable on February 14th, 1904, with three days' grace—"Union Insurance Society of Canton, Limited," is stamped with a rubber</p>

I am a cashier at the London and County Bank, Lombard Street—on February 20th last I was there shortly before closing time—Mr. Jemmett brought me the bill produced and asked me what I thought of it, then he went away—I walked down to his desk and saw the prisoner there—I said to him, "Have not they settled up your business yet?" or some words like that—he said, "No," and gave some answer—I went back to my desk—when Jemmett came back, the prisoner had gone—the following week I went to Old Jewry, and was shown nine or ten photographs by Mr. Disney—Mr. Jemmett was not there—I picked out the prisoner's photograph—the next day I again went, and was taken into the yard, and there saw nine men standing in a semi-circle—I picked out the prisoner—they were all wearing glasses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a comedian, and live at 36, Dorothy Road, Lavender Hill, Clapham Junction—I have known the prisoner for about three years—I heard of his arrest the day after it—the prisoner on Friday, February 10th, was at my mother's house—in the evening he went out with my sister—he came back at night and slept there in a top room—next morning I breakfasted with him between 9.30 and 10—after, we went to the Free Library—we then returned—we stayed indoors a little while and then went to the railway station and bought a paper—the prisoner came with me out of the station, and said he was going to the South-Western Photographic Stores—that was about 11.20—I went home—about twenty minutes after I again saw him at our house with a camera—I took his photo, and he took mine, which took us up to dinner time; that was about one o'clock—the prisoner was in my company from the time he rejoined me, up to dinner time—dinner took about thirty minutes—he went out before me, about 1.40; he said he was going to a matinee—he came back about 2.20, and he was in the house until the evening—when he came back he had with him a rough proof of a photo of a lady)'; it was an enlargement—he told me it came from the South Western Stores, Mr. Jackson's—in the evening the prisoner, myself, and my sister took the proof to the Metropole Theatre, and we stayed there all the evening—we three came home together—I am certain the prisoner was in our house from 11.40 until after dinner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier of the National Cash Register Company, Limited—when a salesman collected money he would, as a rule, pay it over to me or to my assistant, Mr. Smith—the salesman makes out a slip with the name and address of the customer and the amount—if he does not do it, we do it for him—that slip is handed over to the book-keeper who enters it into a cash book—when a salesman makes a con<lb/>tract he lodges it with us together with the amount he has received—his commission is made a note of on the face of the contract—I have examined the books with regard to Mrs. Sackett's account, and find that she had agreed to pay five guineas down and three guineas a month—according to this account, which is a copy of the Company's books, she paid £5 5s. on October 29th, £3 3s. on December 1st. and £3 3s. on January 11th, which sums the prisoner handed to us—if she paid the prisoner £19 in cash besides the £5 5s.—the prisoner must account to us for the difference between £6 6s. and £19, which is £12 14s.—there is no note of our having received that £19—the prisoner paid us on account of Dale £5 5s., and on January 4th £2 2s.—we credited him £2 17s. that Dale had paid for supplies—if he received £12 18s. 9d. beyond that he has to account to us for the difference between that and the £4 19s., which is £7 19s. 9d., for which the Company's books show no receipt—Hammett entered into a contract to pay ten guineas down and six guineas a month—the only sum the prisoner paid the Com<lb/>pany on his behalf was ten guineas—if he were paid £12 6s. 10 1/2 d. over that he has still to account for it—on February 6th his contract was cancelled—I did not see him at all after January—during the time men are learning in the school it is customary to advance them £2 a week for subsistence—I produce the account showing the amount advanced to the prisoner for subsistence while he was in the school, from September 9th to October 20th, and while he was directly under the Company from December 4th on<lb/>wards—on one side are the amounts he was entitled to for commission up to February 23rd—the balance shows that the prisoner owes the Company £17 13s. 2d., to which has to be added £9 13s. 7d., the amount advanced to him by Sibbald, and a sum of £5 18s. 1d. which has been credited to his account twice for commission—I found that a Mr. Jones had agreed with the prisoner to exchange a machine, and this led up to the mistake—these sums together make £33 4s. 10d., being the amount over advanced to him, to which has to be added £39 0s. 7 1/2 d., money he has received and not handed over; therefore when he left he was owing the Company £72 5s. 5 1/2 d.—according to his contract we should pay back Mr. Sibbald</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190403210030"/>
               <p>the £9 13s. 7d. advanced by him and charge the prisoner with it—I have prepared a prospective commission account showing the commissions the prisoner would he entitled to in the future if the full money on the con<lb/>tracts were paid (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it shows that he would have been entitled if he hail stopped with the Company to £33 17s. 11d. prospective com<lb/>missions—we have credited him with this, although the contracts were not completed—deducting from that his liability to the Company of £33 4s. 10d., it would leave, as owing from the Company to him, the sum of 13s. 1d., against which, of course, has to be put £39 0s. 7 1/2 d., moneys unaccounted for—we did not give receipts to the prisoner unless he asked for them, which, to my knowledge, he never did—he never complained that there was any mistake in his accounts—we send receipts to the customer, therefore if there were any irregularity he could find out from the customers themselves what sums had been paid—the regular discount is 5 per cent, for cash, and we recognize no other discount—I have never received any money from the prisoner without entering it on a slip and sending it to the book keeper to be entered.</p>

               <p>account—I had nothing to do with his references—I had nothing to do with the fidelity bond—I know that we charged him £2 9s. 6d. for it—it is not for me to say why we have not made any claim on the Fidelity Company—we have made the prospective commission account separate from his account with the Company because the prospective commissions might never have come to anything—"unshipped" means that the Com<lb/>pany has an order for a register, but it has not been delivered—"shipped" means that it has been delivered, but no cash has been paid—we leave it entirely to the agents to make inquiries as to the customers' standing—until the whole amount is paid the agent is not entitled to get full com<lb/>mission—the prisoner is not entitled to commission on repeat orders, as he has left the Company—he was a first class agent—I do not know what—money he spent in getting orders—only a small part of the work is public-house work—no expenses were allowed to agents—he was charged for the hire of a brougham—the £2 17s. for supplies charged against him in Hammett's account should have been recovered from him at the time.</p>

Mr. Craxton is at Swindon"—Snellgrove asked what time they should come—I said, "About 2 o'clock."—we did not go at once because the bar is cleaned every Saturday night, and it takes till about that time—Snellgrove said, "The job will be done to-night"—I went back to the house and finished my work—I informed my master and Inspector Collins of everything as it happened—at 2 a.m. I was outside my house talking to the potman—I heard someone walking down the road very quickly—the public house was all in darkness—I had finished about 1.30 and turned the lights out—I went inside my own house in Greyhound Road, about 100 yards off, with the potman—a light is left in the saloon bar, and there were several lights up stairs—there are lights in the bar all night—when I was inside the house I heard a low whistle—Holder came up to me and said, "Mr. Trumper, the bar manager, has not gone to bed yet"—his light was not out in his bedroom—immediately after that Snellgrove came along and asked if I was selling them—I said, "No, I am not"—he said, "We will let it stand for about an hour or so"—it had been arranged on the Sunday morning that they were to come into the house through the pothouse door into the yard—that is at the side of the house—I was to leave the bolt and the night latch off, so as to leave it unfastened—two police officers near the Greyhound Road asked me what I was hanging about for, and what I was doing there—after I had spoken to them I went back to the Greyhound, where five officers were concealed on the premises—I went upstairs into the dining room for five or ten minutes—looking out, I saw Holder coming from Putney way up Crab Tree Lane, and double back and go towards Hammersmith—nothing was done that night—at 9 p.m. on February 7th Holder came into the bar of the house with Allsopp, who was a stranger—Holder introduced him to me as Mr. Johnson, an electrician—Holder said, "Do you mind letting Mr. Johnson see the electric plant?"—I said, "No, I do not mind," and we all three went into the engine room and then came back into the saloon bar to have a drink—I left Holder in the bar, and Allsopp and I went into the luncheon room—Holder asked me if anybody knew about their trying to come in—I said, "Nobody knows"—he said, "I intend to <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> small till next Friday night"—that meant that he would keep away from the house, I suppose—he said they had been disturbed on the previous night by a police officer—he said it would be best for me to let them in through the mineral water factory door in the Aspenley Road, which would lead into the passage by my engine room into the concert room, and then into the luncheon room and into the bar—these premises adjoin, though they are not</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 36, Iverson Road, Kilburn, and am a motor car driver—I was formerly a gas fitter—I have been in the Army, and was discharged in July, 1902—in July, 1903, I saw this adver<lb/>tisement "A safe investment producing 10s. per week for every £10 invested, without risk of loss. Money withdrawable at any time. Address for full particulars, 'Chubb's,' Box 4046, Postal Department, <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, Fleet Street, E.C."—I answered it and got a reply from 14, Abbey Court, Abbey Road, N.W., also a circular signed, "Brown,</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This explained a mode of speculation on the turf by means of a "favourite" system</hi>)—at the end of it were testimonials, but with no names or addresses, just the town given—I wrote for a reference, and received a reply from Brown, Bell &amp; Co. referring to"—M. Oberlander, Esq., The Homestead, Oxford Road. Upper Teddington"—I went there, and saw the prisoner, who represented himself to be Mr. Oberlander—I told him I had been in communication with Brown. Bell &amp; Co., and they had referred me to him—I asked him if he had had dealings with the firm, and if he found them satisfactory and always got his winnings—he said he had a considerable sum invested with them, and had found his dealings very satisfactory, and that on one occasion he was short of cash, and had applied to them for some of his capital to be returned, and it had been sent by messenger, so as to save time—this was to show how obliging they were—I believed all he told me—he represented himself to be a patent agent—I had no idea who Brown, Bell &amp; Co. were—I went home and thought the matter over—I then wrote to Brown, Bell &amp; Co., telling them I was satisfied with the reference they had given, and would commence business at once—in the same letter I forwarded £80 in bank notes—I received a receipt on July 27th, 1903—the next com<lb/>munication I had from them was a letter with £4, stating that it was a weed's profit on the money—I received no more profits for a time, and I wrote them letters—I got one reply, stating that they had sent letters which must have been lost through the post—I kept on writing them—I received this letter on August 14th, from 18, Featherstone Buildings (<hi rend="italic">Staling that all winnings would be sent next week</hi>)—on October 15th I received a balance sheet from them—I should have had one every month, according to their circular—that showed a loss of about £32, the way they put it—I do not know whether any money was laid on any, of the horses mentioned in it, or whether losses or winnings resulted—I have received no other balance sheet—I asked for the return of my money, with no result—I called at 18. Featherstone Buildings, but saw only a lady typist—I left a note stating that I should communicate with the police, and received a reply that if I did so I rendered myself liable to prosecution for libel, and asked me not to call at the office again—they sent me £2—I wrote asking for £10 or £20 on account, but got no reply—I then communicated with the police and swore an information—I received some time in February a letter from a firm of solicitors which commenced, "We have been consulted by Mr. Oberland, trading as Brown, Bell &amp; Co."—that was the first intimation I had that Brown, Bell &amp; Co. and Oberlander were one and the same—I received altogether £7 from them—I have frequently applied for the return of my money, but without success.</p>

I live at "The Homestead," Oxford Road, Teddington. with my mother, sister and brother—the prisoner came to reside at our house in July, 1903—he told us he was a patent agent and also managing director of the Utility Company—some days afterwards he showed me a paper Which I thought was a prospectus of the Utility Com<lb/>pany, and in it was written that he and a Mr. Cross were joint managing directors at £500 a year and part profits—I think this was about August 20th—he told me he wished someone would lend him £200 for business purposes—I asked him if it was for the Utility Company and that kind of business, and he said "Yes"—he also said he could not be a managing director for more than five or seven years. I forget which; the Govern<lb/>ment did not allow it—I believed what he told me. and got the money from my brother; he had £100 on. I think, August 20th, and £60 about August 27th by my brother's cheque—he paid back altogether £30—in October he had another £25 from my mother—apart from the £30. I have received nothing back.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew the prisoner very well—I went twice to race-courses with him—I did not know he was betting a good deal—he told me once that he had to go to Holland about some betting transactions—I did not know he was in difficulties because the people there owed him money—I was not attached to him; I liked him—I did not offer to let him have the money, seeing he was ill and worried, and knowing it was for</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing director of the Utility Company—I have known the prisoner since about February 8th, 1903—I have seen him a good deal since—he has written me a letter or two—the Utility Company import novelties and deal in foreign patented goods—the prisoner used to come to the Company's office almost daily from May, 1903, to write letters and that sort of thing—his connection with the Company was with me solely—the Company was registered in July, but there was no prospectus issued—he came to me the latter part of May with 100 to 150 envelopes—one had a name and address on. and he asked me if I would type the same on the others—he said he had promised to get them done for a friend of his—the name and address were Brown, Bell &amp; Co., somewhere at Abbey Court—the prisoner was not appointed managing director of my Company—he has never been an officer of the Company in any shape or form—as far as I know, his name was never printed on any document as the managing director or co-director with me, not with my authority.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The office at 5. New Oxford Street was taken in the prisoner's name—it was arranged that the prisoner was to find a portion of the preliminary expenses, and if he did he was to be a director with me—there was no printed memorandum or articles, to my knowledge, got out with our two names on it and the statement that we should receive £500 a year each—such a document would have correctly represented the state of affairs it he could have found a certain amount of money—he did not find the money—there was a proof prospectus in which the names were left blank.</p>

E. Hollebone; on October 2nd I find cheques paid in for £50 and £10—the one for £50 was A. Ferguson's cheque, payable to Brown, Bell &amp; Co. on the Wilts and Dorset Bank, Salisbury, and the £10 was P. C. Calkin's cheque to Brown. Bell &amp; Co.—there were thirteen cheques paid into the account, seven of them payable to Brown, Bell &amp; Co.—the account was closed on December 31st, 1903—£713 was paid in altogether in cheques and cash, and all drawn out.</p>

You don't deny that you carried on business in that name"—he said, "Mr. Baxter knows I did"—I said, "But I understand your name is Oberland or Oberlander, and that you live at Teddington"—he said, "That is right. Who is complaining?"—I said, "You ought to know: you have your books"—ho said, "In moving I lost them. If you will tell me who they are I will communicate with them"—I said, "They have made repeated applications"—he said, "The business has not been so good as I thought it would be"—I then came away—a few days after Mr. Brown, the prosecutor, came to see me—he made an application to the Magistrate, and a warrant was granted, which I received, I think on February 13th—I could not find the prisoner until the 19th, when I saw him at Little Marlborough Street about 6 p.m., with Servant Springer—I said, "You know mo: I am Inspector Dew"—he said, "Yes; don't tell my wife anything"—he went into his flat and I read the warrant to him—he said, "that is what he says," meaning Brown—on the way to the station he said, "It won't come to anything"—when the charge was read over to him he made no reply—I made a casual search of the flat and found a contract note for goods pledged for £6 odd the day I arrested him. Several letters relating to a loan on furniture, and unpaid bills—we found nothing of any importance at Dacre House—there were no account books, but</p>

I am the wife of Charles William Bream, of 38, Bassing<lb/>ton Road, Wandsworth—I have known the prisoner for six or seven years—she entered my service as servant in the early part of November. 1903, for daily work, and she came to sleep there about a fortnight before Christmas—I noticed she was a little stout, but she said she was attending the hospital for dropsy—she went from my house twice about the end of November to go to the hospital—she was always complaining about her leg, which was very much swollen—she showed it to me—on the evening of January 23rd she complained of not feeling well, and I told her to go to bed—she said she had a bad headache—she went to bed about 9 or 9.30—she slept in a room by herself at the top of the house, at the back—I asked her to call me at seven next morning—she did not call me—I awoke at 8.50—I called up stairs to my little boys to call the prisoner—I got no answer, so I called her myself—she said, "Come up stairs; I want to speak to you"—I went up—she was in bed—I noticed a lot of water on the floor—she told me she had not been well in the night, and said, "You see I have had dropsy; all this water has run away from me"—she said</p>

               <p>she had been sick in the night—I looked into the chamber, but only saw where she had been sick; there was nothing else there—there was a tiny spot of blood on her pillow—I wanted her to let me send for a doctor and her mother—she said she did not want a doctor, and did not want her mother to be worried—I fetched her some hot milk, and then some egg and bacon for breakfast, which she did not eat—she did not get up that day—she complained of her leg, and I told her she had better stay in bed—I am always out all day on Mondays—I go out soon after 8 or 8.30 a.m. till about 10 p.m.—T help a lady collect her father's rents—when I returned, the prisoner was still in bed—my children made a statement to me, and I went up to the prisoner and spoke to her—I did not say if she was to get up next day, Tuesday, or not—when she came down to breakfast I noticed that she was much slighter—she did some light work that day—I sent for her mother during the day—she came about 2 o'clock—the prisoner did not get up on the Wednesday morning—I went up to her room—she said her leg was bad, and she could not get up—I told her she had better have a doctor—she said she did not want one—I went down-stairs—I returned to her room between nine and ten a.m. to get the dirty clothes to be washed, as the woman was coming to wash—the prisoner generally did the washing, but I had to get a woman in, as the prisoner was not well—when I went into the room I saw some underlinen which had been washed out, hanging on the back of the wash-hand stand—there was a white petticoat with a deep blood stain on it—it had been washed, but the stain had not come out—the prisoner told me the sheets were under the dressing table in a pillow case, and that she had washed them, as she had been sick on them in the night, and did not want the woman to see them—when I took them down stairs I looked at them—they were still wet, and I could see there had been blood stains on them—I sent for Dr. Charlsworth—he came between twelve and one—I went up with him—he asked the prisoner what was the matter—she said, "I am suffering from dropsy"—he told her she had had a child—she said, "Oh, no, I have not"—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was very much distressed when I saw her, and she was pale and bloodless—I did not examine her leg. and she did not mention it to me—I examined her to see if she had given birth to a child, because she denied it—it is impossible to say if it was her first child—there were indications that she might have suffered considerable pain—the delivery might be rapid or slow—she was ruptured up to the anus—if there was no pain the labour would be much longer—the after part of the child might not be born for a few minutes after the head, but it generally takes a short time—there is great straining to get it over—the child generally breathes before the delivery is over; in some cases it makes a successful effort to breathe between the birth of the head and the birth of. The body, but it is difficult to breathe before the lungs can be fully inflated—as the child descends the umbilical cord shortens—there is a certain amount of slackness in it which might suffocate the child, but I think there would not be distinct signs of a separate existence—a child often dies before the completion of the labour—mental trouble might increase the difficulty of parturition—after the birth there is generally a period of exhaustion on the part of the mother, and sometimes unconsciousness—in cases where there is considerable hemorrhage the mental condition, I should say, would not be so good as in an ordinary labour where there is little hemorrhage—puerperal mania might occur after a few days—I did not treat the prisoner—she was sent to the infirmary—I only saw her for a few minutes—she had very little temperature then, but she had evidently lost a considerable amount of blood—the mark on the child's neck need not necessarily have been caused by a cloth—I do not think the fingers could have caused it, because it was too regular, and it completely en<lb/>circled the neck—I do not think it could have been done before the child was completely born, because the only way it could have been done then would be by the umbilical cord, and the mark did not correspond with that—the mark was not like what you get in an ordinary labour—if the violence was caused before the child was completely born there would not be distinct signs of a separate existence—I did not make the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>

               <p>examination—the pains in the prisoner's stomach would have no action upon parturition—I take it she probably had anaemia, and gastralgia is one of the frequent accompaniments of parturition—if one is in a state of debility, one would be less prepared for the exceptional trial of parturition.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Assuming that the lungs had been fully expanded, in my opinion it would have been impossible for the constriction to the child's neck to have been caused by the umbilical cord—if the injury was inflicted before the child was fully born the lungs would not be properly inflated—the inflation of the lungs does not indicate complete separation from the mother—before the cord is divided a child frequently cries—apart from the umbilical cord, the inflation of the lungs and the child crying indicates a separate existence.</p>

I am a pathologist, and on January 28th I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the body of a newly born female child—it was 22 in. long and weighed 71b. 3 oz., and was in an excel<lb/>lent state of preservation—the umbilical cord had been torn across 1 1/2 in. from its insertion into the abdomen—it was a full time child—there was a broad encircling mark of constriction running round the neck below the thyroid cartilage—the mark was pale and soft—there were no hemorr<lb/>hages under the skin—the child's hands were clenched—the mucous membrane covering the inside of the lids was blood shot, the nostrils and lips were livid, the mouth slightly open, and the tongue partly protruding; on opening the back of the scalp I found a number of small hemorrhages on the under surfaces of the scalp, in front and behind; the brain was well developed, and the veins of the brain were distended with dark liquid blood; I found two hemorrhages on the back of the tongue, each the size of a lentil, and a number of smaller ones in the mucous membrane covering the tonsils; the veins of the tongues were distended with dark liquid blood; under the skin covering the neck, above the constriction, were numerous hemorrhages, and others in the muscles surrounding the larynx and the back of the head—the lungs were developed and fully inflated, and floated in water, and the air in them could not be squeezed out of them by hand pressure; the heart was extended: the stomach contained air and floated on water—the cause of death was suffocation by strangulation by some soft material being tightly wound round the neck; my reasons for that opinion are the width to the encircling mark, which was from 1 in. to 1 1/2 in, and the absence of hemorrhages in the skin—I formed the opinion that the child had been completely born, and I do not think there can be any doubt about it; my reasons are the absence of any foreign substance in the air passages, the complete inflation of the lungs, and the presence of air in the stomach, which shows that breathing had been going on for some time.</p>

               <p>this case the lungs were only partially inflated; the marks on the child's neck would not have a tendency to spread over the body after death; it would be impossible to form with the fingers such a complete encircling mark; if it was caused by the fingers, parts of the mark would be much deeper than others, and there would be marks of bruising; there were none here, and no hemorrhage where the constriction had gone round; the skin had simply been pressed and made bloodless; one of the chief reasons why the mark could not have been caused by the umbilical cord is that if it had caused it the lungs could not have been inflated fully—apart from the appearance of the mark the appearance is wholly inconsistent with the mark having been caused by the cord—a woman having her first child may, in a way, be affected mentally; there would be pain during the birth, which would be accentuated by depression—child birth is very often followed by a period of partial or total unconsciousness—a woman might not know what was going on around her, or what she was doing herself—I do not think that child birth is a surprising branch of medical science; complexities occur sometimes, but rather rarely—an ulcerated stomach would make a person anaemic, and takes up their strength—I think in this case the child was expelled rather quickly, and the cord so broken across—the cord was not tied; that would not cause the child's death; when it is broken across the ends would coil up, and no bleeding would take place from the stomach.</p>
