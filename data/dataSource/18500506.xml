On 19th March I heard of the National school-house at Kingsbury being opened and robbed—On 27th March I followed the prisoner to a house in Camden-town—I asked Mrs. White, in his presence, whether the prisoner lodged there—she said "No"—I asked her whether he had got any property there—the prisoner said, "No" but she said he had left a parcel there a few days previous—I opened the parcel and looked at the things—I asked the prisoner if it belonged to him—he said it did; he bought the things of a man in the Edgware-road—I said I believed it to be stolen, and I should take him into custody—I searched him, and found on him these keys—my brother officer asked him whether he knew anything about a clock—he said, "No"—Mrs. White said, "Yes, you brought one and sold it in Camden-town for 3<hi rend="italic">s."</hi>—he said nothing to that—I took him to the station—I then went to a broker's shop and found this clock—I afterwards took the keys to the school and fitted them to the locks—every key fitted some lock there.</p>

I was at the Blue Posts, Newman-street, Oxford-street—the prisoner was there, and a man named Burnell—Cruise showed me a book in Burnell's presence, which he said was a list of houses he had indicted—he said they were in the habit of taking houses and opening there—he said, "I get my living by it"—he wished me to join them, and said, "I shall make hatfulls of money; it is our living, we have done so for years"—in the list was the name of a person I knew, Joseph Gillham—I asked him what sort of a man he was—he described him, and I said, "I know the man, he gave my wife away when I was married in 1833, and I am sure he never did any<lb/>thing of the kind"—I meant, keeping a brothel—I said, "You must make a mistake, and I will see you again"—he said, "Very well"—I declined seeing him again, knowing he was wrong—he said Gillbam was one of the gang who kept the brothels in James-street, Oxendon-street—they said, "We have in<lb/>dicted eighteen, and shall make lots of money by it"—they said they prosecuted Gillham merely to make money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Cowley-street, Westminster, and am a law-writer; I was twenty years in Gilby and Allen's service, of Carlisle-street, Soho, and acted as clerk at the Westminster Sessions. About a year and a half ago, I took the house, 15, Melton-crescent, for my own occupation—my wife is an embroidress, and has apprentices—I did not go to live there because there was a brothel next door—I let it to a man named Allen, for 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; the rest I was to pay. On 25th Nov., Burnell called on me, and wished me to assist him in getting up some prosecutions, which I declined; and on 29th I attended at Westminster Hall, and found out that I was indicted—I saw Cruise and Burnell sworn, and saw them go before the Grand Jury—I afterwards met Burnell in Coventry-street, and he said I was a scamp for not assisting him, and he would give me a dose for it—here is the indictment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prosecutor is Frederick Cruise, of 51, Mount-street, Gros<lb/>venor-square, paper-hanger and decorator—I went to that address, and saw Cruise's mother—I met him on 30th Nov. by Westminster Hall, and asked him to give me his correct address, as I wished to serve him with notice of bail—he said if the notices were ready, he would accept them; but as they required signing and dating, I asked him to go into the Exchequer coffee-house while I did them—I signed my name, Joseph Gillham, to the notices—Cruise said, "Is your name Gillham, for if it is, Burnell has deceived me, for I took you for Twigg, and Twigg for you"—we have both been indicted since—he said he wished to God he had had nothing to do with it, he saw that Burnell was misleading him, and it would end in his being <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi>—I asked him where he indicted me for—he said, for Euston-square, and that he did not know where the house was situated until a few nights before, when Burnell pointed it out to him—a couple of days after, Twigg and Allen called on me, and in consequence of what they said I went to Whitcomb-street, Haymarket, and found Cruise and a man named Merritt—Cruise called me out, and said, "I will not say anything in the presence of those persons" (Twigg and Allen)—he said, "I am afraid I have got into a <hi rend="italic">mess"</hi>—I said it was his own doing, and I could not help it—he said he would rather stop the matter if he could; if I would give him the money it would cost to put in bail, instead of paying it to the Judge's clerk, he would get the warrant and burn it—he offered to go with me to the Crown-office to get the certificate and warrant—that would have come to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we went into the public-house, and got into conversation—I told him, in the presence of the other two who were indicted with me, that I</p>

               <p>declined doing anything of the kind, and that I should indict him for what he had done—he has since preferred some indictments against me at Clerkenwell for the same house—I have never been in the house since—I offered to give it up to the agent.</p>

He argued that the prisoners should be allowed to plead over, in as much as the demurrer did not amount to a confession of the fact, but only to a request to the Court to express an opinion whether, in point of law, there was anything to call on the prisoners to answer. That this course had been generally permitted, not perhaps on principles of pleading, but upon principles of humanity, was evident from the following authorities: Archibald's Crim. Pleading, 87; 2 Hale's Pleas of Crown, 256 and 225; Reg. v. Purchase, Car and Marshman, 617; Reg. v. Phelps ditto, and Rex v. Adams, 297 ditto; Gray's case, 11 Clark and Finelly, 427; Reg. v.

See Storey's Conflict of Laws, 527; Trimbey's case; 1 Bingham's new cases; Rothschild v. Currie, 1 Queen's Bench Reports; Benham v. Earl of Mornington, 3 Common Bench Reports, 133; and Astley v.

IV., c. 66, were sufficient to support the present charge; and with respect to the remaining counts, he denied the necessity of setting out the complete instrument; it might be that no such complete instrument was in existence; as for instance, where a foreign State issued a notice, that on a given day, notes of a particular cha<lb/>racter would be put into circulation, and where, in anticipation of that event, documents were forged intended to be substituted for the genuine ones; it could not be contended that that would not amount to an offence, or that in such a case any complete instrument could be set out; with regard to the present case, the averment that such instruments were negociable in Russia was sufficient; for if the instrument were set out, and the slightest variation between it and the forged plates were detected, it would vitiate the indictment; it was enough if on the face of them they purported to be that which they were intended to repre<lb/>sent. With regard to the last question, he contended that the judgment must be final, the demurrer being in reality a confession of the fact, and that the instances quoted, where prisoners were allowed to plead over, applied to capital cases only, when that course was permitted in favorem vitae.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">the prisoners had pleaded and been convicted under it. The first question to be ascertained was, the meaning of the word "purporting;" and it appeared to the Court that it must be construed in this way, that if the instrument in question were a complete one, then it must appear on the face of it, that it purported to be as it was described; but where the word was applied to part of a bill, note, &amp;c., it could not be construed in the same unlimited sense, seeing that part of a bill, note, &amp;c., could not purport to be anything, but it must mean that it was part of the thing which, if completed, would purport to be that which was described in the Act of Parliament; and that must be shown, not by setting out the instru<lb/>ment on the face of the indictment, but by averment and extrinsic proof. Here, the parts were set forth as they were proposed to be proved, with averments, which, if true, showed that they were parts of an undertaking current in Russia; and in the opinion of the Court the first batch of counts was sufficient to sustain a judgment of that kind. The last six counts, in the opinion of the Court, were not sufficient, on the ground that they did not come within 2 &amp; 3 Wm. IV., c. 123, that Act being confined to indictments for forgery, and to complete instruments. With respect to the more difficult and important question, namely, the judgment to be given upon the demurrer being overruled, the Court had taken time to refer to the older authorities on the subject, this being a ques<lb/>tion which had seldom arisen in modern times, and it seemed to them that the judgment must be final. It appeared clear, when the matter was fully investi<lb/>gated, that any plea which was in confession and avoidance of the felony, if adjudged against a prisoner, subjected him always to final judgment. The principal authorities on the subject were to be found in cases of appeals in felony. It was clear that there were many dilatory and declinatory pleas which left the question of guilt or innocence unconfessed; it was the practice in those cases to plead not guilty, and a declinatory plea together; those pleas, as mentioned by Lord Hale, were not held bad for doubleness, as it was allowed in favorem vitae; and this was the solution of all the difficulties which appa<lb/>rently existed on the subject. There was distinct authority to show that if any plea in confession and avoidance of the felony, was determined against a party, he was not allowed to plead over, but judgment was then final; and a decision, by all the Judges, to that effect, would be found in the Year-book of 14th Edward IV., c. 7, placitum 10. It seemed to the Court that the rule which was applied to the cases of plea, governed demurrers also; where the plea was dilatory alone, such as a plea in abatement, or a plea to the jurisdiction, which might well stand with a plea of not guilty, there, if judgment was against the prisoner on his dilatory plea, he was permitted (indeed he had a right) to be tried on his plea of not guilty; but where the plea was in confession and avoidance of the felony, the real and true judgment of the law always was a judgment final, and it was only by the indulgence of the Court that the party was afterwards allowed to plead not guilty. If that was so, it was decisive of the present question, because here there was nothing on the record except the demurrer; there was no plea of not guilty pleaded with it, neither could there be. The Court was therefore of opinion, on the whole case, this being a general demurrer, that it did contain a confession, and that judgment must be final. The modern authorities referred to, appeared to be only dicta at</hi> Nisi Prius,<hi rend="italic">hastily given, and were not entitled to the weight which would have attached to them if the learned Judges had had the opportunity, now afforded to the Court, of consulting the authorities on the subject.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Samuel Bailey, of Windsor-terrace, Canal-grove, Mile-end. On 3rd April I went from the front to the back parlour, about a quarter-past eight o'clock in the evening—two dresses were hanging in the front parlour, and a paletot, a handkerchief, and other articles—the parlour window looks into the street, it was a little way open—when I left the front parlour my sister was there, and she left it about ten minutes after me—no one went into the room, to my knowledge, after my sister came out—I went in again about ten minutes before nine—the window was then wide open, and I missed the two dresses, some calico, the paletot, and other things—these are the sheet and petticoat—I know them by the work on them—there was a mark on the sheet which is not here now—they are my father's.</p>

                  </hi>. I was journeyman to the prisoner in March last. He resided at 25, Brydges-street, Covent-garden—on Friday, 22nd March, I was in the bakehouse, which is under the shop and parlour—the prisoner and his wife slept in the back-parlour I believe—I believe the upper part of the house was let out to lodgers—I went to the bakehouse about eleven o'clock—I was in bed when I was called—after I went into the bakehouse, the prisoner bolted the door after me—he was in the habit of doing that—I could not then get to the parlour or other parts of the house—I was to call the prisoner at three o'clock—after I had been in the bakehouse about half-an-hour, I heard noises in the parlour—I heard mistress screaming as if she was being beaten—she was screaming very loud, and it continued till about three, as from a person in pain; not all the time, but time after time—I did not hear any words—I heard also a wrestling on the floor, as if a person was dragging another about—that continued, from time to time, about twenty minutes, at intervals during that time—I heard the dragging and screaming at the same time—it appeared as if the person who was dragged was the person who screamed—it was my mistress's voice—I heard my master talking very loud, but I could not make out what he was talking about—I think the screams came from the parlour—at three I knocked at the ceiling to call my master—he came down—I did not say anything to him about what I had heard, or he to me—he stayed about an hour and a half in the bakehouse, and then went up-stairs again—I remained in the bakehouse, and heard nothing more that night—I saw the prisoner's wife in the shop about eight, when I was about to go out with the bread—her face was in a very bad state indeed, all swollen and bruised, and there was a cut at the side of her left eye—it was not bleeding—I then went out with my bread, and saw her again when I returned, between ten and eleven—she appeared then just the same as when I saw her in the morning—she appeared rather heavy, and looked as if she was not well—I saw her again about six in the evening, in the shop—Mary Ann Bryant was present—Mrs. Moir was standing at the shop-window, attempting to take some bread out of the window, and as she turned round she fell on the floor—she did not strike against anything—she fell clear of everything—Mrs. Bryant asked the prisoner, who was present, to lend her assistance to assist her up—he said, "Let the d—d b—h lay there till she comes to herself"—he did not assist her to get up in my pre<lb/>sence—Mrs. Bryant assisted her up, and I then left the shop—I never saw my mistress again—I saw the prisoner between nine and ten next morning—I asked him how mistress was—he said she was in a very bad state, and had been all the night, and he did not expect that she would live, and he was astonished that it had lasted so long as it had done—I was only there one week—this took place the first week I was there—I went on the Sunday before this happened.</p>

I am married—my husband is a carpenter and joiner—I am second cousin to the prisoner's wife—her name was Susan Moir—they occupied the shop, parlour, and kitchen, all on one floor, and the bakehouse underneath—from the street you go into the shop, from there into the parlour, from there to the bedroom, and then into the kitchen—they are all on one floor—the parlour is a large room; the other two are small—I have been in the bakehouse, but I am not aware whether it extends under the whole—they have two boys, one thirteen, and the other seven; they slept in the kitchen—I called there on Saturday, 23rd March, about one o'clock, as near as I can tell—the prisoner was at home, and his wife also—his wife appeared very ill indeed, from being knocked about, as she informed me, on the previous night—the prisoner was not there when she said so—he went out—her neck was swollen very much, and her hands were a very dark colour, bruised—I am not aware whether she had a black eye or not, as she wore spectacles; I could not see—I think she was thirty-nine years old—I cooked the dinner that day, and the prisoner returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I was in the habit, when I went there, if there was anything not ready, to do it for her, to give her a little time to rest—the dinner was very nearly ready when the prisoner returned—the youngest child told his father that the eldest would not take out a baking his mother had desired him to—the deceased was then in the parlour, standing by the table, and the prisoner began swearing at her, d—n—g and bl—g her eyes, and hitting her in the back with his fist, and boxing her ears with his open hand—he boxed her ears at least a dozen times—they were violent blows, each almost enough to knock a person down—he said he would make her remember not sending the man with the baking—she said she thought she should do wrong by sending the man, as he was making the York biscuits—she stated that at the first commencement—some time after that they sat down to dinner, and he said of the gravy that was made for the mutton-chops, "This is something like gravy, not like the soup you made yesterday," and then he began beating her again on the side of the face and ear with his open</p>

               <p>hand—he struck her three or four times, I dare say—they were about the same sort of blows as before—they then both sat down to dinner, and the two children—I did not—the prisoner then threw a piece of bread at her, and it hit her forehead—it was about the quarter of a half-quartern loaf, just as you would cut it, half crust and half crumb—the eldest child picked it up and put it on the table—the prisoner took it up and threw it again, but it did not touch her—just before they sat down to the table he told me he had been very much put out with her; that on the Friday evening she got very much intoxicated, and that he had left home to go out, and ordered her to shut up the shop, and she did not shut it up as he ordered her; and when he came back he shut up the shop and went into the parlour, and she was frying soles, and she said she was very glad he had come in, as she had got some nice fish for his supper; and he told me that he told her he did not want the fish, and that he sat down on a chair by the fireplace, and he saw a ginger<lb/>beer bottle standing under the pianaforte, and he went and took it up and put his finger in and found it was full of gin, and that made him very vexed; and that when he asked her where she fetched it from, she said from the "Cheshire Cheese"—the deceased said she did not fetch it from the "Cheshire Cheese," but from a house in Middle-row, Holborn—I told her I did not think she had brought it herself at all, but I thought a Mrs. Doe had brought it to her—she said she had not, she had brought it in herself—I told her she had better tell the truth, for it would save her a great deal, and say who did bring it in for her, for I felt sure she did not bring it in herself—she said she did bring it in, and she got her little basket down and showed us the manner in which she brought the bottle in—I thought she could not have brought it in, because the prisoner said there was no cork in it, and she showed us how she put it in her basket to bring it—when he first beat her about the eldest child not going out with the bread, he also kicked her violently at the back part of the body—that was before they sat down to dinner—he kicked her at the back part of her person, and on her legs—he struck her at least a dozen times—he did not say or do anything more then, and the cloth was cleared, and he went to get the bread for the eldest boy to go out to Camden-town with—the deceased then prepared to dress herself, and he came in and got his pipe, and sat down by the fire—she went into the bedroom, and I remained in the parlour—he did not say or do anything to her then, and I sat talking to him by the fire—after the bread was thrown she did not want to finish her dinner; and he said if she did not sit down to her dinner and finish the meat, that he would send for a rolling-pin, and force the piece of meat down her throat—she then sat down, but did not finish the meat—she put it on the dish again—he then got up, and kicked her, and boxed her ears—he struck her three or four times in the back-part of her person, at the bottom of the back, her sitting-place—they were very severe blows with his open hand—she repeatedly said, "Man alive, don't kill me; man alive, don't beat me!"—he said he would murder her outright, but he would murder her by inches, so that the law should not touch him—he said, "For I can cheat the Devil, and I am d—d if I do not think I can cheat the Government over you"—after she went into the bedroom he told me he thought he had hurt her head very much indeed, and he wished I would get some warm water and bathe it for her, and look at it—I went into the bedroom, looked at her head, and found it in a most dreadful state—her ear was the colour of a piece of sheep's liver—I did not notice which ear it was—she had a cut on her head, some distance above the same ear—the parts all about the ear were swollen—I did not put my hand to her ear—I found there was clotted blood</p>

               <p>on her hair—I went and fetched some warm water—I told her I could not bathe her head; it was in such a dreadful state, I could not attempt to look at it again; I was very sorry, but she must bathe it herself—I then came away into the parlour—the prisoner was still sitting, smoking his pipe—he asked me about her, and I said she was dreadful bad, and he had better let her go to bed, for her ear was beyond all description—he said he could not spare her from the shop then, that it was Saturday—he did not go into the bedroom, but remained where he was—about ten minutes after, as near as I can tell, she came into the parlour—I told her I must go away, and she begged of me to remain—the prisoner went away, I cannot say where, but I think into the bakehouse—I remained a few minutes after that, and then left—it was about three then—I returned between five and six, and saw the prisoner go in before me—I found his wife in the shop—she appeared very stupid indeed, as if she had been drinking a good deal—she came into the parlour—the prisoner came into the parlour a little while after, and asked her if she had sent the twopenny loaf to one of the customers, as he had ordered—I forget the name—she said she had not—he then asked if she had sent to another customer, Mr. Robinson—she said, "No," that the bread had not come up from the bakehouse—she said she would send it then—he then replied that it was a d—d shame, it was no use to send it then; the bread was cold, and it was past their teatime; and he boxed her ears repeatedly, and told her to go and put the bread in the window—I cannot say how often he struck her, I should say about a dozen violent blows—I cannot say whether his hand touched that part of her head I had just before examined, or whether it was the same side or not—I cannot say whether all the blows were on one side or not—she attempted to put five or six loaves in the window, and then fell down—I went to her, and noticed blood coming from a cut near her eye—I said, "Good Gods, uncle, she is in a fit"—she looked up, and said, "I am in a fit, Mary Ann, and a very bad one too; don't leave, Mary Ann; for God's sake don't leave me"—I asked him to come and help me pick her up—he said he would not come and pick her up—he made use of some bad language, I do not know what it was, and said she was drunk, and she might lay there—I was so faint that I was forced to leave her there, and go outside the parlour-door—I do not know how she got up—I was not away five minutes, and when I went back she was in her bedroom, standing at the side of a sink with her head resting on her hand, and sliding herself down—she slid down on the floor, and rested her head on a step at the door from the bedroom into the kitchen—she was then quite insensible—the prisoner, I think, was still in the shop—she laid there two hours, or it might be more—I asked the pri<lb/>soner to come and help me pick her up and put her on the bed—he said no, she should never lay on a bed of his again—I got him to go in once or twice, and he looked at her, and kicked her two or three times severely, and said, "You drunken b—h, get up"—my husband came at a few minutes or a quarter-past eight, and got some warm water, and washed her face—he did not lift her up first, her face was so covered with blood—he could get at her face as she lay there, on his knees—she never came to—my husband aferwards put her on the children's bed—very shortly after that I asked the prisoner to send for a doctor—he said there was no occasion for a doctor—I and my husband remained there till between twelve and one in the morning, and no doctor was sent for while we were there—she continued in the same insensible state—I spoke to the prisoner two or three times about a doctor, and within half an hour of my leaving—he then said there was no occasion for a doctor then; he should see how she got on; if she did not get any better,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185005060040"/>
               <p>he would send for one—he asked me to come early in the morning—I cannot say what time it was when I got there—I should think it was not long after six when the little boy came to me—the prisoner sent the eldest boy for me soon after six, and I was there some time before eight—I found her just in the same state as I had left her—I asked the prisoner if he had sent for a doctor—he said, "No"—I said, "You had better send for one directly"—he said he did not know what to do, or who he should send for; and I advised him to send for a gentleman who had been attending her, Mr. Pritchard—he said, "I do not know where he lives now"—eventually a Mr. Watkins was sent for, and he came while I was there, and saw her—I remained there till past twelve that Saturday night—she was quite senseless all that time—Mr. Watkins saw her repeatedly in the course of the day—I went again about eleven next day, and found she was dead.</p>

In March I lodged at the prisoner's house, in Brydges-street, and occupied the front room, first floor—I recollect coming down-stairs on Saturday, 23rd March, between three and four o'clock—as I came near the parlour occupied by the prisoner, I heard Mrs. Moir screaming and crying dreadfully—I heard her say several times, "Oh, you will kill me, you will kill me!"—I knew the prisoner's voice—I heard him say, "I will murder you before I have done with you"—one of the children was in the room, but I cannot say which, and I heard the child call out, "Oh, father, don't kill my mother! you will kill my mother!"—I did not hear any other voice in the room; I did not hear any other sounds—I stopped at the door to listen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at Chandos-street, Charing-cross. On Sunday morning, 24th March, about eight o'clock, I was called to see the prisoner's wife—I found her on a bed—I examined her—her head, neck, and face, were covered with contusions—the face was amazingly swollen, and the features very much distorted—she was perfectly insensible—the entire scalp was contused—it appeared to be a very dangerous case—I apprehended fatal results from the first—I visited her on the Sunday evening, two or three hours, and she continued completely insensible till the Monday, when she died—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—she died of compression of the brain, in my judgment, caused by extravasated blood under the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>—the contused condition of the head, face, and neck, might produce rupture of the internal vessels and extravasation—repeated blows from the open hand on the head would most decidedly cause the appearances I observed on the head—the brain was remarkably healthy; I have seldom seen so healthy a brain—the liver was a little paler than usual, but plump and elastic, and so were all the abdominal viscera—the paleness of the liver was probably pro<lb/>duced when death took place—the whole of the back was contused from the head to the lowest part—those bruises did not conduce to the death—I attri<lb/>bute it entirely to the bruises on the head—the head was in a perfectly pulpy state; there was extravasation of all the fluids under the integuments of the head—on examining the viscera, I discovered not the slightest alcoholic smell—the viscera did not present any appearance of a person given to drinking; and that I might be perfectly certain of that, I inserted my head into the body; so that had there been any effluvia from any alcoholic liquid of any kind I must have detected it; and another thing, the liver of a drunkard is of so remarkable a character that it is impossible to mistake it—it was certainly not the liver of a confirmed drunkard—I made the examination on the Tuesday morning—there was not the least smell of liquor in the interior.</p>

On 25th April, about four o'clock in the morning, I was in Bridge-street, Mile-end, and saw Connor close under a wall of Bank's terrace—I asked what he had been doing—he said he got drunk the night before, and got locked out, and was waiting until it was time to go to work—he was quite sober—I let him pass on, and went into a corner and saw a pair of shoes and stockings close under the wall—I directly went after Connor, took him, and gave him to another constable—I then went back and found Armstrong stooping under the wall, as if he had just dropped from it, about five or six yards from where I had seen Connor—I asked what he was doing there—he said he was only taking a walk—I found a pair of boots in his hand, a pair of lady's boots in his breast, a tablecloth in his hat, and another in his trowsers—I called Mr. Pardon up, and took Armstrong to the station—I found a pair of snuffers between where I saw each prisoner—I found footmarks of people close under the wall in Mr. Pardon's garden; one without shoes or stockings—there was fresh dirt on the fence, which was eight or nine feet high—Armstrong asked me to let him put on his shoes and stockings, and he put on those which I found—the shoes did not fit him, but he claimed them—I found Mr. Pardon's window wide open; a man could get in.</p>

On the night of 24th April I and my wife were last up—we examined the house—the kitchen window was fastened, but the inner shutters were not—I was called up about four o'clock, and found the kitchen in great confusion—I missed a tablecloth, two pairs of boots, and a pair of snuffers—these boots are mine, and these my wife's—the tablecloth has her initials on it—the catch of the window had been pushed back, and the lower sash lifted up.</p>

In consequence of something, on 16th April, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I went out of a small door in my house on to the loft, without any one seeing me—I looked through a hole cut in the floor, and saw Lewis talking to a man outside—I heard the words, "Have you got it? all right, is it?"—other words passed, I do not know what, and Lewis closed the door with a sack in his hand, which he immediately began filling with large pieces of suet—there was 500 or 600 stone of fat on the floor—when he had nearly filled it, I rushed down and collared him—he made some explanation—I locked him up in a room, and said, "You must be quiet there, because I expect to catch some more of the men, and I don't want them to know you are in custody"—he said Rogers asked him, the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, T</hi> 28). On Sunday, 31st March, I went with Mr. Philp to his garden, and found a great number of trees had been cut down—I saw a great number of footmarks by those trees, and traced them up the garden into an adjoining one—they then went a few steps to the left, and turned round into a meadow which leads to the prisoner's house—the field is 100 yards long, as near as possible—I measured it—a foot track went up to the garden wall of the prisoner's house—we went there, and I told the prisoner Mr. Philp suspected him of cutting the trees, and I wanted him to go with me, as I had found tracks against the wall—I asked him for the shoes—he said, "These are the shoes I had on on Saturday"—we took him to the place, and I made a mark with his shoes by the track by the wall—they corresponded exactly—he had another pair of shoes on—I after<lb/>wards fitted them into the marks—I said, "I am confident this is the shoe which made that mark"—the prisoner said it was not—we then went to Philp's garden, and found the marks by the trees to correspond with the mark by the wall and with the shoes—Philp's footmarks were very different in length and width, and I do not think he had any nails in his shoes—there were only marks by one person where the trees were cut—in some places I found Philp's footmarks as well, but they did not go so close to the trees, and seemed to be different altogether—I searched the prisoner's house—I asked if he had a bill-hook—he brought me this hatchet, and said it was all he had got—I found no pruning-knife, or any other instrument.</p>

Q.</hi> This hatchet does not seem very sharp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think some of the standard trees were cut off at one blow, but a good many were hacked, which it would do very well—I was there about one o'clock—I believe England had been there before me—some impressions were good, and some not—two were covered up—these are the shoes(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was on duty that Saturday night in the neighbourhood of the garden—a man is placed under me—he has a great distance to go, and might not have heard the chopping—it might take longer to chop 131 trees than he would be going round his beat—I asked Peters whether he came home with Keen on Satur<lb/>day night—he said, "No; I left him down at Wyatt's bridge"—the question was put to Peters, because the prisoner had told me distinctly that he had come home with Peters to his own door—there is no road through the</p>

               <p>meadow—I received these boots on the Saturday, a week afterwards—I had returned them to the prisoner, because Mr. Philp refused to give him in charge till he got stronger evidence—I have been in the police twenty years and six months—there are particular marks in the nails of this shoe; you cannot get one to match it—the prisoner said the shoes did not fit the marks, but I am confident they did, I never saw a better fit in my life—none of the others had seen the mark by the garden-wall till we all came together—there was a trace from the garden into the meadow, where some one had jumped over the ditch; then the trace was lost, till you came to the garden wall—I was the first to examine that—the shoes were given back a second time to examine it—I have often examined footmarks before, but have not been bound over to prove it, other policemen being in the cases.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 170). On Sunday, 31st March, I went with Mr. Philp to his garden, and saw several trees cut down, and the foot-marks of one person only—I traced them into the adjoining garden, and from there to the back of where the prisoner lived—I went there and asked him if he would accompany me to Mr. Philp's garden, as he suspected he was the person who had wilfully destroyed his, trees—he said "Yes," and went with me—he had the shoes on to the gate, and I fetched another pair for him; he changed them before he went into the garden, but I noticed the marks the first pair he had made, and compared them with the other impres<lb/>sions—they corresponded in my judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In what particular did they correspond? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were the same size—I was away five minutes, getting the shoes—I do not believe the prisoner had moved when I came back—Mr. Philp was with him—he had these shoes on till I came back—I told him to put his foot down and make an impression, and he did so—it was loose soil by the fruit trees, not mud—it was not frosty—such mould as that would not be drawn up with the foot—I gave up the shoes because Mr. Philp would not give him into custody—the mark by the garden wall was discovered between ten and eleven o'clock on Sunday morning, during the second examination—the pri<lb/>soner had no business outside the garden wall, the meadow was another person's—I was on duty that night—it was a light night—the trees were in rows—a person must have known them to get at them in the night—Philp first mentioned the prisoner to me—I met Peters about twelve o'clock that morning—he did not then say anything about being <hi rend="italic">one</hi> with Philp—that did not come out till we were at the police-court—I could see some of the nail-marks, but not as if the ground was solid—there are nails out of the shoe—you could see perhaps five nails in the impression, and then two or three—both the shoes corresponded with marks—I found no mark of the iron plate on the toe of one of them—the impression was not so sharp and neat as if the ground had been wet—some impressions might be an inch deep or more—in some places it was very good—they went to the trees regularly—the person must have well known where they stood, dark as the night was.</p>

I told her I took her for stealing six tea-spoons, a caddy-spoon, and a dessert-spoon from her mistress—she said, "Yes, and serve her right too"—I got this piece of silk from Mrs. Payne's shop—the spoons have not been found—the drawers appeared to have been broken open with a chisel, and there was a chisel in the kitchen corresponding with the marks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Noyes, of Grove-terrace, Maryle-bone. On 10th April the prisoner came and offered some lead for sale—I told him my husband was not at home—I left him in the passage—a few minutes after I was galled by one of the workmen; and in consequence of what he said, I went into the kitchen, and found the prisoner there—I insisted on knowing his business—he said he came to sell the old lead—I told him he had had his answer before—I insisted on knowing what he had about him, as I thought he had stolen something—he said he had not—I perceived he was concealing something, and I took the steel from his coat, and in the parlour up-stairs he produced a carving-knife—they were my husband's property.</p>

Glyn, for the purpose of being cashed—checks coming in a body are termed "a charge"(<hi rend="italic">referring to a book</hi>)—the gross amount of the charge that Mr. Hobson brought in was 4,269<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it consisted of checks on Messrs.

Glyn—they have a special form of check engraved for themselves—this is one of their forms of check(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was a check for 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the Globe Insurance Company in the charge—they have three descriptions of forms, one for the general account, one for the annuity account, and one for the dividends.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ledger-keeper at Messrs. Glyn's, and have been so many years. I produce the ledger for the present year—it is part of my duty, at intervals throughout the day, to take the checks on Glyn and Co. which have been paid at the counter, and to enter them in the ledger to the debit of the customers by whom they have been drawn—on 26th Feb. I find an entry of a check for 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but my ledger does not show it was from the London and Westminster Bank—I find, in my own handwriting, the entry of a check of the Globe Insurance Company on that day—there are two or three on that day; one is for 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that entry is in my writing—it brings to my memory the fact of a check for 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Glyn and Co. by the Globe Insurance Company coming through my hands—I make the entries from the documents themselves—if it is a check, I have one way of entering it; and if a bill, I have another way of entering it—if it is a check, it is the custom to insert the name of the payer, and if it is a bill I put the name of the drawer—I never make an entry in this book except from the voucher itself—I do not recollect the particular document—independent of the entry in the book I have no distinct recollection of the circumstance—refreshing my memory from the entry, and from my practice, I am able to say that a check of that amount, drawn by the Globe Insurance Company on Messrs. Glyn's account, has passed through my hands—I entered that check in the ledger on the same day, to the debit of the Globe Insurance Company—there are three forms of checks used by the Globe Insurance Company—these are the three forms (<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>)—the one with the figure of the globe at the top is for general purposes, including fire and life losses; the one printed in black, without the globe, is for annuities; and the red check is for dividends—I never entered a check of the Globe Insurance Company in any other form but these three—there was a custom with the Globe Company and our house to have their pass-book made up on the Tuesday evening—they left it with us on the Tuesday, and fetched it away again on the Wednesday—the checks that had been paid in the course of the week were put in the pocket of the pass-book and sent to the customer—the pass-book was written up by one of the clerks in the evening, and checked by me on the following morning—it was checked against the ledger, the entries in which are in my own hand<lb/>writing—another clerk called over each item to me from the pass-book, and I checked them by the ledger—I put a dot to the items as the clerk called them out—I find a dot to the check for 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the entry immediately pre<lb/>ceding that is "annuity 302<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and the amount is 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is the pass-book of the Globe Company (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>).</p>

COCKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has he been in your em<lb/>ployment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think from 1832, I am not quite sure; more than ten years—he was always in the accountant's-office—he was paid by the Company, and was the Company's clerk—it was after I met him on the stairs that he spoke to me about sealing up his papers, and asked me to seal up other papers; I think he said the papers in the secretary's-office—I think there was some sort of specifi<lb/>cation, but not in his office—he said, "All the papers"—I understood him to mean all the books and papers in the cashier's, secretary's, and accountant's department—of course, the Fire and Country-office he could not mean—he did not ask me whether I had sealed up any other papers—he told me he was a proprietor—he is a shareholder, the holder of two shares—I presume he has received dividends on those shares.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the course of business when checks are drawn; I understand checks are drawn by three directors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The checks are drawn at a com<lb/>mittee, called the Treasury Committee—the order is that they shall be signed by the chairman or deputy-chairman, and by two directors, and countersigned by the cashier or secretary—it is the province of the Treasury Committee to sign checks—of that committee, the chairman and deputy-chairman are, <hi rend="italic">ex-officio,</hi> members—it is not necessary to have the signature of the chairman or deputy-chairman to the other warrants, but to the ordinary business it is—previous to a check of this kind being signed, it is called over, and passed at the Treasury Committee, claims and vouchers having passed previous committees—an entry is made of it—the committee-book is the primary record of it—that would contain an entry of the particulars, to whom payable, on what account, and the amount—it is entered in many other books afterwards, but no check would be drawn without that authority—it is entered when it is handed over to the party who comes for it—the checks generally received my signature, I think, with very few exceptions—it is the secretary's habit, after it has been read to the committee, and approved, to call them over to me, indi<lb/>vidually; or, if I am not there, which is very rarely, to the chairman; and my signature was, in point of fact, the voucher that the check drawn on the blank check was consistent with the minute of the Treasury Committee—I mean to say checks come up unsigned, and my signature, or the signature of the chairman, is the voucher that it is correct in amount and date—all that would take place before the other directors signed—when the other directors have signed, they are placed in the hands of the clerk; and as he pays them, or delivers them out to the party who calls to claim them, it is recorded in another book of the Company—we have a counterfoil to our check-books—the counterfoil is in fact a copy of the check—the clerk I give the check to is a clerk in the cashier's-office, down-stairs—a minute is made in the cashier's-office before the clerk delivers it to the person in whose favour it is drawn, and then it is handed over at the counter to the person who comes for it—our books would furnish us with a complete record of all checks which are signed by the chairman, or deputy-chairman, and the directors, in the course of their</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the blank-check book? (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this is the check-book which was in use, and is in use still—it is the check-book for general purposes, losses and life-losses—it is the one with the globe on it—the prisoner had not access to that check-book—it was kept in the cashier's-office—it was mainly kept in an inner department of the cashier's-office, on the ground-floor—it was brought up to the board-room, but I never knew that it ever went higher, and I do not think it ever did—the prisoner, according to the course of business, had not access to this book—the checks are filled up by a particular clerk, Mr. Meedy—the prisoner's father was the cashier—it was his duty to take care of the check when ready for delivery, to lock it up, and to countersign it—it was not his duty to keep the blank book; a gentleman named Biggs, in the same office, kept that; he sits in the inner department—I find evidences of some leaves having been ab<lb/>stracted from this book; I cannot tell how many, several—two or three pages evidently—I know that the door of the place where it was kept has been open—I never saw the prisoner in that office, but it was his duty to go into that office on his arrival in the morning, to enter his name, and the time at which he came there, in the time-book—he had no other duty there—I have examined the time-book, and I find he did go there—he has signed his name on his arrival.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKBURN?</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you that the book was in the proper custody of another clerk, Mr. Biggs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the office was common to other clerks—the time-book was on a table in the outer office—this book was kept in the inner office—at that time in the morning it would be in a strong room, where the prisoner certainly could not get at it in the ordinary course of business—if he had been found in that room at that time in the morning, it would have excited observation—there are seven or eight clerks, whose business calls them into the outer office—they have also access to the inner office—it is an enclosure, a kind of high partition, which shuts off this parti<lb/>cular department of the lower office, and Mr. Biggs' seat—the other books I have spoken of, in which the record of every check drawn is kept, was in the custody of Mr. Watts, senior—they are seen once a month by the directors—we have those books, not in their original condition; they have been altered, not by us—there have been scratchings in that book as well as in the bankers' book—there are no leaves torn out of the cash-book.</p>

Bank of England note—I received an acknowledgment of it in due course; and on Sunday, 7th April, I enclosed the other part—I sealed it myself, and posted it at Weatherfield about one o'clock—it would go by the evening post to London—this is the first, and this other the second half of the note I posted—they make one note, and the numbers correspond.</p>

On 4th April I retired to bed at ten o'clock at night—the house was then fastened—I got up in the morning at half-past five—I received information, and went to the back of the house—the washhouse window had been taken out—they could not get in by the washhouse—they opened the door, went into the yard again, and broke in by the back-room window—they broke six squares of glass—I found the things strewed about the room, and I missed this victorine, the shirt, and other articles—they were the property of my late husband, John Mackall Reeves; he laid bad in bed at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist. On the afternoon of 6th April, I was in Swan-street, Whitechapel. it is narrow at the end nearest to Man-sell-street; it widens for about twenty yards; then it narrows, then it is wide in the middle, then it narrows again—the narrow part is just wide enough for one cart; the wide part for two—I saw two wagons in the broad part in a line, one behind the other—it was a wagon and a cart, I think—I did not know either of the drivers—I think the wagon had three horses—I saw a truck drawn by the prisoner meeting the wagon—the prisoner could have passed those wagons as they stood still—he did not make any attempt to pass them—he refused—he stood still—the driver of the back cart spoke very civilly to him—he said, "Why don't you move your truck on, there is plenty of room"—the prisoner, addressing both the men, for both of them came up, said, "I shall not move unless you back your wagon," speaking to the deceased—the deceased said, "There is no occasion for me to back, there is plenty of room," and asked him to bring his truck forward—the prisoner said, "I shall not move at all"—the driver of the back cart went and said, "You are a silly boy; there is plenty of room to pass; if you won't move the truck, will you let me move it?"—the prisoner said, "No, you shall not put a hand on my truck; I shall not go on the pavement, the commissioners of police will not lot me"—the driver of the back cart then said, "If you won't move your truck, I will," and he and the deceased both laid their hands on it—the prisoner struck the man who had the hinder cart, and then the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Francis-street Old-street-road; I am a pros<lb/>titute, the same as Elizabeth Steers; the prisoners live in the house opposite mine. On Sunday, 10th March, William Steers came to my door between four and five o'clock in the morning—he knocked at the door two or three times—I did not let him in—I shut him out once or twice—at last he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the door open and came in—another man followed him in, and the female prisoner—they came in one after the other—William Steers went to the washhand-stand and broke the basin—he then went to the mantel-piece and dragged a picture down—he then hit a friend of mine, William Risley, who was there, and when he had done beating him, he came and beat me—I am not aware that he had anything in his hand then, but after he had beat me as long as he could stand over me, he took up this quart jug (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and broke it over my head—my head bled, and the blood is on the jug now—as soon as I could get from him I ran into the street and called the police—I said, "For God's sake help me, or else I shall be murdered"—the policeman happened to be just passing the door—as soon as he came up, I lost my senses—I do not recollect what passed—when I ran out into the street I do not know what became of the prisoner—I leaned against the wall—there was nothing done to me in the street that I know of—when I recovered, I found myself leaning against the wall—I do not think the policeman came into my house—when I crossed to the prisoner's place to give them in charge, the female prisoner pulled my hair, just where my head was wounded—they were both tipsy.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 71). On Sunday, 10th March, I was on duty in Francis-street—I saw Ward standing leaning against a wall—the blood was running from a wound in her head down her face and clothes—she appeared to be in a very bad state—she said, "For God's sake, policeman, come here, I shall be murdered"—she said that Steers and his wife had come and burst her door open, and had beaten her, a man who was in the house, and another female, with the poker and tongs, about the head, and likewise with a jug—I did not see the prisoners at that time; they were in their own house, and the door fastened—I did not see them go in—in consequence of what Ward said, I went and knocked at the prisoner's door—one of them made answer, "Who is there?"—I said, "The police"—a man's voice said, "There you are like to be"—I asked them a second time to open the door—he refused, and I then forced the door open—I was in my uniform as a police<lb/>man—I went into the house—I saw both the prisoners—I told them I wanted them—they asked me what for—I told them the charge; and William Steers</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon.

                  </hi>. I am potman in the service of Mr. Shepherd, who keeps the Brill, in Brewer-street, Somers'-town. I went to the dust-hole about two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, 27th April, and found a purse on a shelf over the dust-hole—I should know it again—I did not open it—I took it to my master directly, and left it with him—this is it—I received it back from him in about twenty minutes—he gave me some directions, in conse<lb/>quence</p>

               <p>of which I put it where I got it from—the prisoner was barman there—he slept in the same room that I did, but not with me—the dust-hole is in the back yard—I saw the prisoner go to that back yard about nine the same evening—he then came back to the bar—I went to the dust-hole after he had been out, and found the purse still there—he and I slept in the same room—we got up about nine the next morning—from that time I watched the pri<lb/>soner—he was in the yard, about half-past nine, for about half an hour, and he was away again about eight in the evening—I saw the purse there about nine o'clock that evening—we went to bed, and got up at five o'clock the next morning—the prisoner went down first, and when I came down the back door was unfastened—there was no one up in the house who could have opened it but him—he was out in the yard when I came down—he came in in about ten minutes—directly he came into the bar I went to the dust-hole, and the purse was gone—I gave information to my master, and on that the servant maid was sent out—she returned, and after that I observed the policeman look in at the window of the private door—the prisoner was then in the front bar, and on seeing the policeman look in, he jumped over the counter and went out into Brewer-street—Brill-yard is four doors down that street—he went towards Brill-yard—he was gone about a minute—directly he got in the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Brill. On Thursday, 25th April, I marked two half-crowns, two shillings, and two sixpences; I placed them in the till—on the Saturday, Archer brought me this purse—I opened it, and found in it twenty-eight shillings and sixpence—there was a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence which I had marked on the Thursday—Archer told me where he got the purse from, and I gave him directions as to what to do with it—on Sunday, about eleven o'clock, I marked two sixpences and one shilling, and put them in the till—they were marked in a different way to the money I had marked on the Thursday—on the Monday morning I was up at a quarter before five—from my window I had a view of the back yard, and I saw the prisoner go down in a direction to where the dust-shed is—I could see him within one yard of it—in two or three minutes Archer gave me information, and I called a female servant and sent for a policeman—I came down myself soon afterwards—the prisoner had then left—I went out at the centre door, opposite Skinner-street, that is a way from Brewer-street—I came in again, and the prisoner came in at the Brewer-street door just as I came in at the other—I gave him in charge—he was searched, but no money was found—I went with him to the station—on the same morn<lb/>ing, about seven, the policeman searched Brill-yard, and found this purse; I was not a great way from him when he found it—he and I went to my</p>

I have a business in London, but I reside at Hampstead—the prisoner was in my service—we keep fowls, and we had missed eggs for several days—I mentioned to the prisoner about it—I said there were so many eggs in the nest, and asked him how many he brought in—he said, "Four"—I said it was said there were six there—he then said he brought in five—I said, "I do not like to suspect any one, perhaps you will allow me to see your box," which he consented to do, and there were seven eggs in the box—I asked him how he came by them—he said they were his own—a silver teaspoon was found in his box; it is mine—he has in other respects been a very good servant—with the exception of this I have no fault to find.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tallow-chandler and oilman. The prisoner was in my employ six or seven weeks—on 4th May I had suspicion, and came down-stairs earlier than usual; and in consequence of something that happened with reference to some wash-leather, I sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge—I afterwards examined his boxes with the policeman, when he was not present, and found three squares of fancy soap, a packet of <hi rend="italic">la veno beno</hi>, which is a kind of herb to mix with tea to improve it; and a box of wax-matches—I did not miss any of them from the shop.</p>

On the Wednesday before 15th April I went to Mr. Baldwin's shop to buy some boots—I saw a pair of gaiters lying on the counter, and stole them—I then went to the prisoner's shop, which is a broker's, in Lombard-court, and asked him whether he would buy them—he asked what price they were—I said, "3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was quite enough, and I sold them to him for that—they were <hi rend="italic">bran</hi> new—I was taken into custody on the Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at 2, New-way, Westminster. On Satur<lb/>day night, 13th April, I saw the, prisoner at Mrs. Hefferman's—he paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. rent—there was more owing, and she said, "Will you pay some off the score?"—he said, "No, not until I get better conveniences"—she said, "I cannot give you any more conveniences, for your wife sells them as fast as I give them to you"—the prosecutrix came in—he said that his wife said Ann Hefferman sold the bolster—she stood in her own defence, and said, "I never sold any bolster, nor <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> belonging to my mother"—she caught him by the shirt sleeve, and said, "Will you stand until I tell you all about it?"—I did not see the shirt torn—he went up-stairs—in a few minutes she said, "I will go up to Mr. Neal's wife, and will know all about it"—she went, and knocked at the door—Neal opened it, and came out with a chopper in his hand, and knocked her on the forehead with it—she called out, "Murder!" and I went up, and saw her getting the blow on the forehead—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Will</hi> Neal, don't you do it any more"—he said, "I will, I will kill and slaughter at I go"—he gave me two strokes, and struck her again on the arm—I went to try to protect her, and got my finger nearly chopped off—I saw no sign of liquor about the prisoner—the light went out—I went down for one, and showed the constable up-stairs—the prosecutrix became insensible—she stumbled, and lost a great deal of blood—she gave Neal in charge, and the policeman took her to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon to the Westminster Hospital. The prosecutrix was brought there with a scalp-wound on the left side of the forehead—it was very deep—it was not bleeding then, but she was covered with blood—a very large portion of the bone was exposed; it was about two inches long, and of a very dangerous nature indeed—this chopper is a very likely instrument to have inflicted it—on the Monday I considered her too ill to go before the Magistrate—she went on the Wednesday, and returned and remained till the following Tuesday, and then went out of her own accord—I told her I did not consider her out of danger—the blow went off obliquely, if the axe had fallen perpendicularly, it would most likely have fractured her skull; and from the appearance and the force would most pro<lb/>bably have killed her.</p>

I am in partnership with Mr. Morgan—we are corn-chandlers, and live in White Lion-street—the prisoner was in our service about seventeen months previous to 8th April—we received a communication, and I kept watch—on the morning of 8th April, I saw a cart driven to my premises by Lovejoy, a greengrocer, who lived two streets off, and who, since this has absconded—he drove opposite our premises, and went into the shop—I could not see what took place—the prisoner was in the shop at the time—Lovejoy came out with a sack on his back, which looked like a sack of oats—he placed it in the cart—I next saw the prisoner at the loft door, over the shop—he threw down a truss of hay and a truss of clover—the value of a sack of oats would depend on the quality; from 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this turned out to be a sack of barley, worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at cost price—the hay was worth 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the clover 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner then came down from the loft, went into the cellar, and fetched up a truss of straw—he placed that in the cart—that was worth 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot say where the prisoner was when Lovejoy drove up first, he was somewhere handy about the shop—I had seen him in the shop just before—there was no one else to serve in the shop—in about three-quarters of an hour I went into the shop—I took the slate on which it was the prisoner's duty to enter any sales, if the goods were not paid for, and if they were paid for he was to give me the money—I asked him three times if he had sold anything—he said no, there was nothing else to put on the slate but half a peck of barley to Davies—I asked him if there was anything else sold, and he said no—he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which he had taken, at least, it was in the till, and "Davies" was entered on the slate—Lovejoy has not had credit at our place of late—my partner had given direc<lb/>tions to the prisoner not to trust him.</p>

               <p>of hay, a truss of clover, a truss of straw, and a sack of barley—"Ash and Co." was on the sack—the barley resembled ours, being damaged, and the clover and hay resembled ours—I should like to know what has become of Lovejoy, we cannot find him anywhere—I believe he is the worst.</p>

Thomas Collis Sutton was in a cart coming from Woolwich—Mr. Martin, another young man, and I, were in the cart—when we came to the top of Hog-lane, the prisoners were coming up in a chaise—Mr. Sutton went to draw the cart past them, and they turned their horse's head to the left—Mr. Sutton asked them to allow him to pass—they used very bad language, and drew on very slowly—they would not allow him to pass—when they came to the dock-yard they stopped in front of the horse—Mr. Sutton called to the men in the yard—he then tried to go on, and the prisoners turned their horse's head one way and the other—after we had passed the dock-yard gate, there was another stoppage, and all the prisoners got out of their cart, and they came some on each side of Mr. Sutton's cart, and one of them, I cannot say which, struck Mr. Sutton on the eye—I re<lb/>ceived a blow on my left arm and Mr. Martin received a blow from the same person—Mr. Sutton received a blow on the side of the eye with something about a foot long—I cannot say who struck that blow, for when I saw the blood run I was afraid—I think Mr. Sutton fell out of the cart—he was down in the road when I saw him—all the prisoners were then out of their chaise—they then got into their chaise and drove off—the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

On 25th April, at eight o'clock, the prisoner came to our shop—I was engaged at the time—my father called me forward, and the prisoner went outside the shop—I went after him and asked him what he wanted—he said, "Some cloth"—I told I was disen<lb/>gaged, I could serve him, and went back towards the shop—I supposed he was following me, turned back, and he had walked off twenty yards from me down the road—I thought there was something suspicious about it, went after him, put my hand round his waist, and found these four yards of cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)under his coat, worth about 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was William and Samuel Colston's property—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, of York-street, St. James's, and am the prisoner's brother; he is fifty-three years of age—he was tried here in Nov., 1849, for two acts of pilfering—a nominal sentence of three days was passed by the late Common Serjeant, and he was given up to the care of his relatives, on the ground that he was not in a state to distinguish right from wrong—when this last act was committed, he lived at Walnut-tree-walk, Lambeth; I and his friends supplied him with the means of living—he has been asked whether he wanted more money, and if he had said he did, he would have had it immediately—I did everything except restraining his liberty, which I was afraid would aggravate his malady—he was in business as a linen-draper at Southampton, and failed seven or eight years ago—his mind was always affected, from his youth, and that made it much worse—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185005060108"/>
               <p>was not capable of carrying on his business—frequently he has thought he has lost all chance of salvation, and I have seen him weeping and wringing his hands, and refusing to be comforted—my father was always considered insane, and a paternal uncle in the army would have been shot for striking his superior officer, but was acquitted on the ground of insanity—three brothers, distant relatives on my father's side, were confirmed lunatics, and restrained throughout their lives—I have been led by this, in some degree, to make the mind a subject of study, and have published on it—I consider the prisoner's mind is sometimes in that state, that he does not know right from wrong.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am surgeon of the Gaol of Newgate. I have examined the prisoner this morning—I am of opinion that he is of weak imbecile mind—I have heard the last witness's statement—a large failure in business, in many cases, weakens persons' minds—insanity is also trans<lb/>mitted—I have heard that his father and other relatives were insane—the larger the number of relatives that have been insane would increase the like<lb/>lihood of his being so—it is probable that his mind is in such a state, that he sometimes does not know right from wrong.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, White-street, Waterloo-road, and am a sailor. On 4th April, between eight and nine o'clock, I went to a public-house called the Herb of Waterloo, in Waterloo-road, kept by Okey—I was nearly drunk when I went in—I had nine sovereigns and a half in my left waistcoat-pocket, and a crown-piece in my right waistcoat-pocket—I remem<lb/>ber seeing Frost there—he had a white smock-frock on, and a red handker<lb/>chief round his neck—I wanted to go to sleep, and I did fall asleep—when I was sleepy Frost was near me, and he was <hi rend="italic">fumbling</hi> at my waistcoat-pocket, but I was too drunk to take notice of it—I paid for what I drank there with some silver—I did not change any gold—I afterwards was taken to the station, and when I got sober I missed all my money, and my hat and hand<lb/>kerchief were gone, but when I got home a single sixpence was found on me.</p>

I remember the prosecutor coming there on the evening of 4th April—three or four coal-heavers drank with him—I saw Turner there; he drank with him—Turner told me that the sailor was a relation of his, and that he was not so drunk as he pretended to be—the sailor went to sleep—the coalheavers that he had been drinking with, were near him at the time he was asleep, but not Turner—after Turner had said about his being a relation, he still remained in the house—I heard of the sailor being rubbed—Turner still remained in the room—he paid for a glass of gin-and-bitters, which the sailor had—I said to Turner it was a pity that the sailor should have any more drink, and Turner said he was not so tipsy as he pretended to be, he could go home if he liked.</p>

I went into Okey's, at a quarter before nine o'clock that night—I saw both the prisoners and the sailor there—Frost was dressed in a white smock-frock and a white straw hat—the sailor's head was lolling on Frost's breast—I saw Frost put his hand into the sailor's right-hand trowsers pocket, and take some halfpence out, which he gave to another man, who is not in custody, and he called for a pot of beer—Frost had a white straw hat on, like a sailor's hat, only not covered—when Frost took out the halfpence I looked at him, and he kept his eye fixed on me—I then saw him put his hand into the sailor's waistcoat pocket, and he took out something, but I did not see what it was—I said to some parties who were there, "That man is robbing the sailor"—I should have given him into custody at the time if it had not been represented to me that Turner was a cousin of the sailor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. William Thomas Marsh, a grocer, in Lambeth-walk.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 212.) On 18th April I went to a house in Blue-gate Fields—I saw Butler in bed—I asked her name—she said Williams—I asked her where she came from—she said from Westminster—the prisoner was present, and I then asked her how long Butler had been there—she said, "About a month"—I asked her if she knew her—she said, "No;" she came there for a lodging—I asked the prisoner if she had seen any money about her—she said she had laid out a few pounds for her while she was in bed—she said she had had wine, and gin, and oysters, and lamb chops—I then asked the prisoner whether she had changed any note—she said, "No," she had not; she had not seen one—I then left Butler in custody of another officer, as I was not certain she was the woman—I went to Mrs. Buckmaster's, in Snow's-fields, and she came and identified Butler—the prisoner was not in then, and I went to look for her—I saw her coming by King David-lane station, and I called her in—I said, "What about the note? what have you done with the note?"—she said, "I know nothing about it; I had no note"—I said, "The old lady says that you had" (I meant Butler)—the prisoner then said, "I will go up and see her"—she went to her own house, in Blue-gate Fields, to see Butler—I went with her—I then, in her presence, said to Butler, "What about the note?"—Butler said, "I gave it to the landlady?"—Gillingham then said she left it at the Royal Sovereign for safety, if the old woman should die, to put her underground—she did not say that in Butler's presence; we were going out of the door at the time—I searched the bed where Butler was lying, and there I found three sovereigns, four sixpences, and two small pieces of silver, and this purse, which was identified by the prosecutrix—that was all I found in the bed—I did not see the prisoner afterwards on that day—on the 23rd I apprehended her, and told her I wanted her for receiving the note, knowing it to be stolen—she said she did not know it, and she pulled out a pocket-book and gave it me, and in it were these pieces of coin—I asked her how she got them—she stated that they belonged to her son, and she had had them some time—the prosecutrix identified them—I am quite clear that the coins that she said belonged to her son were what are identified by the prose<lb/>cutrix—she distinctly identified one, and she says she had such a piece as the other—I then said to the prisoner, "They have missed some foreign coin"—she then said, "It was swept up in the house"—I found on her one sovereign, seven shillings, and one penny.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a superannuated inspector, and live in Park-place. On 3rd May I was in Clapham-park—the prisoners followed me a considerable distance—there were gas-lamps, and I could see their faces—Leonard came up to me on the right side, caught me by the arm with her left-hand, and asked me how I did, and to go home with her—I said, "No, I don't want you"—I just put her away—she laid hold of me by the collar with her left-hand—I slightly turned my head to disengage myself, and perceived a man—Leonard applied a heavy blow to my mouth, which I thought was with a handkerchief, or some soft substance, but it stunned me—before I could recover myself, I was struck a heavy blow with a fist on the back of my head which stunned me—it was from neither of the women—I fell on my left side—Leonard threw herself on the top of me, and at the same moment I received several severe kicks in the back, which could not be from a woman—Leonard kept the handkerchief to my month—I resisted all I could to keep it away, for I suspected there was something deliterious which I was to inhale—I smelt something unpleasant, but the time was so short I could inhale but a very little—Conner laid hold of my watch—she had a difficulty to get it out, but she did—I caught it by the guard, and had it in my hand when the police came—Leonard got her hand into my pocket with the money, and took some out—I laid hold of her hand, but could not hold it—I felt money in her hand—I got two or three pieces of money, and put them under my thigh on the ground to take care of them—I lost half-a-sovereign and about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I called "Police!" and "Murder!" and a policeman came—I was very much alarmed—I was not six hours out of bed from Friday night till Tuesday morning, and my head was very much affected—I had to use applications both to my head and back—I am not sure that I inhaled any<lb/>thing—I did not know the policeman—I still kept crying "Murder!" after the second policeman came up.</p>

               <p>and the prisoners were three or four steps from him walking away—I stopped them, and asked them what they had been at—Leonard said, "It is not us, policeman, it is a man just ran down that way," pointing to the very way I had come—I had met no one, and must have done so if any one had gone that way—I took them both to Bass, who was lying down—he said he had been knocked down by two females and a man, and robbed—his watch was in his hand—he said Leonard had pulled it out—that he was knocked down and hit on the side of the head by Leonard, and then received a kick or blow on the back by a man who he had got a glimpse of—he seemed hardly to know what he was about, as if tipsy, but when he got to the station, he came to himself very quickly, and said he had lost a sovereign and eight shillings—sixpence, a penny, and a pawnbroker's ticket were found on Conner—about four o'clock in the morning, I found two shillings and a half-crown in the grass, fourteen or fifteen yards from the spot where Bass lay—both prisoners had walked in that direction; I found one shilling and a sixpence where he lay—he said he had taken money from his pocket and put it there—there was a gas-lamp 100 yards off.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Russell.</hi> I did not refuse to go back with you; I said you had better fetch another policeman before I went, as they were too strong for you; they had beaten me about. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She did say they would knock her about if she went back.</p>

I took Hopkins—I said, "You know what it is for"—he said, "Yes"—I afterwards said I took him on suspicion of being concerned in a robbery in Battersea-fields on Sunday evening—he said, "I know about it; I was robbed myself; I lost my cap, and several things out of my pocket."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Hopkins's Defence.</hi> I went with the policeman quietly; I thought he wanted me as a witness rather than a prisoner, or I could easily have got away. We were drinking, and Hinds said he would fight me; I hit him in the eye; whether he went away I don't know; I stopped a quarter of an hour, went out, and found two men fighting with him; I went and took his part; I caught hold of him by the jacket, and said, "Come along, let us go after him;" the two men took my cap and jacket while I was helping him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father, and am a fellow-ship-porter. In April last we were living at the Hope public-house in Gravel-lane, Southwark—my wife has been dead six years—I only occupy one room—the prisoner has lived with me since her birth—she has never been to service but three days—she will be nineteen next August—on Tuesday morning, 16th April, she woke me about eight o'clock—I had been asleep up to that time, and had not seen her preparing my breakfast—she woke me, and said, "Father, your breakfast is ready," and brought me a cup of coffee, and some bread and butter on a small tray—I stirred the coffee round, and tasted it; it tasted very unpleasant—I said, "Louisa, you have put something into the coffee," and spat it out—she said, "No, father"—I tasted it a second time, and was forced to spit it out again—my mouth and lips were very much parched, and my teeth shook—I felt a sensation of burning, and said, "Louisa, you have put poison in the coffee?"—she said, "No, father, I have not"—she then took the cup off the tray, and threw the contents into a washhand basin containing the water I had used the over night—she then took the cup to the fireside, rinsed it out with water from the kettle, and wiped it out—she threw the water under the grate—I got out of bed, and tasted her coffee, which she was drinking at the table—that had no unpleasant taste—I dressed myself, and put the contents of the basin into a clean jug, covered a handkerchief over it, and took it to Dr. Wood, of Union-street—in consequence of what he told me, I took it to Guy's Hospital—I then went back, and found the prisoner crying—I sent for a policeman, and gave her in charge for attempt<lb/>ing to poison me—she said to the policeman that she had dropped a piece of soda by accident into the cup—I afterwards gave the cup to Thomas Andrews, an assistant at Guy's Hospital—about a week afterwards, I gave a bottle and the coffee-pot to the policeman, and the soap which I had washed with the night before—I had used the soap several times in the interval, but not the coffee-pot—the bottle I found in the cupboard—I had had it for years—it was empty—it used to have oxalic acid in it twenty years ago, and was used for cleaning boot-tops.</p>

On 17th April, I received from Mr. Andrews, my assistant, a glass vessel—I unsealed it—it was completely secure—it con<lb/>tained a brown-coloured liquid, very acid, about thirty ounces, a pint and a half—I tested a portion of it—it had the colour and smell of coffee diluted—the acid element was vitriolic or sulphuric acid—there was about half a tea-spoonfull of strong vitriolic acid in the thirty ounces—taking into account that the coffee was not stirred up, I do not think there could have been appreciably more acid than I detected—if a person had tasted the coffee it would be detected by the lips—I tasted it, and detected it immediately—there was a small quantity of sugar—I applied all the tests for common poisons, but discovered no poi<lb/>son but sulphuric acid—the cup would hold half a pint, and therefore, about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185005060129"/>
               <p>a pint most have been added to it—I received a bottle, a cake of soap, a coffee-pot, and a teaspoon—the bottle appeared quite dry—I examined it by a very delicate chemical process, and found it had contained sulphuric acid some time or other—I tried it for oxalic acid, but it was not oxalic—oxalic acid would be more likely to adhere to the sides of the bottle in a dry state—if the bottle had contained oxalic acid, and vitriolic acid had been put into it, it would have removed the oxalic acid, and so have defeated the tests for oxalic acid—I examined the coffee-pot; it contained no trace of vitriolic acid, but when I warmed in it a small portion of the liquid, it immediately dissolved a small portion of iron from the pot, which was a consequence of its containing acid; there was no iron in the original liquid which I put into the pot—I examined the soap, but found no acid in it, except a small quan<lb/>tity combined with sulphate of soda; but there was probably not the third part of a grain of soda in the thirty ounces—what I found, could not account by any possibility for the acid in the coffee—we find vitriolic acid in all soap, but in very small portions—soap is made with common carbonate of soda, which is roughly made, and contains a little sulphate of soda, from which it is pre<lb/>pared originally—the acid could not have been in the basin when Mr. Hartley washed his hands, it would have prevented the soap dissolving; in fact, it would have affected the fingers, and he must have discovered it—if the soap had remained in the water all night, it would not have added to the quantity of vitriolic acid in the basin—whether it came in with the coffee, or in any other way, I cannot say—I am able to say it was mixed after the coffee was prepared and removed from the pot, or else added to the water in the basin—I detected a small quantity of soda, but no more than would be accounted for by washing the hands with the quantity of soap dissolved in the liquid—an adequate quantity of acid would have counteracted that—I do not think the quantity of acid in the cup of coffee-would be sufficient to cause death—a person might drink it, but the pain of doing so would be acute—I ought to state, that the injurious action of vitriolic acid depends more upon its concen<lb/>tration than its quantity—the proportion of vitriolic acid to the quantity of coffee, was 150 parts of coffee to one part of acid—I have tasted that strength of acid myself—a person would feel a dryness or parched state of the mouth, and a sharp sort of feeling of the teeth, which is called setting on edge, and if the whole contents of the cup had been swallowed, he would probably have suffered from vomiting, pain in the stomach, and soreness of the throat in swallowing, but I believe that in a few hours the whole of those symptoms would have disappeared, and he would have recovered without medical assist<lb/>ance, and without any injurious consequence; in fact, the acid coffee was very little stronger than that which is sometimes given in an ordinary acid gargle—it would not have the effect of destroying the surface of the mouth, but it would produce a whitish appearance by acting on the saliva—I clipped my hands in it, and put it to my lips and tongue, and made my assist<lb/>ant taste it—it would alarm a person, and so perhaps give him a stronger sensation of pain; but the whole quantity would only occasion temporary uneasiness.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you form any opinion whether the vitriolic acid you dis<lb/>covered in the bottle had been there recently? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it had not been there for a long period—it appeared as if it had contained it years before, and a little dried film might have remained, but not within a month or six weeks certainly—four times as much acid as I found could be bought for a halfpenny, about two tea-spoonfulls—it is sold in two states, concentrated and diluted, such as is used for cleaning copper scuttles—the measure of that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185005060130"/>
               <p>would be greater—if a person asked for vitriolic acid they would get the diluted, unless they asked for oil of vitriol.</p>

                  </hi>. I am horsekeeper in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. Gardener was a carman in their employ—his duty was to go out with a pair of horses and a van, and collect the goods—he was allowed to take two bags of provender for the horses when he went out in the morning, and when he returned to fill them again; two bags each time he went out—he had no right to take any other provender—I have ex<lb/>amined some mixture of oats, beans, cut clover, and chaff, produced by Goddard—it corresponded with what was left in our bins—I cannot swear to it—Garde<lb/>ner is a married man, and I believe has a family.</p>
