                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, in the employment of Julius Quitman, a dealer in silk, of 19, Castle Street, Falcon Square—I hate been in the service seven or eight years—the prisoner came into the service some time in January, this year, as town traveller—it was his duty to obtain orders for goods and to wait on the customers of the firm—he was entrusted with sample pieces of silk—before taking them out, a memorandum would be made in the books of the firm of what he received—if I was in he would tell me what he took away; if not, he usually wrote it on a slip of paper before a new customer could be supplied, he had to submit the name to Mr. Quitman, and inquiries were then made—he was not allowed to buy silk—Mre. Ellis, of 46, New North Road, was not a customer of the firm somewhere about the latter part of March I missed a piece of silk 32 yards in length, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I spoke to the prisoner about it; that must have been after the 31st—I told him I had missed it, and asked if he had sold it—he said he had taken it away as be went home one evening, and had left it with a party, but that he had not agreed to keep it yet—I asked him about when that was, he named a day, and I put it down then as the 18th—there had been no entry made of it in our books—he has never paid for it, nor has Mrs. Ellis—Mr. Jardine is a customer of ours—on 22nd April there is an entry of three pieces of silk to him, No. 10,087, 84 yards, at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; No. 10,054, 101 1/4 yards, and No. 10,059, 98 3/4 yards, at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 15th May we sent Mr. Jardine a memorandum order to return those three pieces by bearer—we reoeived the two last with a message—I saw the prisoner afterwards the same morning, and said to him "I have sent in for those three pieces to Mr. Jardine, he has sent back two, and says that you had the other one"—the prisoner said "Oh, that is all right;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187311240004"/>
               <p>he wants to keep it a bit longer, he thinks he can do with it; don't send in for it again, yet"—he left our service somewhere about 24th May—up to that time I had not seen the silk, or been paid for it—this receipt (<hi rend="italic">pro duced</hi>) I believe to be the prisoner's writing; it is dated the 13th May; it refers to the 84 yards sent in on 16th March.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not enter the 32 yards to the prisoner to charge him with it, I merely put it down in this rough scrap-book—I did not ask him with whom he had left it on approbation; I know now that it was left with Mrs. Ellis—the prisoner was entitled to take out goods if he stated where they were going—we had a porter of the name of James Hunt, to whom he could communicate that, when I was not there; Hunt has left us—I believe he was there at that time; he had nothing to do with making entries—if the prisoner took out goods and received the money it was his duty to hand it to the cashier—the entries with regard to the three pieces left with Jardine are correct—I did not give him goods to take out; he used to take them from the fixtures, stating where they were going; he gene rally did that before he went out—he had no trap; he walked—I did not make any note of the conversation on 15th May—I did not doubt what the prisoner said at the time—Mr. Jardine is still debited with the missing piece—we do not know where it is.</p>

I am a widow, and live at 44, New North Road—I have known the prisoner five or six years—some time in March he was showing me some patterns, and I asked him if he could get me a piece of silk—he said he could—I told him I could not pay till June—he brought it me three or four days afterwards—I asked him the price—I am not certain whether he said 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he said I could have it at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I was to pay him on 20th June—he did not leave any memorandum with it—I knew he had obtained the silk from his employer, Mr. Quitman, he told me so; he said he was traveller, or salesman for the firm—I gave 32 yards of it to my dressmaker to make up; one dress was made for my sister, and one partly made, which I gave up to Mr. Brett—it was to be made for the boat race, but unfortunately I had a little trouble, and she was told not to go on with it, and I asked the prisoner if it would make any difference to Mr. Quitman if I paid on 29th September; he said be dared say that would do—that was about the end of June—I asked him for the invoice, and he said when I paid Mr. Quitman I could have the bill and receipt, it mattered not who I paid, Mr. Quitman or himself—I did not tell him not to give my name to the firm.</p>

I am a cloak manufacturer, of 22, Castle Street, Falcon Square—I have dealt with Mr. Quitman for silk—in March or April the prisoner called on me, and showed me some samples of silk—towards the end of April or the beginning of May, a piece of 84 yds., at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, was delivered to me, and subsequently two other lengths of 101 1/4 yds. and 98 3/4 yds. at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw the prisoner on 13th May, the date of this receipt—I wrote it and he signed it—he signed for one piece, the 84 yds. at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the other two pieces were subsequently returned to Mr. Quitman, and I have never seen the 84 yrds. since the prisoner took it away—I have not had it.</p>

I am a silk merchant, of 19, Castle Street, Falcon Square—in January, this year, I engaged the prisoner as town traveller at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I knew nothing of Mrs. Ellis until after he left my service, which was about 20th of May, nor did I know of the 84 yds. of silk being returned to him by Mr. Jardine—I found it oat afterwards—I have never seen that piece of silk since—I made some inquiries of him about it in June, and he said he had sold it to a party at Kingston, but he never gave me the name, and I never could find out—I have no customer at Kingston.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I wrote to him in June asking him for an explanation, and he came on—I wanted to know where the piece of silk was—I don't know whether I wanted the silk or the money—I did not ask him for either the silk or the money—I asked him what had become of the two pieces of silk, and he said one piece he had sold at Kingston and the other piece he had sold to a Mrs. Ellis—I don't recollect asking him the name of the person at Kingston—I don't recollect saying anything about the money—it is the course of business to have either the goods or the money, but he had no business to sell goods without our sanction, without their being in voiced from our counting-house.</p>

I am a carman—in July last I was in the service of Mr. Taylor—I was ordered by him to go to Thames Street—I got there a few minutes before 7 o'clock—I don't think the warehouse was open; I waited till it was open—I then saw a man that loaded me, Newton is some thing like the man, but I can't say—my wagon was loaded with sashs weights—Hickley was not there—I took them to Hickley's house, 14, Robertson Terrace—some little time after I went again to the warehouse, by order of my employer—I saw, I think, the same two men—I had a few sash weights then, and I think a few stoves, and took them to Hickley's house—some little time afterwards I went again; on that occasion I believe: Hickley went with me—we got there about the same time in the morning—I was loaded with a few sash weights, a few iron pallisades, and a few pipes—I took them to Hickley's house—I don't recollect how either of the men at the warehouse were dressed; I think one had a paper cap on—I did not sign any paper on either occasion—some little time after the third occasion I took a load of water-pipes from Hickley's house to Camberwell Green—Hickley went with me.</p>

I am London agent for the Carrón Company, in Thames Street—it is the largest iron concern in London—I have not seen the pro perty the subject of these invoices, but I know what builder's materials are and the prices—there is a class of goods bought by builders which no one in the trade can mistake, they generally buy the lowest priced articles—these invoices give the dimensions in inches of the stoves—the prices that I have heard quoted this morning are all below the current prices at that date those goods were bought—the lowest price for sash weights in Thames Street has been 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from 2nd June up to the present time—I have heard 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as the price paid, generally speaking it is 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the lowest price for register stoves is 3 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per inch—the price quoted here is less, and gutter is also quoted at less than the current price, and pipes also—here is an invoice of sash weights at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I could not buy sash weights at any time during the period mentioned here at that price—there are about fifteen houses in Thames Street, but not one sold at that price—there are very seldom any second-hand sash weights, you may sometimes have them in getting down old buildings, but they are articles that are never in the market, builders generally appropriate them for new buildings—in thirty eight years' experience I never heard of a job lot of sash weights—I say that all these things are below the lowest current price, that is, the price at which I should sell to an ironmonger to sell again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been in the prisoner's company from 11 o'clock on the Friday night—we had a half-gallon of beer at dinner-time on Satur day, which we always had—I don't know anything about a second half gallon—I don't recollect the master coming down and asking why it was all drank and none left for him—I was out when the prisoner sent for the second half-gallon—when I returned I spoke to him in German—I did not use any strong language—I said "Had you not time the night before to get drunk?"—I did not catch hold of his legs or neck and pull him off the trough; I did not touch him—I know Peter the apprentice—I did not say to him next day that I did not know who was to blame; I never said that—Mr. Moss did not arrange with me that I was to have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave my wife 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Saturday night; I don't know that that was the prisoner's wages—after he was given in charge the solicitor came to me to settle it; I said it could not be settled—I did not strike the apprentice on the Satur day afternoon before this happened; I did not say I would beat him too if he interfered—I do not know Frantz Obeist—I never said to him, or to anyone, that I did not know whose fault it was, and that I struck the pri soner first and seized him by the throat; it is all invention.</p>

E. and M. Moses and Sons, clothiers, and the man who gave them to him was Page, and he worked for a Mr. Meyer—he said after wards that Page had called on him that morning at his own residence, Montague.

Graves' house, two men came out from a ditch, caught him by the back of his neck, and threw him on his back; that one of them was Brown, and the other a man with dark whiskers—the constable took him to the gas and said "If you have been on your back there must be some dirt on your coat," but he could not find any, or any signs of injuries—I asked him if he could swear to Brown—he said "Yes," and that while he was on his back they knelt on his chest; that be could not say which man took his money, but that Brown said "I owe you a grudge, and now I will pay you"—the constable cautioned him several times—we had to pass the spot to go to Brown's house; we examined with a lantern, but saw no marks of any scuffle—he said "This is the spot," and pointed with his finger—the constable turned his light on to the ditch, and we saw what we imagined were footsteps; we remained at the spot till daylight, when they seemed to be the footmarks of children gathering blackberries—we took Brown the same morning—he was in bed; he said that he had not seen Cavill that day—Cavill said "You know you have. Brown, and you have robbed me of my watch and money"—I took Brown to the station—the spot pointed out to me was about 30 yards from Mr. Graves' house and 300 or 400 yards from Brown's house—there are two other houses there inhabited.</p>

On 24th October I went to Sir William Palliser's premises, 154, Minories, about 7 o'clock p. m., when the menknocked off work—the prisoner Clifton was called into the office as he left, where one or two members of the firm were present—I said to Clifton "Iam a police officer, and in consequence of something that has occurred Iwish to ask you a few questions; first, have you anything about you?"—hesaid "No"—I said "I must search you"—I did so, and found three smallpieces of leather in his trousers pocket—he said "I picked them up offthe warehouse floor, I thought there was no harm in it"—I said "Do youknow a woman named Brown?"—he said "No"—I said "Do you knowanyone living on the Seven Dials?"—he said "Yes, I know Mr. Darling, 17, Little Earl Street"—I said "I want you to tell me all you knowrespecting Mr. Darling"—he said "You will be very much surprised tohear what I have to say; there is a man, an old servant of the firm, whohas been robbing the firm for some time, his name is Larkins; I, with amate of mine, named Pearson, suspected him and watched him; one night, two or three weeks ago, we followed him out, and stopped him and said 'You have something in your pocket you ought not to have, we shall giveyou in charge of the first policeman we see; 'but he begged so hard that wedid not do so, as we ought to have done; a week or two after that we sawhim leave again, and followed him into Holborn, we stopped him and said 'You have got something in your pocket again; 'he said 'No, I have not; 'we then made him show us the shop where he had been in the habit ofselling the leather, and he showed us the shop of Mr. Darling, 17.

Wontner were instructed next morning at the Mansion House—I searched Pearson's house, and found some pieces ofleather—Clifton picked out one piece, and said "One piece I bought, andthe rest I picked up off the warehouse"—I went to Mr. Darling's and re<lb/>ceived from him some leather and elastic webbing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the association called the Orange and Fruit Porters' Gang, which consists of fifty fellowship porters—they earnmoney by loading and unloading fruit vessels in the Port of London—theprisoner has been employed as clerk and manager since 1867—he received 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, out of which he had to pay two boys—he received all themoneys from the brokers' ships, an account of his receipts and disburse<lb/>ments—if he wanted money he applied to me—I advanced him 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in October, 1872, and he gave me this receipt for it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Free haslooked into his books since he left—on 31st July we gave him notice toleave, and he left on 6th September—on the night he left he handed overto me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him if that was the correct balance—he said "Yes"—after Mr. Free had gone into the accounts a statement was made out of 127<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see the prisoner after that till he was in custody, but Ireceived this letter from him on 8th September—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated September</hi> 8, <hi rend="italic">and stated</hi>: "Dear Jack, I am sorry to inform you that there is adeficiency in my accounts, which I shall expect you to keep to yourself. Iwas surprised when I balanced to-day to find it so, but there it is and itcannot be altered at present. Since the gang so kindly informed me myservices would be no longer required I have been gambling very heavy, andhave got rid of about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Of course you are aware, as well as Mr. Free, that we have during the last three years received from Mr. Grant alarge sum we were not entitled to, that amount you are aware has gone tothe Gang's credit, I have not received one penny. I simply mention this tokeep you silent. If I succeed I will send you the amount I amdeficient. I have pawned my watch to pay my fare to Paris, &amp;c. Signed E.

Adams, Keeling, and Grant, the items, and name the amounts you have knowinglyreceived from them which you were not entitled to. You know I havepointed out the discrepancies to you, and you have distinctly said 'Letthem pass, they will not be found out. 'which so far has turned out correct. There is no excuse for you, the amount so obtained has gone direct to yourfund; I have not received one penny benefit, so I think you will have badluck if I bring these matters to light. Would you believe theamounts you have received make a total of 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? it seems a very largeamount, but then you know the errors were so numerous. Theamount I consider I owe you is 106<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I received from you, which I did not enter, I declare most solemnly was a pure accident, I wasastounded when you produced the receipt. I shall leave London to-night; it is no use your going to expense to try to find me, you will find Ihave got nothing if you do, &amp;c.")—I also received this letter from Newgate Gaol, in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This requested the witness to take the opinion of the men as to whether the prisoner was to be subjected to any further prose<lb/>cution</hi>)—Messrs. Grant have not been defrauded, and the prisoner never said Ia word to me about it—no overcharges have been made to Hunt, or Keeling, or Adams; I have been to all the brokers—the prisoner never named to me Ithat he was overcharging them—I took the opinion of some of the Committee I—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the only two books I have had from the prisoner; Ithey are in his writing.</p>

This 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which is brought forward in thisbook is supposed to be part of what I have stolen, but if last year's wages-book is produced, it will show that the 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was brought forward by me, Ihaving paid it out of my own pocket to make the accounts up. Therewas not enough money, and I used money belonging to myself to make upthe payments, and that is brought forward here. When I wrote, I ad<lb/>mitted that I owed 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had received money in 1871 and 1872 amountingto 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and as I had paid the money out of my own pocket I should havepocketed the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but instead of doing so I wrote it into the account, andkept the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out, so I was cheating myself of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. When the deficiencyoccurred, I tried to account for it, but could not till Mr. Wontner producedthe receipts. If last year's balance sheet and wages book are produced, Ithink they will prove that what I say is correct With regard to Bloom-field saying that the men are not of opinion that I should be let off, it isentirely false.

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Edward Bowring Stephens, theprosecutor—business was commenced at Gun Wharf by Mr. Stephens, as awharfinger, on 25th June last—up to the 11th September, when the pri-soner was given into custody; we had had three cargoes of castor oil from the <hi rend="italic">Queen Victoria</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Vibillia</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Saltwell</hi>—those were the only cargoeswe had—the prisoner was engaged at the opening of the wharf as foremanand superintendent—he had charge of the cargoes that came to the wharf—castor oil comes from the ship in wooden cases containing four tins in eachcase—this is one of the tins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are never more than fourin a case—we employ a tinman to solder such as are leaky—all the casesare opened, and every tin carefully examined, and where tins are found tohave leaked they are filled up from other tins—that is part of the businessof a wharfinger—tins so emptied are returned as ullage—each tin containsabout forty pounds weight of castor oil—it was the prisoner's duty to makeentries of the cargoes in his book—the repairs are done by the tinman onwhat we call the quay—we have not a quay close to the river side, it is along road to the river—that is level with the street—it is called the Bank, and what I call the quay; but it is really a cart way—no leaky tins wouldgo into the basement, or tins that were known to be leaky—the tins are allweighed in drafts of four after they have been repaired and filled, and thenpiled away in the vaults off the basement—the castor oil in this case wasplaced in one of those vaults—after they have been weighed in drafts offour, the weights are entered in a book called the landing account—theprisoner enters a return of how many sound tins are turned out of thecargo, and also a return of the ullage, and the landed empties—I find anentry of the <hi rend="italic">Queen Victoria</hi>, at page nine, of 100 cases, and at page ten, 125 cases; that makes 225 cases, which would be 900 tins—he has returned I 380 tins out of the 100 cases as full and fit for the merchant, and 476 out ofthe 125 case parcel, out of 500 tins—that leaves forty-four tins to beaccounted for by landed empties and ullage—he has entered fifteen ullageand five tins landed empty out of the 400 tins, and fourteen ullage and ten</p>

               <p>empties out of the 500—the tins are numbered consecutively in the landingaccount—the first parcel is numbered 1 to 380—for receiving the castor oilfor the purpose of ullage, the tins would be opened where the plate is; where they have been originally filled, and for the purpose of emptying theyare opened at the corner—this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is properly opened for thatpurpose; it ought to be a little closer to the corner, perhaps; still it is notout of the way—I never knew a tin opened in the way this one is (<hi rend="italic">another tin produced</hi>)—there is also an entry in the prisoner's writing of two parcels, 125 and 150 cases of castor oil from the <hi rend="italic">Vibillia</hi>—the first parcel is atpage thirteen, of 125 cases from the <hi rend="italic">Vibillia</hi>; that would be 500 tins—hereturns 492 as the number made up full for the merchant, and eight tinsullage empty—there are no landed empties in that parcel—the next parcelfrom the <hi rend="italic">Vibillia</hi> is on the same page, 150 cases, 600 tins—he returns 591 full fur the merchant, and nine tins ullage empty—at page fifteen, thereis an entry in the prisoner's writing of 100 cases, that is 400 tins, from the <hi rend="italic">Saltwell</hi>—he returned 382 for the merchant, six tins ullage empty, and twelve landed empty—there were 225 cases by the <hi rend="italic">Queen Victoria</hi>, 275 by the <hi rend="italic">Vibillia</hi>, and 100 by the <hi rend="italic">Saltwell</hi>, making 600 altogether, which would be 2, 400 tins, and I find 2, 321 for the merchant, which leavesseventy-nine to be returned as either ullage or empties—I searched toascertain the number of tins on the premises, when the prisoner was takeninto custody—there ought to have been seventy-nine empty tins, and therewere only seventy-one, and we found ten opened in this improper manner, apparently with a chisel, the same implement as the others, but opened inthe middle to empty it in a mass instead of pouring it—the prisoner wouldnot be justified at any time in emptying castor oil down the well—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), is a sample bottle, and the merchants are supplied with samplesin these bottles—I never knew of castor oil being put in a wine bottle, ora workman's tin can, for the purpose of sampling—I know a workmancalled Bolton—he was engaged by the prisoner—they are paid by the hour, and it is on the foreman's certificate that they get their wages—Boltonmade a communication to me on the 8th August—I had heard the night before that he had been discharged by Venner—in consequence of what Bolton said, I spoke to Venner on the morning of 8th August—I said "Theman Bolton has been to me this morning and made a complaint that youdischarged him, and used blackguard language to him, and that he com<lb/>plained, and you told him to take his money and be off"—the prisoner saidhe was cheeky, and kept him twenty minutes for some men that he wanted—I said "I am not going to interfere between you and the men, but thisfellow charges you with having set aside a certain quantity of castor oil, full tins of castor oil, and returned them to the merchant as empties. Isthere any truth in this charge that he makes?"—he said "None whatever"—I told him I did not believe the man for a moment—he threatened us togo to the merchants, and report the fact to them—Venner said "I shalltreat the matter with the contempt it deserves, and order him off thepremises"—I told the man to go about his business—the conversation with Venner took place in his own office, and also in the cellar—we continued itus we went down stairs—I pointed out some tins in the cellar, and said "What are those set aside there?"—I found they were duty-marked tins, that is in consecutive numbers, and that satisfied me at that time—when Icame back to the wharf afterwards, I told him the merchants had been in<lb/>formed by Bolton, and that if I could get the complaint in writings we,</p>

               <p>that is Stephens &amp; Co., would prosecute for a malicious libel—that was theway we treated it at that time, with full confidence in Venner—I did nothave any conversation with the prisoner about the well—I knew nothingabout that until he was in charge—the value of the castor oil is about 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in the habit of seeing tins opened, more orless, for thirty years—I have not seen tins opened in a much roughermanner when they are leaky; you could not 611 an aperture from such ahole as this—there are only ten cases opened in this rough way on thepremises—the number of empties returned by the prisoner was seventy-nine, and there were only seventy-one—that leaves eight to be accountedfor—when tins are empty they are put in various places out of the way—there are a great many people who have business in and out of the wharf—it would be most improper if tins were leaking to put them on the steps ofthe well, because we have got square troughs holding four tins each, thecontents of an entire case, in which leaky tins are put to prevent the loss byullage—if I found any so placed by the well I should find fault with it; it would be a very irregular proceeding—when the <hi rend="italic">Queen Victoria</hi> parcelarrived we had not got those troughs; it arrived unexpectedly, and therewas a great deal of loss and waste in the yard and on the quay from thebad condition of the packages—we had given the order for the troughs, but they did not arrive until the next parcel was worked—I have seen castoroil tins placed on the flooring on the way to the vaults, but not leaky ones—I should find fault if I found any there—when Bolton made the complaintmy impression was that it was entirely false, and that impression remaineduntil the 9th or 10th September—in the meantime Bolton had been to themerchants—I called on them the same morning, and one of them complained—I tried to institute proceedings against Bolton the informant—I still dis<lb/>believed him, and endeavoured to convince the merchants that it was false—I should not have counted the tins unless there had been suspicion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We did not count them until the morning after theprisoner was in custody—we searched the premises to find all theempties that were there—the absence of the eight tins would be amatter of suspicion, but we should not have counted them except undersuspicion—some of the empty tins were in one cellar and some in another—strangers never go down in the cellar alone; some one connected withthe concern takes them—cotton is stowed on the wooden platform in thecellar—it would be very wrong to put leaky tins on the same floor ascotton—the tins are repaired up stairs, on a level with the street—thetroughs are used to put the tins in when they are being repaired—untilwe had the troughs the oil ran into the gutters and into the street, notdown the well.</p>

               <p>the 125 cases were brought from the <hi rend="italic">Vibillia</hi>—I helped to unpack them—six tins were landed empty—the prisoner asked me how many tins therewere landed empty—I told him six, and he said "You go down to the furtherend of the wharf, you will find some empty tins; pick out six of the worstand bring them up on the wharf, and take six full ones down in the place ofthem"—I did so by his orders—the six full ones that I took down had not been weighed or marked—I put them where he told me to put the four, theywere piled along with the four—I can't say the date, but it was about afortnight after the others—he afterwards told me to bring one of the fulltins up to his office, which I did, and then he unlocked his desk and took ascrew-driver and broke a hole in the tin, and he brought out two glassbottles, and got half a sheet of paper and made it like a funnel, and then Ipoured the oil into the bottles and filled them—they were something likepickle bottles—I know how they sample oil; they were not sample bottles; they were bottles that held about a quart of oil each—he ordered me to takethe tin down again, which I did, and placed it along with the others—about two days after that he called me down to him and gave me two canslike bricklayers take their coffee in, and he said "Go down, Bolton, take alamp, and fill these two tin cans and bring them up to me, "which I did—I continued with Mr. Stephens until 7th of August—on that day I badsome dispute with the prisoner, and he told me to go and get my money, and I was discharged—I afterwards complained to Mr. Hadow about what I had seen.</p>

               <p>into this matter, and let us have an answer.") I asked the prisoner how hecould account for it—he said there must be some mistake in the Calcuttaweights, the invoice shipping weights—my reply was "Hardly likely, Venner, as they weigh there so particularly to half a pound"—he then said that someof the chests might, in the cramped space in which we were working, havebeen run into other piles by accident—I said "It is a lame excuse, it is pos<lb/>sible but not probable"—nothing more passed between us—I was on the wharfby 8 o'clock the next morning; the prisoner was there at work—at that time the <hi rend="italic">Mysore</hi> cargo was being bulked and finished, and the <hi rend="italic">Malta</hi> cargo hadgone—in consequence of what Arnold said I made a search, and found thischest of shellac (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) amongst the empty packages—I saw the word "Malta" in pencil on one side of the chest, and "No. 187," the ship's rota<lb/>tion number—the tare was marked on it, 1 qr. 8 lbs.—I fetched a blackbrush and put a large star on the end of the chest and left it, with ordersthat it should not be moved—I gave those orders in the hearing of all themen who were working in that gang—about half-an-hour afterwards it hadbeen removed, and I found it at the end of the adjacent room, with theword shellac written on it, and "B.

               <p>—I delivered letters in the morning to the two Wilmots, to be sorted, andthey delivered them to the letter carriers—there are ten letter carriers andrural postmen—in some cases money is received from the postmen beforethey go out, on letters that are undercharged, out of their own pockets—letters prepaid by the postmen would be entered on the way bill; I didstate the contrary, but I did not understand; I believe it was not so previousto my going there, which was on 23rd September—there was a slate in theoffice for entering charges which were not paid by the town letter carriers, but that was not used by the rural deliverers—I believe the prisoner hassaid that he gave me a half-crown for the two letters, and that I gave himback a sixpence—I am prepared to swear positively that he did not do so—I swore before that I did not remember his doing so—my knowledge isderived in a great measure from the bill, but not entirely—I have a greatdeal of business to attend to.</p>

I am head letter-carrier at the Richmond Post-office—it is my duty, with my brother, to sort the paid letters into thedifferent districts—those on which charges have to be made go to Mr. Burden, and as a rule they come in a special parcel—Mr. Burden woulddeliver them to the different letter carriers—I sorted the letters on 30th September, and delivered some to the prisoner's walk—if they were endorsedin this way I should not have given them to the prisoner; I should havehanded them to Mr. Burden, supposing they had got among the other letters—next day, 1st October, the men were in the office, and I asked them whatmoney they had received the previous day for extra postage—the prisonersaid "A penny"—this was about 1. 15 or 1. 20—I am quite sure it was after 8 a.m.—the prisoner said nothing about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him "Both deliveries 11—he said "Yes"—Mr. Burden was present—on 17th October Mr. Forestcame down and said "Mr. Griffiths, what is this about Mrs. Leatham's letters;</p>

She afterwards cameback, and we had some more drink, and I went to her house and went to bed; when I awoke I asked her daughter, who is sixteen years old, where hermother was. She said that her mother was drunk in Kent Street. I after<lb/>wards heard her fall down stairs, and picked her up and put her outside thebed. She must have rolled off the bed when the policeman came to takeme. I have always behaved well to her, and given her half my earnings. I was obliged to leave her through her drink, and I have been away fromher ever since. I had a witness who came to the Court and swore that hesaw her lying at the bottom of the stairs drunk, but he is not here.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 16th, at 1. 10, I was near the Old Swan Pier, and heard cries of "Police!"from the south shore, I went over towards Fenning's Wharf, and someone Bang out "Stop that lug boat"—I went alongside of the lug boat, andsaid to Peacock "Where are you bound to?"—he said "lam going to the Custom House buoy"—I said, "What have you got in your lug boat I"—he said "Nothing"—I said "What cask is that?"—he said "I did notknow there was one in"—I said that I should take him in custody for theunlawful possession of a cask of brandy supposed to be stolen—I got himinto the boat, and rowed him up to Fenning's Wharf—I said "What wereyou doing in Dean's lug?"—he said "The governor had her on hire, and Iwas going to return her"—I left him in charge, and when I got to Fenning's Wharf, I heard something, went on board a <hi rend="italic">Billy Buoy</hi>, and found Payneconcealed under the windlas—he said "All right, I will come with you"—I placed him in the police galley with Pocock, and then found Andrewsconcealed between the main hawse and the after hatchway—I said "I wantyou for being concerned in that cask of brandy"—he said "All right," and pretended to be drunk—I put him with the other prisoners.</p>
