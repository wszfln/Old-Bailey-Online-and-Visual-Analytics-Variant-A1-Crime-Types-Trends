               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never took any thing out of the house but what Mrs. Hamilton sent me with; her husband was going to send her to the work-house for being continually drunk; I pledged them in my name, because she said, if Mr. Hamilton knew of it, he would murder her, that is true, as I stand before God; the things I sold, were things of my husband's; I never sold any thing of Mrs. Hamilton's in my life; I am innocent of what they charge me with; she said, she had twenty-four or twenty-five shillings of a milk-score that her husband knew nothing of, and she sent me with the porridge-pot to make up the money; as to the sheets, they were taken off the bed and lay on the dresser to be washed, when they took me.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Hamilton. Is any part of this story true? - Not a single syllable.</p>
               <p>Did you ever desire her to pledge any thing for you? - Never.</p>
               <p>To the prisoner. Did you set up this defence before the Justice? - I did; she acknowledged before the Justice that I pawned two gowns for her.</p>
               <p>To Elliot. Was you at the Justice's when the prisoner was examined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any thing of this pass? - No.</p>

               <p>What was it he threw in your eyes? - Snuff or tobacco dust, they said afterwards at the watch-house it was tobacco dust; I asked them what they meant by that; and they said they would let me know, or let me see; and I said I would have one of them to the watch-house, and I took hold of one of them, but which I cannot positively say, but I believe it was Barney, the farthest prisoner from me, that is the man I seized first; I held him some time, and struggled to hold him till we got out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070005"/>of the alley into Golden-lane, which might be eight or ten yards; there was a lamp at the end of the alley, I could discover them, I was rather come to my sight; I know the faces of Barney and Roberts.</p>
               <p>Had you known them before? - No; we struggled till we got into Golden-lane, then they all surrounded me, and I received some blows about my face and head; I defended myself as well as I could; one of the blows drove me against the public-house, I staggered against the wall, I did not fall down; and in that position one of them took off my hat and wig; I picked up my wig, I suppose it fell out of my hat, and my hat was gone almost instantly; I called watch, and stop thief, seeing they took different ways; but I could see one of them, which was Barney; he had something of an apron tied round him; I pursued him by that particular mark through what they call Basket-alley, and through a dark passage, he was never out of my sight; I took him in White-cross-street, he turned about, and said he was not the man; I took hold of him, and after some little struggle I brought him back with me; by the alarm of the watchman's-rattle, a gentleman had stopped Roberts, and a watchman had taken Eversall.</p>
               <p>Have you ever got your hat again? - Yes, the constable searched one of them and found my hat upon him.</p>
               <p>You pursued Barney by the mark of something he had tied round him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me he threw tobacco dust in your eyes? - I cannot be positive who threw it, I thought it was him because he was the first man.</p>
               <p>How do you know that the other men are the persons that were with Barney? - I could only be positive to Roberts striking me, he attacked me in the face, he came under the light of the lamp.</p>
               <p>Which is Roberts? - The tall man in the middle; I cannot swear to Eversall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did not you say before the Justice that Eversall was the only one you could swear to? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was you examined before? - Justice Blackborow.</p>
               <p>Was it taken in writing? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Did you sign it? - No.</p>
               <p>This was a dark alley; the first thing before you observed the men, was something was thrown in your eyes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How having tobacco dust thrown in your eyes, can you swear to persons you had never seen before? - I laid hold of Barney; and struggled with him, and said he should go to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>How is it that you with tobacco dust in your eyes, in a dark alley, knew these people? - When I came to the bottom of the alley after the struggle, they all came round me; there was a lamp over my head; Barney and Roberts attacked me in front.</p>
               <p>You have cleared your eyes of the tobacco dust; and the thief-takers have thrown some gold dust in your eyes? - There is no thief-takers in the business.</p>
               <p>You know there is a reward of three forty pounds, if the prisoners are convicted? - To be sure, I know that, but I don't come here on that account.</p>
               <p>Did not you say before the Justice that you did not know whether your hat fell off in the struggle, or was taken off? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you tell the Justice, that you did not know whether it fell off, or was taken off? - I cannot tell, I don't know that I did, I might say so.</p>
               <p>Don't you believe you said so? - I believe I might, I cannot immediately recollect.</p>
               <p>Who told you, if you should swear so here, these men could not be convicted so as to get the reward? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - No. 4, Atfield-street, St. Luke's; I have lived there many years.</p>
               <p>You was sober? - Perfectly sober; I am seldom otherwise.</p>
               <p>Court. You don't particularly recollect whether you told the Justice you did not know whether your hat fell off, or was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070006"/>taken off; you believed you might say so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I ask you then if you did say so before the Justice; was what you said before the Justice true? - I don't recollect that I did say so.</p>
               <p>When you was examined before the Justice; did you know whether your hat fell off, or was taken off? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you know? - That my hat was taken from me, and I am clear now it was taken off, and did not fall off.</p>
               <p>Was you clear of that when you was before the Justice? - I don't know that I was so clear, I was a good deal confused and bruised.</p>
               <p>When was you before the Justice, the same night, or the next morning? - The next morning.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that you remember better now, what happened that night, than you did the next morning? - I can recollect the circumstance very clear, and did then; if I made an error, it was not a wilful one.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was taken off, and did not fall off? - Yes, I verily believe it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>What makes you remember it better now than you did the day after? - I was in a very bad state at the time; I had several wounds in my head, and was cut and bruised.</p>

               <p>How came you to let her put her hand in your pocket a second time? - While I was taking the half crown from her she did it, and ran away with the watch in her hand; the man kept me there till she came out of the house again and ran off, and ran into a dark entry; the watch was seen in her hand after she went into the house; I laid hold of her again, and the mob said why don't you cry blood and murder, and you will be rescued; she beat me about the temples with her fist, and a great many more besides her; she got away from me; I followed her and catched her as she was going into another place; it was among such a mob and confusion that I cannot recollect what place; she then said if you will go into the house we will settle every thing, which I refused; then she beat and bruised me again; she got off again; I followed her the last time; I laid hold of her; a person came and rescued me; I was all over blood.</p>
               <p>Who came to your assistance? - One of Mr. Smith's officers; Mr. Dawson was the only person I saw when I came to myself; Ross was gone to get an officer.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. To save the Court trouble, I would observe, that I am a peer of the realm, and by my peers only I ought to be tried.</p>
               <p>Court. I believe these gentlemen must be your peers at present.</p>
               <p>Haynes. On Friday, the 25th of April, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our house; he said he should be glad to have a dinner, that he would have a veal cutlet; but that it must be very fat, and must be done with very rich sauce; I shewed him a room, he looked in and said, that was a public room, he must have a private room; he ordered every thing to be done as quick as possible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As it ought to be for a gentleman, they could not do it quick enough for me; I rung the bell twenty times a minute.</p>
               <p>Haynes. He ordered some potatoes to be got ready; some he would have boiled and some roasted on the gridiron; and he must have some wine and some porter; as soon as the dinner was served up, he rang the bell very hard, and called for a table spoon; the waiter went up to him, when he came down he told me the gentleman wanted a table spoon; and that he was certain he had carried one up, and laid it on the table; that he would take his oath of it; he had ordered a linen-draper and hosier to be sent for; I sent for a constable; he rang the bell again very hard; he wanted to know what there was to pay; I said I did not know till I saw that all my things were safe; I missed a spoon; he said, do you mean to tax me with your spoon, Madam? I am a nobleman, therefore I could not do such a thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They searched me, and stripped me naked as I was born; while I was in the room there was a magpie came in at the window, and knowing that magpies were notorious thives, I did not know but he might take it; I am the first man in the kingdom; I acquainted the king with my situation, and he was so enraged, that he ordered me immediately to be liberated; I made all Mr. Pitt's speeches; I am a legislator; a maker of laws; and therefore it is an absurd idea to suppose I should be a breaker of them; it is impossible I should be guilty of an action so base, and so degrading to human nature; I could not do it; I always had fifty servants at command; I am come to the estate of Lord Hertford of forty nine thousand a year; when I was a child of two years old I had eighteen thousand a year allowed for my education.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen this man before? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070009"/>Did you observe any thing particular in his behaviour? - Only his manner, ringing the bell; I sent for a constable, and he was taken into custody; and the spoon was found upon him.</p>
               <p>JOHN TAYLOR sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a waiter; the prisoner came to our house, my mistress shewed him into the dining room; he ordered a fire to be lighted immediately; and ordered a linen draper and hosier to be sent for, and bid me take his slippers down with me and clean them, which I did; he ordered a dinner, and bid me take care it was well dressed; and said, if he liked it he should dine there often; I carried up a pint of red port and a pint of beer; he desired to have the dinner up; I carried it, and put it on the table; before I had got down stairs, he rang the bell, and asked if it was customary to lay a cloth for a gentleman without putting a spoon upon the table; I told him I had laid a spoon on the table; he said do you keep a magpye, or jackdaw, perhaps that may have taken it off, says he, I saw one come in at the window; I said no Sir, there is no such thing kept here, therefore I expect you have the spoon, and nobody else; I went for a constable, when we came in, he was coming down stairs; he wanted to know what he was to pay; my mistress said she did not know if her things were safe; we went up stairs to see if the spoon might be mislaid any where; the constable opened his shirt and waistcoat, but we found nothing; he asked to go to the necessary, the constable went with him; he was fumbling about; the constable pulled off his breeches, and we found the spoon, it dropped from him in the necessary.</p>
               <p>Was there any body came into the room while he was there? - Not a soul.</p>

               <p>I am a baker; I live opposite where this man lay in Oxford-buildings; on Sunday night my wife and I had been out, we returned about one; the prosecutor sat with his hands in his coat pocket fast asleep; I called the watchman, and left him with the man; the man was asleep then; my wife said, the man is drunk and the watchman will do him; I opened the door a little way, and saw the watchman pull the watch out of the man's breeches pocket, and put it within-side his own great-coat; he then went off calling the hour; we went in search of the prisoner, and found him next day, by means of the beadle; he would not let us in; it was a quarter of an hour before we could get the door open.</p>
               <p>Why did not you take him that night? - I was afraid, because we had had a dispute with him that night; and I thought as he was a watchman, I should find him in the morning; it was a thing I did not know very well how to do.</p>

               <p>I am a beadle; the prisoner is a watchman; I and the watch-house keeper, and Cuming, went to search the prisoner's lodgings for a watch; he pretended he was drunk, and could not open the door; it was a long time before we got in; when we got in, I charged him with stealing the watch; he asked who the watch belonged to; but never denied having it, that I recollect; I found it among the ashes under the grate in his lodgings; Cuming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070013"/>described before I went the string of the watch, and the seals of it, very perfectly.</p>

               <p>When I cried the hour ten o'clock; I found the prosecutor laying drunk in the buildings; the next time I came my rounds, I found the watch lying near the place where I saw the man; when I came to the watch-house next morning, there was nobody there, and so I took the watch home; my wife put it in the ashes for fear I should play any games with it, and she locked me in. The beadle knows my character.</p>

               <p>To Biddington. What character does he bear? - I hope I shall be excused, as I am upon oath, I should hurt him.</p>

               <p>Turton. The prisoner came to me on the 21st of April, with one spoon; he said, his father was a master taylor, that he was in distress and sent him to sell it; my partner bought the first spoon, but I was present; he came afterwards with another about a month ago, almost with the same story; I asked him, if his father had got any work, he said no; my partner came in just as I gave the boy the money; says<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070016"/>he, I cannot tell what to make of it; I sent our boy to watch him.</p>
               <p>You had some suspicion then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to melt the property when you had a suspicion it was stolen? - I did not know how to find out the owners; I kept them a week before I inelred them down; we take silver in exchange for our work, and we have as many spoons as any thing.</p>
               <p>And do you buy of any stranger that comes to the shop? - No; but this boy came with so plausible a story, that, I did not doubt the truth of it.</p>
               <p>When you suspected him then you melted it down? - I kept it a week first; I did not mean any harm.</p>
               <p>Buying plate of strangers in this way, and destroying the evidence, is very improper conduct? - I promise you I shall never do the like again, and I am very sorry my name should be brought in question now; we work for some of the most capital houses in town.</p>
               <p>You must be very careful for the future? - Indeed, I will.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Sunday morning, the 13th of April, between six and seven o'clock, I was informed I had been robbed, and that the prisoner had been taken and carried to the round-house; about nine o'clock, the meat and cloth was brought me by the watchman; the cloth is a very particular one which I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Did you miss any meat? - No.</p>
               <p>In what state did you find your house? - The front door was unbolted, and the back door was open, but I believe that had been left open all night.</p>
               <p>ANDREW MARTIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; on the 13th of April, about a quarter past three in the morning, I saw the prisoner come from Mr. Buckmaster's door.</p>
               <p>His back door? - No, the front door.</p>
               <p>Did you see him come out at the door? - No, I heard a larch go, and saw him coming from towards the door, with fifty-two pounds of meat tied up in a cloth; he begged for mercy, and said, for God Almighty's sake to let him go!</p>
               <p>John Lawrence, another watchman, who was with the last witness, when he stopped the prisoner, confirmed his evidence; and deposed, that he took the property from the prisoner, that they took him to the round-house, and carried the property the next morning to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming along, I saw something lie up against a pair of gates, I picked it up, I do not know what was it to this minute; the watchman came up and took it from me; what they have said, is as false as God is true.</p>
               <p>To Martin. Was there any day-light when you saw the prisoner come out of the house? - It was moon-light; it was beginning to be day-light.</p>
               <p>Was there day-light enough for you to see the man coming out? - I believe there was.</p>
               <p>To Laurence. What do you say to that? - There was, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>To Buckmaster. Do you take so little account of your meat that you might lose fifty pounds of it without missing it? - I might have missed it if I had looked after it; I missed a shoulder of mutton when I came down; I had but one left in the evening, that was gone; it was found upon the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. That I had not; why will you tell such cursed stories? - I took it from her, and there were two six-pences in her lap along with it, loose; then with her left hand she took this parcel of money, and put it under her him; she took it from her lap and put it under her ham; I took it from her, and left her in custody; then I turned round to the man, and he had one new shoe on his right foot, and the other just by him, and in that shoe I found this sample of money unfinished; it was in that brown paper as it is now; I asked him, if it was his shoe; he said; it was; and after I took the money out, he put his shoe on the other foot; I found this file by the side of the woman, and I found this pair of pliers; nothing else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys Prisoner's Counsel. You say this room where the prisoners were, was latched? - It was with a knob; it was not locked.</p>

               <p>The man had two shoes on? - He had a new shoe on his right foot; and I suppose in his flurry, he put the slipper on.</p>
               <p>Do not suppose any thing; you do not come here to suppose; had the man two shoes on, or had he not? - No, he had not, he had an old slipper, and a new shoe.</p>
               <p>Both his feet were covered? - No, I beg your pardon; on the left foot was an old slipper, not up at the heel; after I took the money out of the new shoe, he put the new shoe on.</p>
               <p>Did he put the new shoe on before you took him away to carry him to the Justice? - No, he did not, he put it on in the room, before we took him and the woman out.</p>

               <p>The man owned to the shoe directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This man was cooking his supper? - I cannot say what he was cooking; he was fitting by the fire, there was a kettle of some sort on the fire.</p>
               <p>What was in the kettle; did you examine it? - I believe there was potatoes in it.</p>
               <p>And I suppose you might believe that was for his supper? - Very possibly.</p>
               <p>The man was blowing the fire, was not he? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Do not tell us seemingly, tell us what you saw? - Sir, I will tell you what I saw, I hope you will let me give my evidence easy; in her fingers she had a six-pence, rubbing it; Mr. Whiteway caught hold of her arm, I immediately caught hold of her arm, and twisted the six-pence out of her fingers, and immediately put it into my mouth, and gave it to Mr. Whiteway; and he marked it, and I marked it; it has been in Whiteway's keeping ever since; it is in this paper, (produced) the seal has not been opened.</p>

I found six-pence, which I took out of her hand, which she was rubbing; the next article I took, was in a particular place over the chimney; I took hold of a china mug, and in looking in the mug, I found twenty-four base sixpences, and twelve base shillings; on a mantle piece, over the fire places, I found eleven sixpences and one shilling, in a tea cup; I found two shillings on the mantle piece; here is a shilling which I took out of the man prisoner's left hand pocket; in looking round the room, I found this piece of money in an old lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is a piece of copper.</p>
               <p>To Robinson. What are you? - A labouring man; I work at Quenton's glass house; I am a space man, constantly with the stoker, one week in the day time, and the other at night; I have been acquainted with Mayne and Whiteway ever since I came home from tea.</p>
               <p>What are they? - They always passed to me to be officers of Justice.</p>
               <p>Runners at some office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So they have been there five or six years? - Yes; I never was but in one business of this sort before; I do not know their abilities, any more than seeing them.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you say, you was concerned with them? - In taking some people once.</p>
               <p>For what? - For a felony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What did you get that time? - I got a trifle of money.</p>
               <p>So you will now? - God knows, Sir; I did not look for that, I cannot stop peoples ears when they come into my place; I kept the sixpence in my month ten or twelve minutes; I and Whiteway marked it, and I brought it home with me, and gave it to Whiteway after the people were committed to gaol; it was the next day about ten or eleven.</p>
               <p>Did you keep it in your mouth all the time? - No, in my fob separate.</p>
               <p>Had you never any bad sixpences of shillings? - Sometimes, frequently in our shop.</p>
               <p>You have taken many such a shilling as this? - I might, or might not; see we are all liable to take bad money.</p>
               <p>And you have taken many such a six-pence as this too? - No, I cannot say that I have to my knowledge.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You have been employed many years for the mint, for the discovery of the coiners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There are a variety of things that have been found; you will give your opinion to the court, whether this piece of stuff and leather are made use of in the colouring of money, as well as this bottle; look also at this money? - These are as they come from the caster's; these are cast, they are not blanks; they have impressions upon them; after they are cast, they are filed round the edges, and smoothed round with scouring paper; after they are smoothed, they put them in aqufortis.</p>
               <p>Look at that bottle; what has been in that? - Aquafortis; wherever there is counterfeit metal with any silver in it, by putting it into aquafortis, it draws on the surface the silver, and brings the white on the surface; then they are scoured with sand and water, and they put some black stuff on them, and then they are fit for currency.</p>
               <p>What is the use of that black stuff? - In order to take the brightness off from the scowering.</p>
               <p>That deadens the white? - It does so; it makes them look old, as if there was a grease upon them; they are in different stages; here are some that are cut out in round blanks, the others are cast.</p>
               <p>Is any thing wanting? - No; I cannot say that there is; there was some black stuff, but I do not see it here; yes it is here, every thing that is necessary to compleat the business is here.</p>
               <p>Are there any pieces that are fit for circulation here? - A great quantity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say that bottle before you, is aquafortis you think? - The bottle is not, but there is a quantity of aquafortis in the bottle.</p>
               <p>Is that decidely aquafortis, have you any doubt of it? - I have not a doubt in the least.</p>
               <p>It is strong at present, is it? - No, it is not, it has been lowered.</p>
               <p>Pray have you ever tried an experiment with marine acid of spirits of sea salt? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Do you know wherein is the difference, between the spirits of sea-salt and the spirits of nitre aquafortis? - No Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the spirits of sea-salt marine acid? - Not that I know of</p>
               <p>Then you do not know that it is of a different colour? - No, I do not, but I am sure that this is aquafortis.</p>
               <p>But you never tried the effect of spirit of sea-salt on a cork, whether it will produce the same effect? - No, I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>You was before the Magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe it is very well known, that aquafortis is necessary to produce this colour? - It is so.</p>
               <p>Those persons who apprehend persons that are suspected of coining, know that likewise? - Why no, Sir, it turned out before the Magistrate, that was not the case at that time, it did not appear that the officers knew the nature of aquafortis, nor what the effect of it was.</p>
               <p>You did not see this bottle till it was produced before the Magistrate? - No; I did not.</p>
               <p>(The several things banded to the Court and Jury.)</p>
               <p>Court to Whiteway. Was there any thing in the bottle when you found it? - Yes, there was a little drop, rather more than there is now; Mr. Clarke tasted it at our office; I did not know what it was; I have had the custody of it all the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How often have you been concerned in taking coiners? - Never before.</p>
               <p>You have been here at the trial of coiners? - I do not know but I might; I know nothing of the business at all.</p>
               <p>Are not you here every sessions? - No, not every sessions; I have this to say, that I know nothing of the business; and what I have brought here comes just as it is, such things I found.</p>

               <p>My husband is sick in bed, that is the reason of his not attending here; I live in Deans court; the two prisoners lived in my apartment, in the one pair of stairs; they had lived there about five weeks; they came out of Middle-row, Holborn, into Deans-court, which is not a hundred yards; I was down stairs when the officers came, I heard them fight; I did not go up till the other lodgers sent for me; I knew nothing of it; I was very much surprized; I was in the room afterwards; the gentlemen gave me a caution to put the fire out.</p>
               <p>Did they come is man and wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had they been at home that afternoon? - Sir, the good woman had been at the wash tub, and she came in, I heard her come in, and the man was at home; and when she came home, he said; my dear, I have been at at work two hours.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man gets his living by selling greens and potatoes about the streets? - No, he does not, he works at the labouring business; sometimes when he has business, I suppose he goes; I do not know any thing about it; I am out in the morning part; I know he is a labouring man, and goes out sometimes to labour.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys submitted to the court, that the prosecutors had made out no case against the man; in the act of parliament the charge against him, being for traiterously colouring; and he contended that upon this act of parliament they must prove against the person whom they indict the fact of colouring, or counselling, aiding, and abetting in colouring; and the only evidence against the man, was that he was in the room, where pieces of base money were found; and where a woman might, or might not be supposed to be doing an act; and he submitted, that there was no evidence to affect him, as he was not actually in the act of colouring; and as to counsel, he contended there was no evidence; nothing being proved that he set this woman to work; that he advised her to do so, or gave her any emolument for so doing.</p>
               <p>The Court over-ruled the objection.</p>

               <p>How did you find your house when you got up? - The front of the house was all secure, as I left it at night, I went into the kitchen with intention to open it, and found the sash up about six inches from the sill.</p>

               <p>I am in the India-house; coming down Oxford-road, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner running, and stopped him, and took him.</p>
               <p>Had he a bundle? - No; I saw Taylor at the time, he said, a man had taken his bundle, and given it to the prisoner; I saw the bundle about two minutes after the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Should you know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at that bundle, is that it? - That is it; Taylor said it was his bundle.</p>
               <p>Who produced it in the street? - I believe Mr. Read.</p>
               <p>To Read. The bundle you picked up, was shewn to the prosecutor? - It was opened by the boy at the watch-house, and examined by him; but whether this is the bundle or not, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>To Taylor. Is that the same bundle you examined at the watch-house? - Yes; the breeches and shirt are marked with my name; I am sure the things are all mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You did not see the contents of the bundle till you came to the watch-house? - No.</p>
               <p>Who shewed it you then? - The master of the watch-house.</p>
               <p>He is not here? - No.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Read. You don't know the bundle yourself? - I do not.</p>
               <p>How do you know that it was the same bundle that was opened? - I laid it down on the table in the watch-house, and it was opened and examined by the boy.</p>

               <p>Are you a house-keeper? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Give me an account of it; speak up that I may hear you? - A good deal of plate.</p>
               <p>Did you lose two table spoons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the value of them? - Twelve or thirteen shillings apiece.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070031"/>Were they worth twenty shillings? - Oh! yes.</p>

               <p>What was that worth? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was it worth one shilling and nine-pence? - It was worth more than that.</p>
               <p>Did you lose seven guineas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you lose a silver tankard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was the value of that? - Seven pounds I believe.</p>
               <p>Did you lose a silver chafed cup? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that worth thirty-seven shillings? - Yes; it was a very large one; they were all my property; the rest were my nieces.</p>
               <p>Were these all taken out of your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you reason to charge the prisoner? - I know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Of your own knowledge? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you reason to charge the prisoner with taking these articles that is spoke of? - Yes; the prisoner came into my house about one in the morning; the street door was left on the jar; he came in; nobody was there; and he hid himself down in the cellar; for he owned it himself; he lived with a neighbour opposite to us; I know him very well.</p>
               <p>What business did he carry on? - He lived servant at a fishmonger's.</p>
               <p>Your house was open when he came in? - The door was upon the jar.</p>
               <p>How came that? - My niece went over the way; we have another shop; and I left the door open at nine in the evening; my niece came in almost directly; she did not stay above a quarter of an hour; we saw nothing of the prisoner at that time, nor during that night; at one o'clock in the morning he came up in the chamber.</p>
               <p>Did you see him? - No; but we felt him; he came and flung himself across the bed; we were in bed and in sleep; he demanded our money, and said, he came for money, and money he would have.</p>
               <p>Did you lay alone? - No, my niece and me were in bed together.</p>
               <p>Some person came and threw himself across the bed, and demanded your money? - Yes; I did not know his voice, but my niece did.</p>
               <p>What happened after? - He went out after he had the money and the plate.</p>
               <p>Did you give him any money? - Yes, I gave him about two guineas and a half, and two shillings, in a bag.</p>
               <p>Did he take any thing else besides the two guineas and half-a guinea and two shillings? - Not that I know of besides the plate.</p>
               <p>Did you see him take the plate? - No, I did not, but I lost that quantity of plate I have mentioned, and it was found upon him; then he left the room and went down stairs; I asked him how I should get out; he said, I shall lock the door, and will put over the key for you to come out; I went out and called in the watchman, and the things were gone.</p>
               <p>Then he left your house without discovering who the person was? - Yes, we got up and struck a light, and went down into the market and called the watchman, who came up.</p>
               <p>Did you make any discovery? - None at all, only we lost our property; nobody was in the house when the watchman came; nothing more happened in the course of that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are a single woman, you have never been married? - No.</p>

            , the younger, sworn.</p>
               <p>I am niece to the prosecutrix, she lives in Leadenhall-market, and I live with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070032"/>her; on the 8th of April last, about a quarter before one, as near as I can recollect, we were in a dose, not in sound sleep, and somebody came on the bed, rushed on my arm; and I cried, oh dear! who be you, how came you here? the answer was, be still, and I will not hurt you; that was repeated two or three times; I cried, which way did you come in? and he said no matter; but he had that about him that would do for us, if we made any resistance, for he never went out without a pistol or hanger; but he would not hurt us if we were still.</p>

               <p>Did he demand your money? - Yes; he said, he wanted money; the money was given him; the first money was given by my aunt; I do not know the amount of it.</p>
               <p>Did he take any money from any other person besides your aunt? - He said, it was not money enough, and I got out of bed and unlocked the box, and gave him two guineas and half.</p>
               <p>Was that the whole that was in the box? - No it was not; then he said, was that all? and I said, would you distress me to the last half guinea? and he said no more; but said, I will not hurt you.</p>
               <p>Was that money taken out of the box yours, or your aunt's? - That was my property.</p>
               <p>What passed afterwards? - He told us to go to bed, and be quiet, and make no noise.</p>
               <p>And he sat upon your stairs, and you had a little conversation with him? - I had not, my aunt had.</p>
               <p>Did he set upon your stairs, or stand? - That I cannot tell, because I was in the dark; and my aunt said (I wish to speak this) my aunt said, have you been in this way before? that was of robbing; and he said, yes, many times; but he never hurted any one, without they were obstreperous, or turbulent, or any thing of that kind; and I made answer, it was a very bad way of doing; but wherever you go never commit murder, for the life would do him no good, and it would save him, I did say, I think, from the gallows, (which you know is a vulgar way of speaking) the longer.</p>
               <p>Court. So you had this conversation, after he took your property and had left your room, on the stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He came in at one, and did not leave your apartments till after the watch went half past two? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any knowledge of the person with whom you was holding this conversation? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>From what circumstances? - By his voice.</p>
               <p>Had you been acquainted with the prisoner before? - Yes, I have known him this three years.</p>
               <p>Did you know it was the prisoner at the time? - I knew it was his voice, but I did not say it was him at the time; it is hard saying to the person by the voice.</p>
               <p>Then do you apprehend that the voice was similar to the prisoner's voice? - Yes, I did, when he had spoke three words; and I pinched my aunt that she might not speak, because being an antient woman, she might have cried, oh Mich! is it you?</p>
               <p>As far as I understand you, you have acquainted with the prisoner for three years? - So far as neighbours, speaking good night, or good morning; but no conversation particular.</p>
               <p>Did you deal with the fishmonger that he lived with? - Very little; a little now and then; he served me before now with a trifle; he always behaved very civil.</p>
               <p>But nothing more than good night, or good morning? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>When did he leave the house? - I think the watch went half past two; a person called up a neighbour to go to Billinsgate to buy fish, and when the watchman come the half past two, he said, I shall not be in your house above five minutes longer, and he would lock the door; my aunt said, how shall we shut the door after you, when you are gone? and he said, he would take care and lock it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070033"/>Court. This was very familiar conversation that your aunt held with him, I think? - Yes, and me too; he locked the door, and threw the key in, that we might have it, when we came down stairs; my aunt and me came down, opened the door, and called in the watch; and we had the house searched from top to bottom; there was no nail moved, nor lock broke; then I immediately said, he had hid himself in the cellar.</p>
               <p>How could he throw the key in? - He could shove it in under the door, or shove it through the lattice; I heard the key go down, and then I said, now he is gone.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any part of your property? - A silver tankard, a silver chased cup, two silver table-spoons and tea-tongs; they were my property separate from my aunt's; I brought it with me; I saw the several things that same night at half after ten; when we went to bed; there was a dark lanthorn left in the cupboard, instead of the plate.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of the prisoner during the course of that night or the next day, or any other time? - Yes; I frequently saw him when I used to go down to the shop, but I did not take any particular notice; I dare say he was at the shop as usual.</p>
               <p>Had you any other reason to suspect the prisoner took this plate and money, except from the circumstance, that you knew his voice? - So far; when we put out advertisements from Goldsmith's-hall, in consequence of my advertisement the plate was found, by Mr. Wright, in Tooley-street, a silversmith; the whole was found there.</p>
               <p>Then will you inform me, whether you of your own knowledge knew any thing to affect the prisoner, being the person guilty of the fact, except the circumstance of his voice resembling? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You were much frightened? - Yes, it is very natural.</p>
               <p>You were very much frightened? - Very much.</p>
               <p>This was a very odd conversation to hold with the man that had been robbing you, on the stair-case? - Really, I could talk to him more freely knowing him; I thought he would have more compassion.</p>
               <p>But you was cautious that neither you or your aunt did let him know, that either of you did know him? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Have you one of the hand bills here? - I have.</p>
               <p>I wish to see one.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to Mr. Garrow)</p>
               <p>These hand-bills were published the very next day, I take it for granted? - In the morning, as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>How many days after this robbery did the prisoner continue in his work? - I sent to his master's on the 8th that the bill was put out, and on the 11th he was apprehended; I saw him every day, three or four times a day, with a great fear and trembling.</p>
               <p>How happened it, that in this advertisement you give no sort of description of the person, or of his name, or any thing particular in his voice, where he lived, or where he was to be found? - Because I thought if the plate was found, I should know the person it was taken on.</p>
               <p>But you knew the man already? - Yes, and I spoke to him once as I had done before.</p>
               <p>There was no reserve on your part? - No, there could not be much reserve on my part; I reasoned with myself thus far; what signifies it to take and apprehend this man, when I have no proof against him, his voice will not do; I did not say that the person was a neighbour; I took care that nobody should know it.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it to any human creature till the plate was found? - I gave an item to one just to ease my mind a bit, but not to a soul beside; she never divulged it.</p>
               <p>That was a female friend? - Yes, you may be sure of that.</p>
               <p>Did the person speak in a feigned voice? - He had rather two voices; sometimes a rough one, and sometimes a smooth one.</p>
               <p>Do you mean now in a case where a man's life is concerned, alarmed as you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070034"/>was, frightened almost to death, do you mean to swear with certainty to a man's voice, especially a man that has two voices? - Yes, Sir, and more than that; I said, who the man was, after he locked the door, I said to my aunt.</p>
               <p>Did you tell your aunt that this was Mich.? - I did not say Mich. at once; I said, that was a face I knew; you have a right to plead, but I have not a right to answer every question.</p>
               <p>There you are a little mistaken, you will find you must; do not talk so much, you will beat me all to pieces: you did not tell your aunt before the watchman came in, who it was? - I said it was Mich's voice.</p>
               <p>Will you explain to me, (because it is taken down in short-hand) that you did not trust your old aunt with it, because she was an antient woman; how happened it that you only trusted it to one confidential female friend, and nobody else? - I never mentioned it to her the next day.</p>
               <p>But you told me not many minutes ago that you were cautious not to tell your aunt? - That part of the story I had forgot.</p>
               <p>Did not you think by letting this man continue four or five days at his work, that he would get an opportunity of disposing of the plate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He might have got it melted down you know? - Yes, that was what I thought; if he had, I should not have meddled with him; I did not choose to do any such thing; he bore a fair character; I would not take him up, because I could not swear positively to the man by his voice.</p>
               <p>I should think it a strange thing, but it is what you have been doing for the last half hour: did you make any complaint to his master? - No, all the people knew we were robbed.</p>
               <p>You did not hint to the master, that it was his servant that he was keeping in his house? - I never told any body any thing of it.</p>

               <p>I live in Tooley-street, I am a gold and silver smith; on Friday, the 11th of April, between five and six in the evening, the prisoner brought a box, and said, he had some plate to sell; he opened the box, and there appeared a parcel of plate cut to pieces; the appearance of the plate gave me great suspicion, and having received warning a day or two before of some plate being stole at Leadenhall-market, I examined several pieces; I picked up two that had the mark, M. Y. which are two letters mentioned in the warning; as soon as I discovered that, I told the prisoner the plate had been stolen; he said, I think, sure! was the expression he made, or something I believe of that kind; I am sure it was the prisoner; I have known him seven or eight years ago; he was an apprentice to a neighbour and customer of mine, or at least, he lived with him; he said, it is a hundred, or ten hundred to one, if ever I see the person again that I had it of; I told him it was a very serious piece of business, for I must stop him and the plate, and without he found the person, he would be thought the principal; after that expression, somebody came into my shop; I did not like to have a bustle about the door; I took the plate up, and directed him to follow me into a parlour which we have behind<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070035"/>the shop; he followed me; I said, Nance, we should send to let Mrs. Young know; my wife went herself, and as she was going out of the door, he called her back; I desired my wife to step back; he said, when you come to Mrs. Young, whisper, do not speak loud, and only let her come with you; when my wife was gone, I said, then you know Mrs. Young, he said, yes; I asked him, what she was; he said a greengrocer; there came in a lady and sat down; the conversation turned on different matters till Mrs. Young came; I told him, he had very bad connexions, and it behoved him to get shut of them, for they might lead him into very great error; when Mrs. Young came, she was so agitated at the sight of him, that she nearly fainted away; we shewed her the plate; she took up several pieces, and said, these are mine; Mich! how could you do so? I went into the shop, and left them to come to a conclusion, and a constable was sent for; she took up several pieces, and said, this is a piece of a pepper-box or spoon; I cannot tell minutely what; I do not know what; she took up the particular part, with the letters M. Y. upon it.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing during the time that he and Mrs. Young were there? - I do not know; he seemed to acknowledge he had got a very bad connection; I told him, industry and honesty would carry him through the world, if he got but sixpence a day; the plate was delivered to the constable who is now here.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I produce the plate.</p>
               <p>(Deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Wright. This is the same I delivered to the constable; the piece that had the letter on, is not here; we were obliged to separate the pieces to prevent confusion, and in order to find out the mark which was on the bottom of the pepper-box.</p>
               <p>Henderson. I asked the prisoner how the plate came in this state; he told me, he cut it with a knife.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You told him, it would be better to tell all he knew about it? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Who told him that? - Nobody that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Previous to the time of any conversation, did you make him any promises, that if he would confess he should receive favor, or had you frightened him by any threats? - No; he asked me, what would be of any service to him? indeed, says I, I do not know, it is a business I do not understand; says I, I do not know any thing will be of any service to you; here is the property; I asked him what he had done with the money; he said, he had paid his rent with the money.</p>
               <p>Did you give him any reason to apprehend, if he was to make any confession respecting this matter, it would be better for him? - No; he asked me, what would be of service to him; I told him I did not know any thing else would.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I take the principle to be this; the language which I remember of Mr. Justice Grose on our last circuit;</p>
               <p>"he must neither be influenced by hopes, nor awed by fears."</p>
               <p>Court. But according to my apprehension, this man did not hold out to him hopes, or intimidate him by fears.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. No, my Lord; but he is consulting what he shall do; the man is not acting freely; you know the common saying is,</p>
               <p>"it will be better for you."</p>
               <p>Court. When he said he had cut this plate with a knife, was that before he asked you what would serve him? - No; it was previous; he said, he cut it with a knife; says I, I thought you must have done it with a pair of sheers; says he, with a knife and a hammer.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect his particular expression? - He said, he cut it with a knife;</p>
               <p>(The plate shewn to the niece;)</p>
               <p>Here is the strainer marked M. H. my aunt's.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the one you lost, marked M. H. Yes; I have cleaned it a hundred times; I am quite sure that is the mark, not H. M.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070036"/>Then how happened you then to print it in your hand-bill H. M.? - Because it was a mistake; it was only the cart before the horse; I saw that fault when the bills came home; here is a table-spoon that was marked, T. E. Y. and here is the T. at the end; it was mine; it was a table-spoon; it was my father and mother's name D. E. and Y. at top.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is not so printed here; it is D. E. Y. as though it was in a word? - That is the printer's fault; this was marked, D. E. Y. but this I can swear to without any mark; it is a silver cup, and has no mark upon it now; this is part of the cup that was my property; here are two letters on the sugar-tongs M. R. besides the mark,

            &amp; Y. that mark does not agree with the hand-bill.</p>
               <p>Court. From your observation of that plate, in the mutilated state in which it is; are there any particulars by which you can swear to the property; either your aunt's, or your own? - I can swear to the whole, either marked, or not marked; the mark of some of it is visible, and not only that, often handling it at three or four and twenty years, and some of it thirty years, these marks were all upon either my aunt's or my property.</p>

               <p>When he came for it what passed? - He said it was Mr. Hanley's property; the Magistrate said, he should send for his master, for he suspected they were stolen; after that I went round to see if I could find any owner with some patterns which the Justice gave me; when I came back the prisoner was gone.</p>

               <p>So you could not have told where to find him, if he had not come to claim the goods? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a linen-draper, in Whitecross-street; I have known the prisoner fourteen years or upwards; he sent for me on the 10th of this month, to a public house, and told me, he was very forty he had got into trouble, that he had made use of my name, and said, they were my property; he said, he was afraid the watchman wanted to keep them, as he had no licence to hawk goods about; and that, unless I went to him and claimed them, he should lose them; I said, did you come honestly by them? he said, yes; I said, then there is no doubt of your getting them back again; that I could not demand goods, that did not belong to me; he said, he did not know what he should do; he had said, they were mine; he came to my house on Friday morning, to know if I had heard any thing about it; I had just then received a hand-bill; I then taxed him closer, if he came honestly by them; he said, he had; on Saturday evening, between five and six, I met him in May-fair; on the Sunday morning I went with him to New Prison, along with

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Simpson was with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Simpson told him he had better state all he knew, that it would be better for him? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that nothing was said to induce him to confess? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Court. What did he say? - He said, he was sorry he had made use of my name; Simpson said, you know my situation as a servant in this house, I would thank you to tell me how you got the things out of the house; he said, when he took these goods out, he put others in, and did it in that manner; he asked him, what he had done with the goods he had taken from Thomas Hill; he said, they were at Barnet's, in May-fair, and offered to give a note for the man to deliver them up; Chambers said, there was no occasion for it, and we went without the note; when we came to Barnet's, we told him what we were come for; he told his wife to give them to us, which she did, and we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070039"/>went to a public-house and took an inventory of the goods, and Barnet signed it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have known the prisoner some time? - Yes, he has bought things of me, but I never bought any thing of him.</p>
               <p>What way of life are you in? - A retail linen-draper.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say upon your oath, this man has never sold smuggled or other goods for you? - Never.</p>

               <p>- SIMPSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with the last witness to the prison on Sunday morning, the 13th of April; the prisoner said, he was happy to see me, but was sorry he was in that situation; I told him, I was sorry too; he directed us to Barnet's, where we found the goods; he described the manner of his taking them as Mr. Hanley has represented it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean to say, that neither you nor Mr. Hanley gave the prisoner any reason to believe that it would be better for him to confess? - He was neither promised nor threatened.</p>
               <p>How long had the man been in the house? - Seven or eight months; he had borne a good character, and I looked upon him to be an honest man.</p>

               <p>You were frightened was not you? - It rather daunted me.</p>

               <p>Explain a little how you could distinguish three people, and one of them at the distance of the horse's head; you said, somebody pulled the hat over your face; how soon was that done? - Immediately upon their coming up; when they took the money out of my pocket; they bid me get upon my legs, and then I could see all the men.</p>
               <p>You did not know either of these men before? - No.</p>
               <p>You know the lives of these three men are at stake; do you mean to swear positively to three men, to their persons, under these circumstances, frightened as you was, not knowing them before? - Their faces were so perfect in my mind, that I am sure they are the men.</p>
               <p>What sort of hats had they? - I cannot pretend to say; I was in a fluster and flurry, that I cannot tell what sort of hats they were; they might be such as mine.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of William Frost, we were coming to town on the morning of the 16th of April last, about four o'clock; we were stopped in the Edgeware road by three men, who asked us for our money; we told them we had not any; they told us to let them have what we had in a minute, or they would blow our brains out; one of them, Cobcroft, held the pistol to me, I said, gentlemen, you may have what we have, don't use us ill; I pulled out three pence and my thimble, he turned my hand into his.</p>
               <p>Who did? - Wood, the man in red, when Cobcroft held the pistol to me, he got up the wheel the off side of the cart; I was very much frightened, he went away then.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoners? - I am certain they are the men that robbed me, this man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070045"/>took my money, that man held the pistol, and the other man held the horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you quite sure of the person of the man in the green coat, Fubbs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you always sure as to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you then to tell the Justice you verily believed Fubbs was one of the men that robbed your husband? - I swore to the man when he was present.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say you believed he was the man? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Was you equally certain to Fubbs as you are now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Always? - Always; I am certain sure they are the men.</p>
               <p>How much is your husband to have of this reward? - We have been robbed very often before, but we never took any before; he has often been robbed upon that road.</p>

               <p>Was you ever with him when he was robbed before? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you come out that night in order to be robbed? - Yes, to be sure I did, because I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you come out that morning intending to put yourselves in the way of being robbed? - No, we had no such thoughts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your husband had been robbed several times before, but you never had the good luck to catch any before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with any body about having been robbed before this happened? - Yes, to a great many gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Did any body tell you, that you was out of luck that you did not catch some of the robbers, that you might have got forty pounds apiece for them? - Gentlemen said, it would be a good thing if some of them were taken.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell you it would be a good thing for you? - No.</p>
               <p>Were not you frightened at this time? - Yes, very much.</p>
               <p>Had you in your fright leisure to observe the persons of those three men so as to swear to them? - Yes, safely.</p>

               <p>It is not three days ago you know; tell it honestly? - I do not know; I never heard him say any thing about it, more than what I have said, for I did not come upon that.</p>

               <p>Your father and mother were both present? - They might be for what I know.</p>

               <p>Did not your father say it was very lucky he had got these men, that he had been robbed very frequently but never got any thing for it before; was that in the same conversation? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>What was it? - The three forty pounds.</p>
               <p>You are sure that was all that passed? - Yes; I never desired a farthing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. When your father said he did not want any thing but his own property, it was in answer to Herrington telling him of the three forty pounds? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You never told him you did not want any reward? - I have told people so.</p>
               <p>But did you ever say so to Herrington? - Never.</p>

               <p>Then it is not true, if any body, let them be who they will, has said so? - It is not.</p>
               <p>You never told any body that you did not want any of the reward, but only your own property? - We have told other people so, but not Mr. Herrington.</p>
               <p>You never heard Herrington say any thing about the reward? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was you talking to then? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that the people you heard talking about the reward were total strangers? - I cannot tell the people's name.</p>
               <p>I have not asked you that; I asked you if they were total strangers to you? - I do not know that I had ever seen them before; I have heard them talk about it since we have been waiting in town across the way,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070047"/>here, but I don't know who it was, not of those men, but I have heard there was a reward so much to a prosecutor.</p>
               <p>How much for each man? - I cannot pretend to say how much.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you never hear how much? - Yes, I don't know but I have in town.</p>
               <p>Was that to day that you heard it? - I don't know, we have been in town ever since Monday.</p>
               <p>When was it? - I don't know whether it was not at Hickes's-hall, on Tuesday; it was talked of in court at Hickes's-hall, by people as I stood by.</p>
               <p>They said it would be a good job to you? - No, not to me, they did not mention these men; they said, every man that was prosecuted there was forty pounds a man; they did not say it to us, but we heard it.</p>
               <p>Was that forty pounds for prosecuting them, whether they were convicted or not? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, don't you know that if these men are acquitted you won't get a halfpenny? - I don't want any thing.</p>
               <p>But do not you know that you won't get a halfpenny if the men are acquitted? - I have heard them say so; but I don't want any thing.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I keep the Kilburn-wells, I have kept the house seventeen years next Christmas; on Wednesday, the 16th of April, I was called up a little after four o'clock by Frost the fisherman, I threw up the sash, and asked him, what was the matter; he told me, he had been robbed on the Edgeware road; I desired him to let his wife and daughter go to the turnpike-house, as I had no fire at my house; I found I had never a saddle, I went to the Turnpike-house, and borrowed a saddle and bridle; I got my great coat and a pair of pistols; there were some waggons going by, I enquired if they had seen three men; they said, they were gone to Edgeware; I went to the Black-lion, West-end, and called one Scott up, and desired him to follow me to North-end; Scott came, but it was after the prisoners were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Who went with you? - One Smith and Milkin went with me, and another man, who is not here; I saw the three men coming just by the Bull and Bush, North-end; we went into a garden and hid ourselves, while they went by; Milkin made an attack upon Wood, he ran away, and made his escape; Smith and I took Cobcroft and Fubbs; Wood was pursued and taken and brought back by one Collins; I took them all to the Bull and Bush at North-end, and there we searched them; I found upon Cobcroft three-pence halfpenny, this pistol, and Smith found another in his pocket, and some slugs and powder, and gave them me; we found two shillings and four-pence halfpenny on Fubbs, and this pocket-piece upon Wood.</p>
               <p>(Producing them.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You keep a public-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have had the good fortune to bring several persons to justice? - I have.</p>
               <p>How many? - I can't say.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you can tell us how many of them have been executed? - I believe there have been three executed.</p>
               <p>Of course you know there is a reward upon the conviction of highway-men? - Yes, as well as that you are paid for pleading.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the prosecutors of this indictment are acquainted with it? - They were never acquainted with it by me.</p>
               <p>You never told any of them? - I don't recollect that I ever did.</p>
               <p>Will you say upon your oath, that you have never mentioned it? - To the best of my knowledge I never did.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any conversation with them about the reward at all? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you can tell whether within those two days, you have had any such conversation? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070048"/>Could you have forgot it? - I am most clear I never did.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you not say yesterday, that if these three men were convicted, there were three rewards of forty pounds each? - Never in my life to my knowledge; I am clear I did not; I never did, nor never once dreamt such a thing.</p>
               <p>I ask you once more, will you bring yourself up to swear positively you did not yesterday? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - I am sure I never mentioned such a thing as three forty pounds.</p>
               <p>You never had any conversation about the reward? - Not to my knowledge; all I have said about it is, that when the bills are settled, you must all contribute to it.</p>
               <p>Did not you know that was not true? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you not know there would be nothing to pay, but a great deal to receive? - Not for expences.</p>
               <p>How much may you have received for conviction money in your time? - No great deal; I believe about seventy pounds.</p>
               <p>Whether those people told you at any time, that they did not want any part of the reward? - I never heard them say it.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Frost? - Since last Christmas, or else I have known nothing of him, except going up and down the road.</p>
               <p>This man is not rich I suppose? - No, people went a begging for him for relief, after he had been robbed, for him to go to market again.</p>

               <p>They were searched in your presence? - Yes, and a bad shilling, and a thimble was found upon Cobcroft.</p>
               <p>What else? - I can't say rightly, except a brace of pistols.</p>
               <p>Any thing upon the others? - Not to my knowledge; Mr. Herrington searched them all.</p>

               <p>How much did Mr. Herrington tell you you were likely to get? - He did not tell us any thing.</p>
               <p>Who told you? - We were informed we should gain something by some men at Hampstead that had taken people.</p>
               <p>How much? - Forty pounds for each.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Frost and Mr. Herrington were talking about that, when Frost said, he did not want any thing but his own property? - Yes, just after we had taken them.</p>
               <p>The old man said, he only wanted his property back, the property he had been robbed of before and now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The old man and his daughter were by at the time? - I can't say.</p>
               <p>What had Mr. Herrington been saying to the old man to make him say that? - I cannot say.</p>

            . What did you lose? - One of the new coined penny pieces, a ring, a bad shilling, and a thimble.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing remarkable in your thimble? - It was brass with a steel top.</p>
               <p>That is very common, is it not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You cannot swear to it then? - Yes, I can.</p>

               <p>What sort of a penny was it that you lost? - One of the new coin.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070050"/>What sort of a notch? - It looks as if it had been hammered or knocked in.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the notch was on the head side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at that, (shewing her a pocket piece;) see if you know that? - No, that is not mine.</p>
               <p>Is that yours, (shewing her another?) - No, this is not mine.</p>
               <p>Was it that sort of coin? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Is that yours, (shewing her the piece that was found upon Wood?) - I think this is mine.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - There is a notch upon the head side of this, and a scratch with a pin; there are so many like it, that I don't think I can swear to it; but this is just like mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That scratch was put upon it before the justice, was it not? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 25th of April, this woman's servant came to the office; I am a watchman; I happened to be at the office, there was only me and the door-keeper in the office; immediately this man came and gave information; I took the key from him; he went away some where; I could not find her; this was on the Friday; upon the Saturday they were looking for her, but could hear nothing of her; on the Sunday evening about half after ten, I happened to be at a publick-house getting a pint of beer; this prisoner and another woman came in together; I knew the prisoner; I immediately spoke to her, and asked her whether she was not such and such a person; she immediately said, she was; that she had been to St. Giles's watch-house, to see to get in there; she said, she wanted to go, to give herself up; I said, for what? then I asked her further, says I, what do you want to give yourself up for? she did not know me at this time; says she, I hear there is people gone down into the country after me, for robbing my mistress; I spoke two or three words to her; I said, I shall take you into custody, and I did; I searched her at the same time; she had nothing upon her, only one half crown; first, I asked her what she had done with the money; the ten guineas; she said, she had laid it all out.</p>
               <p>Had you before this told her that you had any intelligence of her? - Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>Did you give her any reason to expect that she should not be prosecuted? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Then she had a voluntary conversation with you, in which she said, that she had spent the ten guineas? - Yes; she had the cloak on her back; I have it here to produce; it has been in my custody ever since; it is now in the same state it was.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>It is my cloak, I have had it a great many years.</p>
               <p>By what marks do you know it? - There is no particular marks in it, but I know it to be mine; the lace, when I first had it, cost me three shillings a yard; I have had it near ten years.</p>
               <p>To Elliott. Is that the same cloak that was on the back of the prisoner, at the time you apprehended her? - It is: I was going to observe to you, on Monday morning when I got up, and took this woman; she told me she had some things that she had bought with some of the money, and left them at different places; I took her that night to the watch-house; on Monday morning I took her out, and went with her to get the things she had bought; (those things produced;) a bonnet, and several gowns and a petticoat, and handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she perfectly sober at the time she conversed with you at this publick-house? - As sober as I am this minute; that day about eleven, she was carried to the office, and committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Some body is gone for, but they are not come yet.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had not other people access to the bureau, as well as the servant maid? - At this time, I had a man servant, as well as this, and another young woman, that goes of errands; but no body had access to my bureau but myself.</p>

               <p>About seven, on the Sunday morning; I saw the other prisoner, the boy, with this sack; containing a copper kettle, and a sauce-pan, a brass pestle, and a mortar, and a quart copper pot; he was knocking at the door of an old iron shop, in East-Smithfield; I took him into custody; I asked him where he got the things; he said, he had them of a black man; I had myself, before then, met a black man; but I cannot say it was this black man that is now at the bar; I took him into custody; and on the next day, I advertized the things; Mr. Andrews came, and claimed them; and I took the black man into custody, on the information of the last witness.</p>
               <p>Court to Miller. How far is Church-lane from Greenfield-street? - I believe it is about three hundred yards; I am positive this black prisoner is the man I saw with the sack on his back.</p>
               <p>What kind of a sack was it? - It was a brown sack, such as we have pollard in.</p>
               <p>What size sack was it? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>But as near as you can guess? - I believe it was a three bushell sack.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any mark upon it? - I did see some letters, but I did not take so much notice what they were on it.</p>
               <p>Court to Andrews. What sort of a sack was it? - A sack that contains pollard and bran, which we give to our horses; they will contain eight bushels of pollards, and they will contain four bushels of corn.</p>
               <p>(The things produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thomas, the black man. I have got something to say, that I know nothing at all about it; on Sunday morning I came over the water to get something to eat; I got a shilling, and I went into a public-house, and got something to eat; and on the Monday or Tuesday, I do not know which, I just got a pint of beer, and they took me into custody; I know nothing at all about it.</p>

               <p>About six I was coming up Wapping, and a man asked me to carry this sack for him a little way.</p>
               <p>What man? - I cannot be sure of the man; I took it upon my back, and carried it to the place where I thought he directed me; I could not find any man.</p>
               <p>What sort of a man was he that gave you the bag to carry? - It was not near light.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he was a black man or no? - He was not a black man.</p>

               <p>What passed there? - The moment I overtook them, they acknowledged they had a guinea more than belonged to them, which they had taken in mistake.</p>
               <p>How far was it where you took them from Mrs. Gibson's shop? - I suppose five or six miles.</p>
               <p>Which of them said they had a guinea by mistake? - Jones.</p>
               <p>Had you charged them with taking it before hand? - I stopped them; and immediately as I did so, they said they had a guinea by mistake; they offered me the guinea, which they said, they had of Mrs. Gibson.</p>
               <p>Had you told them before they spoke about this guinea, the reason you apprehended them? - I had not time, the moment I overtook them, I stopped them; and they acknowledged it that moment; at Mr. Gibson's house, Gray pulled out the guinea and put it down; to the best of my remembrance, Mrs. Gibson said, it was a mistake.</p>
               <p>Did any thing else pass there? - Not as I heard.</p>
               <p>Did you apprehend these people on the road to London? - No, in the road from Hendon, opposite the Bull and Bush; and away from there to the Edgeware-road at the Spotted Dog at Wilsdon-green.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you hear any thing said about it? - I heard directly as they put the guinea down, they said that is your guinea Madam.</p>
               <p>Did she say how it was taken? - She said it was taken out of her hand, she said, certainly; she did not know perfectly which man it was that took it out of her hand.</p>
               <p>What did she say about the mistake; - The mistake was, that she gave him two guineas instead of one; instead of giving him his own guinea back, she said, she gave him his own and another.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell my Lord that just now, that is very material; then she said, she had given it them out of mistake, two guineas instead of one; it was her guinea, not their's? - It is very true, and when I apprehended them, they said, that they had got a guinea in mistake; they offered me the guinea to go about their business, and for me to return into the person it belonged to.</p>
               <p>I do not quite understand that? - They said, that was the guinea they got in a mistake; I was to have nothing, only the woman's property.</p>
               <p>Who was present at that time? - This man.</p>
               <p>With was with you in the shop? - I went to Mr. Gibson's; I saw Mrs. Gibson take the guinea in her hand; and say, it was her guinea.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her say, she gave two guineas instead of one? - I did not hear her.</p>
               <p>If she had, must you have heard it? - There were a great many people in the shop; Jones took the guinea out of his pocket, and held it over to the publican and me to settle the mistake; I said, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070059"/>had better go back and settle the mistake; I got into the chaise, and Milligan followed me on horse back.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Gibson. You was present at the time? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did your wife say, she had given two guineas out of a mistake? - No; she never said any such thing; Milligan lives about Hampstead; I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gray. I wish you would look at these two commitments, you will find a great spite in it; the first commitment is for bail; and the next is, for feloniously stealing.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Gibson. When these people were brought back again to you; did you say, you had given them two guineas instead of one? - No; I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Did you say it was a mistake? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones to Milligan. Did you hear any offer made to Mrs. Gibson or Mr. Gibson, of any sum of money? - They wanted to make it up, and to go to the publick-house and have something to drink.</p>

               <p>I am the constable; I produce the property; I took all these things out of a little Court in Moor-lane, No. 2. I found them there on searching the house; it is let out in tenements; the prisoner was in the room and another man; the things have been in my custody ever since; and they are now in the same condition as I found them; this shirt I took off the prisoner's back, which the prosecutor said was his.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know my linen, because my wife had been unwell for a good while, and I generally gave them to the washerwoman; and I examined them when they came back again; some of them are marked, and some not marked; but they are very particular shirts; there are three different cloths in each shirt; each sleeve has three quarters of a yard, and the width of the shirt is about a yard and nail; I was in great exercise at that time, and used to walk and ride a great deal; this shirt appears to be marked in one of the gussets with J. R. which are my initials.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to that being your property? - This was my property.</p>
               <p>Was that in your bundle when it was carried out of your apartment in Compton-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at the other articles? - I was ordered by the Justice to bring, if I had any, remnants of the gowns as proofs of the indentity; here is a piece of the same pattern of one the gowns, and here is another; this gown was hung up in a closet in the prisoner's appartment; and here is another.</p>
               <p>From these circumstances, will you venture to swear that these were the gowns that were your wife's and your property? - They were my property, and I put them in the bundle; this is a part of what the prisoner took away, and what were found in the prisoner's house; the sleeves of the shirts were the full width of the cloth.</p>
               <p>Court. From the marks that you saw on these several articles and your observation upon them, can you say, upon your oath that they are your property? - All but one old sheet.</p>
               <p>Can you speak with the same certainty to your wife's wearing apparel? - I have delivered all the linen to the washer-woman for these four years; I myself examined them, and gave the whole to the washer-woman, and took them from her.</p>

             I am robbed, and I went immediately down stairs; and he said, Mr. Davis, they have taken my bundle; I was in the yard; he went out in the passage; when we came to the end of the passage the door was locked; it was the street-door; there is but one door; finding the door locked, I sent my wife for a hammer, to endeavour to force the lock back; as soon as we got into the street; Ramsay and me went down Compton-street, towards John-street; we went from there through Allen-street; we traced the people through the ruins; we heard of some men going with a bundle.</p>
               <p>What number were they? - We heard there were three men; when we got to the end of the ruins, that runs into Bunhill-row, we heard nothing of them after, then we went immediately home, and my wife said, she had heard of their names; in consequence of that information, the next day, between ten and twelve we went to Mr. Newman and Mr. Negus the constables; I was present, and we went to No. 2, in a court in Moor-lane; I stood at the door with the prosecutor, and Newman and Negus went up stairs; and while they were up stairs or in the room, I cannot tell which, one man jumped out of the window; within a short time after that, Newman and Negus brought down the prisoner; when they brought him into the passage, Newman ordered me and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070063"/>prosecutor to go up, and own the property; I went up, and picked up the things, and brought them down; they were delivered to Newman the constable.</p>

               <p>Were they found in the apartments of the prisoner? - Yes, I went up with him to Guild-hall, and he was committed.</p>

               <p>Court to the prosecutor. Does Negus, the constable, say any thing more than Newman has said? - He can say no more; he assisted Newman to his utmost in taking him, and without Negus I do not think he would have been taken.</p>

               <p>The person with whom you transacted this business you say was the woman? - I forgot to mention, when I laid down the money on the counter, the man took some, if not all the money.</p>
               <p>Whether he gave it to the lady or no, you do not know? - I do not know what he did with it.</p>
               <p>Your conversation was with the lady? - I did not hear him speak above two or three words.</p>
               <p>Certainly your attention was chiefly directed to the lady? - Where they are in company, and it is referred to the other person, certainly my attention must be refered to them both.</p>
               <p>Was not your attention particularly directed to the woman? - At first it was, because she took the plate out.</p>
               <p>She asked you whether you sold plate? - No, she did not, she asked me, whether I bought plate.</p>
               <p>How long was this woman there? - They might be there four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Is your shop an open shop, or is it divided into boxes? - Part of the shop is divided into boxes, and part of it is open; we had just lighted candles; it is much darkened; it was just dark.</p>
               <p>The woman I take it stood forward? - They both stood even with the counter.</p>

               <p>Court to prosecutor. Is this true? - Such words never passed; I never saw her till the constable found her for me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Graham, Prisoner's Counsel. You gave this immediately after it was presented to Mr. Bower? - I carried it to Mr. Bower.</p>
               <p>When did you see this note last before to-day? - I had it from Mr. Bower; I think it was last Thursday.</p>
               <p>So that it had remained in the custody of Mr. Bower, from the 23d of April, till last Thursday? - I imagine so.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? Not to my knowledge; the prisoner went with me to Mr. Bower's; I was at Mr. Bower's about ten or fifteen minutes, and I left him with Mr. Bower.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner shew any objection to go with you? - He readily agreed; I pointed out no alteration in the note; I told him, I must see Mr. Bower before I paid him the draft; I did not mention my suspicion; I only said, I must see Mr. Bower before I paid the draft; I then gave Mr. Bower the draft; he looked at it; he then said, this is my draft, and should only be for fifteen pound; this is a forgery; the prisoner was in another room; I called in the prisoner; I could not perceive any discomposure about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070069"/>Did you point out to him in what particular parts of the note the alterations seemed to have been made? - No, I did not; Mr. Bower had the note in his possession; Mr. Bower told me, it was a forgery; the prisoner expressed his surprize, very much indeed, and in a very natural manner, and I believe I was with Mr. Bower a quarter of an hour, till he sent to Mr. Lane's chambers; when I came away, the prisoner, Mr. Bower, and Mr. Lane were together, and I knew no more.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand you, that the prisoner expressed surprize, but did not seem confounded? - Yes, I went into the back shop where Mess. Gosslings were, and was shewing them the draft, and while I was doing that, the prisoner came into the back shop; I was not absent from him above two minutes.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect he entered into any conversation about the alteration? - No, I do not recollect he did; I had no suspicion he was the person.</p>
               <p>Court. On what account did he follow you into the back shop? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>It is not usual for such persons to go in that come for drafts? - No it is not, but he must see Mr. Gosling and me with the draft, and that might induce him to come in.</p>
               <p>You say he came into the back shop, was the communication with the back shop open, or was there a door between? - There is a door, but it was open.</p>
               <p>In point of fact, you never paid this draft? - I never paid it.</p>
               <p>Court. Pray when you went in to Mr. Gosling, did you express your suspicion in the hearing of the prisoner? - No, I did not, but from the ragged state of the note, it induced me to suspect it.</p>
               <p>Court. The note is Mr. Bower's hand writing? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. You have seen Mr. Bower write very often? - I have seen him write very often, I have not the least doubt but it is his.</p>
               <p>(The note handed up to the Court.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>(Looks at the Draft.)</p>
               <p>On the 22d of March last, in the Court-house, in Hereford, having occasion to send to London a particular sum of money, and not being able to do it so exactly to my mind, without obtaining a fifteen pound or twenty-five pound draft; I applied to Mr. Bower, who is an intimate friend of mine, to accommodate me with fifteen pounds, which he was obliging enough to do by giving me a draft on his bankers, Messrs. Goslings, for that sum, the draft was by him post dated on the 24th; it is not material, but I believe I could tell literally the terms of the draft; it was to pay me or bearer, the sum of fifteen pounds on his banker's, Messrs. Goslings, in my favour for fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you happen to know why the date was post dated? - I only know from conjecture; it was not expressed at the time. I beg pardon, I will tell you in a moment, whether it was or not; yes, it was; I mentioned to Mr. Bower, I said, oh! what you draw it on the 24th, because it is to be in town, do you? I remember saying that to him across the table, in the presence of fifty people; he said, when I draw from the country, I always post date it; it was understood between us, that it should be so, it was to arrive in town that day, and was to be presented there; the draft which I so received from him, I put together with two bank notes of ten pounds each, into a letter which I adressed to Mrs. Mattingley, and which I sealed, and which letter so containing the drafts and notes, and so sealed, I put together with several other little letters and papers into a cover, a frank which Mr. Bearcroft gave me, and directed it to my clerk, in Lincoln's-inn, and sent it by the post to him, I addressed it to a clerk of mine, who always is in my chambers in London, I gave it to my servant at Hereford, so addressed to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070070"/>clerk in London, at my chambers, to put it into the post.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether that is the draft that you put in? - It is impossible for any man to say positively that it is, but I have no particle of doubt that it is, having with the utmost care and attention examined it, and being master of the literal words of the draft, I particularly attended to it, and accurately looked at it; I had my reasons at the time, I did not chuse to use my friend's paper, but I could not get a fifteen or twenty-five pound note; the first alteration which I observed in the draft, is that instead of the word fifteen pound in the draft I received, in that in my hand appears the word fifty pound, it seems to have been done by a substitution of the last part of the letter y in the place of the two last letters of the word fifteen, in the place of the letters e n, perhaps it is more correct to say by an addition of the part of the letter after the letters fifte, or an addition of the last part of the letter y to the first e, in the word fifteen; the long stroke in the last part of the letter y, to the first e, in the syllable en. I take it to be so because I observe from very accurately attending to Mr. Bower's draft, and I have observed it very often in his writing besides, that his e's do not appear to have any opening, they are a little perhaps fuller at the top, but are like i's; only no tittle, there remain the original letters fifte, and in the place of the last en, there is a substitution of the last past of the letter y which make it fifty.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you conceive to have become of the letters e n? - I rather think that the n has clearly been erased, and perhaps the e also; that is, perhaps the second e in the word fifteen; upon the strictest attention, I am much inclined to think the conjecture which I offered last is correct; that is that the letter e as well as the n, have both been erased, because there seems to be the least but some running ink at the latter end of this substituted stroke for the y, it seems to be jagged and incorrect, more so than it would have been if written upon the original letter.</p>
               <p>Then you say, you seem to incline to think, that both those letters have been erased? - Yes, and again because I cannot trace under that half of the letter y any other ink, which in another instance in the note I do; because I do not trace under that the mark of any other letter; there is a small difference in the blackness of the ink, which I attribute to the spreading upon the erasure, fresh ink, and its sinking in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. I submit these are observations for the Jury to draw.</p>
               <p>Court. They are reasons which he has assigned, having said he believed the alterations to be made in that manner, being matter of observation, the Jury can draw it to be sure, but they are proper questions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bower. It rather appears to me, that the erasure, that is to say, that there had been by a knife or other instrument on the paper, a running, rather to the left hand of the stroke, which I have described to be joined to the first e, a little in the additional part of the letter, it seems to me rather to extend beyond that mark, but the whole of the alteration seems to be most bunglingly executed, and therefore further than conjecture it is impossible for me or any other person to say.</p>
               <p>Court. To be sure the Jury must judge intirely? - The next alteration which may have taken place is by the addition of the letter s to the word pound, but I think that stood originally pounds, and that it is now as it was originally, pounds and not pound, as to that I will not say more, because I attended literally to the draft, and I think it was so, because it would not have been so correct.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not one of the alterations laid, and it seems to be perfectly immaterial as the indictment states it, I observe, that from that time the indictment charged it both wrote pounds and pound, but without charging that it is made; none of the counts charge any alteration to have been made in that word; if it did, that would be a material piece of evidence; but the counts themselves vary, some of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070071"/>the counts stating it to be pound, and some of them stating it to be pounds; but none of the counts charge the word itself to have been altered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. It is by adding the letter s to the word pound? - As I recollect it is so in two of the counts, I heard Mr. Bower read it.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me look at the indictment itself, for it certainly is not so in the abstract.</p>
               <p>Court, (looks at the indictment.) The two first counts state the alteration that has been in substance given in evidence, and take no notice of the alteration of the word pounds; and they state the draft as having upon it the word pounds; the third count states that the word stood pound; the fourth count states that the letter s had been blotted out from the word pound? - I take the liberty of saying that I did fancy the letter s to have stood now as it was written originally.</p>
               <p>Do you think so on memory of the draft, or on inspection? - I do on memory of the draft, because I very accurately attended to it, and I should have observed that it was not quite correct, if it had been the word pound instead of pounds, indeed Mr. Bower would not have needed the correction from me; there appears then to have been one other alteration, a material one in the figures, which were originally 15, turned into 50 as I conceive in this manner, I think the I in fifteen has been erased, and a 5 substituted in its place, there has been no easure committed on the figure 5 of the 15, but that 5 is by ink changed into an o; I am not aware of any other alteration in the draft, I said before I believe, that I had put this with two bank notes, which I inclosed with other papers, to my clerk, and these bank notes and this draft were directed to Mrs. Mattingley; perhaps it may be right to say, that I was sending to her as part of an annuity, which I for many years had paid her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. There seems to be a material objection to the competency of Mr. Lane; is is not an obligatory annuity; you have not executed any instrument for the payment of it? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. When did you first see or meet with the prisoner at the bar, when and where, and what passed at the meeting?</p>
               <p>(The note delivered to Mr. Shelton.)</p>
               <p>T. Lane, Esq. The first time I ever saw the prisoner at the bar in my life, to my knowledge, was on the 23d of April last, in the chambers of Mr. Bower in Lincolns Inn; it was the day of his commitment, be it what day it might; but I think it was the 23d of April; a message from Mr. Bower had taken me thither in great haste, I presume I should be as accurate as I can, as to the words that passed that were used by the prisoner, and in his presence, I shall mention no other words than what were used in his presence: says Mr. Bower to me, so, Mr. Lane, says he, there has been a capital forgery committed on this draft of mine which I gave to you at Hereford; I think they were his words, standing up and looking very much distressed at the subject, as were we all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. The prisoner was then by? - I will not tell you one word, nor a letter, not an atom but what passed in his presence. God bless my soul! says I, I am very sorry for it. Good God! or some involuntary and strong exclamation. Yes, Sir, says he, it has been altered from a 15 l. to a 50 l. do look at it, (I am attempting to give the words as near as I can, but will not affect to say that I am accurate to the precise words, but as near as I can, and the substance I do not vary it) do you recollect what you did with it? feeling much agitated by the question, and the discovery he had so made to me, of the forgery in this draft which he had kindly given to me, I had prudence enough to consider<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070072"/>for a second or two before I gave an answer; I turned round, and having considered for a second, I said yes, I do, perfectly well, I have no doubt but I can trace it with the utmost ease; I think Mr. Bower then said, well, Sir, you must do it, or you must endeavor so to do, or to that effect: Mr. Bower then told me, the prisoner being present, says he, this gentleman I believe, saying Mr. Slack, or whether he mentioned his name or not I cannot tell, but the prisoner, says, he received it for some goods he sold to a Lady, who laid out 40 l. with him; I think who laid out 40 l. was his expression, I am not positive whether he said 40 l. or 50 l. but I think he said 40 l. in goods, and took them away in a hackney coach: Mr. Bower going on says, he has seen the Lady often, he says, but does not know her name or place of abode: I think Mr. Bower added then, she is a pale thin woman, of about five and thirty, that was Mr. Bower's giving to me (in the presence of the prisoner) the relation the prisoner had before given to him; I think Mr. Bower added that, but of that I will not be positive, I think he added a pale thin woman of about five and thirty: during this part of the conversation I think Mr. Bower and Mr. Ewings were both present, and I rather believe, but am not not positive, that when the conversation had gone this length, that Mr. Bower called me aside into another room, and that Mr. Ewings went away; but I will not affect to be positive whether Mr. Ewings heard this or not, but I think he did.</p>
               <p>Court. To what passed in the other room we cannot ask you of course? - I retired with Mr. Bower into the other room, and left the prisoner in Mr. Bower's chambers two or three minutes, I rather think Mr. Ewings was with him then, but of that I am not positive, I took upon myself then to speak to the prisoner, wishing to learn from himself his story, that he so related to Mr. Bower; I wished to know accurately and clearly and precisely what he said, I rather believe I said to the prisoner</p>
               <p>"a tall pale woman of five and thirty;" for Mr. Bower said so to me, I certainly did repeat it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. If you do not recollect it, you had better not speak it, because if you only heard it? - I rather think I did, but I do not speak positively, I said to the prisoner, this lady laid out 40 l. with you and upwards, and took the things away in a hackney coach.</p>
               <p>Court. You repeated so much of what Mr. Bower had said interrogatively? - Just so: Yes Sir, said the prisoner, 40 l. and upwards, the precise amount I cannot tell you, my books will tell you that; Sir, says I, I do not mean the precise sum, but upwards of 40 l. Upwards of 40 l. yes Sir, says he, upwards of 40 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. are you positive as to that? - I am, I will add that there is not a little of my evidence that I have not mentioned to Mr. Bower, choosing to confirm my evidence by his, before I was certain; he repeated that a second time; I had my reasons for choosing to make him particular; I said, as to her name or place of abode, you do not know; No Sir, I do not, says he, the lady I have often seen at my shop, but her name or place of abode I do not know; I think he repeated the words I have previously made use of; I do not recollect any thing material which passed at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the substance of this conversation you speak with certainty? - Literally as near as I can recollect, but to the substance, I speak most positively.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Have you any doubt that he told you he did not know the person's name and place of abode? - I have not any doubt, for he repeated it twice, and also that the amount of the purchase would appear in the books; when Mr. Bower and the prisoner and myself went our of Mr. Bower's chamber's together, Mr. Bower saying in the presence of the prisoner and myself, that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070073"/>was going to Bow street, says he, we must go to Bow street; I went immediately to Mrs. Mattingley, I shall not repeat any thing that passed there, unless you wish it.</p>
               <p>Court. Not unless you are asked by the prisoner's council? - Mrs. Mattingley lives in Long Acre.</p>
               <p>How soon after did you see the prisoner again? - I will not take upon myself to speak to minutes, or indeed perhaps to a quarter of an hour, but perhaps it might be an hour, as soon as I got to Lincolns Inn, I called on Mr. Bower, he was not returned, as soon as he was returned, he sent me word, and I called on him; and as we were going together to Mr. Bower's chambers, I turned my head, and saw the prisoner on the other side of the new Square, Lincolns Inn, the prisoner saw us too, for he immediately came across towards us, and he accosted me, and said Mr. Lane, have you seen Mrs. Mattingley? upon which I started much amazed, and with great sternness said, yes, Sir, I have; have you seen her twice? (said he quickly) no, Sir, says I, I have not, in the same stern manner; why, said I, have you seen her? very sharply; Yes, Sir, said he, I have; I did not ask any further question at that moment, nor did any thing further pass between us, for a few seconds; he put himself by my side for a few paces, as one of the company, I holding Mr. Bower's arm, as we were walking looking at the ground, Mr. Bower and myself were not attending to the prisoner; I think when we came to the corner of Lincolns Inn New Square, round which we were going to turn, to go into Portugal Street, the prisoner first spoke again, he began the conversation, he seemed (I should say) in vast agitation, and he said, pray Mr. Bower, will you give me leave to speak to you? no, said Mr. Bower; you must not speak to me, Mr. Slack; he repeated, pray Mr. Bower, will you give me leave to speak to you? in terms of anxious entreaty; for God's sake, says Mr. Bower, Mr. Slack do not say any thing to me, I may hereafter be obliged to tell the conversation which might now pass between us, I beg of you not to speak, I cannot hear you: we passed on then for several paces, without any other words passing between us, when we came I think twenty or thirty yards in Portugal Street, keeping on the right-hand side of the way, which is not much frequented, Mr. Slack changed his position, and quitted my left-hand side, and went towards Mr. Bower; Mr. Bower and me having separated, we were walking singly, and he several times made fruitless attempts to gain an audience of Mr. Bower, and I do not think any other conversation passed between us, unless it might be a repetition of similar expressions, between that spot of ground and Russel-court, Covent Garden; I will not be positive whether that repetition might be made often, but perhaps once or twice; and I think in Russel-court, but I am positive there or thereabouts, he would speak, in spite of the humane caution he had received, and he said for God's sake Mr. Bower, do speak to my friends, for I have very good friends; I think Mr. Bower said, it is in vain, Mr. Slack, your solicitation to me, I must do my duty, it is my duty to investigate the matter, and the guilt must fall; let it fall where it may; he repeated again nearly in the same terms, do for God's sake speak to my friends; then turning round to me, he said, do, Mr. Lane, pray do Sir; upon which I said, Mr. Slack, do not speak to me, it is impossible for me not to do my duty; I am not aware that he repeated any other, or different words, between that place and Bow-street; and just before Mr. Bower and he went into Bow-street, I said, I will go and fetch Mrs. Mattingley as fast as I can; I said in a low voice but audible, and I believe both did hear, they were both together; I addressed myself to Mr. Bower, I will go and fetch Mrs. Mattingley as fast as I can, I shall be back again in five minutes I dare say; I did go up to Mrs. Mattingley's house, with a view to find her, and left Mr. Bower and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070074"/>him together at the office door, Mr. Bower was saying some words, what I did not hear.</p>

               <p>Court. Up to that time the prisoner went voluntarily with you, without any compulsion? - Quite so; quite so indeed, for I myself had gone many paces before, that I might not seem to be a restraint upon him, and Mr. Bower apparently was very much intent upon his own thoughts.</p>
               <p>There were no means taken to prevent his escape? - Certainly not, it was far from a wish that he should not; I went immediately for Mrs. Mattingley, who was not at home, I learned she was gone to my chambers, I run there as hard as I could, and found her there in a very different state of mind to what I did before, as I had not at that time apprised her of any particulars of the case, I had not told her of any forgery having been made, I made an excuse to her, I had not apprized her that any forgery had been committed, that was when I first saw her, I had seen her but once, then I called a hackney coach, handed her into it, and we went to Bow Street, I apologised very much to Sir Sampson Wright, I believe, and Mr. Bower for keeping them so long, and mentioned to them my reasons for staying; I was not present at the time any thing was taken down in writing, that was when he and Mr. Bower were together, while I went to Mrs. Mattingley's; this time I am mentioning is the second time the prisoner came before the magistrate, and the first time I was there, I do not believe that there was any thing else passed particular.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. I understand you to say, that you had in the same letter sent Mrs. Mattingley two ten pound notes? - I said I had, being part of an annuity I call it, I mean an annual sum that I had paid her for some time.</p>
               <p>Had you at any time sent any drafts to Mrs. Mattingley from that circuit? - No, certainly not, I actually attended to this being quarter day.</p>
               <p>Had you made her any remittance before at that time from that circuit? - I had not, I am certain she had not a bank note when I left London, three weeks before, because I had given her some money myself.</p>
               <p>You represent yourself to have left Mr. Bower's chambers some little time, and to have returned, when the prisoner made that enquiry of you, whether you had seen Mrs. Mattingley? - I said I could not say whether it was an hour or not, it was while I went to talk to Mrs. Mattingley, went to Mr. Bower's chambers, and found he was not at home, went to my own, and left word for him to send to me.</p>
               <p>You do not know where the prisoner had been during that interval? - I do not of my own knowledge; Mr. Bower and the prisoner went from his chambers, where Messrs. Gosling's clerk, the prisoner, Bower and I were together: Mr. Bower and the prisoner went to Bow Street, I left them at that time, and went to Mrs. Mattingley's.</p>
               <p>Court. So in the interval the probability was Mr. Bower and the prisoner had been to Bow-street? - I could speak positively to that, they had been at Bow-street, because it was mentioned in the prisoner's presence afterwards, that they had been there; I heard it said when I was at Bow-street afterwards, that they had been there.</p>
               <p>During the time you was at Mr. Bower's chambers, previous to their going to Bow-street; do you remember that any mention was made of the name of Mrs. Mattingley? - I am sure that there was no mention in the prisoner's presence of the name of Mattingley, or any other thing like it; I am very clear and positive that there was not any mention of any name whatever; and that caused me to describe, what I really felt, a great surprise, at his asking me afterwards.</p>
               <p>Had you conversation with Mr. Bower (not in the presence of the witness) had you mentioned the name of Miss Mattingley to Mr. Bower? - I had, but had not told him where she lived, nor did he know, for he asked me afterwards, nor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070075"/>did he know till they got the door of the public-office, I said to him I will just go up to Long-acre for Mrs. Mattingley, she does not live an hundred yards from hence.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure there had been no mention of Mrs. Mattingley in the prisoner's presence before he mentioned it, but that you had mentioned it to Mr. Bower but had not told him where she lived, till you came to the door of the office in Bow-street; had you told Mr. Bower that you had sent the fifteen pound draught which you received from him to Mrs. Mattingley? - Upon recollection I am not quite sure that I had even mentioned her name, I am not quite sure, but rather think I might.</p>
               <p>I understood you to mention just now that upon recollection you had? - You question suggesting to my memory precisely what passed, I am not certain, that I used her name at all to him, I used another expression.</p>
               <p>Did you mean to explain to Mr. Bower what you had done with the draft? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then I should imagine; consult your recollection upon it; I should naturally imagine that you would mention the name of the person you sent it to? - You may think so, but the fact was, that I described her by another name.</p>
               <p>Could Mr. Bower understand at all by that? have you reason to believe that Mr. Bower could understand it was Mrs. Mattingley; had he known her before? - I do not believe that at that moment Mr. Bower ever knew the name of Mrs. Mattingley; I have no reason to believe that he knew her name.</p>
               <p>Then have you any reason to believe, that Mr. Bower ever knew that there was a person, to whom occasionally you did make those sort of payments? - No, he did not; no man alive knew it, unless a confidential brother.</p>
               <p>Excuse me; have you any reason to know, that he knew you had a certain connection with a person of the name of Mrs. Mattingley? - Most certainly, because I had spoke to him about it before.</p>
               <p>Did you mention to him the purport for which you wanted the draft? - Most certainly not, it was in the court.</p>
               <p>Did he know the purport? - I am certain he did not, because I had applied all round the town for 15 l. or 25 l.</p>
               <p>Then from that moment to the moment the prisoner accosted you, as you represented him, you had not mentioned to Mr. Bower, during that interval, the name of the person to whom you addressed those notes? - I cannot say that, I will not say that I have not mentioned Mrs. Mattingley's name, but I am rather inclined to think, that the expression I used was of a different sort to her name.</p>
               <p>During any part of the conversation that took place in Mr. Bower's room, had you by any gesture, or by any language that you had held, intimated to him any suspicions that you had of his being guilty of altering the note? - I did not directly or indirectly make the slightest mention to Mr. Bower, of any thing that passed between me and the prisoner, except that Mr. Bower's attention being employed in looking for some papers, I called his attention, and said, Mr. Bower, be so good to attend to us; and then I asked my questions I have repeated to you, making Mr. Bower hear what he said; Mr. Bower had first given me a detail; what he represented the prisoner to have said; it was in the presence of the prisoner and Mr. Bower: I have before said, I am not sure whether he was in the room or not; the description that Mr. Bower had given me was quite correct; whether the prisoner would repeat the same description, therefore I put what I said to you before:</p>
               <p>"then, Sir, it was a pale thin woman of five and thirty?" I put the material part of this relation of Mr. Bower into questions.</p>
               <p>I suppose your intention was sufficiently obvious to the prisoner? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>At the first conversation, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070076"/>had reason to suppose he was suspected? - Do you wish me to give an answer to that?</p>
               <p>Had you communicated to the prisoner the suspicions of your own mind? - I will not say he was aware of it; to say the truth, it was rather my intention, that he should suppose I did not suspect him; I did not want to put him on his guard, but the contrary.</p>
               <p>When you perceived him as having come over to you from the opposite part of the inn, to Mr. Bower's chambers, was there any anxiety in his behaviour? - There certainly was a great deal.</p>
               <p>Then was not that agitation encreased on your addressing him sternly, in the manner you have represented? - I cannot say it was at that moment, but I do not think his feelings appeared to have changed, or to be altered, between his first address, my stern answer, and his second interrogation; I am pretty clear it was so, for his manner struck us both.</p>
               <p>Now you say, when this passed, and while Mr. Bower was gone to Bow Street, you went in search of Mrs. Mattingley? - I went to her house, and found her at home, and had a great deal of conversation with her without apprizing her of the forgery.</p>
               <p>I speak of the second time going in search of her? - I found her from home, and I then went to my chambers and found her there.</p>
               <p>I understand you to say, you found her in a situation very different from that in which you had left her the first time of your calling upon her? - I did.</p>
               <p>What was the difference of her situation? - She was very much alarmed at something or other which I had not communicated to her, she was apparently in a very considerable agitation, it was an agitation (I do not know whether I ought to say what passed on that subject) but I wish correctly to describe, I cannot so correctly describe it as by using her words.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I shall certainly ask you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. Give me the note: can you take upon yourself, from your recollection of this note to say whether the ee's in the word fifteen as you suppose it to have been, were closed ee's, or whether they were open ee's? - I have said before, and I repeat now, that I believe the first letter e in that word in the body of the note, which was originally fifteen, continues as it was originally, I think the first e is not altered at all, that is my opinion; with respect to the second e, I apprehend it to be altered.</p>
               <p>Do you apprehend that to have been altered from an open e originally, or from a closed e at the top? - I cannot say, I understand the erasures to be confined to the two last letters of the word fifteen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You saw Mrs. Mattingley much agitated, much alarmed, in great agitation? - I did.</p>
               <p>What was the occasion of that agitation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. My Lord, I certainly do object to the enquiring into that alarm, I wish to be informed of the fact in which she then was; with respect to particular conversations that might have passed between Mr. Lane and that Lady; the clear simple fact is the thing to which the enquiry particularly applies.</p>
               <p>Court. I think at present the objection is right, a very little further of your examination would have let in this examination of Mr. Silvester's, but it seemed to me, that you stopped in time, because you had got nothing beyond the fact of Mrs. Mattingley's situation, and she was in a very different state to what he had seen her in before; Now in that state I cannot permit Mr. Lane to say what was the cause of that agitation; if Mrs. Mattingley is called, I think we may ask her.</p>
               <p>(The note read and examined by the record.)</p>
               <p>"March 24th, 1788. Please to pay to</p>
               <p>"John Lane, Esq. or bearer, fifty pounds,</p>
               <p>"for your humble servant, Fos. Bower;</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070077"/>Mr. Graham. My Lord, the note is read, and it is laid that on the 23d of April, &amp;c. My objection is upon the evidence now given on the face of that indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. It will be matter for the consideration of the Jury, that together with the inspection of the note and comparing it with the record will possess the Jury of the question; for it seems to me, that the erasures are so laid in the indictment, as to require a very strict proof; I doubt whether they need to have been so laid, if it had been laid that the word fifteen was altered to fifty, it would have been sufficient: It is impossible to be too accurate.</p>

             sworn in chief.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Long Acre.</p>
               <p>Where did Mr. Slack live? - In James Street, Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Slack? - About seven months.</p>
               <p>What kind of shop did he keep? - Part a linen drapers and part a haberdashers shop.</p>
               <p>Have you been in the habit of dealing at that shop often? - Very often, I do not suppose I passed a week from the first time.</p>
               <p>Did he know where you lived? - Yes, almost from the first of my dealing with him.</p>
               <p>Did he use to send goods to your house? - Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Did you in March last receive a letter from Mr. Lane from the circuit? - I did.</p>
               <p>What did that letter contain? - It contained a 15 l. draft, and two bank notes of 10 l. each.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect on whom the 15 l. note was drawn? - Messrs. Goslings, Fleet Street.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the note which come in that letter from Mr. Lane? - I paid it to Mr. Slack for a small bill that I owed him.</p>
               <p>What was the amount of the bill you owed him? - It was 3 l. 3 s. and some odd halfpence, but I only paid him the 3 l. 3 s.</p>
               <p>What did you pay him with? - With the 15 l. note.</p>
               <p>Was it the same note you had from Mr. Lane? - It was the same note, I never had another note in my life of that value, the bank notes were ten pound notes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the day, or how soon it was after you had received it from Mr. Lane, that you paid it? - I received it the 24th of March, and I paid it away either the 26th, 27th, or 28th; it was either Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, I do not know which day.</p>
               <p>Be so kind as to look at that note? - (Looks at it.) I have seen it before.</p>
               <p>What do you think of it? - I cannot say it is the note I paid Mr. Slack.</p>
               <p>But you are certain of the note you received in Mr. Lane's letter was the same note you paid to Mr. Slack? - Yes Sir, that I am certain of.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether the sum of 15 l. was both in words and figures? - Both in words and figures I am very clear.</p>
               <p>Having been there the 26th, 27th, or 28th, was you there after that for any other account, before he was taken up? - Many times, between the time I paid that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070078"/>note and the time he was apprehended, I cannot say how many, but I should suppose perhaps a dozen times at least.</p>
               <p>When was you first informed by the prisoner about this note? - The day he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>What passed on that day? - It was the 23d of April, Mr. Slack came to my lodgings about a quarter after two, that was the first time he ever called at my lodgings in his life; when Mr. Slack came, the gentleman of the house rang the bell, and my sister opened the door, and he asked for Mrs. Mattingley, and he was desired to walk up stairs; and when I went into the room to him, he said as soon as he saw me, madam, you recollect the 15 l. note you paid me; upon which I said, yes, Mr. Slack, what of it? he said, madam, a very unfortunate circumstance has happened, I said; what Mr. Slack? I think I am wrong in what I said first, I think he first of all asked me, or whether it was afterwards, he asked me, if I had seen the gentleman who had wrote the note; I do not recollect whether it was first or last, I rather think it was first.</p>
               <p>Court. That must have been after he asked you if you recollected the 15 l. note? - I said, no Sir, I have not seen the gentleman that wrote the note, but I have seen the gentleman I had the note from.</p>
               <p>What answer did he make? - I cannot say, I believe he asked me where Mr. Lane lived, and I asked him what business he had with Mr. Lane, what he could wish to see Mr. Lane for; then I believe it was, he said a very unfortunate circumstance attended this note; then I asked him what; upon which he said he had paid this note to a man in Bread Street, that man had paid it to another man who had forged it, and had come to his shop, and bought goods to the amount of 50 l. that he had taken these goods away, and was gone to Ireland, and had paid him with this note; upon which I was very much surprised at his receiving this note for 15 l. and paying it away, and receiving it again altered to 50 l. and I said, Dear, Mr. Slack, could you be so very thoughtless as to receive this note and pay it away as a 15 l. note, and take the same note back again as a 50 l. note, without observing that the name and date and every thing corresponded? he said yes, he had indeed; I believe I repeated again that I was very much astonished, that he should not pay any more attention to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. Was any body present at this conversation, was your sister present? - No, nobody was present, only just at the first part of it my sister was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Go on? - When he found Mr. Lane had been with me he appeared much agitated and wished he had come a little sooner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. Did he express a wish that he had been there sooner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What did he say? - Something of that kind, that he was sorry he had not come there before, I do not know that he expressed a wish, he wished me to inform him where Mr. Lane lived, upon which I supposing Mr. Lane might not be at home then, I said, Sir, if you will tell me any business you have with Mr. Lane, I will go and inform him myself.</p>
               <p>Had he before this said where the note was? - Why Sir, he had hinted in some slight degree, that the note was at Bow Street, upon which I said, then how came you here Mr. Slack? or something like that; and he told me that his boy was detained with the note; then I thought that the boy had offered the note for payment, and not Mr. Slack himself, that was a thought that struck me; he did not tell me, he was very anxious to know where Mr. Lane was; and I told him I would go to Mr. Lane, he wished me, I believe, to go to Mr. Lane, and tell him of the circumstance, the purport of what he said was, that he wished me to go to speak to Mr. Lane, that the note had been through several persons hands, and that the man being gone to Ireland, he thought he should not be able to bring him back, and the blame would fall upon himself, he wished me to say as much to Mr. Lane, that great as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070079"/>the loss was, he would put up with it; and he could not trace the persons whom he had received it from, he would rather be at the loss of the note if Mr. Bower and Mr. Lane would agree, than have any thing further said about it; in some part of the conversation I might say, pray Sir is not the man to whom you paid this 15 l. note able to trace it any more than yourself; upon which he said, no, he was not? he repeatedly requested of me that I would go to Mr. Lane's, I promised him I would, I immediately put on my hat and cloak, and went down stairs with him, and he went out, and I went to Mr. Lane's.</p>

               <p>Did any thing happen in your way to Mr. Lane's? - As I went along Lincolns Inn Fields I believe the wind might blow, I looked back, and I was almost at the top of the fields, and I saw Mr. Slack following me, upon which I felt myself very much hurt, thinking he might know something more than he had told me, seeing him there I rather thought myself inclined to go towards the houses, I looked to see if I was right, but I was not positive till I came to Holborn, then he overtook me just by Great Turnstile, I went through Turnstile, and down the top of Chancery Lane, not through Lincolns Inn; when he came up to me, he said, madam, have you been to Mr. Lane's? I said; no Sir, I have but just left home, I believe you know that, Mr. Slack, as you have followed; he said he wished very much to know what Mr. Lane said; I told him I would let him know when I came back; upon which he was turning to go towards Lincolns Inn Fields again; but I feeling myself very much hurt, supposing he was wrong in the story he had told me, thought I would speak to him before he went, and I called after him and said, I should like to speak to you Mr. Slack, if you please, and I said, I beg your pardon Mr. Slack for my suspicion, but if you know any thing further of the business than what you tell me, for God's sake run away.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - I said I can tell you thus far, that you are in the hands of men of honor, but men that though they are very good gentlemen, they will see justice done; I then said, I speak Sir as your friend, and I beg for God's sake if you know any thing of the business, fly as far as you can fly; upon which he said I beg madam, you will not alarm yourself upon my account, as it is nothing that can hurt me; and seeing me very much agitated he quite composed himself, seeing me very much agitated and hurt; I felt as if I should fall down in the street; he composed himself.</p>
               <p>What answer did you make to that? - I said, you know best, Mr. Slack, but I speak to you as a friend; I believe there was nothing farther passed; I then went to Holborn towards Lincolns Inn, to go down Chancery Lane, and I saw him returning into the fields.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. When you paid that small bill that you owed of 3 l. 3 s. had you a bill delivered? - I had, this is the bill, these are the articles I paid for that day, the bill is 3 l. 3 s. 2 1/2 d. (Bill of parcels handed up to the court.) I never owed him any bill but that and that which you have in your hand which is 2 l. 10 s. which I paid to his brother after he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. You have for some time dealt with Mr. Slack before this happened? - Yes, between six and seven months; his shop has not been open above eight months.</p>
               <p>Have you ever paid him before this time in paper for any thing you had of him? - Never in paper, in my life.</p>
               <p>Are you quite clear in that? - He once changed me a ten pound bank note, that might be about three months before this happened.</p>
               <p>You say he had sometimes sent things in that you had, to your lodgings? - Very often.</p>
               <p>Have you lodged in Long-acre the whole time of your acquaintance with him? - I have lodged in Long-acre three years.</p>
               <p>Was you always called by the name of Mrs. Mattingley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070080"/>Do you positively say that? - I have been called Mrs. Mattingley rather better than seven years.</p>
               <p>What name did you go by before you was called Mrs. Mattingley? - I was called Miss Mattingley before.</p>
               <p>Will you give me leave to ask you, within seven years was you never called by the name of Holton? - Never.</p>
               <p>Was you never called by the name of Scott, or Miss Scott? - Never Sir.</p>
               <p>So that the name of Mattingley, either as Mrs. or Miss. has been the only name you have ever assumed? - It has.</p>
               <p>Is that your real name? - It is.</p>
               <p>Were there any persons present at the beginning of the conversation, besides yourself and the prisoner, at your lodgings? - Only the maid, I think she shut the door, and heard Mr. Slack say, you recollect the fifteen pound note you paid me; that is all she told me she heard, I did not know she heard one word, when Mr. Slack was introduced to me, she shut the door and went away.</p>
               <p>In what way did you receive this fifteen pound note, that you say was drawn on Messrs. Gosling, in a letter, or by a porter? - I received it in a letter, which I received from Mr. Lane's clerk, it was inclosed in that letter with two ten pound bank notes.</p>
               <p>Are you clear in your recollection that you had paid for the goods? - I paid for the first bill, with the fifteen pound note.</p>
               <p>That you are clear about? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you pay into the hands of Mr. Slack, either of the two ten pound notes? - The ten pound note I got change of him for, was three months before, I did not owe him any bill, it was to pay for some trifling articles I bought of him.</p>
               <p>Will you say on your oath, that in all the four, or five, or six months you are speaking of, you never paid to Mr. Slack's shop any thing more? - I can take upon myself to say, that to the best of my recollection I never changed any other note, but that ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Did you ever send any body with any papers on your account, to be paid by the hands of Mr. Slack? - I never did.</p>
               <p>How many times might Mr. Slack send goods to your lodgings? - Many times, seven or eight times, may be more, but not less.</p>
               <p>ELIZ. MATTINGLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with my sister in Long-acre, I remember opening the door for Mr. Slack, I was at the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham to Mrs. Melissa Mattingley. Do you know a gentleman of the name of Windham or Windus? - I do not; I have heard that my Lord Egremont's brother's name was Windham: now I recollect that Mr. Slack has changed me two 10 l. notes, I changed one of them in Long-acre, and I have the other now.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Did Mr. Slack know you as well as your sister? - Yes, he knew I belonged to Mrs. Mattingley.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowys. I think you say, you are sister to the last witness? - Yes, I was just in the room when Mr. Slack came in, I shut him into the room; and went across the room and heard them words.</p>
               <p>Did you shut the door immediately on Mr. Slack's coming in? - When I had shut Mr. Slack into the room, I went across it immediately for something, I cannot tell what; my sister came in then, and I heard those words.</p>
               <p>It is rather a singular remembrance! how long have you lived with your sister? - Almost seven years.</p>
               <p>I think you said you changed a 10 l. note for your sister? - Yes, Sir, the prisoner changed it for me himself; I went by my sister's desire, she gave it me on purpose to change, I did not go for any thing, but to ask Mr. Slack to change the note.</p>
               <p>Have you gone on any other occasion, but to change the notes at Mr. Slack's? - Never.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether you have ever changed any other note for your sister? - I have before, but not since Mr. Slack opened shop.</p>
               <p>Have you changed many in the course of your living with her? - No, I may have changed three or four; I am not sure.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am clerk at Sir Sampson Wright's; I remember Mr. Slack being there, I took this entry, which I have here myself from his own mouth.</p>
               <p>Did you take it accurately from what he said? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(Reads it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. By whose direction did you take that down? - Sir Sampson Wright's.</p>
               <p>He directed you then to follow the prisoner in the account he gave? - He did.</p>
               <p>Were you sworn? - There are some alterations of the place he called himself of, this is his exact account.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070083"/>Did you write it in short-hand, or at length? - At length.</p>
               <p>Court. You took this by the desire of the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner asked to sign it? - No.</p>
               <p>Why was he not? - Sir Sampson Wright asked him how he came by it, and what was purchased, and there are his answers.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it was only minutes taken by you, of what passed at the time? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you cannot read it; the witness may speak from his memory, he may refresh his memory with it? - I remember the prisoner coming on Wednesday, the 23d of April; in company with Mr. Bower, to the office in Bow-Street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you reading that piece by piece, or are you refreshing your memory with it? - I am refreshing my memory.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand that you speak from your recollection, now assisted by the minutes which you, yourself, took at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The note, or order for payment, was produced in the presence of the prisoner, the first time I saw it lay on the table, being asked how he came by it, he said, that about ten days, or a fortnight, preceding that day, at three in the afternoon, a lady came to his shop, and purchased haberdashery and linen-drapery goods, to the amount of 40 l. and upwards, and gave him the draft of 50 l. and he gave her the change in cash; he said that he had frequently seen her before, but did not know her name, or where she lived; he said she had taken the things away in a hackney coach, but he did not know the number; she was genteelly dressed, and appeared to be about 36 years of age, she was thin, and had a comely face, and he described her dress, that she had frequently come to his shop, but always took the goods home herself, that his boy was in the shop during the whole time; and his brother came in just as he had finished, but did not see the draft; he then said that she bought a piece of Irish cloth at three and six-pence a yard, and several other articles, he said that there was no entry in any books of any thing that was sold to her, that he did not keep a cash book, but kept a day book, in which were entered those articles only that were not paid for.</p>
               <p>Did he say whether he gave any bill of parcels with the things? - He said he did not give her a bill of parcels, but that he cast up the different sums on a piece of paper, which he gave her, that she never dealt for so high a sum before; his boy came a little while after, and I saw him go away from the office in Bow-street, with Mr. Bower.</p>
               <p>Was the boy examined in his presence at all? - No he was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham and Mr. Knowlys the prisoner's counsel, took two objections; one, that there was a variance between the alteration of the note, as described in the indictment; and as described by Mr. Lane in his evidence; and another, that the note was not set forth in the indictment, to be feloniously altered, but falsely; which was not consistent with the act of parliament.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester contended; that the word feloniously was used in the part which charges the prisoner with uttering it, and that that was the offence, for which he was indicted. These objections were over-ruled by the Court.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Mr. Slack, your counsel can only take objections in point of law; and examine your witnesses; if you wish to state any facts to the Jury, you must do it either in word, or by writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I have witnesses.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is my brother; I have been some time his shopman.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived with the prisoner? - Ever since he began business, about eleven months ago.</p>
               <p>Do you remember in April last, any lady that was a stranger to you, coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070084"/>to your brother's shop to purchase some goods, and paying for those goods in paper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what time in April it was? - It was about the beginning of April.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what goods she called for? - I was not in the shop at the time she bought the goods.</p>
               <p>Did you come into the shop, before the goods were purchased? - The goods were purchased and packed up, when I came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Speak out and speak cautiously: did you see the lady pay for those goods? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what she paid for the goods in, whether money or bills? - She paid a bill.</p>
               <p>Should you know the bill, if you was to see it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The Bill going to be shewn to him.)</p>
               <p>Court. Let him first describe it? - It was a check of Messrs. Goslings.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect for what sum it was? - It was for 50 l.</p>
               <p>Upon whom was it drawn? - Upon Messrs. Goslings.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the name of the person that drew it? - It was drawn by Mr. Bower.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the name of the person, to whom it was made payable? - It was made payable to Mr. Lane.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the note, since the time it was paid to your brother by this Lady? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what the amount of the goods were, that the lady bought? - I do not exactly recollect.</p>
               <p>Can you say about how much? - It was about 40 l.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen that lady before? - Yes, Sir, I have seen her frequently in the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you know her name? - No, not her name.</p>
               <p>How was the lady paid the difference, between the note and the goods which she bought? - In cash.</p>
               <p>Did your brother give her any cash? - he did.</p>
               <p>Let me ask you whether it is usual in your shop, and in your manner of doing of business, when you sell goods for ready money, to make entries in your books of those goods? - No, Sir, we never do it.</p>
               <p>Now what kind of shop is yours, as to being light, or dark? - Why, Sir, it is rather a dark shop.</p>
               <p>Is there any particular reason for its being dark? - In having few windows, and those windows blinded up, to make the goods appear to the best advantage.</p>
               <p>You put the goods up to the window, to expose them for sale, and it will necessarily have the effect of darkening the shop? Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing that drew your attention particularly, to what was passing between your brother and this lady, that you recollect distinctly? - There was respecting the check, she asked my brother, she took out a red pocket book, she presented it to my brother, and asked if he would take it in payment.</p>
               <p>You remember then the circumstance of her taking out the red pocket book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did she do with the draft when she took it out of her pocket book? - She laid it on the compter before my brother, he took it up and looked at it, and laid it down immediately.</p>
               <p>Did you take it up also in your hand? - Yes, Sir, I took it up immediately, on account of her saying, would he take it in payment, I took it and looked at it myself.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon yourself to say, it was for 50 l.? - For 50 l.</p>
               <p>Court. You were in the shop when she took out this note, from her pocket book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have seen the lady often? - Frequently, she has been in the shop.</p>
               <p>Should you know her if you saw her again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen her since that time? - I have never seen her since that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070085"/>How came you to take up the draft, to look at it? - The reason why I took it was, she asked my brother if he could take it in payment, that made me anxious to see it, in order to judge if it was a good one.</p>
               <p>This lady was an entire stranger, both to you, and your brother; as to her name and where she lived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had drafts of Mr. Bower's hand writing before? - Not that I recollect, my brother might have.</p>
               <p>Then do you know how your brother came to take a note for so large a sum as 50 l. of a stranger, of a gentleman, whose hand writing he was perfectly unacquainted with? - I do not know what my brother's reason was for taking it.</p>
               <p>Did he ask any questions who Mr. Bower was? - He asked a question or two, he asked her who Mr. Bower was; she said he was a gentleman that lived in Lincoln's-Inn.</p>
               <p>Did not he ask her at all who she was? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>You looked at this, did you look at it so that you could take upon yourself to swear what sum it was for? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Are you certain it was for 50 l? - Yes, 50 l. I swear to.</p>
               <p>Was it 50 l. both in letters and figures? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that; you say it was a check on Messrs. Gosslings, in the name of Foster Bower, payable to Mr. Lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have been eleven months in business under your brother? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been in business before? - No, I have been in the same business before.</p>
               <p>How long? - Three or four years.</p>
               <p>Have you seen many banker's checks during that time? - I cannot say that I have seen many.</p>
               <p>You have seen bankers checks however? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of a check was this; in the first place are you sure it was a bankers check? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you describe a little what sort of check it is, before you see it, what part of it was copper-plate, and what part was writing? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Therefore, now if you recollect so accurately, you have stated to me whose check it was, who it was drawn by, and who it was payable to, and that you are sure the sum was both in words and in figures 50 l. now what part of the check was in copper-plate, and what part was in writing? - I cannot say that, I perfectly recollect what I have said.</p>
               <p>You recollect that from your view of the draft? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then from your view of the draft, what part of it was in copper-plate, and what part was in writing; you know bankers checks are a narrow slip of paper? - I do not think any part of it was copper-plate.</p>

               <p>Upon what account then did you call it a banker's check? - By being drawn upon a banker.</p>
               <p>Did you mean no more than that it was a draft on a banker? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Do not you know the difference, having been so long in business; do not you know the difference between a common draft and check; do you know what a banker's check is; it is a narrow slip of paper with a correspondent part in a book, and one is cut out so as to be a check on the other? - It was a draft on common paper.</p>
               <p>Then what did you mean by saying it was a check of Gosling's in Fleet-street? - I understood it to be the same as a check drawn.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice to whom it was directed? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you read the direction of it at all at the time? - On the back.</p>
               <p>The direction of a bill is never on the back, but on the face? - It was drawn by Mr. Bower, and payable by Messrs. Gosling's.</p>
               <p>How was it directed; how was the bill addressed? - I cannot perfectly recollect.</p>
               <p>How do you know then that that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070086"/>to be paid by Messrs. Goslings? - That was what I took particular notice of.</p>
               <p>Did you take particular notice of the date of the bill? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Was it payable to bearer or order? - It was payable to Mr. Lane or bearer, I think, I cannot say perfectly.</p>
               <p>Was there any indorsement upon it? - No, not any.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - At that time there was no indorsement upon it.</p>
               <p>Which of the Messrs. Goslings was it? - Mr. Gosling in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Your brother knew nothing of Mr. Bower before? - I did not know any thing of him, my brother probably might.</p>
               <p>And this lady you have never seen since? - I have not seen her since.</p>
               <p>Has your brother taken any pains after her, to enquire after her, to find her out? - Not any.</p>
               <p>Why has he not, when it is so material for his defence against this charge? - It would have been very material if we could have found her out.</p>
               <p>In fact he has taken no pains at all to find her out? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>What did he do with this bill after he had received it? - He put it in his pocket I believe.</p>
               <p>This you think was about the beginning of April? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how far in April? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Was it in the first, second, or third week in April? - It was either in the first or second week.</p>
               <p>How came your brother to keep the draft so long before you carried it in for payment? - I know nothing of his cash account, he kept the cash himself.</p>
               <p>You kept no entry for goods sold for ready money? - No, we did not.</p>
               <p>Let the amount be to what it may? - Not any.</p>
               <p>What means have you then of comparing your cash with your stock and with the goods sold? - By the cash we have in hand.</p>
               <p>What check has your brother when he is absent from the shop as to what goods are sold in the shop when no entry of them appears? - There is the account of the money in the till.</p>
               <p>Then he takes the word of the person in the shop when he is absent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you think you should know the draft if you saw it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham. I understand you to say that the person who paid this draft to your brother, was a lady whom you had some time seen and did not know? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it Mrs. Mattingley? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You knew Mrs. Mattingley perfectly well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had she often dealings at your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the note she paid at the shop? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear of any note she paid in? - I have heard of it, but never saw it.</p>
               <p>Which way am I to understand you; have you heard of it as the note for 15 l. paid by Mrs. Mattingley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is become of that note? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you never tell any body what is become of it? - No, I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>Did you never say it had been paid away long ago? - I do not recollect that ever I did.</p>
               <p>Come young man, recollect yourself a little; did not you tell somebody that as to that note, that had been paid a good while ago? - No, I do not recollect that I ever did.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you never said that note that Mrs. Mattingley had paid in, had been in twenty different hands before the time they applied to you; did you say so? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Take care what you are about, I caution you; look at these two ladies, did not you tell them, when they applied to you, and informed you of your brother's being in custody about this note; did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070087"/>you say that the note had been in twenty different hands? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>You hear me, you understand me? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I do not want to entrap you, I assure you it is a painful thing for me to cross-examine you against your brother, but it is my duty; will you venture to swear that when Mrs. Mattingley come to inform you of the situation of your brother, you did not say that that note which she had paid in for 15 l. had been in the hands of twenty people? - I might, perhaps, say it had been paid away into twenty different hands, but I did not positively say that it had, for I did not know, I did not know that my brother had paid it away at that time.</p>
               <p>Did not you inform them in the words I say, that that note had been paid away into twenty different hands by this time? - No, Sir, I did not, I said the bill might have been paid away twenty different times.</p>
               <p>Do you know of their being at your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember their coming to inform you of your brother's situation? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell them of this lady at the time? - I did not know anything of this note at that time.</p>
               <p>When did you first learn about this note? - Mrs. Mattingley mentioned at this time that she paid my brother a 15 l. note, and by some means it was altered to 50 l. I said that the bill might have been paid to twenty different hands, but I did not know any thing about it, that was the word I said.</p>
               <p>Then you did not tell them at all of this other note of this strange Lady's? - I did not know any thing at all of what my brother was taken up for.</p>
               <p>You read the 50 l. note particularly? - I looked that over.</p>
               <p>Was it payable to Mr. Lane, or Lane, Esq. or what? - I do not recollect particularly, it was to Lane or bearer.</p>
               <p>But whether it was to Lane, Esq. or Mr. Lane, you do not recollect? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Now this other note of 15 l. you never saw at all? - No, I never saw that at all at no time.</p>
               <p>Not at any time? - No.</p>
               <p>If you was so accurate in the note, do you mean say, it was directed to any party there by the name, you know there are four partners; was it directed to them by name? - It was to Messrs. Goslings.</p>
               <p>Was it telling where they lived? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Was not the note directed to any particular place as Mr. Goslings residence? - I cannot recollect it was, it was Messrs. Goslings.</p>
               <p>Are there many of that name? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>What makes you so accurate in the sum, for the goods you know were all packed up before you came in? - I did not see any of the goods, they were packed up when I came in; they were on the counter when I came in, I never saw any of them, I took up the note and looked at it particularly.</p>
               <p>Yet you cannot say to whom it was directed? - It was to Messrs. Goslings, that I recollect, but not the place of residence.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was not Fleet-street? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How came you to mention Fleet-street, just now? - I did not know of any other Goslings but that, I had been there before, I knew Mr. Gosling, the Banker, very well, but whether this was Mr. Gosling's, Fleet-street, I cannot tell; my brother generally took his drafts himself, if I was going into the city, perhaps I might take it, I never took any of 15 l. to Mr. Goslings, never.</p>

               <p>You do not know whether any such one was taken there? - No.</p>
               <p>What o'clock in the day was it? - I cannot recollect the time of the day.</p>
               <p>Was it light? - Yes, it was light, it was in the day time.</p>
               <p>Light enough to see and look at the draft I take it? - Yes, it was light enough<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070088"/>to look at the draft, we had not lighted candles.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the draft accurately? - I did not take particular notice of it only the sum, and that it was drawn on Messrs. Gosling, and I recollect, Foster Bower.</p>
               <p>Was in full length? - Yes, it was.</p>

               <p>How long might she be gone? - I was not there, I was in Poland-street at the time, she gave the money to my wife.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you got it? - It was, I believe about two or three o'clock.</p>
               <p>You are sure she gave it to your wife, not to you? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>

               <p>You know Mr. Lockee? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his giving you at any time a check, or draft to get money on? - Perfectly well, I cannot recollect when it was particularly.</p>
               <p>Was it before Christmas? - Before Christmas a long while.</p>
               <p>Where did you take that draft? - I took it first to a relation's of mine; he asked me who it was drawn upon, I told him I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070090"/>not know; he asked me who Mr. Firth was, I told him I did not know; my not knowing who Mr. Firth was, he would not pay it; I knew the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you go with that note to the prisoner? - I did.</p>
               <p>Had you known him any time before? - I knew him when he was shopman to Mr. Thompson.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him to give you cash for that draft or not? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did he give you cash for it? - He did.</p>
               <p>How did he find where you lived, or where Mr. Lockee lived? - I met him several times before that, and informed him where I lived; he told me me he was going into business, and I gave some of his cards about.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did Mr. Slack know what business you was in? - Yes, at that time I lived with Mr. Lockee; I worked with Mrs. Lockee.</p>
               <p>Then you was not a servant to Mrs. Lockee at all? - No.</p>
               <p>What did Lockee say to you when he gave you the note? - Mr. Lockee came up stairs, and desired I would get cash for it as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>Did he desire you to go to the bankers? - No, he said not to go to the bankers, for that would take up too long a time; I asked Mr. Slack, if he would be so kind to change that note for me, to give me the cash for it, and he took the note.</p>
               <p>Did you know who it was drawn upon? - No, Sir; I really don't know; I told him it was for Mr. Lockee; Mr. Slack knew I was at Mr. Lockee's, that was all he knew of Mr. Lockee; he knew me.</p>
               <p>As to Mr. Firth, you did not know who he was? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How came you to pick out Mr. Slack to get this note changed? - I thought him a man in business, and likely to have the cash.</p>
               <p>Did not you lay out a single farthing with him then? - No, he changed it merely to oblige me.</p>
               <p>Lockee lived in Newport-street then? - - He moved to Poland-street, a very short time after: he moved at Michaelmas; I left them; I did not put my name upon it; I know it was signed,

               <p>Court. Were you long gone? No, a very short time.</p>
               <p>Can you read and write? - I can both.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Lockee complain of your having staid so long? - No, Sir, he did not; he thought I had made exceeding great haste.</p>
               <p>What made him in such haste for the money? - The house that he took, the gentleman that was leaving it was going to sell some of his goods, and the auctioneer was to be there at a set hour, and Mr. Locke thought he would be waiting for him; he told me he wanted to get it before he went to Poland-street.</p>
               <p>Then you did not wait till he was out of patience, and went without the money? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You got in time to give it him before he went to Poland-street? - Yes I did.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Lockee at home, or was she gone to Poland-street - She was at home.</p>
               <p>Did she see you give him the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, are you sure that both Mr. and Mrs. Lockee were at home when you brought back the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure they were both at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who opened the door to you when you came back? - The little daughter; I am not quite sure, whether Mr. Lockee was not gone, and Mrs. Lockee waited for the money; I am not quite confident.</p>
               <p>Why you told me, that when you came back, he told you, you had made great haste? - Now I recollect myself; it was Mrs. Lockee told me I had made great haste; but I fancy Mr. Lockee, I think to the best of my remembrance, was gone.</p>
               <p>Was not Mr. Lockee very angry with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070091"/>you when your came home? - No, I do not recollect his saying any thing to me about stopping; I think he was gone.</p>
               <p>Was he, or was he not gone, which will you stick to, for you have sworn both ways? - Upon my word I cannot positively say which, but I think he was gone; he came home to dinner, which I think was about one o'clock; Mrs. Lockee went after him with the money.</p>

               <p>How came you to tell me just now, that he told you when you came back, you had made great haste? - It was Mrs. Lockee that told me so; a mistake will happen sometimes.</p>
               <p>How came you to swear that you got back in time to give him the money before he went out? - I did not recollect he was gone, but I recollect Mrs. Lockee telling me I had made great haste.</p>
               <p>Mr. Slack gave you the cash for the note very readily? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Never asked you any questions about it at all? - No, he did not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know of your own knowledge of any bills or notes that have been discounted lately by the prisoner? - No, I do not; the prisoner was clerk to me for about a year and half; I am a haberdasher; he was not in my business, he was clerk to me.</p>
               <p>Was it in the course of your dealings to make any entries of such goods as you sold for ready money? - Oh dear! no; it is impossible; it is too trifling; we never book any thing we sell for ready money. I never knew the prisoner before he came to live with me; he was with me as a clerk; he managed my books, and he likewise took the charge of the money; he has had the receiving of all my money at times, and more especially when I was out of the way; I had another person, a shopman, that was a check upon him; I never found any thing wrong in him; I had a very good character of him; he might have done me a great deal of mischief, for he had it entirely in his power; he had a banker's check book lately; I have 350 l. of his in my hands at present; I have it in money, and two bills on demand, which bill I reckon as good as money.</p>
               <p>Court. When was that placed in your hands, and for what purpose? - It was placed in my hands, I believe, for the purpose of satisfying his creditors; he is in debt considerably, though he has effects sufficient.</p>
               <p>He was not embarrassed at all in his circumstances? - Of course, being in trede, he must become indebted to a set of creditors, but he has property on the premises in money and goods, to a considerable amount.</p>
               <p>My meaning of the English word, embarrassed; I mean, when whether they have effects or property or not, they have more debt, than they can immediately pay, and are obliged to give security to their creditors, by making a deposit in the hands<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070092"/>of another person? - Clearly, in that case, this sum of money was put in my hands, in trust for his creditors.</p>
               <p>Was that sum of money put into your hands since this prosecution was commenced? - Yes, it was; there was nothing put into my hands before then.</p>
               <p>Mr. FENWICK sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was committed to me the 22d of last month, in the evening.</p>
               <p>Can you give any account of his property that you have come to the knowledge of since that circumstance? - Yes; about eight in the evening, my maid servant came into my garden, and told me, my turnkey wanted me; I went into the kitchen where he was; he told me, (he is here present) that he had property of Mr. Slack's.</p>
               <p>- BRINE sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you remember giving to your master any property, any effects belonging to the prisoner? - Yes, the night I received him into custody, the 24th of April, to the amount of 373 l.</p>
               <p>Where is that now? - My master I believe gave it to Mr Slack.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thompson. This money was deposited in my hands only one day last week.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Fenwick. What did you do with it? - He was committed on the 23d, on the morning I had it, I returned it to the prisoner at the bar; there were forty five guineas in cash and the remainder in bills.</p>

               <p>I work for Mr. Chawner; the prisoner worked in the same house, though not in the same shop; the wire mentioned in the indictment, was delivered to me to manufacture, on the 19th of April; I put it in my box, and having occasion to go out of the shop, on my return I missed it; when I saw it at Guildhall it was very much bent; I think it was bent a little before; I did not see the prisoner take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many pieces of wire were there in your box? - There was another beside that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many in the whole? - Two, the other that was left was stronger and longer.</p>

               <p>I work for Mr. Chawner in the same shop with the last witness; there is a convenience to make water at the end of the shop; the prisoner came in under that pretence, and put his hand into Wendelbow's box and took out the wire, which he bent and put into his pocket, so that it might not be seen; I went up to him and interrogated him, on which he put it in the box again; I collared him and carried him to my master; and took the wire out of the box to shew to him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Is it your silver or the workman's you deliver it to; whether upon a deficiency the workmen is not answerable to you? - It is my property; I weigh it to the men, and expect a proper return.</p>

               <p>Court to Crow. Do you know of such reward? - Yes, but I never expect any, nor never mean to take any.</p>
