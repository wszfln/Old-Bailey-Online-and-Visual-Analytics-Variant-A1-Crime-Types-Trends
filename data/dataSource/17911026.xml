I left my house on Sunday the 14th of August, about six in the afternoon, it was then safe; there was no person in my apartments, which are separate from the other parts of the house, and has a different entrance; it is a house let out in different tenements; the landlord does not reside in it; I left my house, and double locked the door about five, or half past five, and all my windows. I returned about a quarter past nine, or before ten, it was rather dark, not quite dark, I could discern people so as to know them. When I came up to my door a woman stood upon the step, I saw the prisoner in the shop; I immediately seized him, and took him with assistance to the Talbot; when he was searched there nothing was found upon him, but in the struggle I took a child's skirt and stays from him. I returned from the Talbot inn, and I got a lodger to stand at my door while I went to the Talbot. I found my drawers broke open by violence, I lost a 10 l. bank note, and about 20 l. in cash, gold and silver, some guineas, some half guineas, crowns and shillings. I have never recovered any part of my property. There was violence on the shop door, the lock appeared to be picked.</p>

               <p>You found a woman at the door, she went away on your coming up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing about the stays at the Talbot? - I am not certain.</p>

               <p>Do you know Collyer? - Yes, I had a lodger of that name, the prisoner is acquainted with him.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness; I come to prove the property. (A child's skirt produced.) I have the fellow to this skirt, it is my property, I know it by being my own work; it was kept in a drawer that was broke open. I do not know when I saw it before, but I believe a week before; the value of it is about 18 d. the skirt and stays are attached to each other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you call these things skirt and stay, or stay and skirt? - Sometimes one and sometimes the other, they are washed separate, but worn together.</p>
               <p>I suppose you call the thing which a child wears under its chin in the month a pair of stays? - No, I do not, I call it a stay.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Garrow objected to the naming of the stays and skirt together, and said the indictment was erroneous. The Court overruled the objection.)</p>

I saw the prisoner running; I stopped the prisoner, he was taken to the Talbot inn, the prosecutor had hold of him at the same time; I saw the prisoner put his right hand in his pocket, and throw something away, it looked like a handkerchief or napkin. I heard something sound, I followed the sound, and picked up an instrument, it is called a crow, I believe it is the same instrument.</p>

               <p>(The things deposed to by the marks made by a person in colouring.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderman Watson. Do you ever sell any of these goods, and let them go out of your shop with the mark upon them? - Yes, I dare say we do sometimes on the shawls. This is my private mark, I never sold any to the prisoner. This is a printed callico, here are two other pieces of callico which have no marks, but are our sort and pattern, with Mr. Welch's name and mark on them.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to the prosecutor, this mark I swear to, and the price and shop mark in my hand writing; we sometimes sell these articles with the mark on them. This piece was in our possession on the 3d of October, I do not believe it ever was disposed of in trade; I have been in the shop ever since, and should have seen it go if it had been sold. These shawls have the private mark of Anstie and Baker, I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179110260008"/>tell who made it; I know the patterns of these pieces that have Welch's marks; we had such patterns, there are pieces without marks, I know those patterns; the sixth I know not.</p>
               <p>Welch. Here is my mark on two of the three pieces, which proves to me to a certainty that at some time I have received this piece from Anstie and Baker: it is made by me in chalk, it is a hasty way to mark hundreds and thousands. A. B. I recollect no other customers whose names begin so, but Anstie and Baker; the other piece has an A. only, which is not so satisfactory.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of these articles? - The four cotton shawls are worth about 7 s. the chintz, which was found in his hands, is worth 16 s. the other articles are worth 5 l.</p>

I sent for an officer, and Mr. Dutton and I stopped the man; Mr. Dutton was present, he said this is my roll, and my hand labour; he said he would swear to it.

(Prosecutor deposes to the knife and fork produced by Dawson.) I have had this knife eleven or twelve months, it was in the bag.</p>

I gave her a shilling, she threw the hat on the stairs, and after that she took it up into the garret. I went up into a room where there was seven or eight beds, and as many men, they appeared to be asleep. I asked her for my hat, she said if I gave her a glass of gin; I refused. She throwed me on the bed, and took 2 s. 6 d. out of my pocket. I was very sober, I had been to the opera. She ran down stairs; I went out, I met a man I knew; he advised me to go to the patrol, who took her.</p>

               <p>I was employed by the prosecutor, on the 19th of October, about seven, I met my master, he begged me to stop to be searched, the three prisoners were ordered to stand by themselves in the parlour. My master read<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179110260018"/>the letter; during that time one dozen of spoons were laid on the chair behind where Clinch stood, and I heard a rustling, and saw Owen shuffling something into his bosom. I asked him what he had there, he said he had nothing, but turned round, and attempted to pull off his coat, and there was a bundle laid on the ground between his legs; neither Clinch nor Blair stooped down at this time; there was a carpet on the room and a cloth over that, and each spoon was in a single paper.</p>

            , in the absence of the family. The cloth was taken from the bed room, two pair of stairs; I had seen it there, but it was more than a week or a fortnight before; I locked that room that day between twelve and one, I had not been in it afterwards, I had the key all the time in my pocket; I examined the door when the man was in the house in custody; the door had been unlocked not forced, the drawers had been wrenched open, and the things in the indictment taken from them. I saw all the things taken from the prisoner, I had seen them in the house before; I never saw the prisoner at the house but once before.</p>

I told him I would. We never lost sight of Clarke, and took him at about two hundred yards distance, the other got away.

Randall was on my side, and I gave him the money in the indictment, and a three-penny or four-penny piece, some thing of that kind, and a silver watch in a double case, and a metal chain; then they rode off. They were with me not above a minute or two, I should suppose, but a very short time; I saw them again the Tuesday week after the robbery. Each of them had a pistol, they behaved exceedingly well, as a man could expect to be robbed, only threatning the horse. I have no doubt of the men, I saw them at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner Randall's Counsel. What dress did you see Randall in when he was at Bow-street? - A drab coloured kind of coat, the coat he has on now, apparently to me the coat he had on at the time he was stopped.</p>
               <p>So you swore at that time? - I judged it so.</p>
               <p>It is by that principally that you enable yourself to swear to him? - No, Sir; I have a strong recollection of his face.</p>
               <p>You had never seen either of the persons who robbed you before? - Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any body with you? - My brother and two little girls.</p>
               <p>Your children are young children, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are they here? - No, the one is about ten, the other six or seven.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find any of your things? - No.</p>

               <p>Can you swear to him? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Are you positive? - I am as to his person, because he was on the same side of the chaise where I sat, it was close by my side; they ordered the horse to be stopt; then they demanded the money, my brother asked them if they would take all his money? whether he would not allow him something for his expences on the road? he said, deliver all your money and your watch. I saw my brother deliver his money and his watch, they then rode off towards Harrow. I saw them at Bow-street the Tuesday se'nnight after. I cannot swear to Randall's person.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. There is a felonious larceny and a felonious putting in fear, but not a felonious assault.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there must be another indictment, we cannot suffer two men to go upon the highway again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. To be sure they cannot be convicted of the same felony again, if they have the misfortune to stand there, I must exercise my judgment; I do not feel myself armed with powers to wave a good objection.</p>
               <p>[The prosecutor and witnesses ordered to go to Hick's-Hall and prefer a new indictment, and tell the person who drew it that he has made a mistake.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will advise the prisoners, my Lord, to wave the objection.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot do it, we are bound to take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. If any thing can be found for the benefit of the prisoners I shall be very happy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They are now convicted of a highway robbery on this indictment, of course their judgment may be saved; on the face of this record they will be entitled to judgment, because they are convicted of larceny.</p>
               <p>Court. No, we must do justice to the public, we must have another indictment.</p>
               <p>The two prisoners ordered to be taken away, and to remain in custody.</p>
               <p>N. B. On Saturday Mr. Justice Heath informed Mr. Garrow that he had considered the objection, and thought the indictment good; therefore he should not try them again.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor had obtained another indictment.</p>

               <p>Court. Was it one of those very hot days we had in September? - It was: the constable took the purse from him.</p>
               <p>Court. Be so good to look at him again.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have no doubt about him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you decline swearing to me at Barnet? - This I said, that his hair was so much dishevelled, and he had a great colour in his face, whereas before he looked exceedingly pale, that I really at that moment could not swear whether he was the person or not, but I can positively swear to him now: I did not swear to him before the magistrate; I had some doubt in my mind; his countenance was so very different, that his countenance convinces me now that he is the same person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish the Court to know the answer that Dr. Knowles gave to the magistrate at Barnet; wheher Dr. Knowles did not refuse swearing to me, because the person who robbed him was of a very pale complexion? - I say so now.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you swear to him at all before the justice? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you give intelligence to any person at the time? - Mr. Underwood was with me, and he saw the servant set off after him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in the chaise with Dr. Knowles, my father, when he was robbed; the first notice I took of the prisoner, was his presenting a loaded pistol, and demanding my father's money, and said distress had brought him to do it; my father offered him one guinea, and asked him if that would do; he said it would not; he rapped at the shutter three times with a very bright new pistol to appearance; upon that my mother let down the blind, and my father gave him a guinea; he said he demanded the money; he said distress had brought him to do it; upon which my father offered him a guinea; says he, will that do for you? no, says he, it will not do, for distress has brought me to it, and I must have the other; my father gave him the two guineas and the purse, and desired he might have the purse back again, which he had; and my mother gave him a purse, which I did myself; he never offered to rob me; I could not help looking stedfastly at him the whole time, I could not help it; he had a blue great coat on; and his person, and every thing, has been in my mind ever since, and I could describe the person of him in my sleep; he had a blue great coat, and a dirty-coloured silk handkerchief round his neck, like that one I have seen him pull out just now; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179110260028"/>three, four, or five minutes with us; my father talked to him, and parleyed with him in that manner.</p>
               <p>Court. I need not put you on your guard, that the life of the prisoner may depend on your evidence; I dare say you mean to say what is right; but in all that hurry and agitation of spirits which this must necessarily produce, are you sure and certain, in your own mind, that the prisoner at the bar is the man or not? - I am willing to swear it; I am positive, and have no doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The lady, in giving her evidence so very clearly and deliberately, on observing my person, and the colour of my handkerchief, I beg leave to ask her, whether she did not look in my face at Barnet, and ask which was the man that robbed her father? - I recollect he was among a great number of people, and therefore I might not recollect him quite so well, then; I might recollect him afterwards in my own mind.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ask that question, Which is the man that robbed us? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>The prisoner desires to know, and he has a right to have an answer to that question, whether you did ask that question, Which is the man that robbed us? - If I recollect myself at all, it was my saying that, because I thought it was the very man.</p>
               <p>Have you any recollection of that; consider with yourself? - To say the truth, I was very much frighted at that time; I might say it.</p>
               <p>But when your mind was more composed, how were you then? - I recollect the great coat, handkerchief, and every thing, I called to mind; when my mind was more composed, I had a more perfect recollection; it is so much so, that I even can make visions before my eyes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg the Jury will attend to the very deliberate answer, that she should be so cool and deliberate when she came into the room among twenty people looking at me, and asking, is this the man that robbed us; I wish the lady would give that explicit answer, for the satisfaction of the Court.</p>
               <p>Court. That will be a circumstance that, among others, will be left to the Jury to judge, how well she is warranted to swear to you.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I beg the attention of the Court to what has been said against me, and I rest my defence with the Jury. I beg leave to say a few words with respect to what has been laid against me. First, Dr. Knowles comes now and swears positively against me, nearly two months after he was robbed, when an hour and a half after he declined it. The next is Mrs. Underwood, she comes nearly two months after, describing the colour of the handkerchief of the person who robbed them, describing the colour of his coat, his dress, complexion, and every particular circumstance which she could not describe an hour and a half after, and said when she looked me in the face, which is the man who robbed me? That boy is next called, I put it to him, he declines answering it, how far I rode with him, and what pace. I rode with that boy I suppose more than two miles, at the pace of five miles an hour, when I went through Barnet I went not very fast; then when stopt I made no refusal; there was what money I had when I was before the magistrate; nothing found upon me could be claimed by any other person. I was on my business, if any person claims any part of the property that was found on me, so it must be.</p>
               <p>Court. How did you come by the pistols? - I had a pair of pistols about me, which I bought at Cambridge; I have travelled with a great deal of money about me very often, and it was necessary for me to have them for my own defence.</p>
               <p>How came you to ride so fast when the boy was going into the yard? - I did not ride fast, I rode gently up the hill, but when I got into Barnet I rode fast, without any particular reason. I have witnesses to my character.</p>

I let the man go, and struck him across the head with my stick, which broke; then I retreated, and called watch, and the man was secured; he was out of my sight only a moment; I am certain he was one of them, it was a very light night, and very near a large biscuit baker's shop.

I am not sure of the prisoner, but I think I can be sure of the person of Lowe, who came up first, his face corresponds with the recollection I have; the face of the other I never saw. I imagine they were with me not beyond five minutes; after they left me, in a few yards they attempted to stop another gentleman, who called the centinel, and the men ran away. I never saw the men again till now; I have seen my property since. I have no recollection of their dress.</p>

When Lowe was taken I saw Lowe throw a pair of spectacles over the area of Mr. Drummond's door, I picked them up.</p>

               <p>I work for Mr. Russell, I found this soap under the manger in the stable, and shewed it to my master, it was about twelve o'clock last Monday week; there was straw over it. Master told me to put it there again, which I did; he told me to watch, I did so: this man came into the stable about five o'clock. He was going out of the gate, after doing up his horse, I stopped him, and he took it out of his pocket. I sent for our clerk, the prisoner took a cake out of his pocket, he delivered it to the clerk; the clerk gave it him back again, and then the officer came, and took him into custody. After the prisoner left the stable I went to look if there was any soap missing from the manger, it was gone.</p>

I do not in my own knowledge know that it was the prisoner's apartment, but he told me it was, and so did Mrs. Beard, his landlady; the soap was in a closet in his room. The soap now produced is the same which I took out of his breeches; he had a pair of trowsers over his breeches, there might be some in a side pocket.</p>

Mr. Bedingfield got my wages to the time of my return. I saw the prisoner in September, I was at the Swan, I called him Capt. White; he turned round, and told me he did not know me; I made myself known to him, he knew me directly; then I went into the India-house; after that I saw Mr. Unwin come in, and he said Brown, here is your shipmate; I had not time to speak any more about it; I could not think who it was, but I saw him come in afterwards. After some little time had passed he came up to me, and stooped down, and told me not to mention his name. That was all that passed at that time; some little time after he came to me, and asked me if I would go to the Swan, and have any thing to drink, that was about three quarters of an hour after: we went into the Swan, and then he told me what he was upon; he told me that he was come to the India-house to get what gratuity money was given there, and afterwards he meant to go to Somerset-place, to receive

               <p>You say still you are positive now, and were positive at that time, when you saw him before the Justice, that he was the person that robbed you; though you did not chuse, on account of this sort of false delicacy, to swear to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hosty, Prisoner's Counsel. From what circumstances can you take upon you, in so short a time as one minute and an half, to swear to the prisoner? - His face is very particular; I kept my eyes particularly on his face; he had a round hat, no great coat, and came up with a pistol cocked to my side, and demanded my money; I gave them my money; Wells demanded my pocket-book and watch; I told him I had none; he said by God I had; and he clapped his hand on my thigh, and seemed satisfied; he bid me go on, and not look back; if I did, he would shoot me; I do not swear to Kingland; I never saw my purse afterwards.</p>
               <p>Was you agitated? - I cannot say I was.</p>

I believe the prisoners to be two of the men; I took particular notice at the time; and from the best of my recollection, I think they are the men; I looked at them particularly, as they came in that sort of hurry; they went up the hill, towards Watford; Mr. Foster of Harrow, was in the bar; and he came out and said, Will, these are three scampsmen; by that I understood highway-men; they came the Pinner road from Harrow Weald Common, and went up the Watford road.</p>

I went and bought some breakfasting tea cups and saucers, gave 4 s. 6 d. for the tea and 5 s. for the breakfast; I delivered them to my father.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. About twelve o'clock I went to Guildhall, from thence to Allen's house, I asked if she had any china to sell? she hesitated a little at first, she said she had some patterns; she shewed me some; she went with me to the Poultry Compter, and she pointed out Fright, and said this is the man who sold me the china, that was Fright. The goods were in the possession of Lawrance and Clark. I have been a very great sufferer, I have lost from 300 l. to 500 l. The prisoner did not lodge in my house. He packs.</p>

My wife asked me if it was a good shilling, while I examined it the prisoner went out, it was a crooked one, I found it to be a very bad one, it was the same shilling the prisoner gave me, I have no doubt, I put the shilling in my pocket, I kept the shilling in my pocket with two or three others, but I made sufficient observation to know it again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hosty, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you put any particular mark on the shilling so as to know it again? - Yes, I cut it on the edge?</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury, you have collected from the officer, and from my learned friend who opened the indictment, that the defendant, who is now charged before you to enquire of his guilt, has it imputed to him, that he has written and published an infamous and obscene libel: the defendant stands near you, and, gentlemen, if you have been in the habit of attending Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction, you will find there are some circumstances in this, which do not belong to ordinary trials at this place; and therefore, we have been under the necessity, in order to preserve any, the least, attention to delicacy and decorum, to desire the female sex may retire; and we have been under the necessity of desiring that the offence may not be stated even among men in the terms of this libel; we have done this, because a more infamous, a more disgraceful collection of obscene words never met together in so small a compass: It may be asked, if this is the description of the libel, why is it brought forward into the view of the public, and why is the defendant brought here to answer for it? I reply, for this plain and obvious reason, because, if young men, like the defendant, are to be permitted to insult the retirement of the female sex, to write their poison to the wives and daughters of their neighbours, and to intrude themselves on the privacy of decent families, there is an end to all the decorum, and to all the morals of the publick; and therefore, however painful it may be to those who are obliged to stand forwards to produce such filth as this, it is indispensibly necessary, in order that any of us may have decorum, decency, and peace of society preserved inviolable, and that we may live in a state superior to that of beasts, it is necessary that cases like this should be brought before Courts of Justice; it will be my endeavour to do my part within the line prescribed by the decorum and the decency which belong to this place, in which I stand. Gentlemen, the situation of the parties is this: - The prosecutrix, Mrs. Timmins, is related, by the intercourses of marriage, with that young man at the bar, and it seems that some of the family have had unfortunate disputes leading to a divorce, whether the conduct of this Lady has given well or ill-founded offence, is not necessary to enquire; but he has taken the liberty of writing this which I have in my hand - you will be obliged to cast your eyes upon it - the Court must look at it - I know who I have to deal with on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179110260052"/>the other side - I know there is no man who has so high a regard, I say so high a regard for the better part of our species than my learned friend, Mr. Fielding; therefore, I take it for granted, we shall have no public exhibition of it, and that those who are waiting to hear it, will be disappointed; but, Gentlemen, the Court and you will judge what sort of composition it is; this letter was written, as I shall prove to you, by the young man at the bar, and sent by the post to the prosecutrix, Mrs. Timmins; now it occurs to you, to ask how any body should behave on such a subject; when you see something written in the street that offends your eye, you take no notice of it; but this came by the post, therefore this Lady comes now to complain of it: the objects of inquiry will be two; first, was this written by the young man at the bar; and, next, was it sent, by the post, to the prosecutrix? With respect to that, it will be proved, by her, to have been received by her, with a post mark on it; with respect to the writing, I shall be under the necessity of calling to you several witnesses, who will be sorry to lend their assistance to convict their relation, their friend, and their partner; but I am told they are men of character, and I have no doubt, on the subject of handwriting. You know it is not required that a witness should be present at the time - the paper was written, it is not required that he should prove it is the hand-writing of the defendant, because that is a thing that no man can venture to do, unless he was present at the time, and knows the fact by some mark of his own; all that is required, is, that he believes this to be his hand-writing; therefore the labour upon me is extremely easy, and very short. I shall produce the paper, and shall put it into the hands of those acquainted with the handwriting of the defendant, and they will tell you that it is his, and then you will pronounce him guilty: The degree of punishment must rest with the Court. These are times in which it is clearly necessary that this sort of offence should be marked by a punishment pronounced upon it; we have seen Royal Proclamations filed by the Attorney General, which have been unavailing to suppress the public sale, distribution and dispersion, of the most infamous and obscene libel; we have seen the windows of the metropolis crouded with the most infamous and diabolical prints; such as no man, of common decency, can look at without shuddering with horror, such as no modest woman can venture to put her eyes upon. When people have the hardiness to avail themselves of the appetite of the public; I have said more, I am sure, than is necessary, more, I am sure, to impress you with the importance of the subject, a great deal more than can be necessary to excite the Court to lend it their best attention and assistance. I hope this young man will be made an example to others, not to sport at once, with the relationship he owes to the other sex, and, with all the principles of decency, public morality, and decorum.</p>

               <p>How long ago did the marriage take place? - Three years next February.</p>

               <p>There is a suit now depending in the Commons for a divorce. Have you had any connection at all with Mr. Olivier? - No more than his living with my son, as a <rs id="t17911026-63-deflabel360" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>How long is it since the first disagreement took place between the young couple? - Some time about January last; they have lived separate ever since that time.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am son-in-law to the last witness. I am acquainted with the defendant exceedingly well; he was employed in the weaving line nine or ten months; his father-in-law was in partnership with us; I was well acquainted with his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Upon your mother's receiving this letter, did you make any application to the defendant on the subject? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know whose hand-writing it was on looking at the superscription? - I took it to be the defendant's.</p>
               <p>Upon the letter being opened did you take the contents to be the same hand-writing? - Yes, I went to the defendant, and I said to him, how could you be so foolish to send such a letter as this to my mother? (Producing the letter,) he said, is it not true?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Jury. There is an insinuation that this woman every night or every hour committed fornication? - I said to him you know it is not, and how could you be so foolish as to do it. I told him afterwards I was sure it was his, and that he had much better go and ask her pardon for sending such a thing; he said, I might go and give his compliments to her, and she might do her worst. Upon which I bid him good morning.</p>
               <p>Look at that letter; from your acquaintance with the character of his hand-writing in five years, have you the least doubt in the world that that is his hand-writing, independant of his own confession? - I have not, I knew the first letter; that letter is quite nonsense, there is no making head nor tail of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are a little related to the defendant, are not you? - I married his sister.</p>
               <p>There is some dispute I believe between you and his sister in the Commons? - There is.</p>
               <p>You have been a little anxious about that?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I must once more ask whether the private history of a man's life is to be brought into question?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you never held any conversation with the defendant in that suit? - Not to my knowledge, I do not recollect; I might.</p>
               <p>Have you never held any conversation relative to that suit, in which this business of the libel has been afloat, since it began? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did he ever expressly acknowledge that was his hand-writing? - He did not say it was his hand writing, only by his manner of expressing himself.</p>
               <p>What expression did he make? - He said, is it not true? I took the letter out of my pocket, I went to pay some rent, and to speak to his father about it; he was not at home, and young Olivier took the money.</p>
               <p>You told the defendant that you was sure it was his hand-writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath did he ever say it was? - All the words as I have related before.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that that is in his usual common hand-writing? - It is in his usual scrawl, not as if he sat down to write any thing.</p>
               <p>In the manner he does write in his common way; if he had written any thing else<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179110260054"/>in the same manner, would you think it was his hand-writing? - I should.</p>
               <p>How often have you seen him write? - A great many times.</p>
               <p>This was in the beginning of April? - It was; it was about the middle.</p>
               <p>You told a number of people of this? - No, I asked two; I asked Mr. Bassett for one.</p>
               <p>Did not Mr. Bassett tell you, it was not his own hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow objected to the question, which was over-ruled by the Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I think you told me that you did ask two gentlemen their opinions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I want to know of you the names of those two gentlemen? - Mr. Bassett and Mr. Ellis. Mr. Ellis is here, he was our late foreman; he happened to come up into the warehouse, and I believe I shewed it to him, I shewed him the letter, because he seemed to understand something about it; he came to enquire how the disturbance went on; he said he had heard something fresh.</p>
               <p>Where did you see Mr. Ellis? - He came into my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Why did you shew it to Mr. Bassett? - Bassett came into the warehouse, I believe I asked whether Hewitt was at home.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him whether that letter was the writing of the defendant? - I believe I did, I cannot charge my memory. Some days after Mr. Olivier met me, and said I have heard nothing. Says I, that is nothing to me. Says he, you cannot do any thing to me for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you shew this to any body, from the least doubt of its being his hand-writing? - Not the least, I have no doubt to this time.</p>
               <p>As far as any man can swear to a handwriting, you are positive? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now I must trouble the gentlemen of the jury to read the letter; I shall not have it read publicly, but it is highly proper you should read it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding addressed the Jury on the part of the defentdant.</p>

               <p>Is that the letter? - To the best of my knowledge it is.</p>
               <p>It is rather a particular letter, did you give him your opinion of the hand-writing at the time? - I gave him my opinion at the time that it was not, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, having known his hand-writing, do you believe that to be his hand-writing? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Is he a good natured lad? - The young man always appeared whenever I have been with him, which was more or less every day, to be a good-natured mild kind of a lad.</p>

               <p>It is not at all like your young master's hand-writing? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>Look at it, it is not at all like any writing of his that you ever saw? - No, Sir, I cannot say I ever saw any like to this.</p>
               <p>You do not think it bears the least resemblance to his hand-writing? - Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>You are astonished that any body should fancy it is like his writing? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It is not on account of any disagreement that you do not continue to be Mr. Timmins's porter? - No.</p>
               <p>It is only on account of the inconvenient distance to which Mr. Timmins is removed? Yes.</p>
