I keep a beerhouse at Brentford called the Shovel and Hoe—on the morning of 4th July, about midday, the prisoner came in for half a pint of ale; she had two shillings in her hand, and dropped one on the counter, and kept the other back; that excited my suspicion—I gave her the change, and she drank the bear and left—immediately after she had gone I found it was bad; it had not gone out of my hand,</p>

               <p>and I went out and went across the road, and followed her; after going 100 yards she turned round and looked, but I don't think she recognised me; after going another 100 yards she turned round, and I think she recognised me, and began walking very quickly, and when she saw I was closing on her she went into a public-house; I fetched her out, and told her she had given me a bad shilling—she said "Well, if that is a bad one I will give you a good one for it"—I asked her what money she had, and she showed me a shilling and sixpence and fivepence worth of coppers, and said that was all the money she had got—I had given her sixpence and fivepence worth of coppers—I called a policeman, and gave her in charge—this is the shilling produced—I marked it, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I trade now as Raer, Son, and Co.—in May last I was trading as Raer and Co., at 7, Lovell's Court, as fur, skin, and general agent—I had known the prisoner as a traveller for other firms, and on 4th May I entered into this agreement with him—it is signed by him and me—by it is provided that his sole remuneration is to be 40 per<lb/>cent. on the net profits, and that all moneys are to be handed over to Raer and Co. as received—before the agreement the prisoner had not been engaged with me in business in any way—the name of Mann and Co. was put up on the two top floors which were set apart for the business—the prisoner was manager of the manufactory—at that time I had at my disposal a number of bear-skins, some of which were made up into fur trimmings by Mr. Wyld—after that I had a conversation with the prisoner about selling them—6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was fixed as the selling price, and if he could get the offer of a lower price he was to let me know—on 3rd June he said he thought he could place them with Messrs. Evans—nothing was said about the price—next day, 4th June, I inquired whether he had got the price—he said the goods were not sold, he had not any offer, but that Messrs. Evans wanted to consider the matter, and he told me to send the whole parcel there on memorandum for them to look through it—they were packed in canvas—he said something like "I got a porter"—I did not want to send them through a porter of his own—the goods not being very heavy I said to the office boy "You can carry them there, and see to bring me a receipt for the goods"—the prisoner wrote out this memorandum, which the boy took with him and</p>

               <p>brought back receipted and handed to me. (<hi rend="italic">This was:</hi> "Received of Mann and Co. 15 dozen and 10/12 bear trimmings, June 14th, 1885," and marked memo.) The prisoner went round directly after the boy—towards the evening of that day I saw him again—he then said Messrs. Evans would take time to consider the transaction, whether they should make an offer or buy a parcel—on Friday, 5th June, I saw him at the office and inquired—he said "I cannot tell you yet, they have not decided"—he usually came to the office between 9 and 10—on the Saturday, 6th June, he came about 12 or 1 I think—I had then been round to Messrs. Evans in consequence of what the boy whom I had sent to them previously had said—at Messrs. Evans's I was shown this invoice, dated June 5th—I fancy it was then receipted like this—this receipt is in the prisoner's handwriting—the invoice is a printed one of Mann and Co.'s—I cannot tell whose writing is on it—I did not know there were such invoices—I had sent him to the printer for cards, and he had come back saying he had ordered invoices, memoranda, and cards—on seeing the invoices I said there was plenty of time to make them when we had done business—I did not know until I saw this that any invoices had been printed—the skins appeared to have been sold at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or so, less than the cost price—I had told him the price was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we agreed that should be the price—on the Saturday after this when I saw him I said "I think I hear that you sold the trimmings"—he patted his pockets, and said "I have got you; I claim from you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. referring to March and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a subsequent date"—I said "I am going to Messrs. Evans now"—he said "Don't take the trouble; you may save yourself the trouble"—he followed me in the street saying "You can save yourself the trouble; I have got the money"—I asked nim to go to my solicitor on the matter—he declined to follow me there, and did not come there to the office, and so I went on to Messrs. Evans and got all particulars—the prisoner went out of the office as I left—I did not see him again that day—he did not come to the office on Monday—I wrote him this note on Saturday after he left: "Unless you appear on Monday morning at 10.15 at my office, when we can go to Messrs. Field and Buller, I shall know how to act"—I received this answer from the prisoner: "Dear Sir,—I shall not be in the office on Monday till late, but you will hear from me about 11 o'clock"—a solicitor for the prisoner. Mr. Hurrell, called at the office about 11 on Monday—I was out—having heard he had called I went there and for the first time saw this account offering me a balance of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know what the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the disbursements refers to—I never knew the name of Kymer and Co.—Wyld was the chambermaster upstairs who made the fur trimmings up—that is the only genuine name as far as I know—I have heard that amount has been paid to Wyld since this action—at that time I had not heard that any money had been paid to him—I know nothing of wages to J. T. Mann, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., from 30th March to May 11th—I never agreed to pay him wages—he was not in my service on 30th March—I only agreed to pay him what was on the agreement—there was no profit from selling these furs, but a loss—I saw nothing more of the prisoner at the office or anywhere until proceedings were taken against him—I advanced him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at different times on accouut of future profits.</p>

               <p>Co. when Mann joined me; we had just started—I could put no con<lb/>struction on whether the prisoner was partner or servant, we simply had the agreement—he had to receive a certain amount of profits on transac<lb/>tions he made—I have been in the fur trade since 1875, and have know<lb/>ledge of furs—the firm of Raer and Co. had been in existence seven or eight months—before that there had been another firm of Raer and Co., which had become bankrupt in 1880—I am an uncertificated bankrupt at the present time—I believe a dividend of 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid, but it was out of my hands then; that arose out of a partnership—I was never concerned in another bankruptcy—there was no composition with the firm of Thereser Raer and Co.—there was an execution taken by two people, who seized that firm's goods—I knew Mann as traveller for Myers, the largest fur people in the City, of St. Paul's Churchyard—he was after-wards in another house—I supposed he had a good connection among people who dealt in furs—these furs were in my trust; Mr. Field was their owner—they had belonged to Thereser Raer and Co., and had been paid for—Mr. Field paid for them and they became his—he is a member of a firm of solicitors—I wanted the prisoner to go and see them on Monday—I had the intention of prosecuting the prisoner, and consulted with Field as to what was best to be done—I did not at once call a constable, because it was the first case of the kind that had come into my experi<lb/>ence, and I did not know how to act—I went to Field to ask him the name of a solicitor, and after that took criminal proceedings—the only sale effected since the arrangement was this to Messrs. Evans—the prisoner came daily at 9.30 or 10 in the morning, and left at 4.30 or 5 or 6—I think he went about and saw customers—I swear the prisoner did not tell me after two or three weeks that it would be utterly impossible for him to live under the terms of the agreement, as I was not doing any business—I have in my books "Received on account 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., J.B. Mann"—I took no security from him for those advances, it was not the custom; they were not on account of future profits—I swear the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. does not represent advances made by me to him on account of wages he claimed—I am not a debtor to Mr. Field; he was the creditor of the firm of a relative of mine, through which he got these skins; they were paid with that money—the prisonor came in the office about 12 or 1on the Saturday—before I went to Messrs. Evans I met him in the street, when I asked him to go to my solicitor—I had spoken to the prisoner once or twice before March—he came once or twice to inquire whether I had made np my mind to engage him—our cards had Mann and Co. printed on them by my direction, and I had Mann and Co. put on the door—the invoices were cancelled because I did not agree with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I advanced him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the first day, May 4—the sums were entered from time to time in the cash-book as advanced to him—Field and Co. were solicitors to Thereser Eaer and Co., and had advanced money to them on the security of the skins, which Messrs. Field after-wards entrusted to us to sell—I consulted with them as to the price at which they should be sold before I agreed with the prisoner—I had no agreement with them as to profit.</p>

I live at 27, Wentworth Street, Bell Lane—on Saturday evening, June 20th, I was in Wentworth Street, Spitalfields, and saw the prisoner going as fast as he could—Jacobs was running after him, pointing to him and calling "Stop thief"—I caught hold of him; he tried to strike me, but I held him too fast, and he had no power to get at me—he said "For God's sake let me go;" but they held him—he began crying.</p>

               <p>Islington—on 31st May, about 11.15 p.m., I was in Chapel Street with a young woman and saw the two prisoners and a man named Mason—they said, "There he goes"—I turned back, left the young woman, and the prisoners said, "We have just shot a fellow in Upper Street, and we have got a bullet left for you"—Mason had a knife up his arm, and he showed it to me in the prisoner's presence—I crossed over with the young woman towards a public-house, and the prisoners and Mason ran across the road to me, and one of them said, "What about the fight? you had nothing to do with it"—I said, "No, you may take my word for it"—on the following Wednesday or Thursday, June 3rd or 4th, about 4.30 p.m., I was at the corner of the Liverpool Road, and called the two prisoners over to me, and Brown said, "We are only waiting for you to get round a quiet turning, we mean to do for you"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "For coming down and paying our lads"—we walked to the Angel, and I showed Brown the account in the <hi rend="italic">Evening News</hi> of Page being shot in Upper Street—he said he should never have thought it, and we parted—one day in the next week the prisoners and another lad came up to me near the Angel—Brown had his hand under his coat, under which I saw the butt end of a pistol—he said, "I am told you are going to wring my neck"—I said, "If there is any disagreement between us, you and I can finish it without any one else," and we parted—on 21st June, between 6 and 6.30 p.m., I was in White Lion Street outside the house where I lodge; a boy shouted out, "Look out, here comes the <hi rend="italic">lay,</hi>" and the two prisoners came up—Brown said, "Where do we find <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> Reed?"—I said, "I don't know"—we went to the bottom of the court, and Brown accused me of fighting one of their lads on the Saturday before—about an hour afterwards I was in Chapel Street and Foxcroft came up with six others—one of them said, "What are we going to do, lads?"—another answered, "Do as we said," and one who I know by sight took a belt off and hit me across my right arm—there was a whistle, and Brown came running down with some more lads and struck my right eye with his fist, knocking my hat off—I ran to a coal shed to take refuge there, but found the door shut—I then went back and found I had been stabbed in my arm; I don't know who by, but Foxcroft was nearer to me than I am to that gentleman.

                  </hi>. I am manager of the house of Messrs. Sanguinetti and Panjaen, oil crushers, of Marseilles—I first saw the prisoner at my office on 15th June—the name given was Fedeler, Warburton, and Co.—about September last I received a letter from that firm, and subsequently I appointed them our agents for the sale of oil in this country, and in consequence of letters received from them I consigned to Thomas Harris and Sons a shipment by the Renfrewshire on 4th January, and on 12th January 12 casks to Thomas Harris and Sons—the endorsement is, "Deliver to the order of William Geddes, signed Thomas Harris and Sons, endorsed William Geddes"—on 14th February I consigned 20 casks of oil to Thomas Harris and Sons by the ship Hesperia—it is endorsed "Thomas Harris and Sons" and then "W. Geddes"—on 4th April I consigned 50 casks of oil per Nubia to Thomas Harris and Sons—that is endorsed "Thomas Harris and Sons, Wm. Geddes"—on 28th April I sent 50 casks per Comorin to Thomas Harris and Sons—about 14th February I received from Fedeler this bill of exchange for 2,432 francs 30 centimes—that fell due on 15th April, and it was met—beyond the amount of that bill we have not received payment for any consign<lb/>ment—I also received in course of post from Fedeler, Warburton, and Co. this bill of exchange. (<hi rend="italic">Dated 4th April, 1885, for 5,332 francs 5 cen<lb/>times, payable on 3rd June, drawn on Thomas Harris and Sons; of Glasgow accepted payable to Messrs.

               <p>would be in their name, and that the acceptance to the bills was theirs—I forwarded the bills of lading direct to the prisoner for the purpose of transmitting them to Thomas Harris and Sons—when I saw him at the office on 15th June I came over specially in consequence of his corre<lb/>spondence, and asked him how it was that Messrs. Harris after two months should ask for an allowance of 500 francs—he had written to me about that, and I said, "Why did you send us your bill for the 50 casks?"—the last 50 casks had been consigned to Harris and Sons—instead of sending our bill he sent us this promissory note of his own (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was very astonished at my being here, and he wanted to prove how it was he sent us his bill, and he showed me this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on account, of the 50 casks sent per Nubia—the net amount is 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I saw that account sale I perfectly saw how the thing was; I perfectly understood that Thomas Harris and Sons had never benefited by the merchandise, and I asked the prisoner how it was he had taken the merchandise and the money—he said, "I have had the money and have paid different debts of my own with it"—he begged me not to ruin him, and offered to give me some goods to diminish his debt—I said, "I cannot take goods if they are not really your property," and that I was convinced that the firm of Thomas Harris and Sons did not exist—I said, "Show me the letters wherein you have sent the bills of lading to Messrs. Harris and the drafts"—he was not able to show me any, he said they were at his house—we spoke German, French, and English together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am confidential clerk and manager to Mr. Borneman, the prosecutor—I have known both defendants since 1880—I recollect this agreement being prepared and executed. (<hi rend="italic">Dated 1st May,</hi> 1883.) I was at that time at Langenberg, where our factory is—from the beginning of our transactions up to the present time I have had the practical management of all the transactions between Mr. Borneman and Wilson and Eyre under my own personal supervision, and in July, 1883, I wrote to them about my coming to England, and received this reply (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>). (<hi rend="italic">Objecting to his coming at that time</hi>). I went to England a few days after that—that was the first time I had been here—I went to the office at Gresham Street and asked for the books—the defendants made many excuses; they said, "They are not here, they are at home," or "They are at the accountant's"—I asked for them numbers of times—I said, "There must be much more stock than I see on your premises"—he said, "No, we have accounted for everything"—I returned to Germany in August, and communicated to Mr. Borneman the result of my visit—I came back to London in October, 1883, went to the defendants' offices, and spoke about the books again, but with the same result as before; they made different excuses—I returned and examined our own books as to the consignments made to Wilson and Eyre while I was here—when I received what purported to be a copy of our consignment book</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188507270033"/>
               <p>I showed it to the defendants and asked them to check it and say whether that was all in stock—the younger Wilson promised to check it but did not do so—I asked them from day to day and from week to week, and so we got to the end of December, when they said they would take stock, but they did not do it—I asked during that period for an account of the sales they had made, and I got some accounts which I compared later on with the stock—I asked them if there were any more sold, and they said "No"—I asked them more than once, and sometimes young Wilson said, "I know there have been a few sales, but very few, I cannot find them in my books, I shall have to check the stock to find out"—I could not get any stock taken prior to 20th January, on which day I had a conversation with young Wilson, and he was taken over to Germany, I took him to Mr. Borneman—we had a long discussion about the whole business, and it was arranged that he should take the stock immediately on his return to England, but he never did so—he returned to London, leaving me behind, and I arranged with him to return in three or four weeks—I returned about the beginning of March, 1884, but before I returned I received this letter from young Wilson, I having written to him: "February 15th, 1884. To Mr. Borneman. Dear Sir,—Your system of reckoning qualities only creates confusion. You will describe every warp," &amp;c.—no stock was taken in March—I asked for the books again, and he said they were not made up yet—a stock book was made up in Germany, which is here—I requested him to take stock and check it, and he promised to do so—I brought over a list of all the goods—these bills which I had drawn against the consignments were current in February, and I had begun to find money to take up some of Wilson's and Eyre's acceptances; I had to do that in the subsequent months up to June—I was not able up to June to get any account of sales or stock taken—I first heard the name of Holtz in that year; he is the universal provider—I asked young Wilson who he was—he never told me that he had pawned any goods with Holtz—I first heard that he had done go about the end of June or beginning of July—about the end of June I took the stock of actual goods in the warehouse, and while doing so the elder Wilson came in and said "What is going on here?"—I said "I am taking stock; I am going to ascertain how Mr. Borneman's agency stands"—I had previously got possession of their sale-book and invoice book—I did that in June when I had a meeting with Mr. Borneman, and after I came back I wrote a letter to them, in consequence of which I got these books and went through every page—I then told young Wilson that there was a large deficiency, 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of sales unaccounted for, and therefore I was going to ascertain for myself how matters stood—he at first denied that there was any deficiency, but afterwards he admitted it, but said that the amount was exaggerated—he said that Mr. Borneman should not suffer any loss, and he was quite prepared to pay half the loss according to the agreement—I made out a list of the deficiency, and showed it to both of the defendants—on 4th July I took charge of the whole of Mr. Borneman's, stock which was at the warehouse—I had missed some goods, and they said, "Oh yes, I remember, there are some goods at Holtz's"—in consequence of that I gave this paper to young Wilson: "July 16th, 1884. Messrs. Wilson and Eyre. Not any piece of our satin is to leave these premises to go to Holtz (Signed) Foncheven"—on the back of that is written, in young Wilton's writing, "It is</p>

               <p>finished; I cannot struggle any longer; you have destroyed me and yourself"—on 4th July I put an end to the agreement—I said "You have not complied with the agreement in any point, so I do not consider myself bound by it, and I herein ask you to hand it over to me," and he handed it over at once—it was then that the elder Wilson came in—I was going to tell him the whole story, but young Wilson said "Don't you do so, I will tell my father all about it at night, but my mother is ill"—I examined all the books I could get hold of, and here and there some transactions with Holtz were entered—there were occasional entries in a memorandum book—I never authorised them to borrow money on our goods. (<hi rend="italic">A list of bills was here put in</hi>). On 16th July a bill for 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. fell due accepted by the defendants, and on the 7th August one for 226<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 12th August one for 436<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and a number of bills from that date to the last one of Thursday, October 3rd, amounting to over 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—all these bills have been dishonoured—I took them all up as they fell due on behalf of Mr. Borneman—at page 320 of the sale invoice book here is an entry, "15th January.

Four pieces of satin, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 15 1/2., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

George Briggs and Co's. after putting an end to the agreement—I did not find that after putting an end to the agreement on 4th July there were any goods of Mr. Borneman's at George Briggs and Co.'s—I missed a certain quanty of goods, and spoke to the younger Wilson—he said "There is nothing missing," and afterwards he said "Oh yes, I remember, there are some goods at Messrs. Brigg's"—I said "Show me the entries in tho books"—he said "I can't"—that was when I first</p>

               <p>ascertained that there were goods at Brigga's—he afterwards brought me a copy of the goods that were at Briggs's—I did not give him authority to take them away from Briggs and pawn them with Holtz—I have not seen them at Holtz's—I did not know that Wilson took them away and took them to Holtz after the cancelling of the agreement—neither of the defendants disputed that they were a portion of Mr. Borneman's goods—I can tell from the numbers in this memorandum book that the pieces which were seen at Holtz's were those which had been seen at Briggs and Co.'s—the first piece on Holtz's invoice is 30346, then '348, '343, '347, '344, 1135, 30349, '350, '351, '352, '353, '354, and 30074—that entry is on 15th July—they are entered as having gone to Abraham Holtz.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I came to England to ascertain the position of Wilson's business—I was suspicious that they did not account in full for the goods—I also came to improve my knowledge of the English language; I knew something about it when I came, but I had never been here before—young Wilson is supposed to be very deaf—I am capable of suggesting that he affects to be deaf when he is not—there have been dealings between Borneman and Wilson since 1881—this 381<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not due before the new agreement—when the agreement was entered into there was a balanoe of 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that stood over—that is quite a different account—all the accounts under this were consignment accounts—I knew of this agreement a few days or a week after it was entered into—there is nothing in it about keeping books of account—when I came over here I went to their place of business every day, and saw the business going on—I asked to see the books—I was not told that the books referring to their general business were not proper for me to see—I did not come over to find out the names of their customers; my desire was not to improve my knowledge of English and to set up in business and get the business of their firm—it was not my scheme with Borneman that I should learn English and set up here and get the defendant's customers—I am Mr. Borneman's cousin—I know enough of English to know that an acceptance at three months, and not drawn till two months, is a five months' credit—he did not cut off two months' credit; it is not a fact that instead of giving five months' credit Borneman cut him down to three, because the agreement was that we were to draw in one month; it says: "At the end of every successive period of two months the principal shall draw on the agent," and I am sure we have never drawn the 20 per cent.—no accounts were ever settled between us, we could not get him to do so—the goods were silks and satins, cheap ones and dear ones—they had to go through the English workman's hands, for which Mr. Borneman paid in the first instance; but there was a balance on the old account which we could not get, or we would dozens of times have settled it, and instead of that he paid the workmen—we paid 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for finishing the goods, and the old debt was wiped off—he did not pay from day to day what we required for finishing the goods—he did not complain that the silks and satins were of inferior quality, and not fit for the trade; on the contrary, he was very pleased and satisfied with them—I was in Court when George Pulley was called on my behalf—I have sent goods on many occasions to Sergeant to be finished, and Mr. Borneman paid for them—young Wilson complained that the goods were not up to the mark for the London market on account of the finish<lb/>ing, but there was no complaint about the goods, he was very pleased</p>

               <p>with them—he did not complain that he could not get the prices, but he said to me, "Here are all the goods sold, how could you sell them at that price?"—that was the beginning of July, 1884—he said "I know I have sold at too low a price, and will pay the difference, and will not charge commission"—he assisted me in going through the figures, and said "I know there is a deficiency, but I will transfer my fortune to Mr. Borne<lb/>man and will insure my life, and all I have shall be yours to wipe off Mr. Borneman's debt, only don't destroy me"—a bill of exchange for 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in July—that was paid on 19th July—that was the last bill honoured; there were several bills before that—on the following day I said "Give me that bill, I must have it in my possession, the bank is closed already"—I deny that over 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was received by Borneman—I did not carry 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods off the premises—I was present when Mr. Ditton, the solicitor, took away the books and the goods; the premises had been locked before that, and I had the keys from the end of June—I had attended there every day—I found another lock put on—I carried away the goods in a van with Mr. Dillon on 7th August—they were not invoiced as 6,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock—I don't know how much they realised—Mr. State took them off on 7th August—I asked Mr. Ditton to put the matter into the criminal court—he did not tell me that he had applied to the trustee and been refused—the trustee said he was quite willing to investigate it—I cannot tell whether the trustee refused to help me in a criminal prosecution—when talking about the agreement young Wilson said "Do not do so, I will tell him to-night when I go home"—the elder Wilson agreed to that—the younger one said that his mother was ill, and if he told his father his mother would see by his face that something disagreeable had happened, but I told the elder Wilson one or two days later on—I found in some instances that the prices returned to me have been higher than the prices at which the silks were made, and I told young Wilson so—he said "You must make out a damage account, and I will pay the difference"—in two cases the prices returned to me were higher than those which were realised—I do not remember young Wilson saying that part of the deficiency of goods could be accounted for by my taking the goods at £ <hi rend="italic">s.. d</hi>. instead of pieces, and yards—I did not suggest to him that he should get other manufacturers' goods, turn them into money, and keep Borneman perfectly safe—I do not know where the other part of this letter is; this is all I have got—I do not know who cut off the other part, it is addressed to Borneman, and I received it in this state—we sent 4,000 marks in support of the bills—he did not report sales till February—100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is mentioned in this letter, but it may be 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as something is torn away—this (<hi rend="italic">Another letter</hi>) is Mr. Borne<lb/>man's writing; I was, I think, present when he wrote it—he says in it "Take care we have not the slightest loss"—I did not suggest to Wilson that he should get goods from manufacturers in England, pledge them, and hand over the money to me—he said "I am not at all bankrupt, and I am going to prove it"—this is Mr. Borneman's writing, but Wilson's writing is on the back—by the agreement Wilson's were to bear the loss to the extent of one-third, and he offered to bear the loss to the extent of half—this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of goods and bills is in my writing; the bills have all been paid with the exception of what have been produced—the figures I have put down are true, but they are not quite complete; several consignments are omitted—I do not propose to say what the com-mission</p>

               <p>would be; I do not know from memory what it was—the current bills were 6,470<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can produce them; here they are—the goods taken away by State were not as much as the bills—I have got the goods—the bills drawn against the goods were not of equal value; there were 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods which there was nothing drawn against—the bills I produce are plus the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I mean to say that 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills were current and dishonoured after the bankruptcy, they began on 3rd August.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BEARD</hi>. I complained that the accounts returned of the goods sold by the Wilsons were not quite accurate—I say that they returned to Borneman lower sums than they sold the goods for—I only know one or two instances where they have sold at higher prices, but I have not had time to compare all the numbers—I do not know whether there are more than two—Wilson kept this invoice book; it is in my writing; all that is in it was dictated, to me by young Wilson because I happened to be there; he dictated the prices at which he had sold the goods—he was bound to return the prices he got, and he has not done so—he did not tell me that some of them were returned at his prices because ours had previously been returned at too much, but he said, "I will tell you, I got a halfpenny more"—the goods in Wilson's book at folio 438, and in Borneman's at 437, purport to be invoices of the same goods to Lloyd, Attree, and Co.—the prices are entered in Borneman's book in all instances, at something less—the total amount of the invoices in Wilson's book is 330<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the total amount of the return to Borneman is 341<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is not 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against themselves—it was on April 1st, and I agreed that business should be done at that price, and I sat down and he dictated it to me, and here it is in my writing, and I had it copied, but the invoices have been torn up—some time after<lb/>wards I got Wilson's copy book and saw the same invoices—I compared the numbers, and whether they were 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. it was different—here are several pieces which were not in Wilson's invoices that were already sold in 1884 to Messrs. Walton, and not to Lloyd and Attree—this one is completely false, I mean the one in my own writing in Borneman's copy book, which Wilson dictated to me—that invoice went to Borneman, and the true invoice went to Lloyd, Attree, and Co.—this is entirely a fancy invoice, but of course it went to Borneman's—bills were drawn on the consignment—here is an entry to Botherham and Co., 1,808 yards at 12 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and in my invoice book at folio 11 it is 13 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a penny higher—on page 24 here is an entry, 4,325 yards sold to Ryland at 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and in the corresponding entry in my book it is entered at 12 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., being a difference of 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was also against the Wilsons—there is a difference of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was here when the Chancery proceedings were taken—the ease went as far as an interlocutory injunction; it was to be set down for trial later on in the High Court of Justice—Mr. Andrews was afterwards brought into it as a defendant.

               <p>—there were different consignments—the list of goods left with Holtz is included in our consignments made in January, 1884—I have made out a list of the consingments—the bills did not represent so much as 80 per cent. on the consignments—no particulars are given; they were not drawn without respect to particulars are given; they were not drawn January 10th—the goods were sent in in May, June, and July—the bills were not appropriated specifically to any goods—the goods are told up to 2.849<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from January to June, 1883, and the acceptances from January to June came to the same amount—every one of these bills has been paid, but some of the bills for January, February, and March have been renewed several times—one is for 581<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am looking at my pocket-book, and there were two others, one for 339<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due April 27th, and another for 232<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on the same day—the bills are not on this account—there may be another—the others that I have been speaking of are subsequent; they are for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—the 381<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was renewed, and afterwards met—alll the bills on this account have been paid—all these goods may be entered now in a red book kept by Messrs.

I traced all Borneman's goods within one or two—I spent weeks over it—I had to apply for an order to get an entry in a book that was taken away by Mr. Ditton—very likely that was the reason of there being an irregular entry in the book—Wilson, junior, had to apply to the purchasers in order to get the details of the goods; having done that, every one of the pieces of Borneman's goods were accounted for except one or two—the entries were all regular in the day-</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered acountant, of Cheapside—in January, 1880, I was employed by the elder defendant to make up his accounts, and I have done so since then up to the failure—personally I used to go at irregular intervals, my clerk went onoe a week—I have made an investigation of the defendants' books with reference to this matter; they kept a cash book, a bought and sold ledger, a day-book, bill-book, invoice-book, and rough memorandum-books, and all the usual books—the elder prisoner took a very small part in the business; he attended at the warehouse every day when he was well, but he had no part in the selling of the goods to the best of my knowledge, or in the accounts; he very seldom drew cheques—he was away ill part of 1884—I believe he is about 70 years of age—young Wilson's duty was to sell goods, and to make proper entries of sales and so on—he had Brown and Pulley to assist him; part of the time there was a traveller or salesman</p>

               <p>named Batt for about six months—latterly he had only Brown, the ware-houseman, and Pulley, the traveller or salesman—I know that in the summer of 1884 young Wilson was very much harassed in his business engagements, caused by being short of money, want of capital—he had to go out very frequently to look for money; in consequence of that the books were not kept up so regularly as before—previously there had been nothing to complain of as to that—I find in the day-book, page 365, an entry headed May coming after the end of July; that is an entry made by a clerk in my office, why put there I can't say—when the books came to me to be made up there were some entries deficient, and I told the clerk to make them up, to copy them out of the rough books and make the books perfect—as far as I know no alterations have been made in the books since I made up the accounts—at page 351 there is an entry of Coates out of order; the entry immediately preceding it is 2nd May, this is the 23rd, and the one before that is the 31st—I know that young Wilson went to several customers to get accounts (I don't know whether he went to Coates), and in consequence of particulars received we made the entry here—at page 283 there are two entries of Thomas State and Co., dated 4th September, 1883; that is out of order, it comes after 29th September—there is an entry in the rough memorandum-book, at page 139, containing some of the same figures—I find an entry there of 4th September, and that was afterwards put in the day-book—in the cash-book I find an entry of 4th September of money received from Thoms and Co., 211<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount; that shows that cash paid and corresponds with the entry in the day-book of 217<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., although it is out of order—I have been through the cash-book; all the cash is accounted for—I have seen Mr. Andrews's account and tested it, it is absolutely correct as appears by the books and the pass-book—I have no knowledge of any goods missing which should have been accounted for——I have made up a debtor and creditor account between Borneman and Wilson in respect of their goods and acceptances, I have it before me—it shows the goods received and the amounts at which they were invoiced—I have debited Borneman with all Wilson's acceptances that have been paid—I have from time to time debited them with the cash paid on their account—amongst the sundry book debts there is 74<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is an item supplied to me by the trustee, there were four accounts which the Receiver collected—they were for Borneman's goods—if there had been no receiver Wilson would have received them—I have debited him with the goods and credited him with the amount received for them—the next item is "Stock removed by the Receiver, 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that item I took from the trustee's report—I debited Borneman with that amount, and on the other side I have credited him with all the goods reoeived—I debit him with commission at 5 per cent, on goods sold 1,191<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 2 1/2 discount—I took that from the trustee's account, and the same with the bad debts—I understood from the agree<lb/>ment that Borneman had to bear 10 per cent, as his proportion of the bad debts, 213<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are certain goods mentioned in the day-book and stock-book amounting to 378<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which I have not been able to find invoices—that was given me by the trustee—there are goods which he has traced the sale of, of which he had no invoices—the account generally shows 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the credit side—the account includes all the transac<lb/>tions between Borneman and Wilson, so far as I could gather from the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Towards the end of the period the books were badly kept—I complained to the younger defendant on several occasions, not to the elder, because he had nothing to do with the books—I simply said they were in arrear—I said a balance sheet should be made periodically—I could not make a balance-sheet, because the stock was not taken up—we could soon have got the books straight—I did not ask them to take stock, it was not my duty—the cash-book was written up from time to time—it was always kept written up—it was commenced on 1st July, 1884—it may have been completed after the bankruptcy proceedings commenced, but the first entries were not made then; they were made at the time—my clerk went in once a week and made them—some were made when I was called in by the Official Receiver, which was in September—the entries I made faithfully represent the facts—every entry was vouched by some evidence—I had to go to customers to find out when certain goods were sold to them—I applied to Foncheven, and he would not let me see the books.</p>

I am a surgeon, of Eagle Villa, Darnley Road, Hackney—on 15th June I was coming down the Hackney Road in an open frock coat, and wearing a gold watch and chain and an eyeglass—I was was walking on the pavement, not far from Shoreditch Church—I saw Leary standing across the pavement in front of me—I looked at him, and walked right up to him, and instantly he wrenched my chain off my watch, folded it in his haod, and ran off down Barnes Road—I ran after him calling "Stop thief!" and "Police!"—about halfway down the road Murphy intercepted me, and sent me into the road—he must have upset me with his foot—I did not feel him strike me—I found myself in the middle of the road semi-conscious with Murphy on me, and his hand in my watch pocket—he took out my watch and ran away—I was bleeding from my finger, and my side was injured—on Saturday, 21st June, I was taken to the police-station, and shown about 20 men, out of which I picked Leary—on 4th July I went to the yard of the police-court,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188507270047"/>
               <p>and from a number of men identified Murphy—I have not the slightest doubt about either of the prisoners—I am 69 years of age; the fall on my side bruised my hip—I have hardly recovered now—the bruise remained for a week or two—I did not take to my bed—the wound on my finger I attribute to the fall; it took two or three days healing.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 116, City Road, St. Luke's—on Friday, 12th June, about 11 p.m., the prisoner came in my shop for some tobacco—while wrapping it up he leant over the counter and snatched my watch; the chain broke, leaving a small portion, and the bolt behind—he ran out of the shop, I ran after him—three or four yards from the shop a person very much like Murphy, but who I could not swear to, tripped me up, and the prisoner got away—my watch was worth about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—subsequently I saw the prisoner at the station, and identified him after a little time; he was then shaven—when in my shop he had a slight moustache—I am sure he is the man.</p>

I had before—I cried "Police"—before I had time to get up he kicked me on my mouth and ran away—he did not seem drunk—I went up to a lady and gentleman whom I saw a little way off and complained to them—about 10 minutes after, as I and the gentleman were looking to see if we could find some of the money, the prisoner came back—I caught hold of his arm, and said "This is the man that has robbed me"—he then struck me before the lady and gentleman, and I gave him in charge.</p>

I am a clerk, and live at 8, Market Street, Islington—about 1.30 a.m. on 21st July I was in Copenhagen Street, my way home—I heard a female cry, and a few seconds after a man about the prisoner's stamp, ran past me followed by the prosecutrix, who came up to me and made a complaint—blood was coming from her mouth, andshe showed me a bruise on her face—at her request I went back with her to the spot where she had been knocked down, and with the light of a fusee found a shilling lying in the gutter—while looking for more the prisoner came up from the opposite direction to that in which he had run past me—the prosecutrix stepped towards him and said "That is the man that has robbed me"—he then raised both his hands and struck her about the lower part of her face or chin or high in the neck, and she fell—I stepped towards him and said "You hound, to strick a woman"—he put himself into a fighting attitude, and passed some remark which I could not distinctly hear, but which I took to be "You can have some if you want it"—I should say he was not drunk—he then walked backwards for a few yards, and turned and walked through Copenhagen Street—I raised the cry of "Police"—a constable appeared 20 or 30 yards off—I told him the prisoner had assaulted and robbed a woman, and she charged him with doing so—I accompanied all of them to the Upper Street Police-station.</p>

On 3rd July at half-past 10 a.m., in company with Dicker, I went to the coffee tavern—I found there had been a fire in the kitchen, a small fire in the bar-parlour, and the bed and bedding upstairs considerably burnt—I said to the prisoner "How were you awoke?"—he said "By a kind of suffocation and choking"—I said "Were any other persons in the house besides yourself?"—he said "Yes, a lodger, my wife and daughter; I left my room and called the lodger, I then wont into my wife's room, called my wife and daughter, and put my daughter out of the front window" (I saw the daughter, she was about 14 or 15); "I returned to the landing-window, and got out of the window into the yard"—the fire in the kitchen had no connection with that in the bar-parlour or bedroom—the kitchen ceiling was black with smoke—I said to the prisoner "There is evidence of three distinct fires, and I shall cause you to be taken to the station and detained until further inquiry is made"—he said "All right"—he was taken to the station, and about half-past 9 I went there and said to him "You will be charged with setting fire to the dwelling-house, 13, Pelly Road, and endangering the lives of persons therein"—he said "It is a false charge; I know nothing of how the house got alight"—I read the charge over to him, and he made the same reply—on 4th July at half-past 3 I went to the house again, and found there had been a small fire in the scullery in front of the copper-hole—it was pointed out to me—I think there was about nine inches of cement in front of the copper-hole, and the rest was boarded—there were burnt embers on both—I was shown a bottle containing paraffin on the top of the copper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were some small pieces of burnt paper and wood, by the copper, on the cement; the boarding was not charred—the fire in the bedroom was between the head of the bed and the bedstead; it appeared to have begun there, because it was more burnt there than anywhere else—I did not smell any paraffin on the bed—since the fire I have made inquiries in the neighbourhood as to the prisoner's character—I find that he owes 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he should have paid for fixtures and stock when he took the house two yean ago—I found nothing against his character, nos did I find that he was much in debt.</p>

I am Chief Superintendent of the West Ham Fire Brigade—I have had a good deal of experience in fires—on 3rd July, at 20 minutes to 9, I went to the Grafton Coffee Tavern—I made a complete examination of the whole house—I found there had been a fire in the kitchen under the dresser—the dresser was burnt, and, the fire had damaged the whole of the floor—the bed and bedding in the room marked "2" on the plan was burnt, but not the floor—in the bar-parlour there had been a fire in the corner on a shelf, some curtains that were hanging down there were burnt—on Monday my attention was drawn to a small fire at the copper-hole, but I thought nothing of that, that was very easily explained away—in my opinion the three fires were distinct—I should think the fire in the kitchen had been alight 20 minutes, that in the bar-parlour and bedroom not many minutes—there</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman cargo clerk in the service of the British India Steam Navigation Company, the owners of the Kangra and Westohall—the latter ship on 26th Jane was in the Royal Albert Docks between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—at that time we were taking in 14 cases from the barge Lead belonging to the Union Lighterage Company—the 14 cases came from the Condor from Ham<lb/>burg—I saw Pinder at that time in the hold of the Lead; he was bulky, in consequence of which I kept my eye on him—I saw him come out of the barge after she was discharged, and go on board the Westohall, the ship in which the 14 cases had been shipped for Brisbane—from that he went on the quay and then on board the Kangra, and from her on board the s.s. Navarino, and from her into the cabin of the barge Copper—Inspector Moyse came up then—I asked him to go to the Copper—Pinder came out of the cabin, ne went towards the Westohall again—I called to Hodder to follow him and let me know where he went—the barge Cochin was lying under the bows of the Westohall—when I saw him on board the Kangra I was close to him and could see in his left-hand jacket pocket what appeared to be small packets in brown paper—after speaking to Hodder I saw Moyse come from the Copper with Walshaw and Waller—afterwards I saw Hodder, and in consequence of what he said I went and looked after the Cochin with Moyse-—Pinder went with us up the dock to find the Cochin, he took us past it to the far end of the dock—we found it under the bows of the Westohall after some time—Moyse went into the cabin, he asked Pinder to unlock the cabin that he might go in—he refused for some time, saying he had other work to attend to—ultimately he did, but first he said "Mind, if there is anything found I know nothing about it"—only Moyse and Pinder went in the cabin, I stayed on the top—Moyse brought out some brown paper packets</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188507270076"/>
               <p>containing meerschaum pipes, some boxes containing amber stems, and some tobacco pouches in papers, and two bottles of brandy—I should think the brown paper packets containing the pipes were the same as I had seen in Finder's pocket—on the following morning I opened two cases, No. 224 and 231, part of the 14 from the Lead, on board the Westohall—the tin linings inside were out and they were not full, some of the coutents were similar to these articles—this is one of the pouches I took out, it is similar to the one found in the cabin—there were briar-root pipes, not meerschaum, in cardboard boxes in the cases—I knew the Copper had delivered to the Kangra 500 cases of brandy from the Era on the previous day, the 26th—I got the Customs officer to open one of the cases on board the Kangra on Saturday morning—the bottles of brandy in that were similar to the bottles found in the cabin—the men were charged in the ordinary way.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BROUN</hi>. About four men would be in the hold to unload the Copper of the brandy, I could not say exactly—during the time of discharging both barges would be accessible to a number of persons—Pinder was in authority over the other men, and it was his duty to look after them and go about from boat to boat—the Customs-House officials were about occasionally, not always—I did not see the clerks to the consignors, nor to the agents, about—the Customs' locks were on these things, I believe—I could safely say that what I saw in Pinder's pocket was not a pocket-book, but four or five parcels; it was an outside pocket and quite apparent to the eye when I got above him—I cannot say that Pinder has borne a very good character up to now; he has borne a fairly good one, I believe there has been something against him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> At one time he bore a very bad character—I have heard he was convicted in 1876 for unlawful possession.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">MOYSE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector to the London and St. Katherine's Dock</hi>). About 8 o'clock on the evening of 26th June, in consequence of what King said to me, I went on board the Copper, lying close to the Kangra—I went into the cabin, where I saw Waller and Walshaw—Waller was sitting on a cross-bench or looker, with this bottle of brandy with its neck broken, close to him; his right hand was over it as if he was endeavouring to conceal it—I searched Walshaw, and found this fall brandy bottle in the outside pocket of his jacket—I asked him where he got it from—Walshaw said he had found it, and was about to hand it to his foreman—Waller said nothing—I retained it—I left them, and went on the quay and met King, and ultimately Pinder, whom I asked to unlock the cabin hatch of the Cochin—he hesitated at first, and then did so—I requested him to go into the cabin with me—he refused at first and said, "Mind, if there is anything wrong I know nothing about it"—after some persuasion he went in with me—I searched and found behind one of the timbers these 10 new meerschaum cases and pipes, tobacco pouches, and two bottles of brandy, one full and unopened, and one partly full in a locker on the cross-bench—I detained him—he said nothing when I found the things—I had not seen the Copper when they were discharging the 500 cases.</p>

               <p>previously to my going on board the Copper, which was about five or ten minutes after King spoke to me—I could see the barge when King spoke to me, but cannot say if Waller and Walshaw were on it then—I know Walshaw only went on board just before I did—he is a lighterman's watchman—he told me he had only just been called to help the other man put on the hatches—I could not say whether as a watchman Walahaw would have anything to do with unloading barges—he would have to take care of the barges when the lighterman was not there—there is a Central Hotel close by used by those passing in that direction—I could not say where Waller came from just before he went on board—I could have got down the hatch if Waller had not sat down—his hand did not entirely conceal the bottle of brandy which it was over—both Waller and Walshaw were perfectly sober—Waller said nothing at all—he did not say before I found the bottle in Walshaw's pocket, "There is a bottle in Walshaw's pocket"—I asked Walshaw if he had anything about him—he made no reply—on turning round I felt something hard strike my right elbow, and then I searched and found it in his pocket—that was almost immediately after I asked him if he had anything on him—I was for eight or ten minutes in the cabin—Walshaw said he was going to take it to the foreman—the foreman has use of the Shipping Company's box on the quay—it would be a risky thing for a lighterman who found anything on board his barge, to take it to the foreman, because he would be liable to be stopped by the Company's police or by the Customs—he should communicate with the Customs' searchers or tide surveyor, or even the surveyor of Customs, who lives almost opposite where the ship was lying—the foreman lives about 100 yards off—it would depend on whether the thing was liable to duty as to whom it should be taken to; it would be safer to communicate with the surveyor—if stopped by the tide surveyor with one of these bottles he would have been charged with smuggling—I have known Waller and Walshaw for some time; I know nothing against them; they both bear good characters from what little I know of them—most of these cabin doors have padlocks on them—there were padlocks on the doors of the Copper—it was empty when I went in, I suppose the Customs had cleared it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When a ship comes in with 500 cases of brandy they would have to be passed through the Custom House, and then put on a barge to be taken to the outward bound vessel.</p>

I am a foreman in the employment of the Union Lighterage Company, who own the Copper, Lead, and Cochin, and in whose employ all the prisoners are—Pinder is a leading man to officiate in my absence—Walshaw is a watchman on board one of the barges, and Waller a lighterman, having charge of the Copper—Shaw was in our employment on 26th June, on which day they were all the persons who had anything to do with those barges—they were left in charge after I went—Waller had charge of the Copper, containing the 500 cases of brandy; Shaw had charge of the Lead, and Pinder had charge of the Cochin and other barges, and to see after water and different things—Waller had loaded the Copper the day before with brandy, and he had orders to remain on board until the brandy was all on the ship—it was part of the duty of them all to superintend the unloading.</p>

Pinder or I would get the receipt, and if we get it from the ship, the, lighterman has no notice that anything is wrong—sometimes men have meals on board, sometimes on shore—there is a stove for cooking on board—it is not usual to get their meal on board—most men go to the Central Hotel when standing down there—it is the usual custom for men to go ashoze when the barge is unloading—he has his orders to come and see me—it is not his duty to stay on board till some one takes him off—if the men find anything on board it is not usual, but advisable, for them to bring it to me, or other men on the quay—it would be very hard for them to be charged with smug<lb/>gling—it would do no harm for them to report it to the surveyor of customs—I know nothing against Waller and Walshaw—they are both constantly left in charge of valuable cargoes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and when on shore live at 16, Ford Street, Canning Town—on 16th June, between 4 and 5 p.m., I met the prisoners outside the Barking Road Distillery—I then had a watch, silver chain, an eyeglass, and silk pocket-handkerchief—they both asked me if I would treat them, I said yes—I took them in the Distillery and gave them three or four drinks at my expense—we were in the Distillery about three-quarters of an hour—I carry my money loose in my pocket, and</p>

               <p>took out coppers to pay for the drinks—when I left the distillery they followed me; we turned into Viotoria Dock Road—I went into the bar of Ralph's music hall, and the prisoners followed me, and I gave them a drink there, and had a drink myself—we were there 20 or 25 minutes—after we came out, Kelly asked me to go home and see her husband—we went into other public-houses; the Victoria Dock Tavern was the last—it was then almost dark—I knew what I was about, but after I left I cannot remember what happened, I was senseless—at 11 o'clock I picked myself up close to Kelly's door, 17, Charlotte Street, two or three minutes' walk from the Victoria Tavern—all my pockets had been stripped, my watch, Albert, and handkerchief were gone—I was almost naked, from everything—I had last seen my watch, chain, and handkerchief when I went into the Victoria Dock Tavern—this is my reading-glass, that was in my waistcoat pocket when I went into the tavern—I afterwards went to visit my people at Plymouth, and then came back to London—on 18th July I met Kelly in Victoria Dock Road, about 10 p.m.—I had been on the look-out for her—I tapped her on the shoulder, she said "How are you?" I said "I am very well, how is yourself?" she said "Nicely"—I said "I beg pardon, I want to speak to you for a moment; do you remember the evening you and me were together and the other person?"—she said "Yes"—I said "Did I go home to your house"—"Oh no," she said, "I left you at the Barking Road Distillery"—I said "You are telling a lie; I have been on the look out for you ever since; now I have got you, unless you can give me some information where my watch and chain is as I lost in yours and the other person's company, I shall detain you and give you in custody"—she called me a villain, scoundrel, and struck me in the free—she said nothing about the watch and chain, she said she would give me in charge—I gave her in custody on the charge of stealing the watch and chain—on the following Monday, when Kelly was being tried at West Ham Police-court, Hag<lb/>gerty was in the body of the ball—I pointed her out, and the Magistrate ordered her to be taken in custody—I have not seen my handkerchief since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Jones, and live at 7, Rutt's Terrace, Peckham—it is a six-roomed house; three rooms upstairs and three down—we occupy the three downstairs rooms—the front room upstairs was occupied by Waller, a tailor, and his family, and the other two rooms by the prisoner and his family, consisting of three daughters, two boys, and two infants—one of the daughters was the deceased, Emma Read—they had been lodgers there for about five months—on 22nd June, between 1 and 2 in the day, I saw Emma at the sink in my room, getting a pail of water—I spoke to her—she was then quite well to all appearance—after getting the water she went up to their room—Isabella, one of the sisters, was there at that time, and I thought also two of the boys and the prisoner—Louisa was out—about 4 o'clock that afternoon I was in my back parlour, which was immediately under the Reads' room—I could hear talking in their room—I recognised the voices of the prisoner and Emma—I heard a few words—I heard the prisoner accuse her of being with a Mr. Lee in the high road, late on Sunday night—I heard very high words between them, and swearing from the prisoner—this was going on about three-quarters of an hour—I then</p>

I am a porter, of 21, Creland Grove, Catford—on 29th June I saw the prisoners coming over a fence from Mr. Edwards's fields at Perry Hill, in a direction from St. George's Villas—Mr. Edwards came out and called them back, and I opened the gate and let them out—I am sure they are the men.</p>

People often use the field as a short cut, and Mr. Edwards does not like it—I sometimes tell them that it is no thoroughfare—the two men were quite strangers to me; one was dressed in a lightish suit, and when I was called to look at a number of men two of them had light suits on—Lester was not one of them; he is dressed now as he was when I picked him out at the station from four others—I was asked to pick out two of them—I did not take notice of the other two, I was so certain directly I saw a light coat.</p>

(They are not known at those addresses.) I followed them about 200 yards down Camberwell Road, called on William Christmas, who I met to assist me, and seized the prisoners and took them to the station—I then went back to the Glebe, and found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a ditch—I showed it to the inspector, and Lester said "Your informant put that there, or you did it yourself" and Parker made a similar remark—they were charged with loitering, having housebreaking implements in their possession. <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK AYMER</hi>. I live at 5, Aymer's Cottages, Priory Hill, Catford, and am a builder—on 29th June I was at 1 and 2, St. George's Villas, and saw the two prisoners sitting on a stile or three-railed fence between 30 and 40 yards from the prosecutor's house—I went up to my first yard, and then to my second yard—I looked round, and saw the two men cross the road towards Mr. Bishop's house and go in at the gateway, or it may have been next door, because there is only one gateway with a rail between the two houses—I then went into my place of business, and when I came out at 5.30 I saw some people gathered outside Mr. Bishop's gate—I went there and tried to get in—the place had been broken into—I tried to get in at the front door, but could not, and jumped over the side fence—I saw the back door open; I waited some time before I went in; Mrs. Bishop then came round, and I went in with her and several others—I identified the two prisoners at the police-station—I first picked out Parker, and then I said another man resembled him, but when I saw him I had not the slightest doubt about him—I identified Lester.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I only saw the two men on the 29th for a few seconds, they were absolute strangers, I had never seen them before, I was taken to Lambeth Police-court to identify them on the same day—I was shown eight or nine men in the passage, and I went up to Mr. Stacey and said "You resemble him, but you have got much thinner," I did not say</p>
