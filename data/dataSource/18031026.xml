               <p>LAZARUS LEVI sworn. - I am an apprentice to Mr. Jacobs; I generally put the shoes out in a morning, and take them in of an evening: On the 6th of October I put out six pair of new shoes; when I took them in in the evening there were only five pair; when my master came home I told him of it; he was standing at the door very uneasy, and saw the little one, Connell, about the door; he was alone; my master brought him in doors, and asked him if he knew any thing about the shoes; he was very obstinate, and would not tell till a good bit; my master then went out to see if he could find any other boy, and left Connell with me; while I was putting up the half hatch he ran out; I ran after him, and caught him, and just as I was bringing him into the shop, my master came back again; Connell still said he knew nothing of them; my master offered him two shillings to tell where they were, and then he shewed the other boy to my master, but I was not present then; my master came home with the shoes; I knew them immediately; my master and me made them together.</p>
               <p>Q.What has become of them? - A.I sold them, and my master made a great noise at me for selling them; I did not know they were to be kept; I knew them by my own work, and by the stamps.</p>
               <p>Jacobs. I saw Connell near my own door, and laid hold of him; I asked him what he wanted, and he asked me if I had an old pair of shoes to give him; I told him, no; I asked him, have not you stole a pair of shoes from this window; says I, I am sure you have; I was a long time before I could get him to tell me any thing about them; I offered him two shillings if he would tell me, and I then went about Covent-garden with him for two hours; at last he said, he dare say the other had pawned them at Dirty Dick's, in St. Giles's; just before we came to Dirty Dick's I saw Groves; Connell immediately said, that is him; I immediately laid hold of him, and took the shoes from his bosom; he tossed himself on the ground, and began crying; I took Groves to Bow-street, and the little one followed; I knew the shoes to be mine; I took them home, and put them upon the shelf; I did not know that I was to keep them separate; I knew them perfectly well, and swore to them.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure you had never delivered them to her to be bound, or for any other purpose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>PHILIP GREEN sworn. - I am a constable; I had been to the prisoner's lodgings before Mr. Pedder, and found the property; Mrs. Pedder was with me. - (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH PEDDER sworn. - I went with the constable to the prisoner's lodgings; I went up stairs, and found three bonnets and some caps, I cannot say how many, and a man's hat, laying upon the table, and two more in a ban-box; they had our shop marks upon them; I knew them to be my husband's property, I can swear to the marks; I cannot say when they were taken; we never sell hats in this state; I cannot swear that the men's hats had not been put out; there are six children's hats that never were put out; when I found them I sent for my husband.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the value of them? - A.About 2l.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are not worth so much, my Lord; they are my property; some of them I had not had in from the country above three weeks; the prisoner used to come two or three times a day to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you use to deposit them? - A. They used to lie open on the counter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that she had received the hats from the prosecutor's shopman, who was his brother-in-law; that she bought one of them; that he gave her the children's hats, telling her they were old shopkeepers; that she had the others to line and bind, as would appear from the book in which the shopman entered every thing, and which she had to produce.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Pedder.) Where is your shopman now? - A. He is gone for a soldier; he enlisted into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260012"/>first regiment of Surrey militia, and is now at camp near Ashford, in Kent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you part with him for any dishonesty? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the children's hats old shopkeepers? - A. No, some of them had not been in three weeks.(The prisoner produced a book.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is an entry in the book of a child's white had lined.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Pedder.) Then you see the prisoner had had one child's white hat to line? - A. It appears so from this entry; it is a book that she herself keeps, and upon the return of the goods they are entered in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these hats might have been delivered to her, and there would be no entry of them in the book, because they have not found their way back again? - A. They were not put out with my knowledge. <rs id="t18031026-22-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>JOHN HARRISON sworn. - I am a surveyor and builder, in Berkeley-square: On Friday evening, the 21st of this month, a person of the name of Ellis gave me some information.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ELLIS sworn. - I am a constable: On the 21st of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was at the bottom of Essex-street, Strand, under the arch-way, I saw the prisoner come out of the house of Mr. Plowden, he had a parcel wrapped up in a dirty sheet of white paper; I had a suspicion, and followed him to an old iron shop in Shire-lane, he was there about two or three minutes before I followed him in; when I went in, I saw the lead in the scale, which is here to be produced; I asked him what he had got there, he first said, it was his own property, and at the watch-house, he said, it was the property of General 
               <persName id="t18031026-30-person233">Bulkeley</persName>
            ; I searched him, and found in his pocket a key that opened Mr. Plowden's door; I then went to General

            's, and from thence to Mr. Harrison's, whom I found to be the prisoner's master; the lead does not match to any thing; the prisoner slept in the house, it was repairing, and the key was the proper key of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harrison. Mr. Plowden's house belongs to General Bulkeley, his name is Felix, he is the landlord of it; I don't know that the lead belongs to General Bulkeley; the prisoner has worked for me four or five years, I always found him very honest.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ASKEW sworn. - I am foreman to Mr. Harrison; I know there was lead on the premises, but I know nothing of this lead, I did not miss any.</p>

               <p> - BARBER sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Corby, pawnbroker, Green-street, Leicester-square: On the 6th of September, the prisoner at the bar bought some cotton handkerchiefs, and I exchanged a twenty-five pound note for her; I have not the least doubt of her being the person; she gave me the name of Griffiths, which I put upon the note; it was in the middle of the day.</p>

               <p>Barber. This is the same note; it has upon it, in my writing, Griffiths, No. 17, York-buildings, 6th of the ninth month.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Olave Aycott.) Is that the note? - A. I cannot say; I did not take notice of the number.</p>

Through fear and shame, I absconded for a fortnight; I then went home to my mother's, and was concealed there till I was apprehended; Mr. Wright came in a blustering manner, and said if my friends had come forward, he would have taken it at half-a-crown a week.(For the Prisoner.)</p>

I met with this woman and another near Wellclose-square; I went with them to the Crooked Billet to have a pint of beer; I could not pay for it without changing half a guinea; I missed the half guinea out of my-pocket; I stooped down to look for it; Mr. Brown came up, and took a bundle out of this other woman's hand; he asked me if I knew any thing about it; I told him I did not; he took the other girl up stairs, and made her intoxicated, and told her, if she did not say what he bid her, she would be hanged.</p>
               <p>Clavering's defence. I went with this young woman to have a pint of beer; she missed a half guinea; I saw this bundle on a porter's knot in the corner; I went to lay hold of it, and Brown took it from me; he took me up into a garret, and gave me beer and gin, and made me intoxicated; he said, if I did not speak the truth, I should be hanged; he bid me say this woman had it; she is as innocent as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Brown. There was a porter's knot in the window, but no bundle.</p>

             sworn. - I am a cellar-man: I employed the prisoner, on the 24th of this month, to help me bottle a pipe of wine; I was obliged to go out, and when I returned, I thought he was rather in liquor and incapable of packing; I desired he would go, and leave packing, left there should be any misfortune in breaking them; when he went away, I thought I heard the rattling of a bottle; I went after him, and saw him with a bottle on the stairs, which I took from him; the bottles were placed nine in a row, and I missed one row.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This man discharged me, saying I was in liquor; I had a bottle of wine in my hand at the time, and he took it from me.</p>

             sworn. - Q.State what you know of the robbery? - A. On the 28th of September, I got up about five minutes after five o'clock in the morning, and found my bar had been broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your dwelling-house? - A. Yes; there are two hatches to the bar, one above that locks, and a lower one which bolts on the inside, and which I found unbolted, as if somebody had come out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was bolted when you went to bed? - A. I am certain of it; I had locked it the last thing before I went to bed; I had been robbed a little while before, which made me very particular in looking round the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to-bed? - A.About eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you miss? - A.In looking round, for I took every thing of value out before I went to bed, I saw two sixpences lay at the corner of a small shelf, but do not know them again; at the further end of the shelf, I saw a quantity of bad halfpence and farthings, but I did not think them of any consequence, and left them there; there was a small napkin also, which I took up in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260025"/>hand and threw over some butter in a small room behind the bar, left the cat should get in; I cannot swear to it, only from its general appearance; in the morning I missed the things I have stated.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find your house as to the fastenings? - A. I saw a stool placed under the bar-window.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the bar? - A.In the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a stool necessary for the purpose of approaching the window? - A. Yes; the bar-window was a sash which drew to and fro; it had not been broke open, but was drawn back, as I had forgot to fasten it; the stool had been taken out of the bar too.</p>
               <p>Q.The stool was inside the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.How could it be used to get into the house? - A.Not to get into the house, but to get into the bar window.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any part of the house broke? - A. The pannel of the back door was broke; I had fastened it myself the night before, when it was quite entire, and not broke at all.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it dark when you fastened it? - A. I fastened it a few minutes before I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the whole you missed? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing else broke? - A. It was necessary, after he broke the back door, to come through the tap-room, where there is another door, the line of which was out which pulled the door to, which I had fastened round a staple.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you see any of these things again? - A. They were produced before the magistrates; I cannot swear to the cloth, but my daughter can.</p>

I did; on Wednesday, the 28th of September, about eleven o'clock in the morning, at No. 5, Court-street, Whitechapel, and in his room I found a napkin, which I carried to Mr. Chaney's, and his daughter knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that which you shewed her was the identical napkin you found in his lodgings? - A. Yes; I asked the description of the man who lodged there, and having got it, I went to a place called the Broad-place, near Petticoat-lane, where I took the prisoner, about twelve o'clock; he was pointed out to me by a little lad; I searched him, and in his pockets I found three sixpences, two good and one bad, and some halfpence and farthings.

               <p>- HARRISON sworn. - On the 24th of September I was standing at the public-house door, at about a quarter past seven o'clock; Mitchell and I went up the street to Barrett's house, and I saw Palmer standing opposite to Barrett's, and Bentley at No. 3; I knocked twice at Barrett's door, and a man jumped out at the window; in jumping out, he cried, Halloa! halloa! what is the matter? I said I would let him know, and made a snatch at him, and instantly got him on the ground; Palmer and Bentley then came up, and rescued him from me; I halloaed out stop thief, and they repeated it; Mitchell caught hold of Palmer, and I proceeded after the others, but could not take them; I cannot say who the man was that jumped out, because, as he lay upon the ground, and I had hold of him, they rushed in; I can swear Bentley was the man that was standing there, and helped to rescue the other.

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes, I have seen him many times, as I used the house; I had seen him that morning, about an hour before, in the tap-room, with a bundle under his arm, which he left in the house; he had something to drink, and as he went out of the back door, he said to the landlord, put it up; I apprehended the prisoner soon after, who immediately said, Lord have mercy upon me! have mercy on me! I had only told him he was my prisoner; I then took him to the Black Horse, and shewed him the bundle; he said it was his first offence, and hoped his master would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did he not mean, put the reckoning up to him as a score, and not the bundle? - A. I don't know; for my part, I thought he meant, put the bundle up; he went out at the door in a great hurry.</p>

             sworn. - I was cashier to Sir Richard-Carr Glynn and Co. On the 3d of September, on that day, I found a deficiency of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260030"/>50l. I traced it, by checking over all the check articles of the day entered, and all the 50l. notes, and found one deficient; we then copied down the number of every note of 50l. that came into the house on Thursday and Friday, to check them against every note we had paid away, and discovered one note of 50l. had come in twice, without being paid away at all, No. 9140, to the best of my recollection, which created suspicion, and I examined who had paid them in, and found it was entered in the prisoner's collection first, and then in Mr. Allen's; the entry is No. 9140, on the 23d of August; Mr. Allen is a collecting clerk; these are Goldsmith's books; on the 3d of September, there is no such note for 50l. No. 8881, in our book; I carefully examined the books, to see whether there was, or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do all the collecting clerks come back at the same time? - A. No, there was a difference of about three quarters of an hour; in point of order, O'Hara's account was first entered; I sent for Mr. Parry, and there it rested till Monday morning, when Mr. Hallifax was informed of it, and there it rested again till three o'clock on Tuesday, when an anonymous letter was brought in by Mr. O'Hara, addressed to the head cashier of the house of Sir Richard-Carr Glynn, inclosing a 50l. Bank of England note; I gave them both to Mr. Halifax, after putting my mark on them, (a letter and note shewn to the witness); these are the same; the note is No. 9550, dated 24th August, 1803.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you offer to buy the mare of him? - A. Yes, I asked him if he would sell it; he said he would; I asked him what price he would have for it; he said, eleven pounds; I told him I was not a judge of it, that I would give him five pounds for it; he then said, if I would give him six pounds, I should have it; I told him, if he would take the horse into the yard, I dared to say he and I should make a deal, which he did; I asked him to go to a public-house, and have something to drink; he said he would have some beer; I said, what do you mean to say about the mare; he said, if you will give me half-a-guinea more, you shall have it; that was half-a-guinea more than the five pounds; I told him I thought he had not come honestly by it, and I should take him, and the mare too, which I did, and sent for Maynard, the constable, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Q.While the mare was in your custody, did you shew her to Mr. How? - A. Not that I know of.</p>

               <p> - COLLIER sworn - I am a brush-maker, in Hughes's-buildings, Kent-road: On the 5th of October, I was looking for Edwards on Londonbridge, about a quarter before seven in the morning; I don't know what he is; I saw him with an empty basket, and I followed him to the King's-head, in King's-head-court, Fish-street-hill, where Jones soon after went in, with the neck of a bottle out of one pocket sealed with red wax; he came out again presently, and Edwards came out with the basket apparently full; Jones's pockets seemed empty; Mr. Emmett and I followed Edwards to the bridge, and stopped him; Mr. Emmett took the basket from him, and gave it to me, with three bottles of oil in it, and took one bottle out of his right hand coat pocket, and I took a pint bottle out of the left; they were marked Gordon and Emmett, Harvey's Sauce, and red wax; Edwards said, they were not Mr. Emmett's property; before the Lord-Mayor he said he bought them of a mate of ship, and gave fifteen shillings for them, near Billingsgate; Jones at first denied it, but the second day he owned he took it from his master, and gave it to Edwards, at the King's-head, in King's-headcourt.</p>

            : On the 5th of October, in consequence of information, I hid myself in a house opposite, which had a view of our warehouse and down the court; I saw the prisoner, Jones, ring at the warehouse-bell about ten minutes before seven, in a great coat, with the pockets flat to his side; he went in, and remained three or four minutes in the warehouse; he came our, his pockets sticking out, and went into the court, took down three shutters, and went into the King's-head, where he remained a short time, and came out and finished opening the warehouse; he was in about a minute, when Collier informed me Edwards was gone over the bridge; we followed him, and took him with the property. (The bottles produced.) I missed some oil; Jones was our porter, and had no power to sell any articles; the sauce is made for exportation; we don't sell retail, only wholesale.</p>
               <p>Jones's defence. My confessing was by the promise of the constable that I should be liberated.</p>

Yes; I came up stairs from the kitchen, and attempted to unlock the parlour-door, but could not; I gave the door a pull towards me, and it pulled open; I saw two men, the prisoner and another, and was inclined to shut the door again on seeing them, but they rushed out upon me, and knocked me down.

A bundle was found when I returned from the watch-house in the parlour, packed up in a blue apron,(produces it); I know all it contains to be mine, they had been removed from the shop into the parlour; all are here but a pair of small-clothes, which I let a customer have who was going out of town; the cloth is worth twenty-six shillings.</p>

I think they must have got in by a pick-lock key, I did not see any mark of violence at all; a pair of shoes and a hat were left in the parlour, which the prisoner owned to be his, he would not own the blue apron; he was without hat or shoes when he was taken to the watch-house; the things in the bundle are worth more than five pounds.</p>

Hoares, bankers, in Fleet-street; the prisoner was with us as clerk without any salary, and is a foreigner; I gave the bill to him to take out for acceptance, and did not enquire for it next day; but in three or four days after, looking over my bills, I found this missing, and asked him if he had not called for it; he said, he had, and he had put it on my desk; I searched, but could not find it, and let some time elapse before I made further enquiry; near the time it became due, I sent to Hoare's to stop payment, and went myself the day after it became due, and found it had not appeared; I wrote to my correspondents, and applied again to Messrs. Hoares, but did not get payment of the bill; sometime after, Mr. Pearce came to town; I sent a clerk again to Messrs. Hoares, but did not get the money; at the beginning of August I sent again, and found the bill was paid; I went myself to Messrs.

               <p>Q. You know of the remuneration given to persons for the detection of sheep-stealers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you expect if this man should be convicted? - A. I don't know what to expect.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you not expect fifty pounds, and do you not wish for it? - A. I do not wish for any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation of life are you in? - A. I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q.Fifty pounds is no object to you? - A. Yes, fifty pence is an object, but not in a clandestine way; if the man is convicted by the real truth, I wish to have it; the prisoner said, he had been led into this, and he would be d-d if he would do a good-natured action any more; then he offered me five shillings if I would give up the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you where he lived? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, have you never said to any body that you believed in your conscience the prisoner was an innocent man? - A. I did say something to Dean that I thought there were more concerned as well as this man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not say to Dean, or any body else, that you believed the prisoner at the bar was an innocent man? - A. Yes, I did say I believed the man was led into it.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, did you or not say you believed he was innocent? - A. I have told you as near as I can recollect what I did say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you seen any other person with him? - A. At the time I saw him upon the hill there were two or three men following him up the hill, but I did not see them interfere with the sheep, or driving them.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: I received information that there were some sheep astray upon Clerkenwell-green; I went to look for them, but could not find them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Martin? - A. Yes; I will not be sure whether it was on the Tuesday or Wednesday after the first examination at Hatton-garden; after coming from duty, at six o'clock in the morning, the superintendant of the night, and me, and Martin, were going down Benjamin-street, Martin said to us, will you go and have any gin? I rather equivocated, and said, I did not wish to have any gin; he then said to me, I am a d-d fool; I said, for why; says he, when the man asked me to go along with him to help turn the sheep, I might have napped the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the construction of the word napping? - A.Taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, he might as well have had a reward of one hundred and fifty pounds as fifty? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Where does she live? - A.Somewhere in Bell-yard, by Temple-bar.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Marybone-lane, about thirty or forty yards from the prisoner, Smith's, on the opposite side of the way: On Tuesday, the 18th of October, I saw the prisoner, Bennett, go into Smith's house, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the morning, with a bag of feathers; he gave it to Mrs. Smith, and she put it on the stairs; I heard her say, I expected you would have brought them before. On Thursday, the 20th, I saw him again, about ten minutes past eight o'clock in the morning; he had on a brown great coat, buttoned up; I had a suspicion of him, and watched him; he went in very quick; he came out again in about ten minutes, with his clothes unbuttoned, both coat and waistcoat, and an apron loose; I followed him into Oxford-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260041"/>street, and there I lost sight of him; I came back past Mrs. Smith's door, and saw her opening some check; in about ten minutes after, Mrs. Smith's little girl brought some cotton and some check to my house for sale, but I sent them back, having first measured the check; I did not measure the calico; I afterwards gave information to Messrs. Foxhall and Frver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. A cabinet maker and joiner, and fell brokery goods.</p>

               <p>ANN WILSON sworn. - I live next door to Mrs. Smith; I have seen the prisoner, Bennett, go into Mrs. Smith's almost every morning for three months; the most that I have seen visible was horsehair; about a fortnight ago, I saw him carry in a carpet; at other times I have seen him carry in nails, and small pieces of bed furniture; I have seen him go in four or five times a day frequently; I gave information of it to Mr. Fryer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What shop do you keep? - A.- A. I sell tobacco, snuff, and old clothes.</p>
               <p>Stevenson. Mrs. Smith's little girl took back the check; I sent for it the next morning, and Pettifer had it from my house; it was cut so that it was very visible it came off the same piece.</p>
               <p>EDWARD PETTIFER sworn. - I received a piece of check from Mr. Stevenson; I took it home, and matched it with some check in the warehouse; I found it had been cut off that piece; I then returned it back to Stevenson, and then took it to Mrs. Smith's; I told her I was the person who wanted to buy that check; she said she could not take less than four shillings, and I gave her four shillings for it.</p>

On Saturday, the last day of July, I saw the prisoner, Shevill, there; he appeared to be buying cloth; he sat down by a sample of wool, which my brother had brought there; he asked me if I would sell the lot of wool; I told him I should be glad to sell it; he put some in his pocket, but no agreement was entered into at that time; he said, he should pay with ready money, or bills as good as ready money. On the Monday following, I went to Wotton-under-Edge, and saw him there with a Mr. Gardiner; Mr. Antill was with me; he told him I was ready to sell him the wool; we there agreed for the price; it was to be about twenty-pence farthing a pound, the stone is about fifteen pounds and a half; he was to have all the wool that I had at Gloucester at that price; it was in twenty-nine packages, in the possession of one Mr. Lewis, till Friday morning; Shevill told me he was an agent for five houses in London; he told me he was to have an hundred pounds a year from one, and a guinea a week from another, and a guinea a day for every day that he went out; he said he should draw bills upon the house of Felton Hutchinson, Esq. in Suffolk-lane, Cannon-street; he said, when the peace came, he took a coach and four, and went to Deyonshire to buy fish, and that that journey cleared him between two and three thousand pounds for one of his houses; he said, Mr. Hutchinson was a merchant to send goods to America; he said, he was able enough to pay these bills, when they became due, if all the shillings were guineas; I was paid in bills on the 4th of August.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at those bills? - A. I received these bills from Shevill; they were drawn in my presence; they are eight pounds short of the price of the goods, and there was five pounds besides for the packages; my brother received the thirteen pounds in Bank of England bills, that made up the whole amount; he said, he should have the wool worked up into cloth in Chalford-Bottom; Mr. Gardiner was to work it up; the wool was to lie in the warehouse till I was satisfied of the goodness of the bills; I remained there till Friday morning; I gave an order to Mr. Lewis to deliver the goods the same day that I received the bills; Mr. Shevill made application for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Corrick before? - A. Not till latterly. I returned on the Tuesday following, in consequence of a letter I received from Mr. Lewis, and found that the wool was gone; I came up to London on Thursday morning; I went first to the Bell, in Warwick-lane, and found seventeen packages; I went to the Swan, Holborn-bridge, four or five days afterwards, and found twelve packages more; I saw Shevill the very day I came to town; I saw him at the Bell, in Warwick-lane, in the yard, with the prisoner, Corrock; I told the book-keeper not to deliver the wool; there was another man with them, who said, he was a lawyer, and he would have the wool, and offered to pay the carriage; I said, it should not be delivered till the bills were paid; I told Shevill I did not think they were worth any thing; when I came to London, they told me the man they were drawn upon was not sufficient; Shevill asked me if I should like to see the man, and we made an appointment to go to the Swan, at Holborn-bridge, that evening; I went, and saw Corrock, and two or three others, the lawyer was one of them; he said, they wanted fifty pounds, and they would give up the goods; he said, that was for his trouble and expence in the country; I saw Corrock several times afterwards, and had conversation with him; he said, he had come to make up the matter between me and Mr. Shevill; I did not like to speak to him much; he wanted twenty-five pounds for Shevill's expences in the country, and I was to have the wool back, which was worth about five hundred and sixty pounds, but I would not pay it; I did not see Shevill again till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Shevill write the drafts - look at these letters, and say whether you believe them to be his writing? - A. To the best of my belief, they are his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley, (Counsel for Shevill.)</p>
               <p>Q.Shevill was introduced to you by a friend of your own? - A. Mr. Gardiner and Mr. Antill introduced me to him.</p>
               <p>Q. They had been dealing with you before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no immediate adjustment of the contract? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went twenty or thirty miles after him for the purpose of inducing him to buy this wool, which he had resused to buy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At Wotton-under-Edge, he told you he should pay you by bills upon London? - A. Yes, or ready money; the bills were drawn at Gloucester, and I received them on the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. That afforded you an opportunity of sending to London to enquire after the person on whom the bills were drawn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you remember making a further demand for the packages? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did he not then desire to break off the bargain, and say he would not give any more than he had bargained for; and, if you would return him the bills, you should have the goods? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed, (Counsel for Corrock.) Q. You never heard of, or saw the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260043"/>soner, Corrock, till you came to the Swan? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was the lawyer who wanted you to repay him a sum of money? - A. Yes, a man who said he was a lawyer.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEWIS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.You are a wharfinger, at Gloucester? - A. Yes. The latter end of July last I received thirtyfour packages of wool, addressed Thomas and Peter Jarman; they were to remain with me till further order: On the 3d of August, Mr. Shevill came to inspect the wool, and had it weighed; Mr. Jarman was with him, myself, and my porter, and Mr. Antill; I afterwards saw Mr. Jarman and Mr. Shevill at my warehouse; Mr. Jarman afterwards shewed me the bills; I expressed a doubt whether they were good or not, and advised him to take one of them to Turner and Co's banking-house, and get it sent up. After Mr. Jarman had left town, Mr. Shevill came to me, and produced me an order for the wool; Mr. Shevill went away; he returned again, and said, he had seen a gentleman to whom he had sold the wool, and he gave orders respecting it; in consequence, he gave me an order to direct it to No. 4, Suffolk-lane, Cannon-street; he wanted me to return the first order.(The orders read:)</p>

               <p>Lewis. On the evening of the 4th of August, Mr. Shevill asked me the best mode of conveyance from Gloucester to London; I told him the cheapest was by water, but he said that would be too tedious; upon turning his eye, he saw a waggon in my yard; I told him it was going to London, and I could forward part of it with that waggon, and the remainde the next day, and he said that would do; I accordingly sent twelve packs that night; they were not directed; I gave the waggoner a way-bill where to deliver them, at No. 4, Suffolk-lane, at the same time giving him a caution that waggon went to the Swan Inn, Holborn-bridge; I wrote a letter the same evening to Mr. Jarman, to inform him of it; the next day I sent seventeen packages by a waggon that goes to the Bell Inn, Warwick-lane; Mr. Jarman came the Tuesday following, and I went with him to the Bank to see if the bill was returned, and we found it there.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the way-bill that arrived with the waggon? - A. Yes; Shevill came before the wool arrived, with two or three other persons, but I am not sure that Corrock was present on that day; Shevill enquired for Mr. Jarman, and saw him; I saw Corrock on the day the wool arrived, and a person who called himself an attorney; Jarman said he would not have the wool delivered till he was satisfied of the value of the bills; Shevill offered to deliver up the wool if he would return him the money back he had paid Mr. Austin, and fifty pounds; I believe Corrock was not present then; Corrock came the Monday after, to know what was to be done about the wool, and Jarman said the same as before; Corrock said he would come with Shevill next day, but did not; Shevill was to have come on several days to settle it, but never came after the first time.</p>

               <p>"Yours of Monday night's mail came duly to hand, and you will please to inform my friend Binford that I have bought to the amount of nearly 5000l. but they cannot possibly be got ready in less than three weeks, none of the manufacturers having any on hand finished; those are agreed to be paid for by bills on Hutchinson, or Gover and Co. Nothing whatever can be done here with C.'s bills, and I assure you it is almost (at some places that Sedley took me to), impossible with Abraham Newlands' to do business; the people at Chalford, &amp;c. have been, they say, completely swindled by a person of the name of Hayes, &amp;c. and how any man could be so foolish to take me to such a place I am lost to know; however, if I have my health, much business may and shall be done, if it is properly conducted at the office, and I supplied for expences, which I am now without. I go this morning for Gloucester, to meet a manufacturer, who has a large parcel of goods, and doubt not but I shall besuccesful; Sedley has not been with me since Saturday morning, believe he is going to Hayes; so Mr. Gardiner informed me.</p>
               <p>"As, of course, enquiries will be made at the office, it ought to be put into a better trim, and my things taken out with all possible speed, and the office properly attended to. I am waiting your reply, and am, with great respect to Mr. B.</p>

I inclose 20l. reserving 5l. for H. as F. has not done the note, and he has not any money; and Mrs. Ching, about the house, expects the fixtures to be paid for immediately, before she gives the house up, which amounts to about 10l. but as this 25l. is applied otherwife, I cannot have the means to comply, and think some of the articles overcharged, therefore waved, without your concurrence, paying the money, but would give her what she wished on account, which she did not chuse; and unless you instruct me further, it will remain until your return. I observe, in your letter to your wife, what you have been doing, but you must say where you will have them deposited, and what done with them; I have just heard that Myers is completely done up: I have not heard or seen any thing about the business of

            draw, get him to send a letter of advice to the office, what he intends to draw, for this ought to be done without fail; it will shew they do business together; this is all I can at present say on the subject: I hope you see the necessity, and that you will keep Mr. H. as sweet as in your power; he must have a few pounds, if he accepts for C. and should I draw on him, no delay whatever must be attached to any bills that come in for acceptance, but you must see him as soon as possible after, say, after you shut up the office; should it so happen that any bills come in from me for H. s acceptance, and you cannot get them accepted in time, tell the person that calls that they are sent to H. and will be accepted. In respect of my drawing on Pearce, it will be of no use; I could sooner negociate H.'s<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260045"/>bills than, his. H. living in the City, the house founds more respectable man in the country, but it will not be in my power to get cash on either of their bills, I thesefore hope you will beg Binford to sand me a supply without fail, for I am now stuck fast, and have none.</p>

               <p>"In the transaction of the wool, Sheyill wrote from the country that he purchased some to the amount of 500l. or there abouts, and should send it up; he came to town before it arrived, and after he had come, he asked me if the bills, he had drawn, had been sent to the office, to which I told him, no; he, in the course of a day or two, sent me to the inns to enquire after it, and I brought him word back that the waggon in Warwick-lane was expected in the latter end of the week; I called again by his orders, and I was informed it would be in on Friday, at twelve o'clock; he sent me with the money to pay the carriage, and I went and asked for it, having consigned it by letter from Mr.

            , according to the note I shewed; the person at the office replied, that he had orders not to deliver it to any body, and he should not, until he had heard from the country; I returned to the office, and acquainted Shevill with it, and he replied, what was to be done; I answered, I did not know; he asked me if I knew of any attorney to go to; I replied, no; after some time, he said, he would go to Mr. Hall, in Queen-street, Fowler's attorney; we went, and he stated the business, and shewed him the papers; Mr. Hall said, he would go with him, which he did, and we went to the inn when the owner of the wool was there; Mr. Hall asked what was the reason the wool was not delivered; the owner of the wool, Mr. Jarman, said, because he was not satisfied that the bills were good, and no such person as Mr. Hutchinson was to be found, and it should not go till he was; Shevill then said, if he was not satisfied, he did not desire to have the wool, but was willing to come to terms of accommodation, according to the agreement entered into, but Mr. Jarman would not consent, and Mr. Hall, Shevill, and myself, came away; Shevill consulted with Mr. Hall what was best to be done, and Mr. Hall advised taking opinion of Counsel, which Shevill waved, and here it rested. In the mean time, two of the bills came in, and were accepted by Hutchinsoti, by Shevill's orders I went to enquire after the other wool, and was informed the waggon was expected in a few days; I returned, and acquainted him of it; he then desired Mr. Fowler to go with me, which he did, on the day they said it would arrive; Shevill sent me with the money to pay the carriage, and I went and asked for it, it having been consigned by shevill, according to the note I shewed; the person at the office replied as at the other inn, on which I acquainted Shevill with the result; Shevill, on the next or following day, went to the Swan, to propose a settlement; which was; the money he had advanced to be paid him, the notes given up, and the agreement not being fulfilled, the forfeiture, he said, he had an undoubled right to; Mr. Jarman objected to the whole, adding, who was to pay his expences and loss of time. Nothing decisive was done; they parted to meet again. After Shevill had returned to the office, he drew out an account of what was expected to be paid, which he ordered me to copy, and carry to Mr. Hall, and appoint a time when to go, which was done; and Mr. Hall and myself went with it. On its being stated to Mr. Jarman its contents, he entirely objected to it, and added, that Shevill had charged fifteen pounds money advanced, when only eight pounds were had. It was agreed I should acquaint Shevill of it, and to meet again to endeayour a settlement, which I did two or three times; I called at the inn, and Mr. Jarman was out once, if not more; Mr. Fowler was with me; at last Shevill said, what was to be done? I answered, why settle with the man, and give up the wool on his payment of the money you advanced, but he says it is only eight pounds; have the bills back, the rest come to any terms fair and reasonable. He replied, no, I'll never do that, you must get the agreement stamped, and I will agree to take half the penalty. I answered, you may depend he will never do that; he then said, call and tell Jarman I will meet him on Saturday morning; one o'clock, which I did, and left word with the master of the inn, but I had previously made the appointment; when I returned, he said, now what am I to do? Do as I advised before. No, that I never will, he added. I tell you what you shall do; you shall make oath before a Magistrate that you bought the wool of me, and after that is done, I will provide you with vouchers and documents that shall secure it to you so certainly, that nothing shall get it out of your hands; after which, you shall attach it, and then they may do their worst; I would have paid two or three of their bills, but when you have done that, I won't pay one. (When he had done,) I answered, not for the world. He replied, what then am I to do, lose the wool, the profit of it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180310260046"/>the money I have advanced, and the fifty pounds forseited. I replied, that is nothing to me, come to terms of accommodation, and settle it somehow, that is the best way; consider at what expence Jarman is while here, for you will never get him to comply to any terms of paying any money; on the contrary, he claims a right to some amends being made to him for all the loss he has sustained. After this conversation had ended, and he continued in the office slent, he went out, and returning shortly, he desired I would go up either in the evening or next morning to Fowler, in Tottenhamcourt-road, and tell him he wanted to see him at the office about ten o'clock the next day, or soonet if he could, about some business, but not to mention any thing to him about what had passed between him and me. I must add, that when I refused to comply to swear the wool my own, he said, if he had known that, he never would have sent it to me, as he could have consigned it to one or two that would have done it. For answer, I said, that's nothing to me. In the morning, by his orders, I went up to Fowler, and told him Shevill desired to see him at the hour stated, as near as he could; he asked me what the business was; I told him, and that he had strongly pressed me to do it, but I would not, and advised him not by any means to consent when he came, and to take no notice of what I had said to him that he like wife wished him to go with me to settle the dispute, if possible, about the wool; he replied, that he would do in the morning; when Soevill came to the office, I told him Fowler would be there about the time; he came, and when he went in, Shevill ordered me out of the office; and after a long conversation it was then proposed by Shevill that he should endeavour to dispose of some cloth he had bought and paid for, to enable him to pay a bill he had accepted for him; Fowler undertook to do so, and took patterns with him, and the price Shevill said he would have, and in the course of the day, or the next, came to the office and acquainted Shevill of what he could get for them, and took an opportunity to acquaint me, but I do not know whether it was that day or the next, that Shevill had proposed the same to him of swearing to the wool, and had offered him some money to engage him to do it, and for him to then attach it, which he had refused. On the Saturday Mr. Fowler, myself, and Shevill, set out to go to the Swan, and at the end of Fleet-marker, next Holborn, Mr. Shevill said, go you and see if the parties are there, and I will wait till you come back; Fowler being before me, I went over with him to the Swan, and we both sat down; I then came out and turned towards Holborn-Hill, went a little way up, and came down to Fleet-market, where I saw him, and told him the parties were there; he said he would step a little further, adding, to the York Coffee-house, and if he did not come to me, to put off the settlement till Monday; I returned, and we were taken into custody; Shevill several times proposed to himself to arrest Jarman, but said he should, he thought; be able to settle it without."</p>
