She proved before me, that her aunt was in the street at the time of her stealing them: she confessed likewise, that she had sent them to one Mrs. Skevington's in Ratcliff Highway to be pawned. I went to Mrs. Skevington's , and found one shirt that was my own, two shifts, one handkerchief, one neckcloth , and an apron. I spoke to the Prisoner's aunt, and the Prisoner did own it, and offered to make a debt of it if I would excuse it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was found upon the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Watson. There were three guineas, and 13 s. and 6 d. in silver, she said the remaining part of the six guineas she had laid out in clothes: the money was found in her box.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner say from what place she took them?</p>
               <p>Scot . Her aunt was at our house, and I believe she took most part of the things herself.</p>

               <p>Q. How did she behave before this?</p>
               <p>Scot. Very well, she was a very good natured creature, I believe it was occasioned by her aunt, for she told her she was going into a house where there was money and good linen, and ordered her to bring them to her. The Prisoner had no part of the money the goods were pawned for, and I have the goods that she bought with the money, so that the loss is but trifling.</p>

            . On the Tuesday morning, May 22d, I found the cellar door open, and a little window, both the cloaks hung up in the kitchen, and the other things lay upon the dresser. To the best of my remembrance they were there on Monday night, between 8 and 9 o'clock; we go to bed pretty early, because at this time of the year we get up at 3 or 4 o'clock to go a milking. I believe they heard somebody and that disturbed them, and so they went away. I opened the door, and there was a man coming by, I desired the man to let me light a candle. I said, God Almighty bless you, be so good as to go down with me, for I fastened the cellar door when I went to bed, and this little window, and they are broke open; we searched, but there was no body.

My master being up early was sat down in the kitchen to take a nap, my mistress was in the yard, and, I was at the door. There were three gentlemen who had three tankards of beer; when they were going away there was some beer left in the tankard, and one of the gentlemen turned about to drink it. Bannister came in and asked if Robert Hall the drover was there; said I, why do you ask for drovers at this time o'night? you should have come at one or two o'clock. I fetched half a pint of beer for him, and he lighted his pipe. There was a woman came for a pint of beer in a hurry, I went down for it, and when I came up again Bannister was gone, and the tankard was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did the woman come into the house?</p>
               <p>Vane. There was no body in the tap room but Bannister, the woman did not come into the tap room, she sat on the bench at the outside of the door. I said to my mistress, Madam, have you taken the tankard off the table? She said, No. The pipe which Bannister had just lighted lay upon the table, and he was gone without paying for his beer. On Tuesday this tankard was advertised, on Wednesday when my master was out there came in the constables with the two Prisoners: as to Moody I never saw him till he was apprehended, but as to Bannister, I am upon oath. When the constables came in they called for a tankard of beer, and I was dubious of drawing any beer in a silver tankard, because I had lost one on the Friday: when I saw Bannister I cried for joy to see him, and I said, You rogue, I believe you stole our tankard; he said, You are a wicked creature to say so, for this silver I bought of a gentleman's butler. I said, You are a rogue for stealing the tankard; I have no other way of getting my living, and you would ruin me, for my master and mistress might think that I had stole it. Moody, when he was in custody, said, if we would go to some place, I forget where it was, we might find out the lid of the tankard. I would have gone after it, and if my master had gone with a search warrant I believe we should have found the bottom and the handle of the tankard.</p>

            (to Bates.) You say you saw Bannister in your house?</p>
               <p>Bates. I ask pardon, I did not see him, I was only informed so by my servant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bannister. You hear her say there were three men in the house; then how can she be sure I took the tankard?</p>
               <p>Vane . I did say so, there were three gentlemen in the house; I am upon my oath, but they went away, and left the tankard behind them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . An't please your honour before the Justice she said two men and a woman went out of the house together.</p>
               <p>Vane. I come here to do justice to God and man; there was no body else in the tap room when I went to draw the beer for the gentlewoman but Bannister . I took too much remarks of him about his calling for half a pint of beer to be mistaken, for it is not usual for people on a market day to call for half a pint of beer, and smoke a pipe; and as it has sell out I am very glad I did take so much notice of him.</p>

            . I keep a house next door to the old Seven Stars in Rosemary Lane, and sell old clothes. On Monday the fourth of June both the two Prisoners came to my house. Moody came up to me, and asked if I had any such thing as a pair of damask shoes. He got on the left side of me, and asked if I did not buy silver; he said he had got some bits to sell, and shewed them to me; said I, young man, this is either the handle of a cup or a tankard. I asked him how he came by it, he said he found it in Rosemary Lane. I asked him how he came to think that I bought silver, when I sell old clothes: he said he was recommended to me; I asked him who recommended me, he said a man in the Old Change. I said I did not care to buy it, for I was apt to think it was stole; he said he did not know but it might be so, but he found it. When my husband came down, I told him such a person had been here, he said he was angry I did not call him, for I ought to have stopped him. The Wednesday following Bannister came and asked, whether I bought silver, and said he had some little bits to sell. I think he pulled out this paper. When I found it to be plate cut to pieces it surprised me. I believed there were some pieces that seemed to be stole. I went up to my husband and acquainted him with it; he came down and examined the plate bit by bit, and asked him what he was; he said he was an old clothes man, and bought it of a gentleman's butler. My husband said he would stop it, Bannister said he could not blame any person for being careful, and that he was not afraid of any thing. My husband said, young man, stay and see the weight of your plate. We had not weights enough to weigh it at once, so we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174407280008"/> weighed an ounce and an half at a time, and when there were three ounces weighed, the Prisoner asked whether that was an ounce, I told him there were three ounces; there were five ounces in all. The neighbours told us we should stop the thief as well as the silver. I sent my boy after him, the boy came back and told me he had watched him, and he was with the Prisoner Moody at one Buckmaster's at the sign of the George by Prescot Street: they were brought to our shop, and we got a constable; I said to Bannister I charge you with stealing the plate, and the other with being a confederate ; and before the Justice Bannister said he was an old clothes man, and bought it in the street for fifteen shillings. We looked at the advertisement, and found that Mr. Bates had lost a tankard.</p>

            . I know nothing of any thing but only the stopping of the silver, I had it from Bannister, and he said he bought it of a gentleman's butler. I said it was broke to pieces, so that I did not care to buy it till I knew how he came by it, and stopped it; and when he came before the Justice, he said he bought it by chance in the street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bates and Mr. Sturt who are both silversmiths by trade, said they took the pieces of silver to be part of a tankard.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Bannister. I went out early that morning with my bag, and I did buy it of a gentleman's servant, but do not know who he was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Moody. Bannister gave me the silver to sell for him, I carried it to Mrs. Sturt, and she would not buy it, so I carried it back to Bannister. The Wednesday following he desired I would take a walk with him, for he was going to sell something to fetch a little money. I knew him to be a hawker and dealer in goods, so I went along with him, and we were taken up. Moody <rs id="t17440728-12-verdict70" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Stratford. There is a nut in the middle, it will turn, but it takes so little hold that it is of little or no use.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it a screw to go in, or a hook to catch hold of the other sash ?</p>
               <p>Stratford. It is a hook.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing that could latch it?</p>
               <p>Stratford. No; I believe not so as to secure the window.</p>

               <p>Atkinson . It was quite down.</p>

               <p>Atkinson . It might be half an hour after ten.</p>

            . On Thursday the 10th of May I heard an outcry of thieves, and went to Mr. Elkins the constable's house, and there I saw the Prisoner; I said it would be proper to search him there; the constable desired me to search him, and searching him I found a key and some other things in his pocket belonging to another man. Quarendon, said I, here are some of the things, where are all the rest? With that, Sir, taking the key out of his pocket (he was loth to part with it) I said, this is the key of a chest of drawers. Yes, said he, so it is. Then Mr. Stratford and the officer went to his house, and some time after I saw them come back with a great many things; there was a white quilt, two gowns, and some caps; the white quilt Mr. Stratford brought back himself, and I heard him say he took it off the Prisoner's bed. Afterwards in searching the house, I took a shirt marked R. S. N. out of the washing tub wet; his wife was there, I asked her how she came by that shirt; she said she could not tell how her husband came by it, (there were some caps and other things of Mr. Stratford's.) I asked the Prisoner how he committed the robbery; he told me voluntarily he came over the back wall by the tenter ground into the yard, and seeing a window without a window shutter he got to the top of the shed, then went up to the window, pushed his finger against it, found it lifted up, and so pushed it up far enough to get in, and then got into the room, went to the chest of drawers, and pulled one of the drawers out, took the quilt off the bed, and put these things into it, which he took out of the drawers; and out of the second or third drawers, I cannot tell which; he said he took about half the things, as much as he could carry away, and put them into a dyer's bag, got out of the window again, dropped the bag down, and came to the shed; he held the bag by the mouth, dropped it down, then jumped down himself , and made the best of his way through the next dyer's yard, and so home.</p>

             (constable.) The Prisoner was at my house, and I thought proper to search him before he went away; he hussled a watch out of his pocket, and was going to throw it out of the window, so I took care to secure him in the cage till morning.</p>

            . About eleven o'clock at night I heard of the Prisoner's being taken, Mr. Elkins the constable said I have not searched him yet; when he talked of searching him, the Prisoner put his hand out and put a watch upon the shelf. He confessed he had broke into Mr. Stratford's house, and had got the goods at his house; when I came there I opened a drawer with a key which he had in his pocket, and took out some things which I have here sealed up.</p>

Upon the tenth of May hearing a person was taken up and in custody at Norton Folgate watch-house, I went to see who it was, they said it was one that I knew, and I did know him - it was the Prisoner at the bar. Mr. Elkins the officer said we must search him, and I found my scarlet coffoy breeches upon him, and my watch was taken upon him there, the knee-buckles were found under the seat. He confessed the robbery, that he got in backwards, and saw

The tenth of May hearing this person was taken up, I went to the watch-house, when I came there they talked of searching him, the Prisoner put his hand to his fob, and offered to lay something upon the edge of the window; I caught hold of his hand as he was laying the watch down, and took the watch out of his hand: said I, Mr. Goodwin , I believe this is your watch, and Mr. Goodwin claimed it. In searching him I found this key, a pair of scarlet breeches were found upon him, this pair of silver knee-buckles I took from under the seat where he sat, and I fetched one pair of breeches from his house. He said he got in at the window, and went into the room where Mr. Goodwin lay, and took his clothes out; he was up stairs when the gentleman who owns the other watch came into the room, and he sat upon the stairs till they were in bed, and till he heard them both snore, and when he thought they were asleep: he went into the room , and took the things away; he said he tore the shalloon down off the horse in the dye-house, and that it was about one o'clock in the morning when he came out of the house. <rs id="t17440728-14-verdict86" type="verdictDescription">

I told him he had deceived us, then he said he would go and show us where the things were, and he went with us to this Mr. Johnson's. I knocked at the door, and they would not let us in - there was nobody appeared to open the door. I sent somebody round to see if there was not a back door. I looked in and saw a man and a woman go out of the room where they lay, one in his shirt, and the other in her shift, and they went towards the yard; then some of my assistants got in at the back door, and let us in at the fore door, and gave the things to me, and I delivered them to the Captain's maid, and she said here is something more than our due, that was a shirt unmade, and three plates. I went into the fore parlour, and Johnson was sitting with his coat on in the bed with a child by him. I asked him whether he was the master of the house, and he said he was not.</p>

            . The Prisoner is my brother-in-law, he came to see my wife, and took this Bible. I missed it the twentieth of May; I made an enquiry after it, and found he had offered to pledge it to a pawnbroker in Old Street Road for 5 s. He s aid he would not take it in, because he thought it was stolen, and told me he believed he was gone to the Three Balls in Golden Lane. I went there, and asked him if he had taken in such a thing as that ; he said he believed he had, and gave me a description of the person that brought it. I got the Prisoner to go with me to the pawnbroker's, and he said he could swear that was the person that brought it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I ever deny before the pawnbroker that I carried the book there?</p>
               <p>Plummer. No; the Prisoner said when he came opposite to the house he knew what I was going about, and said I should have the book in a fortnight's time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he took it with a design to steal it?</p>
               <p>Plummer. I believe he would have returned it, and that he never did such a thing before, but was put to straits for a little money.</p>

            . I live at the Three Blue Balls in Golden Lane, the Prisoner brought this book to me to pawn (I believe it was earlier in May than the Prosecutor speaks of) and asked 12 s. upon it, (he did not offer to sell it) he said it was a book he had a great value for, that he had a child lay dead, and had not money to bury it, and that was the reason of his bringing it. I offered him 5 s. upon it, he said that would not do, for he was very hard put to it, so out of compassion I lent him more than another would have done, I lent him seven shillings; he did not pledge it in the name he was indicted by, but in the name of

I went to the house of one Tidsell (who I sent for to come hither) I asked him whether Cox's credit was good enough to borrow 20 s. and pay it at a shilling a week. I did this that they might not suspect what I came about. I did tell him there was an old woman that lent out money at a shilling a week that desired me to enquire, and the landlord went and fetched him; he came and sat down, I said how do you do Cox? I think there is too little for you, I had the pot in my hand and drank to him, (some people said he looked a little white) and desired the landlord to bring another. I catched him by the collar, and I had a little Joiner's hatchet by my side, and I said if he stirred a step I would lay his head upon his shoulder; Tidsell said, If I had known this, I would not have called him; then Tidsell said to him, I told you what these whores would bring you to, but I did not think you had been so great a rogue as this; Cox said he did not do it; but he believed he knew who did, he said it was our Tom's wife and some other persons. Then said Tidsell send and have them taken up, but he wanted to go and fetch them himself: I said, it is the custom in our country always to keep an egg in the nest till the hen has laid again, so Sarah Cox was sent for and brought in, when she came in shed - d his eyes and limbs if she would not hang him and all the gang of them; after that she sell a swearing at me, she said she was present at the time of committing the robbery, and saw it done, but that it was

I asked him if he would go round among my friends for me, and he said he would (he said he was an attorney at law: ) I was sent from the Counter to Bridewell; he went along with me, and asked me 5 s. for going to my friends, and he did not go to any of them but two; then he said he was acquainted with the Sheriffs and Aldermen, and Mr. Lord Mayor, and under pretence of doing me great services he wanted money to treat them: he desired I would let him have the keys of my room (I have a room in <placeName id="t17440728-21-crimeloc126">Houndsditch</placeName>

The matron of Bridewell asked me how I came to employ such a man , for he had not a good look, and bid me ask him (when he came again ) for the keys. I asked him for the keys, and what he had done with a half guinea I had there; he said he had not found the half guinea, but would bring me the keys. When I came to enquire after him, I found he was a runner at the Counter; when I was discharged I went to my lodging, and missing my things, I was surprized. I went to the Counter to enquire after him, and they said they did not know any thing of him, but one of the debtors said he was a rogue and a villain. He absconded about six weeks, and I could not hear any thing of him but by the help of the matron and my friends coming to me I was discharged; and one day as Mrs. Moyett and I were together, I saw Parker going up the Fleet Market, I took him by the shoulder, and said, Parker, how could you rob me (there was one Mrs. Stevens who lives with him ) he trembled very much, and said, I know I have robbed you - he said he had robbed me; we went into a publick house, and I got a constable, and had him before my Lord Mayor, and he owned then that he had wronged me, that he had pawned the things, and would make me easy in three or four days, but he had a fortnight's time given<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174407280018"/> him, and did not do it then. He sent Mr. Goodall to me, and he gave me a note on the behalf of Parker , that he would get my things in a week's time, or he would produce two guineas; but I was informed the note was good for nothing. I got a search warrant, and found all the goods mentioned in the indictment at four pawnbrokers, one in Clare Market, one in Shoe Lane, one in Barbican, and the other in Houndsditch.</p>

I kept hold of his arm, and would not let him go till I got into a house. We went into a house the corner of Fleet Lane, and he sat very quietly; Mrs. Nicholls said she would have me go and fetch a constable, I told her she had better go herself : while she was gone, I said to him, I wonder how you could use this woman so barbarously when she was in prison I told him there were five pair of sheets, and a great many other things; he said, I am sorry for it, I will make her any satisfaction; where is she gone? I believe she is gone to fetch a constable: I said at first I did not know, and afterwards I said, I did not know but she might. I asked him how much he thought they might be worth; he said he believed he had pawned them for about 40 s.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. In April last I went accidentally, or rather unfortunately into the Poultry Counter , the Prisoner was committed there on suspicion of robbing her master. I had some business with relation to the clearing some insolvent debtors, which was the reason of my going there. I was recommended to her to assist her, and went about her business (she acknowledged she had been guilty of a great many errors.) When she was removed from the Poultry Counter, I went and attended her in Bridewell: she desired I would take her keys, but I sent another man for them; she delivered the keys to him, and he delivered them to me. She ordered me to pawn some things for her, and bid me say I came from Mrs. Hickman: and I do say, I do allow, I said I came from Mrs. Hickman, for I had her order so to do.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner these five or six years, for I am concerned as an agent for his brother, who is a reputable attorney in the country; and since the Prisoner has been out of business, I have employed him as a scribe, he writes a good hand, though he was not bred an attorney. I heard he was sent to the Counter on suspicion of a robbery; I enquired into it, and went to the Prosecutrix, and said, if he has robbed you, I will not be concerned in it, but I do expect his brother in town and then he will make you satisfaction . She said she was in upon suspicion of a robbery herself, and while she was there nobody would come to her; she said she had entrusted him with her keys to go to her lodging and take some things out: says I, you must have a very good opinion of a man to suffer him to do that; she said he owned he had taken her things, and pawned them to the value of 40 s. or upwards. I asked whether it was without her privity (because he said she had given him power to go and take such things in order to raise money) and she said she had given him the keys to take some things to pledge to raise money, but I cannot say what particular things she mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she gave him directions to take particular things, or was it a general order?</p>
               <p>Goodall. I understood it was a general order to take what he thought proper, but I cannot say positively it was. The Prosecutrix came to me a second time at King's coffee-house in Fleet Street, and said , I do not want to hurt the man, but unless you will give me two guineas I am advised to prosecute him for Felony : there was a Jew along with her at that time.</p>
               <p>Edwards . I was with her before my Lord Mayor, and she never pretended it was a Felony.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath whether you ever said to Mr. Goodall , that you gave the Prisoner your keys to take such things as he thought proper to pawn? Is that true, or not?</p>
               <p>Nicholls . I never had any such thought, nor never said any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. He says you owned you gave the Prisoner your keys to pawn either some particular goods, or else in general to pawn goods for your use?</p>
               <p>Nicholls. I never said any such word, or any thing like it, as I am in the presence of God.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say it was all one to you, if he would give you two guineas or your goods, or else you would prosecute the man?</p>
               <p>Nicholls. I said I was very much imposed upon, and I would go by my Lord Mayor's directions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer any note to you?</p>

            's in Thieving-lane , (whether it was his wife or no I could not tell) I enquired for him by the name of Probert and described him, and they said there was one Mason lodged there that belonged to the army. I heard he had entered into the Duke's regiment, went to the Corporal of the guard at St. James's, and found he was sick in the Infirmary. I had liberty to go up and found him lying in a miserable state of health. I heard there was a woman came to him who called herself his sister, and she was to be there the next day. I waited to see her, and found she was the Prisoner; I enquired at Lewis White's whether they had seen any calico shirts, and in particular, the counterpane: they informed me where the washerwoman lived, I went to her, and she said she had washed such a thing; 'tis an India Pallampore. Upon this information I got a warrant to search Mr. Smith's a Chandler's shop in opposition [opposite] to the Blue Boar's-head in Denmark-court. I searched the house and found 5 towels and a table cloth. I got a warrant to apprehend the Prisoner; the Wednesday following I saw her at Mr. Townsend's she said there her husband (Mr. Probert) as she called him had sold 2 table cloths, some towels and the counterpane to this Mrs. Smith for 13 s. or 13 s. 6 d and she said she had sold the silver spoons herself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray Sir, did I sell the things?</p>

               <p>Smith. I bought these things of her and her husband as she calls him, and she said she was offered 11 s. for them at the Star Tavern in the Strand; that her mother bought that counterpane of an upholsterer and gave a guinea for it. I gave them 13 s. for them, and I heard no more of them till Mr. Vaughan came with a warrant.</p>

On Monday he sent a note to me by Mr. Godman's [the Surgeon] servant to pay him a guinea, (and Mr. Godman's receipt should be my discharge,) before Mr. Godman would meddle with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174407280023"/> him.

            . I attended the deceased on the 14th of May, and the first word that the deceased said to me when I came into the room was, This wicked woman has murdered me. I desired to search him with regard to his complaint; he told me she had hurt him in his private parts, when I came to examine him, I found he had a rupture of the gut in the scrotum - the gut had fallen down into the scrotum - our term for it is Hernia Intestinalis. I found upon examining that this was not recent.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by examining?</p>
               <p>Godman. Both feeling and looking.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by recent?</p>
               <p>Godman. Fresh contracted; for his rupture had been some years, but he had received a contusion upon the groin, which had occasioned a stagnation of the contents of the gut in the scrotum, of which notwithstanding all I applied to relieve him he died - I believe about the 23d of May: I opened him after the Coroner had taken his inquest, and found the gut to be mortified, which was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. By what occasion was that mortified?</p>
               <p>Godman. I take it to be by the bruise upon that part of the gut which comes down into the scrotum .</p>
               <p>Q. Was the contusion recent?</p>
               <p>Godman. That was recent, but the rupture had been of a long continuance.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose this had happened to a found man, what damage do you think this would have done him?</p>
               <p>Godman. It would not have hurt him, for some labour 20 years under this complaint ?</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a great bruise?</p>
               <p>Godman. It was sufficient to occassion a stagnation of the contents, which occasioned the complaint; - his general cry was, the wicked woman had killed him, but who he meant I can't tell, for he never mentioned any name to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Godman may be a very good Surgeon, he is Surgeon of St. Luke's Parish , but I never knew a Surgeon open a man without 3 or 4 Surgeons with him, for he had this ailment a great many years; if he lays any thing against me I will suffer the law. My husband was two months and was not able to put his shoes or stockings on.</p>
               <p>Godman. I have mentioned it to the Court good woman that this was an old complaint.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My husband loved women, he had got 2 wives besides me; he had a crew he lived with in St. Giles's, and one of them gave me a slap of the face; I asked her what she did here? and she said he was her husband and struck me, and said she could cut me in three pieces, and she tore my cap off my head; he went to pull this creature off me, and fell against something, and this creature fell upon him, he fell backwards, and she is a very great weight; and he got such a disorder by this that he could not put on his shoes or stockings; he has not had an hour's health since I have had him, which is 4 years and an half. He was very bad to be sure, but I never lifted up hand or foot against him. I was advised to carry him to the hospital, but that creature [

Mr. Adler was acquainted with another woman in Golden-lane that he had two children by; he was always a loving man to his wives at first, and when they came to be a little expensive to him, they used to fight like dog and cat: he had another wife between her and that gentlewoman [the Prisoner.] I ask pardon it flurries me, I am not used to these things; I am not used to come into a Court: he had a housekeeper who was pretty lusty, and she used to beat him, and when he put her off, he took to this; she was as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174407280024"/> pretty a modest behaved creature as could be, and continued so for a long time; he was as fond of this at first as he was of the others, but then money growing thin he wanted her to work, and allowed her but little for it, and would buy stale things for 2 d. which if they were good would be worth 8 d. I believe they trumped up stories against her, for I carried her twice to New Prison, (I am an officer of the Parish and kept a publick house in the neighbourhood) the last warrant I had, the Justice did not believe she was guilty, and discharged her.</p>

I had given him leave to go out to play, when he came home he sat down at the bottom of the stairs . I went to him and said, Tommy, why don't you come up and eat some supper? He was very dull. I had some bacon and greens but he did not eat any of them, only a bit of bread: he did not say any thing of his being hurt that night; the next morning between 7 and 8 o'clock I thought I saw some disorder in my child, and asked him what was the matter with him; I said there was some disorder more than ordinary .

               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner one of the two women?</p>
               <p>Tuck . I saw her in the house, but she was not one of the two women. When they had taken my buckles they left me in the room by myself, then I went out of the house with a design to go home about my business; as soon as I came out the Prisoner at the bar followed me, came unawares behind me, and tore my watch out by main force through the waistband of my breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you prevent her doing it?</p>
               <p>Tuck . Because I was by myself, and she came unawares upon me. I turned round, and saw the watch in her hand, and she went into the house she came out of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel the watch taken out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Tuck. I felt the watch going. I turned round and saw it in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. So you did not secure her?</p>
               <p>Tuck. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at that time perfectly sober?</p>
               <p>Tuck . I was sober when I came into their company, I had been drinking a dram or two with them - I was not so much out of my senses, but I could remember very well what I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any thing before you went there?</p>
               <p>Tuck. I drank one dram before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He had a warrant against the other two women.</p>
               <p>Tuck . I had a warrant to take the two women; I at first learned the name of one of them, but the name of the other I could not learn.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you charge the other women with?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174407280026"/> Did you charge them with taking your watch as well as your buckles?</p>
               <p>Tuck . No; only with taking the buckles; the Prisoner's name was in the warrant, but it was only for taking the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you secure the Prisoner then?</p>
               <p>Tuck . I secured her the next day.</p>
               <p>Jury. Why did not you secure her then, you might have run after her and taken her?</p>
               <p>Tuck . I was afraid of having my brains knocked out.</p>
               <p>Jury. You don't say there were any men in the house; did you see any men there?</p>
               <p>Tuck . No; I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Jury. It is not probable that these people should take his buckles out of his shoes, and leave a watch in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor came th e next day to search for a watch; I stood with my back to the window, he said he saw nobody that he knew; the Constable asked him whether he could swear to any body, at last he laid his hand upon my shoulder, and said, you are the woman that robbed me of my watch; and Mr. Waters made answer, and said, I must take charge of you, and I went down to the watch-house with them. I never set eyes on him before, and I did not know him again when I saw him.</p>

               <p>N. B. The stature says, if any person within his Majesty's dominions shall marry another wife, his former wife being alive, shall be guilty of felony. Then it is provided, that this act shall not extend to those who shall be beyond the seas for seven years together, or who whether husband or wife shall absent themselves from one another for the space of seven years, one of the persons not knowing the other to be living at the same time.</p>

             and I were going down Holbourn, and offered the things to the Prisoner to sell. Smytheman and my husband asked him to buy a knife, the things were done up in 4 parcels - There was a razor, and I believe 5 or 6 pair of white metal buckles; I don't believe there were more, and some other odd things; they were done up in a bit of a rag.</p>

               <p>Haycraft. They egged him on, so that they would force him to buy them, and he was willing to buy a bargain if he could, for he might as well buy them as another.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say he got them from a workman in that way?</p>

             went in, and I staid without, and in a very little time they brought out the ticket; then we went to Mr. Henshaw's office on Tower-Hill, and they wanted to sell it, but there being some deflection [defect] in the will, it would not pass there - for the will bore date several months before he went on board the Hector .</p>
               <p>Council. It appears by the books of the Navy that he went on board the Hector in 1739, and the will is dated in 1738.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you told that it was wrong, or did you know it yourself?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. The Prisoner shewed it me, and asked me how I could make such blunders, and I saw plainly afterwards that it was wrong when I compared it with the ticket. Mr. Henshaw sent for the Purser of the ship, and asked if he knew Callaway's sister? He said he did not know his sister, but knew nothing to the contrary but that it was his will. Mr. Henshaw said if she would go to the Pay-Office in Broad-street, where the ship was paying, and get the first payment, he would discount the remainder; (that was what the Prisoner and Ogden said to me when they came out) then the Prisoner cursed and swore at me, and Ogden said if she did not get the money for her trouble, she would go to the office where she got the ticket and deliver it up again. The Prisoner took the probate and I took the ticket, because I remember we did not care to trust one another; we appointed to meet next day at Tower-ditch, this

He said, never fear, we will get it sold; the Prisoner and I went directly and had a bill of sale made, I think it was to one Mr. Tarver by Ratcliff-cross, we went to Mr. Tarver's house and shewed him the ticket, and got a note on Alderman Hankey, we got the money mostly in Portugal gold.</p>
               <p>Council. How much money did you receive?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I know there was above 20 l. it might be 25 or 26 l. for I know we divided above 20 l. and he took 4 s. or 4 s. 6 d. in the pound. - Mr. Tarver gave Gulleland a draught for 20 l. and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Tarver give you a draught on Alderman Hankey?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. Yes, Mr. Tarver would do such a thing for the Prisoner at any time, he would have trusted him with 50 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the bill of sale made?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. It was made at the office in Brichin-lane ; the Prisoner and I went directly to Towerditch where we had left

             and the young man waiting for us, and went to the seven Stars or fourteen stars in Rosemary-lane, I can't tell which (for there are both those signs there) then the Prisoner gave her the ticket for her to put her name to it, and she said if you don't pay me for it, you shall not have it any more; then he held the money in one hand and the probate in the other, and he said (holding out two moidores and a guinea to her) here is the money for you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she sign it before she made this demand or after?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. It was after; she made her mark and then the Prisoner gave her two moidores and a guinea, and the Prisoner took the paper to himself and she made a great noise because she had not more; that Money was to be between her and a young fellow that used to wait on her. Then the Prisoner and I went to Goodman's-fields to settle our affairs, and there we had 2 chickens and asparagus, and two bottles of wine. I asked the Prisoner how it was to be ordered? He said he had had a great deal of trouble about it, and advanced the money; so I had 4 or 5 moidores for my share, and we paid 8 s. for the reckoning; after that he said, there is an Attorney at law by Moorfields who has got a bond of mine and he threatens to run me to an execution, if you will go along with me, I will go and pay him the money; I went with him into Moorfields, and he paid the Attorney four or five moidores before my face, and the Attorney delivered up the bond. - It was somewhere by Moorfields, I can't tell the name of the place.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What account was the bond upon?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I don't know what account, he said he was threatened with an execution about it - this was all in May 1742 - there were two or three people came to me to New Prison to ask me to make a deflection in my evidence - one Hart who is a publican in St. Catharine's came to me and said, if I would make a deflection in my evidence, he would give me 12 guineas, and would get it out of Gulleland , and he said if I did not find the bill, I should have the money directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You say you had two chickens and asparagus, and two bottles of wine, and all for 8 s - if the rest of your account is as true as this, 'tis a very good one.</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I think it was the Green Man that we went to, to the best of my knowledge the reckoning came to 8 or 9 s.</p>
               <p>Council. I suppose you had some strong beer too?</p>
               <p>Sherlock. I don't know but we might.</p>

               <p>Ogden . I have known him about two years. Between Easter and Whitsontide I think, about two years ago, the Prisoner and this rogue [pointing to Sherlock ] told me I was to do something for them, and it was only to tell a lie; they gave me a letter, and I was to go with a will.</p>
               <p>Council - Who gave you the letter?</p>
               <p>Ogden . Gulleland did.</p>
               <p>Council. What was the letter given you for?</p>
               <p>Ogden . I was to give the letter to somebody in Doctor's Commons. Gulleland went with me and shewed me the door, and I had a will, which I gave to the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Council. Should you know it again if you were to see it?</p>
               <p>Ogden. I don't know that I should know it, I never saw one before, and I hope I never shall again: after they had done it, they spurted beer upon it.</p>
               <p>Council. Who did?</p>
               <p>Ogden. Gulleland did.</p>

               <p>Ogden. It is by a tavern, the sign of a head in the Commons, and then he gave me the will.</p>
               <p>Council. Who gave you the will?</p>
               <p>Ogden. The Prisoner, he knows it, he will not deny it, I know he will not tell a lie.</p>
               <p>Council. What sort of a man is Mr. Lee?</p>
               <p>Ogden. I believe he was a man, a little round shoulder'd.</p>
               <p>Council. Where did you go then?</p>
               <p>Ogden. He took me to a handsom man, he had a gown upon him like you, a very fresh handsom man, and he handed me a book, I don't know what he said, and he gave that gentleman a shilling. I left Mr. Lee after I had delivered him the will; he gave his service to Mr. Gulleland, and bid me come the next morning about eleven of the clock; then I went to these honest gentlemen [pointing to Sherlock and Gulleland] where they ordered me to come to them, and I met them the next day in Blowbladder Street, and afterwards I went with this Sherlock to a coffee-house in St. Paul's Church Yard, and Gulleland and I went to Mr. Lee's and got the Administration, and paid for it: Mr. Gulleland, did not you pay for it? he will not deny it.</p>
               <p>Council. To whom was the probate of the will given?</p>
               <p>Ogden . It was given to Mr. Gulleland, he knows it was; then we went to the Ticket Office , and he sent a little boy in to see if Mr. Purvis the ticket clerk was in the way. [It was not you, Sir, it was another little man, speaking to Mr. Bentham.] I went into the ticket office, and they staid till I got the ticket, then I went out and gave it Gulleland, for they would not trust me with it, and you never saw such work, fighting and quarrelling, and Sherlock said to the Prisoner, You shall have the sheep skin, and the Prisoner said, You shall have the other. Did not you say so? [speaking to Sherlock] the parchment he called the sheep skin.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not you ask Gulleland for some money?</p>
               <p>Ogden. Not that night, it was late before we parted, I believe it was six o'clock before we got the ticket; they were didling and dadling backward and forward till it was too late to go to Mr. Henshaw's. Gulleland said in the Ticket Office , Mrs. Callaway, the Hector will be paid to morrow; I thought he was going to call me by my own name. The next morning we went to Mr. Henshaw's , and he sent for the purser of the ship, and asked him if he knew

Mr. Henshaw asked him if he had made any other will, he said he did not know that he had. Mr. Henshaw said, well Mrs. Callaway, go to the Pay Office in Broad Street, and get what money is due to you, and then come to me. I said to Gulleland, how can I go there to face so many men as the whole ship's crew? I said I would not do it, I would carry it to the gentleman that gave it me, and really I did not think there had been any harm in it till I handled the book, and they know I would not do such a wicked thing if I had known it: they were afraid I should go to Mr. Henshaw and discover it; one was worth money, and did not care to be exposed; and as to the other, he did not care to go to a goal, but he is not afraid of scandal, for I believe he is pretty good proof against that: as I had done it, I thought I might as well have something as nothing, and I said, I would not sign it till I had the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sign it before you had the money?</p>

               <p>Q. Who proposed it first to you?</p>
               <p>Ogden. Really I can't tell; Gulleland said that Callaway belonged to the Isle of Man .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing about what money you was to have?</p>
               <p>Ogden. I said I would have as much as they, and I thought it reasonable I should, I thought I ought to have as much for my lie, as they had for their's, as we were all liars alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know that you took an oath?</p>

               <p>Tarver . Yes, I remember it very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much the ticket was for?</p>
               <p>Tarver. Yes, I received 22 l. 12 s. 6 d. upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the Prisoner a draught for this money on Alderman Hankey?</p>
               <p>Tarver. No, I gave him the money, I gave him no draught: I did upon another ticket give him a draught, but I did not give him a draught for this; that which I gave him the draught for, was upon a ticket relating to a trial last Sessions. I gave him then 25 l. 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you pay the money to?</p>
               <p>Tarver. To Gulleland , I saw nobody else. - I paid Gulleland 20 l. 11 s. for it, the ticket was made out for 22 l. 12 s. 9 d.</p>
               <p>Sherlock. Ask him, my Lord, whether I can't tell any remarkable place in his house, and what pictures are there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You will hardly see your own picture hanged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. When you paid the money for the ticket, was the bill of sale filled up?</p>
               <p>Tarver. The bill of sale and every thing was ready.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any thing besides the ticket delivered to you when you paid the money?</p>
               <p>Tarver. I had all the papers, and the parchment too?</p>
               <p>Council. What ticket was that you gave him the 25 l. 10 s. upon?</p>
               <p>Tarver. It was the assignment of Donald Mcdonald's ticket, June 2d, from

               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174407280035"/>Tarver. I never heard any harm of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Do you think he would forge a will?</p>
               <p>Tarver. I should think he was the most unlikely person in the world to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any other will from Gulleland?</p>
               <p>Tarver . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a forged will?</p>
               <p>Tarver . It is not right; I was half concerned in that, he had one half and I had the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you had another that was bad?</p>
               <p>Tarver. I can't say I had not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Do you think he would be such a fool as to trust himself in the hands of an Irish woman, and Sherlock the witness?</p>
               <p>Tarver. He came up from Portsmouth last sessions, I told him how things were; and I said, sure you are not such a villain as to put these things upon me, because I have faith in you? He said he knew no more of it than I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I shall make no observations, we have contradicted Sherlock by what the last witness says, and the woman has positively swore she never was at Gulleland's house, and we can prove that she has.</p>

About a month after, Gulleland came to my chambers, and said, his character was aspersed by Sherlock, and he had a mind to clear his character to the Commissioners of the Navy: the Commissioners said I should speak to Sherlock, and draw up any deposition he had against him. On Monday he came again, (Sherlock had sent me some accounts relating to Mcdonnah's will) The Commissioners were not willing to take him up upon the evidence of Sherlock alone. They examined the books, and found they agreed with the ticket, which he could not know without he had been concerned: they took time to consider of it, and then resolved to prosecute Gulleland.</p>

               <p>Justice Richards. I have known the Prisoner about ten years, I never knew him charged with any crime or vice. His character is as good both in publick and private life as any ones; he is a sober, honest, modest man; I was surprized when I heard of this; I never was more deceived in the character of a man in my life if he is guilty of what is laid to his charge - he was a check weaver when first I knew him, but since he kept an alehouse, sold slops, and bought tickets - he has been a very good husband and a father, and kind to his wife's friends that wanted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepphard. I have known the Prisoner ever since the year 1738. I always knew him to be just in his dealings; I should not have thought such a thing as this by any thing that I ever saw of him. Mr. Baker likewise appeared to his character.

I took a will out of my pocket, and filled it up before her face, and read it over to her; I wrote the name of Farmer , and Rochead wrote the name of Stones ; I wrote the name of Ryan, and he made the mark: the name of Davis was wrote after, it is a different sort of ink.</p>
               <p>Mr. Huntridge produced the will, and proved he had it out of the Prerogative Office: [ then the will was read.]</p>
               <p>Sherlock. The Prisoner, Rochead, and I, went to the Commons, and she went to Mr. Alexander's , a proctor; she returned and said, she had proved the will, and the probate would be ready next morning. The next day I went, but we had no money to pay for the probate, and I desired Mr. Alexander to let his clerk go to the Navy Office to get the ticket: when we came there the name was Ryant upon the books, and the clerk would not deliver the ticket, because the probate was in the name of Ryan, but Mr. Alexander's clerk said he would get it done properly, and he got the words (otherwise Ryant) interlined. The next day we went again, the Prisoner, Rochead, and Mr. Alexander's clerk, went all in together, and brought out the ticket - I believe Mr. Alexander's clerk had a crown for his trouble. The Prisoner, Rochead , and the clerk, went to Mr. Parr's at the Blue Anchor in Crouched Friers , and the Prisoner could not remember the time of his entering on board, or the time of his death, or any thing. Mr. Parr said she was an impudent creature, and would have nothing to do with her; we were forced as we had no money to leave the probate and ticket with Mr. Alexander's clerk. We went to one

After the demur at Mr. Parr's we gave her fresh instructions, and she went through it very well, and it was sold to Mr. Coward Mr. Hexshaw's clerk, who discounted it for 2 s. or 2 s. 6 d. in the pound, and we had a draught upon Casewell and Mount. The Prisoner received the money, and kept back four guineas, I threw the rest down upon the table; I believe we did get another guinea from her; then we paid Hussey the guinea we borrowed, and a guinea for interest.</p>
