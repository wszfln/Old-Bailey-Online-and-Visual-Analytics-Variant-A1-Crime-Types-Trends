I am an auctioneer, surveyor, and estate agent, at 82, Queen Street, Cheapside—in January last I had some business transactions with the prisoner, who was carrying on the business of a confectioner at 14 and 16, Terminus Road, Eastbourne—I was employed to obtain a partner for him—on 28th January I had an inter<lb/>view with him at my office—he was anxious to have a loan of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I declined to give it him, because he offered me as security freehold property at Eastbourne subject to two or three mortgages—I said "You have the leases of 14 and 16, Terminus Road unencum<lb/>bered; I will make you an advance upon them"—he said "I have a lease of five years unexpired which I have surrendered to the Duke of Devonshire; a new lease is being granted for 21 years"—I then said that I would send for my solicitor, Mr. Hack; that he should come, and the prisoner should give the necessary instructions—I told him I would take the freehold for what it was worth, and he said he would hand over the new leases as soon as they were granted—I was present when Mr. Hack took the instructions for the purpose of executing the deed—on the same afternoon the defendant came into my office again—Mr. Hack was there with, I believe, the draft mortgage and the original deed—one of them was handed to the prisoner, who read it and handed it back, saying it was perfectly correct—it could not be executed that day because Mr. Hack wanted to fill in some blanks, and the prisoner could not give the necessary information—before he left I drew this cheque for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was endorsed by him in my presence, and it was handed to the clerk, who went to the bank and got it cashed, and handed the money over to him—I parted with my money on the faith that the new lease would be handed over, and that the old</p>

               <p>lease was unencumbered—on the 6th of May I saw the deed executed by the defendant at my office in the presence of Mr. Hack—I saw the defen<lb/>dant sign it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the deed. (<hi rend="italic">The third schedule of this men<lb/>tioned all the houses, land, premises, and rears situate between Terminus Road, Eastbourne, and no mention was made of any encumbrance; it was to secure the repayment of 300l.</hi>) After Mr. Hack had left on the 6th May I asked the defendant when I might be expected to receive the new leases—it was quite time I had them—he was rather excited at the time, and said "I have left them with Mr. Catt at Brighton, but I have no doubt I can get them"—he said there was about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing on his account—on 10th June I went down to Eastbourne and saw the defendant, and asked him about the leases, and he offered me some draft leases of some back pre<lb/>mises, but not of 14 and 16, Terminus Road—he said he had left them with Mr. Catt; that he had paid 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,100 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that there was a balance still due of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,and he had no doubt he could get them—up to the present time I have not received any of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back or the leases—there were two bills given as collateral security—they were renewed in August.</p>

I secured by the mortgage was my commission on the sale of the business to Chamberlain—although the word interest was used, it was commission—I was arranging about the commission before the thing was completed—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not interest—Vine did not say he was not going to sign the deed and pay such interest, he had agreed to it before—after he asked me if I would make a reduction I believed it was arranged—I would not charge more than 50 per cent, if it was done in three months—he never said he would not pay me any such sum as 50 per cent. interest—I swear he did not then say he would only pay me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if it was done in six weeks—this is a memorandum of 28th January: "If you pay me the amount of money this day advanced to you at any time after six weeks from this date, I undertake to charge you proportionate interest on the sum advanced to you"—I was to charge him proportionate interest on the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. interest—Mr. Hack wrote the memorandum—I pledge my oath the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for commission on the business—the proportionate interest on six weeks would be 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not decline to sign that deed, but he did not sign it, because he could not give the information as to the addresses of the parties who advanced him money on mortgage, the first and second charges—the first schedule of the mortgage relates to freehold houses of a rental of 227<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; they were subject to two or three mortgages; the second schedule shows a mortgage on property bearing a rental of 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and the third schedule relates to the leases of Terminus Road—I perused the mortgage deed—it secured the sum of 409<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to be paid in August, with interest in the mean<lb/>time at the rate of five per cent.—the interest was really to date from August, that was the understanding—I was to enforce it—I never heard the names of Messrs.

(<hi rend="italic">A letter was here read from the witness expressing his surprise at hearing that the leases were in Catt's hands, and saying that he would not delay a day after 1st August, and that the prisoner would pull through if he would realise on his freehold property at once.</hi>) I still went on trying to get the leases—the matter of trying to get a partner or sell the business was out of my hands and in Chamber<lb/>lain's solicitor's hands—I told him if Chamberlain did not buy the business or go into partnership I could easily find one who would—I was in communication with a Mr. Hutchinson, and went on negotiating the sale of the business—I instructed my solicitor to take steps against the prisoner about the 13th—he wrote on 11th May saying he was afraid his client would take criminal proceedings against him—I left the matter in his hands—after I returned from taking out a summons at the Mansion House I found the notice of the meeting of the prisoner's creditors on my table—I wrote on the 13th asking who had the leases—I had seen in the <hi rend="italic">City Press,</hi> "W. Catt and Son, of Brighton," and I did not know if they were the same or not—I wrote and asked him for a cheque for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for advertising and expenses prior to 28th January, before the arrangement was made about the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not press him to sell—he did not ask me for advice as to what he should do about selling—he said he believed if it was sold he would have a surplus—the letter of 8th June referred only to the sale of the property, not of the business—up to 8th June I was asking him to come and see me about selling the property—he did not call on me in answer to my letter of the 8th—I wrote to him on 9th June, asking him to have the leases ready to hand over to me the next day—I was calling on him to perform the covenant and deed executed in May with regard to money in January—I believed right up to the last I should get the lease—I wrote that before I got the notice of meeting of creditors—I had no summons in my pocket when I looked in at the meeting—my man was sitting on the stairs—I knew there was a meeting of creditors after I obtained the summons, and that bankruptcy proceedings were pending against him, although he was not yet adjudicated a bankrupt—I attended the adjourned meeting—I had about five days' notice of the first meeting.</p>

Monk and Lloyds, solicitors, with Captain Osborne, whom we met for the purpose of Osborne seeing Mr. Monk before he signed the deeds, and that Mr. Monk should give him some advice—we waited to see Mr. Monk, and Mr. Livesey explained the matter to Burslem, who signed the deeds, viz., a conveyance by me to Captain Osborne, a mortgage to Guntry for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a second mortgage to me for 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no money was paid—Mr. Livesey then retained the deeds as escrows, and as security for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Osborne still retained possession of The Grove—he changed the name, and called it Osborne Hall—after the deeds were signed an execution was put in against Burslem, who had already taken the furniture on a hiring agreement, not being able to pay it—some things had been taken when the Sheriff came—on 2nd April I took out a summons against Burslem for obtaining furniture by false pretences—that summons was adjourned by arrangement—on 16th April Burslem was taken in custody—I then found out the nature of his representations—I appeared as a witness at Bow Street—when I regained possession of The Grove I made a search, and found these five letters. (<hi rend="italic">Signed</hi> "John Edward Smith," <hi rend="italic">and addressed to Captain Osborne; one of 10th February stated,</hi> "it is a matter of life and death I should have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to morrow;" <hi rend="italic">one of 19th February stated,</hi> "I suppose the bill is arranged; I am pressed as to it;" <hi rend="italic">one of 27th February said,</hi> "I felt sadly troubled this evening; I have gone on promising my client, from whom I got the bill, from day to day, so my burden is doubled; there is money due to him and money I want for myself; I shall be at the office to-morrow morning waiting with great anxiety;" <hi rend="italic">and that of 28th February stated,</hi> "I cannot understand what is meant by success when I have been kept waiting so long after you parted with possession of my bill; my client is getting more and more dissatisfied; altogether I am in a regular fix; I shall be at the office to-morrow morning, and ready to hear any arrangement you may propose to make.") Burslem handed this card to me, "The Honourable Captain Osborne, late Egyptian Gendarmerie."</p>

Haskett and Metcalfe on behalf of Burslem—Burslem, after hearing the explana<lb/>tion and the opinion, signed the deeds—I retained them because they were executed in escrow, no purchase money having been paid—I after<lb/>wards sent back the deeds of title to Mr. Guntry.</p>

I am an estate agent, of 9, Northumberland Street, Strand—I advance money on property at times—on 13th February, Sedger, who I knew before, called there with the prisoner Burslem, who he introduced, saying "This is Captain Osborne, who is going to lend some money on the Novelty Theatre; he is a relation of the Duke of Leeds, and very well connected; he has some freehold property, and wishes to raise on mortgage about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he said that the property was a freehold house at Burgess Hill, the property of Burslem—Burslem said "I want a mortgage of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at five per cent., but I am temporarily in want of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go on with; I have bought the house for 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid for it all but 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and my solicitor's bill of costs is owing as well"—I said "Who is your solicitor?"—he said "Mr. Smith, of Clement's Inn;" No. 15, I think—he said that he had given his acceptance for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up the balance of the purchase money—I said "Before the mortgage can be carried out for the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it will be necessary to have the mortgage paid off, because it will be considered as unpaid purchase money"—he said that he had between 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; and Sedger said that he had a pension of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and showed me his name in Whitaker's Almanack, Sidney Godolphin Osborne, Secretary to the Army Purchase Commission—Burslem did not contradict or deny that—I said "Where are the deeds?"—Burslem said "At Mr. Smith's, my solicitor's"—I asked him how that was; he said that Smith had endorsed the bills for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and held the deeds till they were paid—I said "Can I see the deeds?"—he said "I will write to Mr. Smith, authorising him to give you all the information required," which he wrote and gave it to me—I said "I shall require a survey"—he said "200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will do for me to-day"—I sent Mr. William Jackson to Smith's to make inquiries, and gave him the letter Burslem had written—he returned and made a report to me, in consequence of which I advanced Burslem 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—as far as I can recol<lb/>lect the letter said "Dear Smith, please give the bearer all the informa<lb/>tion you can about my property at Burgess Hill; I am about to raise 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a temporary loan," or "a second charge"—I saw Burslem the same afternoon, and handed him the cheque—I had sent for Mr. Barnes, my solicitor, and he was in my office and prepared this mortgage deed (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in Burslem's presence, and he signed it—on 18th February Burslem called again, and I advanced him a second 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a similar mortgage—he brought with him this bill of exchange (<hi rend="italic">For 93l. 15s. 6d., drawn by Marsh and Co., and accepted by William Long and Co., wine mer<lb/>chants, Chancery Lane; endorsed by Smith and by Osborne.</hi>) He said "This is a bill which my solicitor has taken for a bill of costs, and he wants to turn it into money as quickly as possible"—I said "I do not care for the people's names who are on the bill; if Mr. Smith will endorse it as well, I will entertain it"—Smith's name was not on it then—he said "Oh, Smith will endorse it at once; I will send it on for his endorsement"—he wrote this letter to Smith in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">Asking Smith to endorse it</hi>)—it was brought back with Smith's name on it, and I then handed Burslem the cheque for 270<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the bill and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on extra advance—this other mortgage (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was signed in my presence—I then instructed my solicitor to see the deeds, and I saw Burslem and said to him "There seems a great difficulty about these deeds; first you sent us to Mr. Smith, and he says he will produce them, and he does not do so,</p>

Mr. Sedger was lessee of the Novelty Theatre at that time—I had known him three months, he wanted to raise a mortgage on the Novelty Theatre—he is not here—it was he who made this statement as to Burslem's position—Burslem was present when Sedger said that he was secretary of the Army Purchase Commis<lb/>sion; he sat a few feet from him and could hear it—he did not reply to that, but he occasionally nodded his head—I was a corn dealer in the north before I came to London 20 years ago—I was bankrupt once in the north, in liquidation—I only made arrangements with my creditors once—I came to London in 1880—Jackson is one of my agents, I did not enter into partnership with him; I had rooms where he lived—he advertised to lend money, people were to apply to him, but I was to advance the money—I am not prosecuting in this case willingly, I have a Crown Office subpoena and am obliged to come, much to my disgust—I have prosecuted persons before for defrauding me, and the charge was dismissed—it was Sedger's introduction which induced me to lend Burslem the money, and I made inquiries through Mr. Jackson and Mr. Smith—I was satisfied with what Sedger told me—Burslem said that he had 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year allowed him by his family and his pension was about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I understood him 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he said that he was in the receipt of it, not that he expected to get it—I charged him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for interest for the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. including fees; I dare say that was 75 per cent. per annum—I looked upon it as a temporary loan, and he said he was not particular about the interest he paid if he had it that day—he said "You can charge a fair bonus, you will have the expense of going down;" and as to the second 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I asked what I should charge, and he said "The same as before"—I would not take the 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bill unless Osborne and Smith signed it; the discount would be over 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent.—I have got judgment on the bill—Harrison and Burslem were present when I saw these two advice notes; I looked at them and saw the figures, one is dated nine months and the other six months before—I knew that a sum of money paid in then would probably be gone—he told me that Burslem was his mother's name, and sometimes he had money sent to him in one name and sometimes in the other—he afterwards gave me cheques amounting to 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. respecting the two mortgages—I have sued on the cheques, but do not expect to recover on them because the drawer of them has no money—he is Mr. Collinson, a solicitor of Chancery Lane, who is in partnership, and I think their affairs are being administered to</p>

               <p>in the Court of Chancery—Burslem showed me several letters and cheques showing that Collinson owed him money, and I believe more than this—I kept the cheques for what they were worth—I believe Collinson is in a perfectly solvent state, some judgments are registered against him—the two mortgages of 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each were signed in my presence—they were filled up, not signed in blank, if that has been stated it is perfectly untrue—I heard the, whole of the first one read through.</p>

I ask why the letter sent from me to Smith of February 13th has not been produced. The above noted were in the name of Burslem, and the witnesses swear they only knew me as Osborne before my arrest. Messrs. Boxhall were going to arrest myself and a gentleman for conspiracy, and I went to Coulson to borrow the money temporarily to save the gentleman, who was ill in bed. Coulson says he is suing on the cheques for 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he expects to get it back. The Treasury knew the money was not for me at all, and the 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. did not come to me. It is not shown that I have not the income I stated, I belong to a good family. I can pay everybody in the world 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound. I have been here three months; I was brought here because I said, it is alleged, that I was 'The Honourable.' I am the next-of-kin of the Earl Godolphin, who I believe is related to the Duke of Leeds. The charges have been jumbled up. I have not had the money. I have always said I held a Captaincy in the Volunteers or Colonial forces; non-commissioned were given a commission for the time being in Africa under Lord Chelmsford. The card produced is 'Late of the Egyptian forces.' When I have said I was in t✗he Royal Artillery they have jumped to the conclusion that I was a captain, I never said so. They could always have turned to the Army List. I lost my leg in Zulu<lb/>land. Harrison was told long before that I had served in the ranks and only had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day pension, and they all knew that since 3rd February or 4th. The money was not borrowed till 13th February."</p>

I am a single woman, and live at 15, Frederick Place, Mile End Road, with my mother—I have known the prisoner about 11 years; he married my eldest sister about June, 1875; they separated in November last—she left him on account of his cruelty—on the 13th July she was not at our house—about a little before 6 o'clock on that day I was at home with my mother, and heard a knock at the door, it was opened by my mother—I was in the back parlour, on the ground floor, which is level with street door—what first attracted my attention was my mother calling out "Oh, Jessie, Jessie!"—I went out of the back parlour into the passage; the prisoner was there; he took hold of me by the left arm—I don't know whether he was sober or not—he forced me to the ground and put a pistol behind my left ear, I felt it pressing against my flesh—I then heard a report and found I was wounded—he then went and looked in the back parlour, and then walked along the passage out of the door, into the street—I had not seen him previous to this evening for five or six months—I had remonstrated with him more than once about his ill-treatment of my sister—nothing was said at the time he shot me—I knew he had been to Egypt—I saw no more of him that evening—I was assisted, and a doctor attended me and got the bullet out, and I was able to attend before the Magistrate on 28th July.</p>

Whitworth" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a duplicate was issued on the 13th September, 1879, and on the 16th I received it with the transfer—on the 14th August last I received the original document, and the transfer previously, from Mr.Shaw (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the 15th August I received the transfer back again by post—Mr. Shaw's name was on it then—I first saw the certificate after 1879 on the 14th August last, when it was shown to me by a clerk in Mr.Shaw's office—we then examined the books and found what I stated.</p>

I am a stockbroker, of Wardrobe Chambers, and have had transactions with the prisoner for two and a half years—about April last I received the certificate marked "A" from him—there was some stock open, and it was going a good deal against him, and I advised him to close, and if not I must have security, and he handed me this amongst other documents, which I handed back to him—I believed it to be a genuine document—I think the transfer was completed at the same time—I do not sign till I deliver the stock, and through an omission of my clerk's it went in without being signed—he asked me to hold it over, as he had promised his wife not to part with it if possible—I said I would hold it over as long as I could—I took a bill at two months, but the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Drayton Townsend, a brick<lb/>layer, of 155, Estcourt Street, Fulham—I used to work for the prisoner's mother at 35, Mulgrave Road; the prisoner's wife worked there as an ironer—on 15th July, about half-past 7 in the evening, I was there—the prisoner came in; he appeared to be in an excited state—he said to his mother "Mother, my wife has been unfaithful to me, what am I to do?"—she said "Forgive her"—he said "What, once, twice, three times, how many times?"—she tried to smile and said "Seven"—he threw up his hat and said "No, I can't; I love my wife, but I'll kill that man; I can't rest"—it came on then time for the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> to pay the women—she went to the door and opened it, and the women were on the stairs—Mrs. Norman went on the stairs with a Mrs. Frost—when the prisoner's wife saw her husband come to the door she went towards the back room, as he stood at the front door—I then went downstairs with a pail of water, which I had been cleaning the room with—I was absent only a few minutes—as I came back through the passage the mother was standing in the passage—I heard the deceased shriek out "Oh"—the prisoner and she were up in the little back room—when Mrs. Norman heard the noise she said to Mrs. Frost and myself "Go up, don't leave me here by myself; I can't be left here in this manner"—I saw the prisoner push the deceased into the room—I took hold of him and took him away from her—he struck at her again, but did not hit her—I pushed him back—he said "Don't handle me," and he said again "Don't handle me"—I said "I shall; you shan't strike her"—he used some very bad language, and was there some little time—then the wife said "Let me come out, it is getting late; I want to get something for the children, and the shops will be shut up"—he said "I am afraid you won't go out from here to-night, Nell"—the women tried to quiet him, and after some little time we all went downstairs together—when we got into the passage the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> paid me and Mrs. Frost; she gave the prisoner something out of her purse; he kissed his mother and said "Good night and God bless you"—I was the last out of the street-door with his wife—I said "You are all right now; don't go home with him"—the prisoner had got his two little children, one on each side—I then left them—about an hour and a half after that I was at the Lord Clyde public-house, that is not five minutes' walk from there—the prisoner and his wife, and his brother, wife, and his two children came in there together and sat down—the prisoner seemed more agreeable then, and I went across the bar and spoke to the deceased—they all went out together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have worked for the prisoner's mother turned three years, and I knew the prisoner before that—I don't know enough of him to say whether he was a most affectionate husband—I have not said before to-day about the wife shrieking "Oh"—I had not forgotten it—when they left the Lord Clyde they were more agreeable, but not happy—when he spoke to his mother about his wife being unfaithful he did not seem to be in a more distressed state of mind than he generally was; he did not throw down his hat, he only took it off—he did not do it in any excited manner, not more than usual—I have seen him so many times.</p>

               <p>brother, and live in Pownall Road, Fulham—on Wednesday, 15th July, about 9 o'clock, I was outside the Lord Clyde and saw the prisoner and his wife and two children outside, they were quarrelling—the deceased was crying, and I asked her what she was crying for—she said "Harry has a dagger with him, and I won't go in until he gives up the dagger"—I tried to make peace between them—I said "Oh, don't think anything about it"—I said "If you have the dagger give it to me"—he said "No"—I asked them to go home and forget it—the prisoner promised me he would go home, that he wouldn't touch her that night; and I saw him go to his front door; his wife and children went in first, then he did, and I bid them good-night and left them—their house is only a few steps from the Lord Clyde—the prisoner is a painter by trade and went out usually early in the morning to work—I have known him 25 years—this is the dagger (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have seen it at the mother's house at least 20 years ago, it was kept in her bedroom under her bed, I couldn't remember whether it had a sheath—I have not seen it for years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner has been married from 10 to 11 years, and until very recently I have never known him any different from an affectionate husband—when I asked him to give the dagger to me and he said "No," I did not understand him to mean that he had not got it with him, he said nothing further than "No"—I did not ask him whether he had got it or not, I didn't see it—I was not in the Lord Clyde with them more than five or ten minutes; we came out together—at that time his wife was very anxious for him to go home with her—I have not seen this dagger at the mother's house since he was married—I have not been to his house more than twice in the 11 years and I have not seen it there—I don't know whether it was there or not—I remember the prisoner having a very heavy fall downstairs at his house, I was not there at the time—I had been so little in his company that I did not notice any change in his manner from that to which I had noticed before—about the first half of July of the present year the prisoner said he had been working on a roof, and it was so hot and he came over so dizzy and giddy he felt he should fall; he has been in the habit of holding his head lately, I have noticed it frequently with him, and more frequently since then—I have noticed him since that occurrence in a very excited and depressed condition, and especially so within a month or so prior to this sad occurrence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I cannot fix the date when he said he had been on the roof—he did not go to any doctor that I know of—he has been to his work ever since, as usual.</p>

I keep a general shop, and am landlord of 10, Rylston Terrace—the prisoner and his wife lodged there in the second-floor front, and I occupied the first-floor front room, underneath them—on Wednes<lb/>day, 16th July, about 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, I heard the prisoner making a noise, jumping and stamping about, and then a noise as if somebody had been thrown on to the floor; he then came out on the stairs and challenged me to come out and fight him—I was then in bed—I did not answer him, and he said he would burst the door open, and kept swearing if I did not open the door—I didn't answer him, and he went off quietly—on the Saturday week before that he had come to my shop about 8 o'clock or something of that, and performed, throwing his</p>

               <p>fists about, and said "Come out here and fight"—I said "What do you mean, Norman?"—he said "You know all about it"—I said "You had better go out until you get sober, and I will talk to you then"—on Thursday, the morning after the noise overhead, when they came down<lb/>stairs, I said to the prisoner, "What do you mean about this?"—he said "You know all about it"—he accused me with having familiarity with his wife—I said "I have not had anything to do with your wife, I I am as innocent as anybody is, we will have this out;" and I said "Call your wife down," and told the boy to go and fetch his mother down—she came down, and I said to her "Mrs. Norman, what does Mr. Norman mean? he accuses me of having familiarity with you, what does he mean about it?"—she said "Mr. Batten, there is not a word of truth about it"—he then made a noise of jumping about, and <hi rend="italic">chucks</hi> down his hat and said "You know all about it"—I told him I should take out a summons against him—on this morning, 17th July, I was in bed about 5 o'clock, I heard some one go downstairs and run past the front of the shop, and then I heard the prisoner's girl and boy scream—I went up to the prisoner's room; I saw the wife lying on the bed in her night-dress, the clothes were over her as usual, nothing disturbed—I saw there was a little mark on her breast like a scratch, and some fatty matter round it; she just gasped once or twice—the little boy showed me the dagger, it was on the table underneath a handkerchief and a newspaper; it looked stained a little—I covered it over, and at once went for a policeman, and a doctor came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was in the habit of going out to his work about 5 o'clock in the morning, and returning about 9 at night—he had for the last five or six weeks been throwing out nasty hints about me and his wife, and said something about improper intimacy with his wife, but I didn't understand him—he said on the Saturday "You know what is between you and my wife"—that was the first day he had said anything plain to me about it—when I called his wife down on the Thursday morning he seemed excited; I had seen him but very little before that—up to two or three weeks before this occurrence he and his wife seemed as usual—the dagger did not look as if it had been thrown down, but as though it had been covered over for the purpose.</p>

I am divisional surgeon of police—on the morning of 17th July soon after 5 o'clock I was called to the prisoner's house—I found the woman lying in the bed on her back; I felt the body, it was quite warm and was quite recently dead—I examined the body and found a small wound on the left breast and some bruises which were not recent—on the 18th I made a post-mortem examination—the wound was a punctured one three inches below the clavicle and two and a quarter inches from the centre of the sternum and penetrated for a depth of five and a half inches, passing through the edge of the lung and the pericar<lb/>dium and penetrating the left auricle of the heart—that was the cause of death—this dagger corresponds exactly with the wound; in my opinion this dagger must have gone in right up to the hilt, because that corre<lb/>sponded exactly with the wound—the woman might have gasped once or twice—I saw the dagger at the time, there were very slight marks of blood upon it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say that if the prisoner had had sunstroke he would be more subject to fits of passion than an ordinary man—a case of sunstroke would be consistent with his complaining of his head, and though very slight at the time it might leave permanent effects—the prisoner is what is called a full-blooded man, and in that case a slight sunstroke may have permanently affected him more than if a man not quite so full; it may or may not, sometimes it does.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a saddle-maker, of 6, Norman Street, St. Luke's—on Saturday evening, 22nd August, between 6 and 7, I was in Old Street—I saw the prisoner driving a small four-wheeled van with one horse—he was only two or three paces from me when I first saw him—he was driving steadily till he took the reins out of his left hand and lashed the horse across the loins; that made the horse start a great deal faster, about eight miles an hour, and he was going towards St. Luke's Hospital—he was continually urging the horse on; it was galloping—I</p>

               <p>saw an old gentleman crossing the road in his slippers—the near shaft of the van knocked him down, and the wheels went over him—I shouted after the driver to pull up, and several others shouted after him, but he took no notice—he still went on for about 100 yards before he was stopped.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw a boy in the van; the thing was all over in a few seconds—I did not see the deceased leave the kerb—he was in the road when I first saw him—he was knocked down on the near metals of the tramway—he was walking across with his head inclined downwards—he did not look to the right or left—he passed behind a cart that was in front of the van—the prisoner pulled his right rein and cleared the horse's head from the deceased—if he had looked up the road there was nothing to prevent his seeing the van.</p>

Strand—on Saturday evening, 22nd August, about 25 minutes to 7, I was in Old Street, on the left side going from Aldersgate Street to Shoreditch—the road was particularly clear—I saw the old gentleman stepping down from the roadway—I heard a shouting on the right-hand side, and then I heard a noise behind me, as of a vehicle coming very furiously along, and I saw an Apollinaris van driven by a man and a boy—the near fore-part of the van swerved and struck the old man, and sent him right forward on his face, and the van passed over both his legs and apparently over his right side, as he lay on his face—I after<lb/>wards saw that the prisoner was the driver of the van, when he alighted—when I first saw the deceased he was about five yards in front of me—I believe the van was going about 10 or 12 miles an hour—I am not much of a judge—the horse was galloping—after knocking the deceased down the van continued on; there was a slight check; it swerved as it struck the deceased, and after it passed over him he ran away faster than ever—I saw the old man picked up and put on the kerb—the van was stopped from 110 to 120 yards from where the man was knocked down.</p>

I am manager at Martin's Bank—the prisoner was a clerk there from 1881 up to about 4th May last, when he was discharged—his salary was 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he worked at a special desk in the morning; he was one of the country clearers—we have three cashiers in the bank; Mr. Cole is the third cashier, and the prisoner sat behind him in November, January, February, and March—each cashier is pro<lb/>vided with a counter cash-book, and those books when not in use were kept in a box on wheels under the counter—the wheels are merely in case of fire—the pass-books and paid cheques are kept in lettered drawers at another counter, which the public had no access to, but all the clerks had—when a cheque is presented at the counter the paying cashier enters the name of the drawer, the amount, and the mode in which the amount is paid, with the amount, number, and date of each note; he then obliterates the signature and places the cheque cancelled on a file in front of another clerk, who enters it in the cash-book—the cheques are then turned down into a box and taken away by the ledger clerk, who sorts them and posts them in the ledger to each customer's account, and on the same day they are fetched away by the pass-book clerk and entered in the customer's pass-book if it is in the house; if not, they are sorted between perpendicular cards, and remain there till the customer sends his pass-book—we always put the cheques in the pocket of the pass-book—we have a system of keeping house by which on week days a certain number of the junior clerks have to stop after business hours, nominally until 9, but they sometimes ask the night porter to come on between 7 and 8 instead of 9 o'clock, and on Sundays the clerk stops all day, and has access to the whole of the premises, in fact he is there to watch them—the prisoner took his turn on Sundays, but not on week days—Mr. Cooper has kept an account there for many years; he was not very</p>

Fredericks, Bedford Arms, Arlington Road, N.;" and on the face of 17,729 "Hugh Lloyd, 99, Jermyn Street, St. James's;" all those notes were given for Mr. Cooper's three cheques—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the country clearing book kept by the prisoner, it appears to be all written by him—these letters <hi rend="italic">A B C</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D,</hi> and this envelope <hi rend="italic">Aa,</hi> and this memorandum <hi rend="italic">Bb,</hi> are all in the prisoner's writing—my attention was first called to this matter about April 7th or 8th—I gave information to the police about the prisoner before going to Messrs. Humphreys, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188509140044"/>
               <p>gave them instructions—the police acted under Messrs. Humphrey's instructions—the inquiries of the police did not lead us to discharge the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner knew of the occurrences in the bank, it was general knowledge, and he had to help in looking up the work—inquiries were made of him—when we found that pages were missing we set a clerk to mark off the places, and then we discovered that cheques were missing which were not recorded in the cashier's book, and that Mr. Cooper's cheques, which ought to have been in the house, had been abstracted—we found that out almost at once—the prisoner knew that cheques were missing—we commenced on April 7th when Mr. Cole first called our attention to a leaf being torn out of the book—Mr. Cooper had had his pass-book for some time, and therefore it was not written up, and the cheques ought to have been in our possession—their dates were 21st January and March 4th—we made no personal charge against the prisoner and gave him no reason for his discharge, except that we did not require his services any longer, and we gave him a month's salary on May 4th in lieu of notice; we acted under the advice of our solicitors—there are 27 clerks in the bank—the prisoner has been there since May, 1881—on 14th November he was doing duty which did not require him to pay any money over the counter, he had no authority to pay cheques—the same answers apply to January and 4th March—the night porter might come as early as 7 p.m. if the clerk asked him, he would very likely get a tip for doing so—if the clerk did not so arrange he would be there from 5.30 to 9 o'clock alone—on Sundays the man who attended there would come when the night porter went off—I think the night porter came on at 9 and went off at 9—dinner was provided for the clerk on Sundays, and he was allowed to have a companion—clerks who kept house were allowed to change their Sundays one with another—there was no deficiency in money, but there was a deficiency of 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cheques—my saying that note 40,861 left the bank on that date depends on the correctness of the entries—the notes were there in the morning and not in the evening—the strongest case of the prisoner's writing is this, "H. Johnson, 61, Jermyn Street," I have not the least doubt that that is his writing; it is done, I believe with a quill pen and with upright letters, his usual writing is diagonal—I think the word "John" in "St. John's Wood" on this envelope is the same as the J in "Johnson"—there is hardly any loop to the "e" in Jermyn Street, and in the two "o's" the stroke is blotted together, but not absolutely closed. (<hi rend="italic">The witness pointed out several features of resemblance between the writing on the notes and the prisoner's writing.</hi>) I think all these are written by the same person, but some are written with a steel pen and others with the back of a pen—I admit that the G's in "Gooderich" and "Grove Road" are different.</p>

Johnson, 61, Jermyn Street," is his, but it is perpendicular—to the best of my knowledge this "Gooderich," "Castle," and "Hol<lb/>loway" are his writing—I speak from my general knowledge—there is no record whether Mr. Cooper's pass-book went out after 19th November—it is made up to 6th December—if these had been regular transactions the cheques for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would have been in the pass-book, which</p>

Building Society, but whether it was the 11th or not I cannot say—I applied to the prisoner, by letter for payment of the money due to Mr. Kidd, but did not receive any—I did not, in September, 1881, receive 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Mr. Kidd; or in December, 1881, another 80<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> or in July, 1882, 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never received any of these sums—I did not lend or make an advance of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the 8th E.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Theodore Jones, Hill, and Co., chartered accountants—I manage the liquidation matters—the affairs of the 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th E. C. Societies, and the 9th London, were placed in my hands, and with the exception of the 12th, orders have been made to wind them up, and proceedings are now pending to wind up the 12th—I have investigated the accounts of all these Societies—the total deficiency is about 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have received no assets—I found that in each of these Societies there was kept a cash-book and general ledger and a share ledger—I know the prisoner's writing—these books are nearly always entered by him—the share ledger should</p>

               <p>show the number of shares held by each person, and the amounts paid off by them—the cash-book and general ledger appear to have been audited year by year, but the share ledger is quite the contrary—when a book is audited this certificate is written by Mr. Jones and signed by the auditors, and the ticks are all through the books—there are no ticks to show that the auditors have looked at the share ledger—the share ledger of the 11th E. C. Society shows that Mr. Caesar paid 147<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in respect of shares between 1875 and 1881, and also that that sum was repaid in payments of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the last payment being made in March, 1882, closing the account—in the cash-book there is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to Mr. Caesar in September, 1881, in the prisoner's handwriting, and in February, 1882, there is a further entry of a payment of 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Caesar, and in December, 1882, a further sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., showing a total of 292<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to Mr. Caesar—the 12th E. C. Society was not formed till February, 1876, and I find in their cash-book a sum of 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as having been paid to Mr. Caesar in March, 1882, and on looking at the share ledger I find that he never was a shareholder in that Society—there is no entry of his name—the share ledger of the 11th Society shows that in 1877 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due to Mr. Pringle, and it also shows that it was paid in 1877—no entry appears in the share ledger after that—the account appears to have been closed then—the cash-book of that Society shown that 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to Pringle in 1880—the share ledger shows that in September, 1881, Mr. Westmoor's account was closed by a payment to him of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was nothing further due to him except the bonus—I find these two sums properly entered in the cash-book, and also that a further sum of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to him in November of the same year—I find by the share ledger that Mr. Andrews owed to the 11th Society in March, 1882, 609<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—all the books show that amount as still owing—when I investigated the books I called upon the prisoner to explain this, and he simply made this note in the book in my presence: "The balance, 465<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to be debited to me, J. Jones"—he had no expla<lb/>nation except that he had received the money and had not accounted for it—465<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the principal; the 609<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the amount with the interest at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per month—the snare ledger shows that Mr. Meldrum owed the Society 304<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as nearly as we could arrive at the amount, and the books show it as still owing—I called the prisoner's attention to that at the same time, and he could offer no explanation, only that he had received it and not accounted for it—this payment of 607<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the 11th Society's pass-book on 9th March has nothing to do with the payments of Andrews and Meldrum; it was for a debt of the Society with the Con<lb/>solidated Bank—the share ledger of the 9th Society states that Mr. Evans paid off the whole of his indebtedness by the 27th April, 1880; that a further sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was advanced to him—there is no date—I also find in the cash-book in June, 1880, a further advance under the head of subscription, of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Evans—Miss Emily Bailey was a shareholder in the 12th Society—I find by the share ledger that her account was closed by the payment to her of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in November, 1881—there is no further entry in the share ledger whatever—in turning to the cash-book of the 12th E.

I find that sum of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. properly credited to Miss Bailey in September, 1881—the two books do not agree—one is September and the other October, as though two sums were paid to her—I find Mr. Kidd was a shareholder in the 8th and the 11th Societies—</p>

S. Kidd"—that purports to be a loan by them to the Society—there is also another entry in the cash-book corresponding to that—60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. principal was due to Mr. Kidd when he died in 1877, from the 11th E. C. Building Society—the share ledger shows that that amount was paid in one payment in September, 1881—the cash-book also shows that a further sum of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to Kidd in September, 1881—taking all the books of the Society 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was apparently paid to Kidd, for which the Society is debited—I have investigated the books—1,180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is due from the prisoner alone—I pointed out the items to him—he went through them one by one, and admitted the irregularities and the writing in the books—I heard him examined in the liquidation upon this parti<lb/>cular point—I had this conversation with him about the same time.</p>

Bacon's Chief Cleric's report, and a copy of the account gone through by the official liquidator, showing the balance due to Jones on winding up the 7th East Central Society of 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., also the affidavit to which the account is an exhibit—in November, 1882, Jones had advanced to the 12th Society 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and taking the whole book for 1882 he had advanced in April 1,900<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> July, 2,800<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> November, 2,350<hi rend="italic">l.;</hi> and December, 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—deducting the 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, which were not found, charged in this way there would then be still 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during that year advanced by Jones including the 7th Society—Jones has been receiving the moneys more or less since 1880, and meeting the whole of the obligations—the entries in the books are his own, and appear to be entered at irregular periods—I have found no impropriety in respect of the cash payment of subscriptions which Jones has received—he has made one portion of the cash-book do duty for another portion of the cash-book and journal—there is no difficulty in ascertaining the payments, especially in respect of withdrawals—you have only to refer to the share ledger—none of the Societies were wound up by the Chief Clerk—I had an accountant to assist me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not examined the books to see if the auditors have looked at the share ledger—I see ticks—I cannot say whose they are—I do not see any ticks in the subscriptions received—in the general ledger there are ticks—an amount paid over twice would arouse my curiosity—I saw the books of the 12th Society at Mr. Phelps's offices—I have not gone through the books of the 7th Society—my Knowledge of the 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance is from the report of the Chief Clerk and the affidavit made afterwards in support of the claim—in the 10th Society I found'a debit balance in September, 1878, and another in September, 1879—I am not able to say whether Mr. Gardner's figures are correct—Jones stupidly admits 1,180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is due to the 11tb Society—the entries are very few in the pass-book—few sums are paid to the credit of the account in 1882-3-4—all the payments are interest on loans—the 609<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not entered as received from Andrews—the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is entered twice as a payment to Westmore—that affects the balance of the Society; no doubt it reduces it—Bailey's entry of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. appears twice over—in the inner margin is 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and in the other 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that simply shows the sub<lb/>scriptions—various sums have been entered as paid to Kidd amounting to 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from the two Societies—giving him credit for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan which he debits himself with, there is still a balance of 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is the effect of the entries to reduce the balance of the Society to that amount—in addition to 218<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there is a fresh entry of 60l. having been paid to Pringle in November, 1875—by the share ledger 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due to Pringle—the 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. seems to have been Pringle's first draw, and then in July, 1877, Pringle's deposit account was 218<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the two cash-books—Jones has looked at the share ledger, and found that he paid 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1875, and then added it on in 1876—the effect is to reduce the balance in his favour by 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he should have looked at the general ledger—no doubt it is a wrong method of correcting an error—as to the casting in</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> As a test case I do not find any cheque drawn in Jones's favour, showing that he received money on the day of the payment to Evans—there has been no balancing of the accounts from day to day or month to month, by which errors could be detected—Jones is suffering from weakness, defective vision, and I should say his memory is about the worst I ever came across—he is blind in one eye.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Martineau and Smith, of Birmingham—we expected some nails to be delivered by Boyd in consequence of a transaction in the previous February; we had paid him for them, and we ought to have received them within a few days of 28th February—they were Globe horse nails of Mr. Seeley's Company—shortly before 10th April I pressed him for the nails several times; at last I told him I thought he was going dangerously near to getting them under false pretences—he called on me on Saturday, 11th April, and brought an order for delivery of 400 boxes of nails in his own handwriting—the paper was handed over to Mr. Lawrence, one of our own clerks, to obtain delivery of the nails—Boyd said, "I want you to get these nails at once"—I said, "What is the hurry?"—he said, "Oh, you know what a man Seeley is, he might change his mind," or words to that effect—I said, "Well, how are we to do it?"—I consented to send my clerk Lawrence, who by my instructions went to London on Sunday night, and the suggestion of a telegram came from some one—Boyd called upon me on the Monday about 11 o'clock and asked if a telegram had come—no telegram had then come—he came again about half-past 2, and I said, "A telegram has come, Lawrence has the nails, and I have done Seeley out of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he looked pleased and knocked his hands together—the Hardware Journal is ours—Boyd's account is not paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have claimed rather more than 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Seeley—prior to 10th April, 1885, we held Boyd responsible for the amounts due by the Horse Nail and Shoe Company, and would have sued Boyd for the debt—since 10th April we thought it was hopeless to get the money from Boyd, and as the Horse Nail Company had the benefit of the advertisement we thought it was probable they might pay us—this business of the civil trial, &amp;c., has resulted in bitter feelings between the parties—I should say the vendor of the nails has been very badly treated—I was a witness in the civil trial—Boyd claimed 2,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he says he will move for a new trial—I was not rebuked by the Judge at the</p>

I am cashier to Mr. Henry James, who trades as William Roberts and Co., at Birmingham—I believe an arrangement was made with Boyd on 2nd April to deliver some nails, but I was not present—my knowledge of the transaction begins with my instructions from Mr. Edmunds—an agreement was drawn up which was not signed—Mr. Edmunds tore it up—there was a misunderstanding as to the terms of the agreement—Mr. Edmunds left the agreement in my hands, and money to pay over on its being signed—when I went to Boyd to sign it he said "I did not agree to this and that"—100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid in cash and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills—the disagreement was on 4th April, and I thought the matter was at an end, but an appointment was subsequently made for us to meet at Mr. Fisher's, the solicitors to the firm, on Wednesday, 8th, when it was agreed the agreement should be carried out, subject to the delivery of certain nails that were due to us, which had nothing to do with the agreement—the agreement was not good on 10th April, because on the 9th I had instructions to send word to Mr. Boyd that it would not be carried out, as he had not delivered the 100 boxes of nails which he had agreed to do—this letter was sent by our firm to Boyd on the 13th; it was dictated to me; it is dated the 11th—there is no pretence for saying the letter was written to defeat this prosecution; we did not know it had anything to do with it—it was written to show the Wheeler Horse Nail Company.

Sir,—I beg to inform you that having entered into a contract with the United Horse Shoe and Nail Company direct, we shall now decline to enter into the proposed agreement with you, and cannot therefore make you the expected payment to-day on account thereof.

I have been engaged in commerce 18 or 20 years, and Mr. Edmunds about the same time—W. Roberts and Co. is a respectable firm of ten years' standing—Boyd called on the Saturday when Mr. Edmunds was busy and could not see him, and he came again on Monday morning, when he saw Mr. Edmunds, who refused to hand him over the money, and afterwards instructed me to write this letter.</p>

I live at 238, Green Street, Bethnal Green, and am a dealer in horseflesh and cat's-meat—I went to bed just before 1 o'clock in the morning of 27th July—I had shut the front door and all the windows between 2 and 3 o'clock—I was awoke by my wife—I went into the next room, and there found the prisoner—the window was then open and the shutters also—a coat which I had left hanging behind the back room door was lying in front of the drawers—I caught hold of the prisoner and said, "What do you want here?"—he said, "I have come to look for my mother"—he was a perfect stranger to me; I do not know his mother—I struggled with him and he got away—I caught him again; a constable came up, and I gave him in charge.</p>

I am assistant to Hawes and Sons, pawn<lb/>brokers, in Cranbourne Street, Leicester Square—on Saturday, 26th July, about 7 p.m., a watch was brought to be pledged—I advanced 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it purports to be manufactured by Walker—I examined it; I saw what purported to be hall marks; I believed it to he gold—I do not recollect the person who came; it was a man, but I cannot recollect who—on Saturday, 15th August, the prisoner came to the shop about 7 o'clock—I had seen him in the shop before that; his face is very familiar to me—I thought he dealt in goods of that class—the box he came into has a very bad light, we have to have gas—the man who pawned the first watch came into that box—the prisoner gave me this watch (No. 2), and asked me to lend him 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, or more if I could—I examined it and tested it at the back of the shop; I found it was not gold—I returned to him and asked him how much he gave for it—he said 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him where ho had bought it—he was going to say, but he hesitated and did not say where; he gave no answer—I observed that the watch had the hall mark for 18-carat gold—I went; to the door and called in the constable, James Calf—I told him to take the prisoner in charge for offering a forged hall-mark watch—he said he</p>

               <p>their carts called regularly on her with bread—these sales are very busy affairs—there are two regular days a week for selling remnants—the 11th or 22nd was not one of those days—we always have the goods exposed on the counter—the 11th was a day of great pressure of business—we very often get such crowds that there is a difficulty in dealing with them—the counter at which I was stationed is a very long one, not quite as long as this Court—there are 10 other assistants there besides me—this is exclusively a ribbon counter, which was covered with boxes with remnants in them—the people who come to buy these remnants take them up and look at them and put them down again—there are two other counters in this shop, one at the top and one at the bottom—mine is in the centre—the top of the shop is at the other end from the door—there are five at that counter and four at the bottom one—we always keep the same position at the counter—to get to the antimacassar depart<lb/>ment from the ribbon department you would have to go through two shops, it is further in the building, and to get to the banking depart<lb/>ment you would have to go through five shops—ladies loiter about in the shops a great deal at the time of these sales looking at different things—I saw the prisoner two or three times after that during the day on which she was charged with stealing, going from one shop to the other—I have seen her served in the ribbon department since the 11th by other assistants—I do not remember saying at the police-court "I have seen the prisoner twice since the 11th; she then purchased from other assistants at the same counter."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder and decorator, of 59, Stan<lb/>hope Street, Regent's Park—I was at Mrs. Dash's house on Good Friday between 8 and 9 p.m. after they had been to church—I was introduced to the prisoner as a gentleman who was going to marry Miss Dash—I was in his company an hour or so—the next morning I went to the wedding, and afterwards I went with them to the breakfast at the Clarendon, and saw them off by train—the prisoner is undoubtedly the same man who married Miss Dash—I next saw him on Easter Tuesday at the Victoria Station, I having left Brighton at 5 o'clock—he was waiting there to receive his wife—he was talking with a lady of the name of Somers I believe, and he said to me, "Where is Emmy?"—I said, "I do not know, I have not seen her since about 11 this morning"—I called then to bid her good-bye—he said he could not understand why she had not come—I said, "I do not know, I am very sorry," and I suggested that we should stay until the next train from Brighton, which we did—he invited Mrs. Somers and myself to have some coffee, which we did in the waiting-room—we stopped there about half an hour—Mrs. Somers did not stay—I suggested that he should come in a cab with me to Miss Lewis's, and I said that perhaps Emmy had sent a telegram there—on our arrival at Miss Lewis's his wife had sent a telegram—I believe the sum and substance of it was to the effect that she was out at the time his telegram arrived, and would not be able to come to Stanhope Street till about 10 o'clock that night—he represented to me and Miss Lewis that he had been before the Board that day and refused to take this ship—then he pulled out a telegram from his pocket and said that he had received it from a friend of his who was on the Board, or was present at the Board at the time, to say that the Board expressed their surprise to find that he should refuse to take this vessel, and they thought it was a very fine chance for him, and in the meantime he had telegraphed to the Board to say that he would accept of the vessel which was then lying at Plymouth, and had laid there two days waiting with a pilot on board, and that it would cost 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day for a vessel to lie at Plymouth with a pilot on board—he did not give me the name of the vessel—he said he had agreed to take it—after that he sent for a Bradshaw to find the best route to Plymouth, and he made out there was a train leaving Paddington Station at 9 o'clock—he said he would not have the sack from the Company for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he ultimately left me a little before 9 o'clock</p>

               <p>near Hertford Street leading to Park Lane—he got into a cab there—I have been examined and had my evidence taken down by a solicitor—he had a black bag—when he went I said, "Good-bye and good luck to you"—I did not hear any direction given to the cabman—he said he should travel all night, as he wanted to get to the vessel at 5 o'clock in the morning—the next time I saw him was at Walham Green at the Butchers' Almshouses garden party, which I believe was on 9th July—he was in a Highland dress—when I recognised him I patted him on the shoulder and said, "Halloa. Mac! I didn't know you were ashore," he shook hands with me, and after a moment's hesitation he said, "Ashore! what do you mean?"—I said, "Well, I take you to be Captain Macdonald, who married Miss Dash, of No. 10, Broad Street, Brighton, at St. James's Church, on Saturday after the Good Friday, between 8 and 9 in the morning"—he said, "It must have been my brother or my apparition; I should like to have had the pleasure"—he afterwards said to me, "Are you in the trade?"—I said, "No, I am not in the trade, but I have some men here who are in the trade, and of position, I believe"—when he said it must have been his brother or his apparition I said, "If I have made a mistake I will apologise, but if you are not the man I never saw him"—he asked me if I was in the trade because I was stockily built, I suppose, and some butchers are—when I mentioned three gentlemen in the trade, Mr. Grant, Mr. Kalkick, and Mr. Peter Toker, he said he knew them well—then I went to the marquee where the dancing was about to take place, where I saw Mr. Grant—the prisoner asked me several times if I would buy some tickets—I said no, I had done buying tickets for the day—I made an arrange<lb/>ment with Mr. Grant, and went to his house about the 13th to meet the prisoner—I previously went to fetch Miss Dash and Miss Lewis—I went to the room first; Miss Lewis entered, and then Miss Dash—Miss Lewis turned round directly she saw the prisoner, and said to Mrs. Grant, "He is the man," and I believe she said, "May God forgive you"—Miss Dash said, "Donald, how dare you stand there and deny me? You know you are the man. How can you wipe that scar from your forehead? and what about your tooth? Why don't you own me? You know you are the man. Say yes, and I will forgive you if you will only own me"—he said, "If I say yes then it will all be over"—I said, "Remember if you say yes you commit yourself," and after that he said he wished for something to be settled by the Wednesday, if not he should send his family away and take the consequences—he asked Miss Dash if she would go to his home and see his wife, and the thing would be explained—Miss Dash was crying and pleading for him to own her, and she objected to go to his wife.</p>

I am a meat salesman at No. 32 in the Central Meat Market—I live at Highbury—the prisoner is now in my service, and I hope he will be for many years—he has been in my service since 1st July—this letter of 16th September, 1885, is the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "32, Central Meat Market, 16th July, 1885. Dear Sir,—I am sorry to have to trouble you on your holiday, but I think it my duty to let you know how things are. You remember my saying that I was claimed as a Mr. Macdonald at the garden party, and treating the matter as a joke. Mr. Grant asked me to meet the person at his house, and I willingly did so. The young lady, to my surprise, was of the same mind, the result being that I had to appear at the Guildhall this morning, and the case has been put off till Thursday 2 o'clock, and out on bail. I am able to clear myself, so I hope you will not let the matter spoil your trip. I must say that my position is not at all comfortable, but have no fear but that all will come right.—I am, yours faithfully, J. Malcolm.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am President of the Market Association, and am a member of the Court of Common Council—I went to Brighton after the prisoner's apprehension to make inquiries, and saw the curate, Mr. Kirby—the first thing I did was to ask Mr. Kirby to describe the man—he gave me a description—I certainly should not have recognised the prisoner from that description—he did not describe the prisoner to me, he described another man altogether—on 8th July, after the Butchers' Garden Party, the prisoner came to me and told me of his own accord what had taken place—I went with the prisoner for the purpose of making inquiry at Mr. Chodwick Brown's, the dentist, either the last day or two of July or the first day or two of August—I made inquiry of the dentist—that was after the charge was brought against the prisoner—on 8th or 9th July I remember his being racked with toothache in my counting-house—I saw him the next day or the day after—he was not then suffering from toothache—I can't swear definitely that I then saw that he had a tooth extracted; I missed it afterwards—on Tuesday, 2nd April, I saw the prisoner at 12 o'clock at Messrs. Pearce's, the solicitor in Giltspur Street, with reference to this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was to come into my service in consequence of this agreement—he would be materially benefited by so doing in a peauniary point of view, to such a degree that he would be likely to make his fortune; it is my belief and hope that it would be so. (<hi rend="italic">The agreement was put in and taken as read.</hi>) I was away when he was taken into custody—he had the entire control of my business; if he had wished to abscond he could have done so with a large sum of money—he signed cheques for me—I had a good balance at my bankers' at the time—I always have had, and still have, unlimited confidence in him—since he has been out on bail he has continued to have the same privilege of signing cheques as before—I have been in the habit of seeing him from day to day, both before he entered my employment and since—there is not much alteration in his appearance; if any, it is that his beard is a little longer than it was—he has not cut his beard or whiskers—I never saw them quite so long as now, but there is not a great deal of difference—he has been a total abstainer from his birth, I believe—I have tried very hard, and have never yet been able to find any one who has ever seen him drink any alcoholic drink—he signed this agreement in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at the register</hi>) this has a certain resemblance to the prisoner's handwriting, but I am</p>

               <p>able to say from all I know that it is not his handwriting; I mean, from looking at the signature I should be sorry to say it was, and I should be sorry to say it was not—there is a certain resemblance, certainly—I say the same as to the second register—I should like to see a letter that was put in at the police-court signed Symonds, and dated from the Strand—Messrs. Lewis and Lewis had it—this paper with the word "Darling" on it is not in the prisoner's handwriting, to the best of my belief; I should be much more decided about that than the other—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at the affidavit made before the Surrogate</hi>) I will swear that this signature is not the prisoner's handwriting.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I first saw these registers on the Monday after the prisoner's apprehension; I saw one at Brighton, I think, not both—I can point out a material difference between the two registers—I should imagine they are signed by the same person, but I could point out a difference which an expert would point out—I do not doubt that both registers were signed by the same person—I am only pointing out that the signatures are not alike—I say there is some similarity to the hand<lb/>writing of the prisoner; I will not say a great similarity—I can point out a difference between the "Macdonald" in the register and the "Macdonald" in this letter—the "M" in the register begins with a round dot; in the register there is no dot; and in the second register there is no turn to the "d," though there is in the other—there is another difference, there is a distinct hiatus in the register between the "a" and the "c," and there is none here.</p>

I am manager of the Victoria Hotel, Brighton, which is in the Queen's Road about 150 yards from the station—the prisoner came there on Good Friday—I am a Scotchman, so is the prisoner—our hotel was very full at the Review on Easter Monday—I heard the prisoner ask the barmaid if he could have a bedroom there—she was uncertain—I went into the hall and asked him to wait a minute while I saw my wife, who was then in the kitchen—I called her up, and she said Mr. Malcolm could have room No. 30 for that night, and to-morrow we should have to put up a bed in No. 26 sitting-room—he said he preferred staying with us instead of going elsewhere.</p>

It was on the Wednesday before Good Friday that the prisoner brought down the case of rings for me to see at Brighton—they were different kinds of rings, most valuable rings; there were not any plain gold ones or keepers; they were diamond rings, pearl and coral, and there might have been other stones mixed with the diamonds and pearls—there were about 12 to 20; I could not say how many, but a row of rings, a case of rings—he did not give me any of them or leave any of them with me—he told me to choose one, and I did—he said I had not the one he wished to give me, that I should have pink coral, that I might have the one I chose, but when I tried it on it was too large, and he said he would take the case back and have the coral one added he had one of my rings to measure, but that had not been altered—I was to have the two made smaller—I got my own ring back; I never had the other rings that were promised—I did not first see the wedding-ring at the ceremony; he showed it to Miss Lewis on Good Friday evening; I first saw it then—if my mother said that he brought the rings down on the Tuesday that is a mistake—I am not sure when I had my own ring back, but I think on the Thursday—he took it back again to have the rings made the same size as that—some rings were shown me on the Wednesday—I had given him my ring before that—he asked me for a ring to take to town—I am not sure of the day I gave him the ring to take to town, but I think it was on Tuesday, I cannot fix it positively; I should say Tuesday; it must have been Tuesday, it was not Sunday, it was after he proposed to me on Tuesday, and he took it up to London for the purpose of getting a ring of that particular size—he brought down some rings on the Wednesday, but they were none of the right size, not those that I chose—he gave me back the ring I gave him as a pattern either on Thursday or Good Friday—he has not yet given me a ring of the same size, they were to be altered to that size—my mother has the ring I gave him as a pattern.</p>

Kitchener and Co. was painted up, and immediately after I saw goods and packing cases arriving—the good were merinos, cashmeres, and serges, and were there until recently—I saw them there because the house was being repaired at the time, and the roof was partly off and water got through, and I went in the rooms to see if the goods were spoilt—there were no table, chairs, desks, or boxes there—I saw this stamp when the officer came there, not before—I do not know what was done with the goods—I saw packages brought in and taken out by Kitchener and Grant—they were the only two I saw there—Kitchener remained there some weeks, I could not say how long—some time after Easter a bill of exchange was brought there for over 100 francs—I gave it to Kitchener when he returned—I never saw him afterwards.</p>

Norman and Stacey, furniture merchants, of 79, Queen Victoria Street, who let furniture out on the hire system—on 30th August Hodder made a proposal to hire about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of furniture—he left us a reference to a banker's and a business, and we made inquiries ourselves and through our bankers and were satisfied—we allowed him to have 186<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, which were sent to 135, Salcott Road—he signed an agreement for the hire of that on 27th September and paid an instalment of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, the remainder to be paid in 36 monthly instalments—on 2nd June Norman and Stacey seized the furniture at 135, Salcott Road, and in order to take it away had to pay 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing for the rent; we have since sold the furniture by auction for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 24th September I had an application from Grant for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of furniture; he gave Hodder as one of his references at 17, Queen Victoria Street—we sent to Hodder—we supplied the goods, and on 28th October an agreement was signed for them—the instalments have been paid regularly when due—on 28th March we received an application from Klein senior for 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of furniture—he gave references and a guarantee as well, and we sent him 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of furniture to No. 6, Garrick Street under an agreement of 26th November to be paid for by monthly instalments of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has been paid, but that includes 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the insurance company for the property de<lb/>stroyed by the fire under a joint policy—in the end we had to seize and move the goods—I don't know who was in occupation of the premises when we did so.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 167, Queen Victoria Street—in December last I became acquainted with Hodder, whom I knew as Tournier and Grant—they represented themselves as watch manufacturers in business together—under their order we printed 50 cards for them as watch manufacturers in the name of Tournier and Co., 145, Queen Victoria Street—we printed more cards for him, 50 or 100 at a time—I saw Grant write this order for cards to be sent—the "A. Tournier, Esq., Manchester" is his writing, it was brought to me by Kitchener—I also printed this for Grant: "Victoria Dock Bakery, 4, Frederick's Road, Canning Town. Shippers supplied"—I also printed this for Grant: "Grant and Co., merchants, Paul's Bakehouse Court, Godliman Street," and also these describing him as sole consignee and agent for Sohuler and Co., Antwerp, and giving his address—he also left this in what looks like his handwriting for us to print from—from it we printed this invoice: "Sole consignee for Robarta and Co., of Antwerp, Paul's Bakehouse Court"—on 15th May we printed 50 of these invoices for Gould: "Bought of W. Hayes Gould, 30, Watling Street, E.C."—he came for them himself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I am a member of the firm of Galpin and Crochard, woollen and merino manufacturers, carrying on business at Amiens, in France, but at this moment in liquidation—both I and Galpin had an ordinary education—we commenced this business in 1879, when I was 21, and were doing business in October, 1884—on 8th October I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Signed Klein and Son, stating that they had letters from religious communities inquiring about cloth, and would be glad if Messrs. Galpin and Crochard would supply them with their samples and prices, and that they would give the best references in Paris and London, and all possible guarantees.</hi>) I replied to that and then received this of 25th October. (<hi rend="italic">This was headed P. K. Klein and Son, Tourist, Railway, and Hotel Agents, 6, Garrick Street. It acknowledged the receipt of a book of samples, and requested by way of trial that a piece of anacost, at 3 francs 40, should be sent, giving a reference Pere Maurice, Notre Dame.</hi>) We executed that order, and were paid for it, 300 francs—those letters</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188509140116"/>
               <p>were in the elder Klein's handwriting—on 7th November we received this, signed by the younger Klein, and with a postscript by the elder one, (<hi rend="italic">This ordered more cloth, and enclosed a bill for 1,000 francs.</hi>) That bill was met at maturity. (<hi rend="italic">Other letters were read: one in the elder Klein's handwriting, of 24th November, asking if he could not have 30 days' credit, and requesting a piece of merino and cashmere to be sent; a letter of 5th December, acknowledging receipt of the goods, and enclosing an account showing that Klein was indebted 687 francs; and a bill for 328 francs at 60 days; this also requested that goods should be sent by express, and that they intended pushing the stuffs among all the Convents and High clergy in Great Britain, and would wish to be the sole agents in Great Britain; and a reply from Crochard stating that he would be glad to see Klein if he would go to France; and a letter of 13th December from Klein asking for further goods, and stating that they had written for good representatives in Holland and Belgium to their friend the Dutch priest, and that the younger Klein would probably be with them in a fortnight.</hi>) Before that the elder Klein had paid us a visit at Amiens, when we had arranged with him the terms on which he was to remain our customer, and extended the credit to 60 days, and constituted him at his request our agent and representative in London, and permitted him so to describe himself on his letter paper—it was also arranged at that interview that he was to introduce customers to us, having one or three per cent. on all the business they did, according to the client—the customers were to have 30 days' credit generally, except Tournier, with whom the terms were 20 per cent. for cash, 30 per cent. at two months, and 40 per cent. at four months—I showed him over our warehouse at Amiens—on his return he wrote the letter of 13th December. (<hi rend="italic">A letter of 22nd December from Klein was read; it enclosed a bill in settlement of the last invoice, and stated that he would write tomorrow about a grand lot. A voluminous correspondence was put in and read, passing between the defendants and M. Crochard, relating to various transactions between them and others.</hi>) Klein and Son guaranteed the payment of Kappenberg's account—they were Klein and Son's own acceptances in the cases of Kappenberg, and they were fully responsible for the account he opened, and it was on that account I increased the commission I allowed to Klein to three per cent.—Klein was responsible, and had three per cent. therefore for all but Tournier; for him he was not responsible, and therefore only had one per cent.—that is in the main the correspondence between us—between the beginning of January and the middle of April we supplied 95,000 francs' worth of goods to Klein and Son—we received for them 88,000 francs' worth of acceptances from them, and there was an uncovered balance of 7,000 francs between us when we went into liquidation—of the 88,000 francs, 74,000 francs were dishonoured at maturity—to Kappenberg I supplied about 1,000 francs' worth, receiving acceptances for the same amount, which were all dis<lb/>honoured at maturity—to Courty, Foster, and Co. I supplied 15,000 francs' worth, receiving acceptances for the amount, of which 13,000 francs were dishonoured—to Tournier and Co. I supplied 47,000 francs' worth, receiving an equal amount in bills, of which 34,000 francs, the bills I received through Klein for Messrs. Grant and Co., purported to represent about 10,000 francs, the whole of which were dishonoured—I received about 9,000 francs of Kitchener's through the same source, of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188509140117"/>
               <p>which the whole was dishonoured; about 9,000 francs of Gould's, all dishonoured; about 1,300 francs of Carnsick's, all dishonoured; about 6,000 francs of Wagner's, all dishonoured; of Charles Bird, of Shenton Street, 800 francs, all dishonoured, and 847 francs of James Brown, all dishonoured—I did no business with McDonald—at the time I parted with my goods I believed in the prisoners' solvency completely, and at the moment I received the bills I believed they were good and valid securities for the payment of money, and that Klein, Kappenberg, Tournier, Gould, Grant, Kitchener, and the persons named on them were carrying on genuine trades and businesses; if not, I should not have parted with my goods—where the bills came from Klein's cus<lb/>tomers I believed they represented debts owing to Klein—upon those beliefs I parted with my goods—I am at this moment in liquidation, owing to the dishonour of these bills for 122,000 francs, and 7,000 francs uncovered, altogether 130,000 francs.</p>

I am a packer and finisher, at 4, Distaff Lane—in February last I was introduced to the firm of Tournier and Co.—their only representative I knew then was Grant; afterwards I knew Hodder as Tournier—from time to time large quantities of goods were taken to my premises straight as they arrived from the Continent, and were cut into half-pieces, measured, rolled on boards, and papered and prepared for delivery—the marks of the manufacturers were taken off them when they were brought there, off the fag ends of the pieces—this went on till some time in May—sometimes we delivered them to different houses and sometimes they were fetched away by their own cart—on 7th April I received 13 cases on account of Robarta and Co., to A. Grant's order, of Paul's Bakehouse Court—afterwards we were instructed to transfer Roberta's goods to Schuler and Co., to be hold to Grant's order—afterwards we received goods on account of A. Schuler and Co., to hold to Grant's order—we still have 52 pieces of the goods in our possession.</p>

I am a commission agent, of 6, Foster Lane—I received patterns from Hodder, which I was to sell for him, in the first place he told me at 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the end I went to Messrs.

Bradbury, Greatorex, and Co.—I believe Grant told me to sell there, and I got a cheque for fully 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I handed to Grant, I believe—I remember being in Gutter Lane and seeing black merinos of the same quality going in to Bentley's; Hodder was walking about outside with Mr. Ellis, Mr. Dobree, the pawnbroker's, foreman—I attempted more transactions, but could not effect them—I sold on a commission of 2 1/2 per cent.—I had some expenses allowed me, and in one instance when I got a better price I had 5 per cent. and expenses—some</p>

Kitchener and Co."—there is a person McDonald, who calls himself a merchant—I then went to 39, St. Andrew's Hill, where the name of Kitchener and Co. was up, but partially painted out—the office was a small back room on the second floor—I found empty cases there with the prosecutor's initials on, no furniture of any kind, no books or papers, but samples of dress stuff which Mr. Crochard recognised, and a stamp—on 5th June I went with Outram to the Elm public-house, Way<lb/>burn, Surrey, where I found Hodder in the bagatelle-room of the public-house on the ground floor, darning some stockings—he had then no whiskers nor moustache—I told him we were police-officers, and that I believed his name was Albert Edward Hodder—he said "Yes"—I said "I have a warrant for your arrest, I will read it to you"—I did so, and said "Are you the person referred to in this warrant?"—he said "Yes," and after some refreshment I brought him to London—Outram searched him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a woollen merchant—the prisoner Bucks has been with me about eight years—his duty was to buy and sell goods and to keep stock and give orders to travellers—when we happened to be out of a particular article it was his duty to replenish it, and keep the stock up to the amount—he did that of his own accord—he had no authority to sell goods to any customers without having them entered in my books—in March I was dealing with Cawthra and Co., and bad done for some time—this is the copy of an invoice which I received from Cawthra and Co. for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have paid that amount, but I have never received the goods—this is the prisoner's signature (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for those goods on 19th March—I never saw that till after this inquiry. (<hi rend="italic">Two invoices were here put in; one for four pieces of goods, 15l. 1s. 9d; the other was:</hi> "March 25th, 1885. Mr. France, bought of M. E. Bucks.")

The receiving note has Buck's signature, and the invoice has been debited to our account. (<hi rend="italic">Another invoice was put in for goods told to Mr. France for 14l. 9s. 9d.</hi>) He had no authority to send these goods to France—none of these goods are debited in my books to him—I have known France as a customer since August, 1881—in some instances when he has bought goods direct from my house, he has bought them through Bucks—he knew Bucks and his position in the firm—they would be entered up in the books, and would be delivered from my warehouse—I am not in the habit of buying goods wholesale, and delivering them direct to my cus<lb/>tomers; they are invariably brought to the warehouse first—on 1st August I went to Mr. France's with Detective Wright and asked him if he would be kind enough to show me the invoices of the goods he had bought of me—he said "Yes; all I owe you is 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Have you not bought any other goods of us?"—he produced these two invoices and said "No, only these; I have paid you for what you have sent me in</p>

               <p>statements"—I said "You have bought goods of Bucks"—he said "Yes, I have had a couple of transactions with him"—I said "I think it is right to tell you, before we go any further, that we have had occa<lb/>sion to give Bucks in custody for dishonesty, and this gentleman here is a detective officer, you have had more than two transactions with Bucks"—he said "No, I don't recollect that I have had any others"—I said "Yes, you bought four pieces of Italian on July 2nd of him"—he said "No, I didn't buy four pieces, I think I bought one"—I said "No, you bought four"—he said "It might be two, but not four"—he then looked on the file and found an invoice for four pieces of Italian on July 2nd for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is the one without a receipt stamp, with France's heading scratched out—I said "You see we are right; we did not come up here on any wild goose chase; you have been buying goods of him for the last 18 months"—he produced two other invoices; one for six rolls of satin and six pieces of canvas—I said "Yes, you have got them here," and put my hands upon them—he said "Yes, those are the goods," and asked me not to give him in custody—he said "I have given a very good price for the goods"—"Well," I said, "I won't enter into that with you; you knew Bucks was in our employ"—I asked if Bucks had sold him these goods by sample—he said no, Bucks had sent them up and settled for the price afterwards—the detective was there all the time—he said I might take the whole shop, but not to take him in custody—I told him I could not hold out any promise; I should have to consult my partner—I did not give him in custody then—Bucks was brought up at Guildhall and then France was given in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KISCH</hi>. Hundreds of other persons deal in Italian cloth—it would be a breach of Bucks's duty to purchase goods in his spare time, not for us, and sell them again, it would have been dishonest—his hours were from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and he was paid by salary—France has been a woollen-draper and trimming seller in the Harrow Road for some years; that is a considerable distance from me—I said nothing at the police-court about the conversation which I had with him, I have not mentioned it till to-day—when I went there on 1st August my property was exposed to view, and I recognised it at once—he did not expect to see me—I asked him about the transactions, and he told me about it and referred me to the receipts on his file, showing me the transactions and what he paid—it frequently happens in our trade that persons buy bankrupt stock at a great sacrifice, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth would be sold for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know that France attended on subpoena to give his evidence, and he was taken outside the Court and arrested; that was the way he was caught—there is a receipt in every case for the goods which he paid for—he told me that he is 64 years of age.</p>

Josephs and Co. direct, but goods have been delivered from Bucks's during that time about 10 times, and in each case I have seen payments made by France to Bucks direct—once I went and paid the bill and once or twice France went; I only know one occasion in which France paid Bucks any money on account of Josephs and Co.—these two delivery sheets of March 19th and May 26th, No. 13 on one and 2 on the other, were signed by me on for those goods—this delivery sheet at No. 28 is signed by France's daughter—these three lots of goods were received on the premises to my knowledge, most of them were taken away by Detective Wright on 8th August—two pieces were sold to a man named Collingford, who does business in the tailor's trimming line, he goes about the country hawking with a horse and trap.</p>

The property was in the middle of the shop in front of the counter—these two pieces formed an insignificant portion of it—persons in that position do trade to a small extent with their own money—I was present once when Bucks brought some Italians in a cab—France said he did not want them—Bucks pressed him to buy them, and he did so—this business has been established 14 year, in Harrow Road.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 6th August I received a warrant from Guildhall for Bucks's arrest, and on the 7th I saw him at Margate at 62, King Street—I told him I was a City police officer, and held a warrant for his arrest; I read the warrant to him—he said, "This is not a matter for the Court, let it stand over until I come back from my holidays"—I said, "You will have to come back with me"—he said, "No, I will not come back with you to-night"—I said, "You will have to go now if we can get a train"—I took him to the Town Hall, and brought him to London next morning, and he was charged—on the 8th I went with Mr. Abrahams to France's house in Harrow Road—Mr. Abrahams asked him if he would show him the invoices of the things he had bought of his firm, and told him who I was—I then asked him to look through his file and show me all the invoices he had relating to Bucks—he looked and handed me one for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one not receipted on plain paper—I asked him to look carefully through his file, as he had had more than a dozen transactions, and it was a very serious matter—he looked through, and handed me this third invoice, and said he had no more, and he had had no further transactions with Bucks—I said, "These are simply cash receipts for the goods made here, not receipts; you bought these goods 30 or 40 per cent, below cost price, you must have known they were stolen," and asked Mr. Abrahams to give him in custody—he said he would consult his partner—I said that he ought to give him in custody—five rolls of canvas and three rolls of Italian cloth and three pieces, were selected and put on the counter, and we brought them away and told him we would call again on Monday at 3 p.m.—we went again on Monday with Mr. Abrahams and he was not there, and again on Wednesday and he was not there, and on Thursday I left a subpoena for his attendance at Guildhall on the hearing against Bucks, and he attended—I saw the witness Skelton on each of these occasions—the whole of the evidence was gone into against Bucks, and then France was given into my custody—I took him to the Old Jewry and charged him, and brought him up at Guildhall for committal—I commenced to search him; I asked him what property he had about him, and he pulled out of his pocket these five papers and handed them to me. (<hi rend="italic">These were receipts for 2l. 19s. 6d., 3l. 3s., 2l. 5s. 8d., and other sums, for goods bought of Bucks.</hi>) I told him he would be charged with feloniously receiving the whole of the property from Bucks on the dates named in the invoices—he said.

I keep the Golden Lion, Dean Street, Soho—on 23rd June the prisoner came there and gave me this cheque and said "Will you change it for me?"—he was in the bar parlour; a general conversation was going on—I said "Is it all right?"—he said "Yes"—I gave him the money—I paid it away to my tobacconist, and it came back marked "Account closed"—I parted with my money believing him to be a respectable man, having been introduced to me by a customer—the prisoner called a few days afterwards and said "For God's sake don't part with that cheque, I find that my account is wrong; I shall have some money in a few days, and I will come and pay you"—I said "It is too late; I have paid it away."

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, of 3, Lisson Street, Hoxton—previous to June 23rd I worked for Mr. Wooster, of 207, Oxford Street, and was entrusted with the key of his premises—I knew the prisoners, and they knew I had the key—about 10 days before this Bygrave said, "Halloa, <hi rend="italic">Bill,</hi> I hear you have got the key of Mr. Wooeter's door; if you can get some fish I can sell it for you; if you give us the key we can get in and get some fish"—I said, "I have been at work at Mr. Wooster's a long time, night and day, and never done such a thing," but I did it, and the policeman caught me—I went with Bygrave and undone the door about 2.30 a.m., and we both went in and got some fish—I pleaded guilty at this Court (<hi rend="italic">See p.</hi> 431), and was let out on recognisances to come up when called upon—we met Robertson as we went to the house, and he helped us with the fish on to a barrow, after I had unlocked the door and gone in and got out the fish—a policeman then came.</p>

When monoy is advanced on mortgage a considerable margin is left—I should advise a client to lend only half the amount the property was worth, with regard to agricultural property—in some places unoccupied house property is almost more difficult to sell than land; it is very difficult to realise on at the price at which it has been valued or lent on—I should say it was almost impossible now to realise more than two-thirds of the mortgage price on it—we thought we might by the action possibly recover our money after the sale proved abortive from Mrs. Taylor or Mr. Rendall, who got into it by taking the transfer of the Collison mortgage, which was on 29th September, 1884—I think unoccupied house property has been decreasing in value since 1880—a higher value might be put on it in 1880 than now—I thought The Towers worth the upset price of 3,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On 22nd July I had a warrant to search The Towers—I got in by a window, one pane of which I found broken—I opened the catch and went in—I had previously knocked and rung at the door, and received no reply; I was in plain clothes—when I got in I heard a voice say "Who is there?"—I saw the younger prisoner—I said "I am an inspector of Scotland Yard; you know your mother is in custody on a charge of fraud, I suppose?"—she said "Yes"—I said "Is your name Miss Taylor?"—she said "Yes"—I said "I hold a search warrant to search the house for property supposed to be contained here obtained by fraud"—she made no reply—I said "Have you any pawn-tickets here?"—she said "My mother told me not to say anything about it"—I searched the house, she being with me—I was shortly afterwards joined by Constable Nunn, and Knight, an ex-sergeant—in one of the dresses behind the door of the bedroom I found these four pawn-tickets: Mr. Coburn's for a fork and spoon; Mr. Spong's for Mr. Pentland's silver flask; Mr. Coburn's for Mr. Bumpas's boots; Mr. Devereux's for Mr. Lebas's piece of silk, and two others relating to silk which has not been identified—I said to the prisoner "Whose dress is this?"—she said "Mine"—I searched through the house—I found a lot of new goods in a place between the top ceiling and the roof, which I got to by a ladder through a trap-door—I found a large quantity of new boots, a set of lawn tennis, new crockeryware, and other valuable property—in the bedroom I found three travelling trunks, very nearly new, not identified by a witness in this case—I have have had applications for tho property; I also found two boxes con<lb/>taining 320 white tiles for painting on, picture frames, three long lengths of calico, new, 50 pieces of unused music, cigar cases, eight new pairs of lady's boots, and other goods—some of these were in the rooms over the stables, where the prisoners were living at the time—I should say the value of the property I found was from 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found an unused gas-stove in the stable and coach-house, which Mr. Hunt has identified—it was amongst a lot of crates, coals, and empty boxes—in the cellar I found three wine cases, with these labels of Mr. Hudson on them—the kitchen, a sitting-room, and a bedroom were partly furnished—I should think there were 24 rooms in the house altogether—the rooms over the stable were furnished; they were suitable for a coachman—no room was used as a study—I saw a new easel iu one room—I found</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant and carry on business at 20, York Buildings, Adelphi—in February, 1885, I had a room at the Outer Temple, 225, Strand, room No. 64, where I was carrying on my business—at that time I was a debt collector for Mr. Braham, a person I had known for some years—it was necessary at that time in many of these matters that legal proceedings should be taken—I was conducting the business under a deed of assignment; I then knew a Mr. Percy Sewell as a solicitor's clerk, and I believed him to be clerk to the prisoner—he called upon me in February with the prisoner and introduced him as a solicitor—the prisoner said "Mr. Sewell has explained to me your re<lb/>quitements, I am willing to co-operate with you"—I said "I have several matters of business, the papers relating to which you see now on the table, for a Mr. Braham, which principally arise out of a deed of assignment, he is the assignee—under that deed I have made applica<lb/>tion for payment to the several persons indebted, and being an unqualified person, as you know, I can take no legal steps"—he said "Very well, I am perfectly willing to allow my name to be placed on the office door and for the business to be carried on"—I then had a <hi rend="italic">Solicitor's Journal</hi> on the table and I looked at it, but I did not see Mr. Lamb's name in it—it contains the Law List, and I said "Where are you carrying on your business now?"—he said "Well, I have no office now, but I had an office in October last in Renfrew Road, Kennington Lane"—I said "Excuse me, have you your certificate?"—he said "No, I have not"—then I said "You are useless to me"—he said "Well, it is unfortunate, I have the certificate itself from the Law Institution," producing it at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188509140172"/>
               <p>the same time, "but the fact is I have not been able to find the money to stamp it, can you find it?"—I said "Well, I won't say anything about that at present, you had better let the matter stand over for a short time, say a week, and see me again"—upon that the interview terminated, I believe—I had explained to him that there were several matters which I thought would involve litigation and good profits might arise, and he said "Well, I hope we shall come together"—I think I told him I had had over 20 years' experience in the profession, and that Mr. Braham knowing my capabilities would require me to attend to various matters—the prisoner and Sewell called about a week afterwards, and then there was another solicitor's name on my office door—I had made arrange<lb/>ments in the meantime—his name was Mr. Fulcher—I said to Lamb in consequence of his not having his certificate I had been compelled to arrange with another gentleman—about ten days after that the arrange<lb/>ment with Mr. Fulcher was broken off—he was suffering very much from gout and was in infirm health altogether—I wrote to Lamb, and he after<lb/>wards called with Sewell—I told him that in consequence of ill-health Mr. Fulcher found it very inconvenient to attend at the office, and I told him of the termination of the arrangement—I said "Now, Mr. Lamb, have you your certificate?"—he said "No, I have not, I have been thinking over the matter," and simultaneously he produced a draft bill of costs—I do not wish to say against whom, unless his Lordship requires it—the amount of it was 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said "This has been delivered over a month"—if we only take legal proceedings against the party we are sure to get the money, as he n✗olds a responsible position under the Corporation—I asked him to let me look at the bill, and he did so—I said "If I can procure you the money for your certificate are you willing to assign your interest under it?"—he said "How much do you think you could get?"—I said "I cannot say, Mr. Braham is the gentleman who will do it, I have no doubt"—he said "Well, I will leave it to you," and he was to call again in a day or two, and I was to see Mr. Braham in the meantime—I did so either the next day or the day after and told him I thought it a good debt—I saw the prisoner again and explained to him what had taken place with Braham, namely, that, Braham would give 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the debt provided Lamb would assign his interest—he said "Well, I am quite willing, it is rather low," meaning a low sum—I said "I cannot do any more; he is a Jew, and you know what Jews are; there is a lot of risk in these things, as you know; you may sue people, but you do not always get your money;" and he said at last, "I will take 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; when do you think the money will be forthcoming?"—I said, "In a few days, no doubt; I will prepare the deed"—Sewell was present at every interview—I said, when Lamb was with me, "Before this is finally completed, what terms are you going to arrange? you see I have a respectable office"—I cannot give you the date of this, but it was all in February—I said, "The offices are decently furnished, and apart from Braham's business I am in a position to introduce other good matters, and if I am instrumental in getting your certificate, that is another benefit to you; the rent of this office is 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the housekeeper's expenses are a little over 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he said, "Well, what do you think?"—I said, "I would rather you make the proposition"—he said, "You name it"—ultimately the proposition was that each should receive half the profits, I to find the money out of pocket in matters I introduced,</p>

               <p>and he to do the same in matters he introduced—he said, "Well, on the condition that I am not to be called upon to pay office expenses"—I said, "That is rather hard," but ultimately he said, "Well, say half"—I said, "It would only be fair, Mr. Lamb, that we should embody these terms in writing"—he said, "Oh, I could not do that, because it might get to the ears of the Law Society"—I said, "I should be very sorry to prejudice you in that respect, therefore I will trust to your honour"—I then asked Mr. Sewell to retire; he did so and I said, "Now, Mr. Lamb, before we finally conclude matters it is a very painful admission for me to have to make, but I must tell you that I have been twice in trouble; I am anxious to redeem the past and to go on in a straightforward manner," and I told him that I had received 18 months and also a term of two years—the date of the first was 25th May, 1879, and of the second in the November Sessions of this Court, 1882—he said, "Well, Mr. Simmonds, it is very unfortunate, but I am sure, having suffered what you must have done, it will be a caution to you in the future; I like you all the more for your candour; we will waive that"—I said, "Now, having explained that to you, how are we going to manage? for I must conduct the matters on behalf of Mr. Braham, and other matters, in fact, that I introduce"—he said, "Oh, certainly, I have no objection to that, I shall only be too glad of your assistance; of course, for the purpose of carrying out the business, you will represent yourself as my clerk"—I said, "Of course, being an unqualified person, Mr. Lamb, I can do nothing else; I have conducted matters of business for solicitors for some years, apart from my ordinary employment of a clerk, and I have always been requested to represent myself as clerk"—he said, "That is quite understood"—I think we had a little refresh<lb/>ment, and the interview terminated—his name was put up, and I paid for it, the names appearing on the office door as "Mr. Simmonds, Mr. Lamb, solicitor, commissioner, &amp;c."—Lamb and Sewell daily attended at the office, and Lamb introduced a matter of Tidy <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Luff—he brought the papers from Ealing—he asked me to look through them, which I did—I said, "There has been very great delay here"—I made an inter<lb/>locutory application for judgment against Luff—I obtained the judgment under Order 14—I took out the summons myself at Lamb's request, and I attended before one of the Masters; I forget which one at the moment, but I think it was Master Francis—I should say that it was attended by Counsel, but I attended with Counsel—I prepared his brief and paid his fee—I would not be sure who delivered it, whether it was Sewell or myself—I paid for the filing and all those things—the learned Counsel, Mr. Terrell, argued it before the Master—I was successful, and there was an appeal, when the judgment of the Master was confirmed for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with costs—I signed judgment—I think it was about 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not the bill of costs here, I suppose Lamb has it—I made them out, and charged for everything as between party and party—Lamb looked them through afterwards, and we settled them together—I cannot remember the amount of the costs—there were two sets; there were the costs before the Master and the costs of the appeal—I should think the two sets together would be about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were affidavits on both sides; I forget who prepared them, but I think Lamb; he had them prepared for some time; I should not like to say for certain; the matter had been neglected for two years, and I could not say whether I prepared them or</p>

I paid Sewell 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Lamb owed him for overdue salary—it was arranged beforehand that Sewell was to be paid—he was in very great distress; he had two sick children—I paid him another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. two or three days after—the other 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I kept on account of what was coming to me—I paid the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the bank for safety, I did not care to carry about so much—I think I saw Lamb on the 23rd—Tidy got none of the money entirely through Lamb—Tidy lived at Ealing—he had a banker—I had differences with Lamb—we both knew Tidy's money had been recovered, but there were some costs to come out of it—we had 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for costs, but there were other costs as between solicitor and client—I could not say from memory what those costs were; they were a considerable sum, and it is some months ago; it might be about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a writ was issued, appearance entered, and defence delivered, and then I took out a summons under Order 14—the cost of the summons would be only 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—then there was drafting affidavits and all that sort of thing—the brief fee paid was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was a <hi rend="italic">Fi fa</hi> and a lot of expense—I met Lamb on 23rd May at either Charing Cross or the Wellington—I told him what I had received, and I gave him a letter from Mr. Webster Butcher, of Bouverie Street—it was in consequence of that letter that I paid the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in—Lamb could not attend at the office—I think I received the letter on the 22nd—I think it was on the 20th that Luff paid me the money—I am sure it was the day I received the letter that I paid it in—I wish to be correct—I have not my pass-book here, I have it at home; at least not my pass-book, but paying-in book and cheque-book—I had notice to produce my books at the police-court; I have not the notice here.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">A letter was handed to the witness</hi>. ) I have not seen this document before, cer<lb/>tainly—the handwriting is very much like Mr. Barratt's—I believe it to be his, to the best of my belief; he sometimes writes very irregularly—I asked Mr. Barratt to write a letter of introduction to the bank—I believe he did so—I do not call that an introduction, that is a reference—I gave Mr. Barratt's name as a reference—I went myself voluntarily—they asked me for a reference—I think the account was opened on the 22nd—the date of the letter is the 29th—I could not be sure whether it is Mr. Barratt's writing; to the best of my belief it is. (<hi rend="italic">Another letter was handed to the witness</hi>. ) I do not think this is Mr. Barratt's writing—he writes so irregularly, and there is a great difference between the two—I could not swear to the writing—I have a brother who I am sorry to say is at present in trouble; he is at Reading Gaol—I should think the reference to the bank is not in his handwriting—I will not swear it is not—it is not like my brother's writing, certainly, and I should say it is not his—he lived at Dulwich—I will not swear that the letter is not in my brother's handwriting; it is not like his, that is all I say—I think it is like Mr. Barratt's—Mr. Barratt promised to write to the bank; that is why I gave him as a reference—Mr. Barratt lives in Lambeth, at 20, York Buildings; it is not my office, but his—I cannot exactly remember whether Mr. Barratt said he had written that to the bank—the manager told me he had received a letter—I have already given you the best of my belief on that—I cannot recollect the date when my brother went to gaol—he is only awaiting his trial—I should say he was not in gaol on the 29th—I understand he is there on a charge of stealing 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which there is not a tittle of evidence—Mr. Braham is the prosecutor, and I should say <hi rend="italic">persecutor</hi>—I mean my friend Mr. Braham, who advanced the</p>

               <p>money—my brother previously did business for him, and knowing me longer he said "Will you take up my matters for me?"—I did not pay a single sixpence of the 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Tidy—I paid 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether to Sewell and kept 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a portion of what was owing to me—I used the balance for the purposes of my defence, under legal advice—I did not convey to the solicitor that it was Mr. Tidy's money, paid to me in discharge of a debt due to Tidy, in that explicit way—I think I told him so—he did not advise me to expend the whole of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my defence—I told him there were differences between Lamb and myself—he did not ask me whether I paid any of it over to Tidy—I considered that I was entitled to spend the money in defending myself against such a wicked charge that was made against me—Lamb incarcerated me in prison—I have not the amount of the bill of costs paid out of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not a single sixpence of it left—I have spent it all in defending myself at the trial here. (<hi rend="italic">A cheque was handed to the witness</hi>. ) <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Look at the endorsement on that cheque, "Fulcher." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I signed that by his authority, as a matter of business; I had Fulcher's authority in February to sign his name generally in matters of business. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>.

To endorse his name on cheques? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I do not say that; if it was not expressly said, it was implied. In all matters of business he gave me liberty to sign his name—I do not think I have ever endorsed his name upon another cheque—I think that is a matter of business—I really do not know who the other person is who endorsed the cheque—it is no doubt the name of the person who cashed the cheque, when I got it cashed—out of that cheque I paid an instalment for hiring office furni<lb/>ture—I never paid the proceeds, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to Fulcher—there were some matters of business between us—I paid the cheque to Moeders—there was a contra-account between Fulcher and myself in respect of some moneys I disbursed—I made an affidavit in the County Court, in pursu<lb/>ance of the County Court form, that I was Lamb's clerk—I have sworn that I was; it is true in one sense. (<hi rend="italic">A document was produced</hi>. ) That is my affidavit, made in conformity with the County Court rules as to the service of a document. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I, Thomas Simmonde, of Outer Temple, clerk, in the permanent and exclusive employ of John Henry Lamb, &amp;c.") I hope I shall be allowed to explain about that affidavit—my trials are already in evidence—I was convicted on 26th May, 1879, of conspiring to obtain goods by fraud, and sentenced to 18 months'—I have suffered for that; and in the month of November, 1882, I was convicted of receiving a stolen cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., knowing it to have been stolen—I was not then a solicitor's clerk; I was not in any employment—I was sentenced to two years', and have suffered for that, and I thought there was an end to it—there was, at the time I was convicted of receiving the cheque, knowing it to have been stolen, an indictment for forging that cheque, but I did not forge it—that has not yet been tried—I took an assignment of the bill of costs of Lamb for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which he got 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the amount of the deed, but Mr. Braham lent him the other 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I brought an action against a gentleman in the Corpora<lb/>tion, in the Mayor's Court, and recovered a verdict in Lamb's name and at his request—I took offices in the Outer Temple in the beginning of last January—I had not paid any rent—the furniture was distrained upon.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Alverscourt Road, Dulwich, and was formerly a clerk in the defendant's service when he carried on business at 2, Lower Renfrew Road, opposite the Lambeth Police-court—I left him in October, 1884, in consequence of the depression of his business—he gave me this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) explaining the reason—I had seen Lamb on several occasions between that time, and when I called on Mr. Simmonds he had not any office—I went with Lamb to Mr. Simmonds's office in February last—I had been introduced to Mr. Simmonds—negotiations were opened, but afterwards broken off—about the end of February I went again with Lamb to Mr. Simmonds—an arrangement was come to that Lamb should occupy part of the office at the Outer Temple with Simmonds; that Mr. Lamb's name should be painted on the door, and that Simmonds and Lamb should divide between them the profits of any business that came there from the introduction of Simmonds or Lamb, but that Mr. Simmonds was not to look to Lamb for any salary, and that he was not to be expected to pay for anything in the shape of rent or cleaning expenses of the office, and so on; that Mr. Lamb should have no liability whatever—at the latter part of the interview Simmonds said he should like Mr. Lamb to make some agree<lb/>ment in writing between them to embody the terms, but Lamb said he would rather not as it would be dangerous, as the Law Society might possibly hear of it—the arrangement further was that if Lamb came into the office with Simmonds I should retain a seat in the office as Mr. Lamb's clerk, and Lamb said he thought he could pay me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, or he would be glad if it could be more—afterwards Lamb and I went regularly to the office every day until the latter part of the time about May—legal business was transacted there, and Mr. Simmonds did the active part—he would draw affidavits if required, and I copied them—after Simmonds was in custody I saw Lamb at Ealing; he wrote to me from his private house—I went, and Lamb told me that he wanted to speak to me about Simmonds; that he had given Simmonds into custody—I said I had heard so, and Lamb said to me "What are you going to do?"—I said "I have heard you have charged Simmonds with em<lb/>bezzling 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and you swear he was your clerk, and that you paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; is that so, Sir?"—Lamb turned to me and said "What if I have?"—I said "It is a very serious matter, Sir"—he said "What can I do? I must put myself right with Tidy," and he asked me what I intended to do—I said "I can only say what I know; I think it is a very serious matter"—he said "Well, you have nothing to gain by keeping with him; you had better stick to me."</p>

I am a builder, of 202, Clapham Road—in September, 1884, I had a house 40, Nelson Square, Blackfriars Road, to let—Sidney called on me and represented himself as a retired naval officer, giving his address as 2, Bessborough Gardens—he said he lived in the house with Mr. Grey, who was the landlord, and that he paid for half the house, as he would pay for the house in Nelson Square—owing to the lease expiring I wanted to receive the rent monthly—he said his income being quarterly he should prefer it quarterly—I asked him for references, and he named Grey and a Mr. Baystable—I wrote and got these letters, one from Grey, with a monogram on the top (<hi rend="italic">Both of 9th May, and speaking in similar high terms to the other letters</hi>)—on September 15th I received from my daughter the agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), signed as it is now (<hi rend="italic">Of 15th September, 1884, rent 55l., payable quarterly</hi>)—he took possession—I gave him notice that I should call on a particular day for the first quarter's rent due Christmas—I did not get my rent—I gave him notice to quit in March—I got this reply of 21st June (<hi rend="italic">Asking the witness if he would retain the lodgers to write by return of post</hi>)—on 25th June possession was given to me—I employed Morgan, a broker, who got no money; there was nothing to distrain upon, and the house was all let out to lodgers.</p>

A. B. Gor<lb/>don, and I as agent let it to you on the understanding that I should hand it over to you at the expiration of his tenancy, but the landlord refused to take you, and we had to hold the house on—six months' rent is due to me—I never had any account of yours—I have had several applications for your debts, and among them the tax collector.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I am a journalist, for<lb/>merly of Namur, now living at 32 1/2, Greek Street—I saw an advertise<lb/>ment to the effect, but not in the same words, as this one. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that servants of both sexes were wanted for England, that English was not necessary, and that expenses would be refunded; application to be made to Barnard,</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">A, Noel Street, Berwick Street, London;</hi> 30 <hi rend="italic">centimes to be enclosed for an answer</hi>. ) I wrote to Barnard and received this letter in reply. (<hi rend="italic">This had a printed heading, French Registry Office, &amp;c., J. Bar<lb/>nard, director,</hi> 21, <hi rend="italic">Noel Street, and stated that they had several situations as professors in schools, with salaries from</hi> 100 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 200 <hi rend="italic">francs per month, with board and lodging, or as French correspondent with</hi> 75 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 300 <hi rend="italic">francs a month, or as correspondence clerk and bookkeeper at a firm of diamond merchants at</hi> 400 <hi rend="italic">a month, and requesting him to send references and</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">francs for inquiry fee, and adding they would charge</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">per cent. on the first year's salary as commission</hi>. ) I sent references and 10 francs to Barnard, and received this letter from him dated 10th July. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that in eight days they would be able to put him into communication with the diamond merchants who required a clerk and bookkeeper, and who they hoped would accept his services</hi>. ) In consequence of that I came over to England on 25th July, and went to 21, Noel Street two or three days after my arrival, but saw none of the prisoners there—I was told to call again, and I went again next day, when I saw the three prisoners—I asked for Mr. Barnard; Launet came forward as if he were he—he said the place for which I came had been taken two or three days before, but that they had a place at that moment which would suit me, and to which I should be introduced; that was to be the director of Mr. Dompe's club at 40, Charlotte Street, near Fitzroy Square—I went there with Linden, who called himself Durant, and after having a glass to drink he introduced me to Dompe—after doing so he said, "Now I have intro<lb/>duced you to Dompe, and if you suit him we shall speak of the matter to-night"—we did not speak of business that day, but next day I went again with Linden to the place, and then Linden spoke to Dompe by himself, after which he informed me that Mr. Dompe expressed now some objection to my getting the place, and that he asked a deposit of 10,000 francs, but that through his intervening with Dompe on my behalf Dompe would be satisfied with 3,000 francs—I told him I would write home for the 3,000 francs and try to get them—Linden said, "Remain here and write the letter," and then he left—I afterwards went to Noel Street, where I saw Linden, and said Dompe did not require a servant, but somebody to take charge of the club, with 3,000 francs deposit—Linden said, "If your father should object to pay the money from hand to hand without depositing it at a bank, let your father</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188509140203"/>
               <p>sign a bill, which I will hand over to Dompe, and he will be satisfied with that"—after that I called several times at Noel Street and always saw the prisoners there; I have seen all three at Dompe's house—I chiefly dealt with Linden—I got no situation—the police informed me not to deposit any money, and I did not do so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Barnard.</hi> Although you did not write to me posi<lb/>tively to come over, the meaning of your letter was to that effect, and I believed I was to come because you said you would put me into direct communication with the place—I received no letter saying that if I was wanted they would write to me to come over—I never asked you to repay me the 10 francs—I saw you in Dompe's cellar, where I went to taste some wines; I cannot say if once or several times.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Launet.</hi> You did not say you were Barnard, you always spoke and acted as if you were; you took no further part in my affairs—it was Linden with whom I had to do.</p>

(I did not ask you to) when you found I was about to telegraph for some money—I wrote, and an answer by return of post enclosing 200 francs came to my name at Barnard's address—the prisoners opened the letter, but the money was by draft and they could not get it; they gave me the letter opened—I returned the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is possible that at the police-court I did not mention the sum of 10,000 francs which I was asked at Dompe's—I never said Dompe told me he did not want any employe—I did not know he was in want of a confidential person to take an interest in the business and deposit 3,000 francs—I should have had one or another place if I had deposited a lot of money—Barnard's firm have not fulfilled their obligations because their letters never mentioned anything about a deposit—it is true your letter mentioned simply the places and nothing about the terms.</p>

               <p>holiday was only a holiday for the clerks, but that the principals prolonged their holiday during the whole week—two days after he gave me a note to Mr. Dompe, and told me to go there, but to speak of nothing till he came, and he gave me a memorandum to get my dinner there; he was a member of the club—I went there; it is a club in Charlotte Street; I had dinner, and waited till Linden and Launet came—Linden and Dompe spoke together, and then Linden told me to go upstairs to take a cup of coffee, and on the staircase he told me Dompe would give me 400 francs a month to be the manager of his provision and wine warehouse—he said Dompe was going to give 300 francs at first, but he interceded, and he then consented to raise it to 400 francs—I had not said whether I had any experience of the wine business—in the passage Linden took me on one side and said, "Now the matter is arranged, but a deposit of 300 francs is required"—I told him I had no money at the time, but on writing to my mother no doubt I could get it—he said he would write a letter as well to my mother in support of my application, and he said, "Your mother can send the money to me or Mr. Barnard"—on that day my week's lodging terminated—I went to take my box away from Bar<lb/>nard's office and found the door locked and no one there, and all the things, including my own, were seized—then Inspector Moser spoke to me.</p>

I am a wine and provision merchant—in July last a Mr. Gull introduced Linden to me as a customer—I asked him what kind of goods he would want—he said wines and provisions—he told me he had registry offices in Belgium, France, and England—I asked him where his office was, and he said "Near to your house"—he asked me if I required a partner or manager, accountant, book-keeper, or clerk, and he would get me one—I told him as the business was getting on better now I should like to have a partner if I could get a suitable person for the business—the next day Linden asked me to come to his office—the prisoners came to my place—Launet said "If you will come at 5 o'clock to my place I wish to speak to you"—I went with Gull to Noel Street—the prisoners and another man were there—Linden said "I have written to France and other parts, and two gentlemen will come, and I have no doubt that one of the two will suit you; I will cause him to deposit 3,000 or 5,000 francs in my pocket, and then I will send him to you to treat; once I have the money in my pocket, and you have come to terms with them yourself, I shall prepare the agreement," the terms of which were that the money was to be paid as a loan at six months' interest in advance—I said "Well, if one of these gentlemen call upon me and I find him suitable I will accept him"—he said "You call him a gentleman, I call him a <hi rend="italic">type,</hi>" meaning a man not of great consequence, or "one of the set"—I said "Well, if the man suits me I will make an inventory of my stock, and will take him as a partner; I shall then have an agreement drawn up by a solicitor, and if we should dissolve partnership the money will be refunded to him"—he said "No, no, that must not be done like that; in a little while you will pick a quarrel with him somehow or other, and turn him out of doors, then send him to me, and I will just give him a touch of my boot to a certain part, and send him back to his own country, and you need not return him the money before the expiration of the contract in three or five years accordingly"—I did not fall in with the arrangement—I communi<lb/>cated with the police—this occurred the beginning of July.</p>

Sindoux Dutap, and Saumi came in and said "We have come for our situation, we sent you the 10 francs, and wish to enter it"—I asked them to point out Barnard to me: they pointed to Launet—I said to Launet "I shall take you also in custody for conspiring with Barnard to defraud M.

Taicht out of 10 francs"—he said "None of these persons can produce a document that we asked them to come to London"—I said "Is not your real name Brillon?" he denied it, hesitated, and then said "Yes"—I said "Under what name are you going now?" he said "Linden, of 59, 60, and 61, Hatton Garden; here are my keys, if you go there you will find a clerk to-morrow morning"—I went and found a portfolio containing a foreign newspaper with an advertisement in it, also a quantity of papers addressed to Barnard and Co., also these two books, in which are entries of receipts for post-office orders, all for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 10 francs, and "Sindoux 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d.,</hi>" and "Dutap" and "Dubourg" for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., "Van den Dries" for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and "Meurant" for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d.;</hi> and in the other book "Taicht 10 francs;" I also found this sheet of post-office orders, marked by the prisoners, 65 altogether—I counted between 20th June and 18th July, 125 post-office orders—it was a large office in one house—there was a desk, table, and three chairs; no business books beyond these two—we found a great many letters—from August 14th to 17th they received 230 letters, con<lb/>taining 13 post-office orders, addressed to Barnard and Linden—we found at Noel Street a book with entries in different places; also Mr. Hind<lb/>let's name as proprietor of and successor to the business at 31, Old Comp<lb/>ton</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 143, Barking Road, Canning Town, and am a soda water manufacturer; the prisoner has been an assistant of mine nearly six years, and on 23rd July we agreed to part—about 2 o'clock on the afternoon of the 27th I went into my shop and saw the prisoner—he asked me to give him a written character—I told him I had not re<lb/>ceived one with him, but I would give him a verbal one—he walked deliberately out of the shop and said, "Governor, me and you have not done together"—about half-past 9 on the same evening I and my wife were sitting in the shop—it is wide open from the street—my face was towards the door—the prisoner came in and said "I have come for that character"—I said "George, I did not receive one with you, but I will give you a verbal one"—he then deliberately pulled a revolver out of his right-hand breast pocket—I heard the click and saw it pointed at me, and said "George, don't make a fool of yourself," and moved my head; as I said that the shot went by my ear—he said "Take that"—when he fired it I was sitting on one end of the seat, and he was standing at the other end—the seat is 4 feet long—I did not hear the breakage, but when I looked round I saw a looking-glass behind me broken, and the shot at the bottom of the corner, and it took a piece out of the wood—he turned round immediately and cocked the revolver again, I heard the click distinctly—my wife leaped at him and held him, and threw both her arms round him—directly I got up I said "Let him go, I will face him"—I was afraid he would fire at her—cries of "Police" and "Murder" were raised, and the police came—I did not see the bullet found.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I instructed no solicitor to prosecute—I was shown into a room at the police-court after waiting a quarter of an hour—there were three or four average aged women there—the prisoner was not so old; she was the only person wearing a hat—I told the police the woman who came into my shop wore a hat; the others had bonnets on—I had never seen any of them before—I gave her the meat before she said it was for Mrs. Farley—I thought she was a respectable woman—a detective came for me to go to the station next day—I did not give a description to the police—Mrs. Farley's husband did—I did not interfere till the police called on me, and said they had got a woman in custody who answered the description, and wanted me to identify her—there are two Mrs. Farleys in Wellington Street—I first asked her if she was the photographer's wife after she had the mutton—I have not got the mutton back.</p>
