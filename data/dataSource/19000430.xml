Levi's premises—I was with other officers—we followed them and saw them go together to 35, Radnor Street.—Nathan's pockets were bulky—Kirby came out and went to 100, Down<lb/>ham Road—his pockets were full—when he left, his pockets were thin—on April 5th I was with Constable Hind and arrested Kirby, and after<lb/>wards Nathan—after I had arrested them I went to the prisoner's house at 100, Downham Road—Mrs. Ascher came to the door—it is a private house—I asked for Ascher—she said, "He is in bed"—this was at 11 p.m.; she called him, and I said to him, "We are police-officers; do you know a man named Kirby?"—be said, "Yes"—I said, "He is in custody for stealing fur necklets, and you are suspected of buying property of him; I am going to search your house"—he said, "I bought some property of him"—he took me to his bedroom, and produced 20 white llama necklets, three blue circlets, and three blue borders—he said, "They are what I have bought of him"—I said, "How much did you give him for them?"—he said, "It is only rubbish; I gave him 2s. 6d. to 3s. apiece for them"—I said, "Have you a receipt for them?"—he said, "No"—I asked him how he became acquainted with Kirby, and how he bought property from him—he said, "I have known him and his brother for years; I thought he was in business for himself. I met him in a public-house about 12 months ago, and asked him to get me some fur for my wife; he brought me some, and I have bought of him ever since"—I said, "How did he bring these circlets to you?"—he said, "Always wrapped in brown paper, and carried them under his arm"—I searched his house, and found a quantity of necklets and skins, which he refused to give any reference to, except that they were chamber masters' cabbase—the prisoner's wife afterwards said to me, "Don't get him into trouble; you had better take £5"—before that was said some conversation took place between the prisoner and his wife in some foreign language; I could not understand it; then the prisoner said, "What do you want? say something; I cannot spare £5, as the rates have just been paid"—he was taken to the City, and, in the presence of Kirby and Nathan, I said, "These," pointing to the necklets, "have been found at Ascher's house"—Kirby said, "Quite right"—I said, "How much did you get for them?"—Kirby said, "Two-and-six all round"—Ascher said, "He told me he got them from his brother"—Kirby said, "That is not true, Ascher"—Ascher was charged at the station; he made no reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found 58 black skins—he told me they had been sent to him by a Mr. Grant—I believe the prisoner has had dealings with a Mr. Grant—Ascher speaks English quite well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mortgage broker and surveyor, of Leyton Grove, Brecknall Road—in January, 1899, 1 made Armstrong's acquaint<lb/>ance, and he gave me particulars of some property which was for sale at Edgware—he afterwards showed me the plans—I have ascertained that the property belongs to Mr. Richard Berridge—it is called the Little Stanmore Estate—there are about 330 acres, and the price asked in January, 1899, was£200 an acre—I told Armstrong that if everything was in order I might be able to do something with it, as the price seemed extraordinarily low for land in that posi<lb/>tion, so near to London—he said it belonged to a client of his, a very wealthy gentleman, the owner of a large quantity of property in different parts of the country; that he was in a very pre<lb/>carious state of health, and he wanted to turn his property into money—5 per cent, commission was promised me—I said it was a very large commission to pay—the usual commission would be from 1 to 1 1/2 per cent.—he said, "Well, if you place it quickly, we are prepared to pay you that sum, as Mr. Morris, the owner, wants to get rid of it"—a few days afterwards I saw Morris at Armstrong's office, when Arm<lb/>strong gave me this commission note, agreeing to pay me 5 per cent.—he then went into his other office and had some further conversation with Mr. Morris, and came back and said, "I am prepared to give you that; as you have had a lot of trouble, I am prepared to give you another I per cent., but you will have to give me half of it back"—so I was<lb/>promised 6 per cent. on something like £60,000—the plan I had given me was marked Lot 1 and Lot 2, and so on—that was taken from me, and Morris gave me another—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—on it I see that the frontage to the Edgware Road is broken, so far as the estate is con<lb/>cerned, by Edgware House and the White Lion public-house—I said what a pity it was that the frontage was broken—Morris said that he had a very good offer for the White Lion, and that he had sold it, but it was very foolish of him, and that Edgware House might be bought back again by the intended purchaser—be did not say that he had sold it, but that he had no control over it—I asked him if he was the owner of the land—he said yes, and he had been for many years—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190004300012"/>
               <p>said he had a good Parliamentary title to the whole estate, with the exception of five or six acres, and as to that he had a time title—Morris and Armstrong said that if I could get £150 an acre for the land they would take it, but an alteration in the commission would have to be made—I introduced the matter to Mr. Price, a solicitor, and made an arrangement with Armstrong to go to Mr. Price's office, at 20, Great Winchester Street—I went there with Morris and Armstrong, and introduced them to Mr. Price—I said to Mr. Price, speaking of Morris, "This is the owner of the Edgware Estate, Mr. Price; perhaps you will go into the matter with him"—Mr. Price put several questions to Morris about the property—Morris said that he had a Parliamentary title—he produced plans, and said he was prepared to accept £150 an acre, that he had been the owner for 13 or 14 years, and that he had collected the rents, which amounted to about £827—Mr. Price asked if that covered the interest—he said, "No"—he said he had given Mr. Berridge a mortgage for £30,000 on the property, and if the rent did not cover the interest he would put a little out of his own property—Mr. Price asked him how he became possessed of the property—he said, "Well, the fact is, I did not buy it for myself; I had to buy it for a syndicate, and I was to arrange the price; it was on a Saturday afternoon, after bank hours, and I was to give a cheque for a deposit for something like £1,500, and I was to call on the gentlemen who I was buying for on the Monday morning, when they would give me the money to meet the cheque, and when I went on Monday morning the gentlemen repudiated the bargain altogether; I then went to the agents, and told them I had been deceived, that I could not complete the purchase, as I had not as many pence in the bank; they said they would hold me to it, and that they could not alter it"—then he said that he went to Wimbledon to see Mr. Berridge, who said that he would hold his cheque for six months for £1,500 if Morris would meet it at the end of the six months—nothing was decided, but Morris offered to sell it for £140 an acre—from what I heard from other people I went to Messrs. Tweedie &amp; Tweedie, solicitors, of Lincoln's Inn Fields, where I made inquiries—after that I heard from Mr. Price the result of another inter<lb/>view he had had with Morris and Armstrong—then I saw Armstrong at his office—he said he did not think Mr. Price was a buyer—I replied that I was certain that Mr. Price was not a buyer, as I had found out the true character of Mr. Morris, and Mr. Price would have nothing to do with it—then I said, "I am surprised at you giving me all this trouble, as you must surely have known the character of this man"—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190004300013"/>
               <p>and added, "Let the thing go"—I said, "Who is going to pay me for my trouble? I ought to have at least £50"—he said, "Oh, you are going to start to blackmail us, are you?"—I said, "No, but I ought to have something; I have spent seven or eight weeks over this, and I think I ought to be paid for my trouble"—all I got was half-a-crown—after that I saw Morris at Armstrong's office, and I said to him practi<lb/>cally what I had said to Armstrong—I told him what I had found out about him—I received this letter from Fernley—before I received. it I told Mr. Pye, a surveyor, and Armstrong what I had found out about Morris—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I am astounded to hear from my client, Mr. Henry Morris, that you have been, for reasons best known to yourself, making slanderous statements about him. You have, so he tells me, been stating that he has been prosecuted twice for selling two estates which were not his to sell, and I am instructed to inform you that unless a full with<lb/>drawl and apology in writing is received by me by return, proceedings will be taken against you for slander")—on March 16th I went and saw Fernley at his office, 85, Coleman Street—I showed him the letter, and said, "I have come to answer this in person"—he said, "Well, what have you got to say? I think it is rather dangerous for you to come to a solicitor"—I said, "I don't mind that; I have come in answer to this in person," and I repeated exactly what I had said before—I told him that Morris had been convicted, and the rest—he said, "It is rather dan<lb/>gerous for you to make such a statement as that"—I said, "I am quite prepared to abide by it"—then he said, "I have not known Mr. Morris a very long time; I am very much obliged to you for coming to tell me this; it will make me cautious in the future"—that he had done some work for Morris, for about £50, and he thought he had very little chance of getting it—I mentioned the Edgware Estate, and said that, after a lot of trouble, I got a gentleman to make the purchase of it, but I had found out that Morris had no title to it; that I had been to Tweedie and seen their manager, and he repudiated Morris in every shape or form—Tweedie's were the solicitors for the owner of the estate, and had collected the rents for 13 or 14 years, and nobody else had done so, and that they had sold the White Lion public-house.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 22, Great Winchester Street—on February 24th, last year, Mr. Borras brought Morris to my office—I had already received particulars of an estate which was supposed to be for sale—Morris was introduced to me as the owner—I asked him how he became possessed of it—he said 30 or 13 years ago, I do not remember which—he had entered into a contract to buy the land as an agent for some other persons; that they declined to carry out the contract, and he then went and saw the owner of the estate, Mr. Berridge, who had said that he would let him have the balance of the purchase-money on a mortgage, and give him time to meet the cheque—Morris said he had given his own cheque for the deposit; I do not remember for how much—I asked him who collected the rents—he said he had always collected them, and that they did not come up quite to the interest on the mort<lb/>gage—I asked him if he could show me a receipt for the last interest on the mortgage—he said his solicitor had the receipts—he did not say who his solicitor was—he said he was in Chancery Lane—he said he had sold the inn which fronted the Edgware Road to please Mr. Berridge—I made no offer at that time—after he had gone I made inquiries—Borras had mentioned the matter to me before he came with Morris—on March 7th Morris and Armstrong came together, and asked me if I was in a position to make an offer—I said I was not satisfied about the title—I said to Morris, "I am told that you don't collect the rents"—I think Armstrong replied, "Oh, the title is all right"—he said it was not usual, until the contract was signed, to go into the questions of title—I asked them if they knew a man named Letts—they both of them said they did not know the name at all—I said to Morris, "I believe it is not many years ago since you were prosecuted with Letts"—Armstrong said to Morris, "Why, that is the villain who nearly ruined you"—Morris then explained that they had been prosecuted with a man named Morten for getting money on cheques, and that Letts had given him the cheques to cash, that he had been imprisoned, but that Letts had absconded—Armstrong then said, "Letts has nothing whatever to do with the title of this land"—I said, "The story of Letts has a great deal to do with Morris being the owner of the land"—Armstrong then said, "Oh, come on, it is no good stopping here; he has not got a purchaser,"and they went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 7, King Street, Cheap<lb/>side—I know Bennett—on August 25th, 1899, he called on me and produced this memorandum of agreement (<hi rend="italic">Produced,</hi>) which purports to be the counterpart of a contract for the sale of an estate at Edgware—it is signed by Morris, and has got at the end of it a receipt for a deposit on the purchase money, "Received by cheque the sum of £5,827 10s. as deposit and part payment of the within named property from Charles Bennett, Esq., the purchaser"—when Bennett produced that contract he said that he had bought the property and had sold it again; that his purchasers had paid the deposit referred to in the receipt and asked me to act for him and look after his interest—I said that I would—I knew him before—he never told me the name of his purchasers—at the fag end of the chapter he said that the solicitor acting for the purchasers was a Mr. Galbraith—I asked him if he had a written contract with his purchasers—he said he had not one—I drafted one for him and sent it to him to get it signed by his purchasers—as far as I know, it was never executed—I do not think I ever saw it again—at a later date he brought this plan, which was seen by my clerk, but I did not examine it—in the early part of October I drafted this endorsed contract for signature by his purchasers—I never heard of any mention of an option of purchase—on November 2nd Mr. Minton Slater called upon me as solicitor acting for Longman—I did not know him before—he asked me for information about this alleged purchase of the Edgware Estate, and I gave him such information as I had—I knew Morris; he had been introduced to me by Bennett about October 25th—I saw Morris after I had seen Mr. Slater—I told Morris that I had had a call from Mr. Slater, the solicitor acting for a Mr. Longman, and asked who Longman was—Morris said, "I owe money to Longman," and that he had asked Longman, to wait for his money till this matter was through—Bennett handed me this letter as coming from Morris—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated July 31st, and stated that Morris was quite prepared to return to Bennett any sum over and above the £150 per acre, and would convey to him or his nominee at any price he might require.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am an outside stockbroker, at 16A, Tokenhouse Yard—I knew Armstrong before January, 1899—on September 1st he brought Morris to me; he said that Morris had entered into a contract to sell some land, and was desirous of borrowing money, pending completion—I asked Morris for particulars—he produced a contract of sale entered into with Bennett, and this cheque for £5,827 10., on the London and South-Western Bank, Hammersmith Branch, dated September 14th, 1899, and signed "Bennett &amp; Son"—I asked him how it was that it was post-dated—he said that Bennett would have the money on that date—I read through the contract—I asked Morris if he was the owner of the property—he said he was—I said I should like that confirmed by his solicitor—he siid his solicitor was Mr. Fernley, and Armstrong volun<lb/>teered to fetch him, and went out; Morris remained—about five minutes after Armstrong returned with Feruley, and I asked him if he identified Morris as the party to the agreement—he said that he did—I then asked him if Morris had a good title to the property, as I was advancing money—he said, "He has"—he then went away—I agreed to advance,£100, £50 on that day and £50 next day—I then handed Morris a cheque, for £50—Morris was a stranger to me—I had known Armstrong before—Morris gave me a promissory note for£125, and also signed a letter of charge on the estate for the total sum of £300 as security—Armstrong said that Morris would pay £25 for the loan, and as he was getting a lot of money out of the sale, Morris could offer a bonus, and the amount was suggested by them—next day Morris came again, and brought this letter, signed "Charles Bennett"—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that the purchase of the Edgware Estate from Morris was bona fide, and would be carried out to the very letter, and that all the arrangements with the gentlemen behind him would be completed by the date on which his cheque would be payable.</hi>)—on seeing that I handed Morris a further £50—I believed that he was the owner, and was entering into negotiations for the sale with Bennett—a few days after that Armstrong came again—he wanted to know if I would advance a further £400, making £500 in all, on the contract, pending completion—I said that before advancing further moneys I must ask my solicitor to go thoroughly into the title—I do not know if I mentioned Mr. Minton Slater as being my solicitor, but he is, and I mentioned it afterwards—after that conversation I received this letter from Morris—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he was surprised when he heard the name of the solicitor, and did not want him to go to people where he had to go for thousands of pounds, and that he would repay any money rather than have anything to do with him.</hi>)—I think I had mentioned to my solicitor that I had had transactions with a Morris, and he said, "Oh, I know a Morris; he was a bankrupt"—Armstrong had said nothing about it, he must have told Morris—a few days after that I got this document from Fernley—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that Morris instructed him to say that he wished the question of a further advance to be dropped, as he did not wish the mortgagees to know of any negotiations for the sale of the property, as if it did not go, they might call their money in.</hi>)—I did not advance any more money—the promissory note for £125 fell due on October 4th, and was not paid—I gave notice to Morris, and got</p>

               <p>this letter in reply from him—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that although Bennett had failed him so far, he had sent into the country for the money, and he might have it by any post, when it would be at once sent on.</hi>)—at that time I had the cheque for £5,827, which had been left with me—I paid it into the bank, and it was returned marked, as it is now, "Account closed in 1893"—I think that was early in November—the cheque was dated on September 14th—I was only holding it as a collateral security—I commenced an action against Morris and Bennett on Decem<lb/>ber 15th, on the cheque—when I got information about Morris being a bankrupt I laid information against him at the Police-court for obtain<lb/>ing credit from me under the Bankruptcy Act—a summons was granted—the case was heard, and remanded—on January 31st, while the case was under remand, I had a visit from Armstrong—he said he had been commissioned to settle the action in the Queen's Bench, and asked on what terms I would do so—I told him I should, require the £100, and be glad to get it—he subsequently brought the £100 in gold—at the adjourned hearing of the criminal charge I did not appear, but I in<lb/>structed my Counsel to mention the whole matter to the Alderman—I was called away to Spain—I wanted to withdraw from the action if the Alderman would agree—I would be guided by him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Tweedie, solicitors, of 5, Lincoln's Inn—our firm acted for Mr. Richard Berridge, who came into the Edgware and Little Stanmore Estate under the will of his father, who died in September, 1887—the son did not come of age till April, 1891—he is now the owner of the whole estate, with the exception of a small part, Edgware House, which was sold by us soon after he came into possession—it was an old ruin, and was sold really for the site—I have looked at the description of the land in the contract No. 1 between Bennett and Morris, and it evidently refers to this same estate—the conditions in the contract about the title appear to be taken from our condition of sale dated in 1889, when the property was last put up in lots—I have all the deeds relating to the estate—I personally have had the conduct of this business—I have never heard of any option being acquired by any person named Morris on this estate, or of any sum of £250 being given for an option—we have had no notice of it—I should expect to find some notice of it among the papers—we should expect a notice from the owner—I have not heard of any mortgage on the estate for £30,000—it is mortgaged by the present owner, but not for £30,000—it is absurd to suggest that Mr. Berridge is the mortgagee—he is the absolute owner—several persons called to know if the estate would come into the market when Mr. Berridge died—I do not know if Morris called; if so, not in that name, because it would be in my diary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to William Badderly, a stationer, who trades as Warrington &amp; Co., 23, Garrick Street—on the night of January 16th I locked the premises up, and, so far as I know, I was the last to leave—I left by the back door, locked it with two locks, and also locked an iron gate which is down three or four steps from the door—when I arrived next morning about 8.45 I found the premises in the possession of the firemen—my attention was drawn to an office on the first floor, which contains two safes—one of them had been tampered with—the side was partly forced, and some of the packing, a kind of cement, was on the floor—the marks were not there the night before—there was a crowbar near the safe—it is the firm's property, and is kept in the basement—some little time afterwards the key of the other safe was picked up, with which I opened it, and a bag of money was missing—the key is usually kept in a drawer of a desk which is not locked—I missed about £8—I had seen it there safe on the Saturday before the 13th—I did not miss anything else—the damage done by the fire was about £2,000—we have several lads employed there, and amongst them the prisoner—he had been employed about two months—he was at work on the Tuesday—he was last paid his wages on the Saturday previous—there would have been money owing to him for the Monday and Tuesday—I never saw him again—he was not discharged—there was also in our employ a lad named McNeil—he was paid the previous Saturday—he had been there on the Monday and Tuesday—he was not discharged, but he has not been there since.</p>

I am a printer, and work for Mr. Badderly—I live at 16, Emerald Street, Theobald's Road—on April 10th I was out with a boy named John Scott—we had some goods on a truck—I saw the prisoner in Holborn Circus—he used to be employed with me—he said, "Halloa!"—I said, "Halloa! you done a nice thing for our firm"—he said, "What! the fire?"—I said, "Yes; did you get any money?"—he said, "Yes; we got £8, of which we had £4 each, me and McNeil; we both stayed behind at night, and hid behind a litho' stone; Mr. Ham<lb/>mond came down to turn off the gas; McNeil intended to hit Mr. Hammond with a piece of iron, only he was too quick for him"—he then said they went from, there upstairs into the shop, and opened a safe, from which they got the money—they then went up to the governor's room, on the first floor, and stayed there till 5 o'clock in the morning, they came down, and McNeil had a piece of lighted candle, he placed it near some paper beside a cutting machine, and then they left the premises a little after 5 a.m.—he did not say whether the paper was alight—he did not say which door they left by—he said he was working for Page &amp; Pratt's, in Bride Street—I had not seen him between the night of the fire and when I met him in Holborn Circus—McNeil used to work at Warrington's—I have not seen him since the night of the fire—he has not been at work—I made a report of the matter—McNeil is older than the prisoner.</p>

I am one of the firm of Thornicroft and Willis, solicitors, of 59, Chancery Lane—about March 27th Mr. Barnett Marshall consulted me in this matter—actingon his instructions, on Wednes<lb/>day, March 28th, I called with Outram, my clerk, on Bailey at his house at Leatherhead—he had ceased to practise at Lincoln's Inn Fields—I told Bailey I had come on behalf of Mr. Marshall to make inquiries about a mortgage; that I understood there was a mortgage for £250 on property in Carnaby Street from Hocking to Marshall—Bailey said that was so—I said, "Has the mortgage been paid off?"—he said, "No"—I said, "How is that?"—he said, "Hooking was to have paid it off on the 26th, but he has not done so"—I said, "Why did you get the deeds from Mr. Marshall last November?"—He said, "Hocking told me that he had arranged to sell the property; that the mortgage would, therefore, have to be paid off, and I wanted the deeds"—I said, "Has the property been sold?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Where are the deeds?"—he said, "At 63, Lincoln's Inn Fields"—I said, "Why did not you return them to Mr. Marshall?"—he said that Hocking had arranged to pay the mortgage off—I said, "I thought you said just now that he was going to sell the property?"—he said, "He has changed his mind, and is going to pay the mortgage off"—I said, "How is he going to do that?"—he said, "He is going to deposit the deeds with his bank, and get an advance"—I said, "You are quite sure nothing has been paid off?"—he walked away to the end of the room to look out of the window for a moment, and then said, "I have received £100"—I said, "When was that?"—he said, "About a month ago"—I said, "Why have you not paid it to Mr. Marshall?"—he said, "I did not want to"—I said, "Why not?"—he said, "I was going to pay it all over at the same time"—I said, "This is most irregular, and I must ask you to meet me to-morrow morning and hand me over the deeds and the money"—he said, "I am afraid I have an engagement to-morrow</p>

I am a shop-fitter and builder, at 124, Wardour Street—in 1896 I gave instructions to the agent and to the prisoner, as solicitor, for the purchase of 47 and 47a, Carnaby Street—I instructed Bailey to procure me an advance of £250—in January, 1897, I completed the purchase and signed this mortgage to secure the £250—in November, 1899, I met Bailey at Messrs. Barnard &amp; Son's, 48, Brewer Street, by accident—he asked me if I was not ready to pay it off, as the trustees were doubtful about the security—I told him, as I had only had the mortgage for three years, and it had cost me £20, I thought it was rather hard, and, as for the security, I would not bell the pro<lb/>perty for anything like the amount that was lent on it; but I would see what money I could pay him by Christmas—I never told him that I desired to sell the property—I believed what he said about the trustees, and went to his office on January 1st with £100 in notes—he said he was sorry I had brought it in notes, as he wished to send it away, and would I give him a cheque—I went home, wrote out this cheque for £100, and sent it to him—I wrote, "Pay Bailey, or order, £100, part payment of mortgage re 47 and 47a, Carnaby Street"—that is Bailey's writing at the back—it is dated January 1st, 1900—I enclosed it in a letter, in which I reminded him that I wished the receipt put on the mortgage deed, as I wanted his client to see when I paid the money—I got a letter back with this receipt (<hi rend="italic">Produced,</hi>) but there was no reply to my request about the receipt being put on the deed—I wrote to him on February 25th, saying that he had not kept his promise, and asking him to do so, and send the deed for perusal—I got his reply of February 27th—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he would call to-morrow at 2 o'clock with the deeds, and that he should be glad if he could take up the deeds, as the beneficiaires were in want of the money</hi>).—he called the following day, and wrote this receipt on the deed in my office—he did not tell me that the mortgage was transferred, or I would not have paid him the £100—I never told him I had changed my mind, and that I was going to pay the mortgage off instead of selling the property—in reply to his letter of February 27th, I told him if the beneficiaires wanted the money they ought to make me some allowance,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a firewood dealer, of 9, Burlington Road, Enfield, and have been in the habit of hiring a stable at 1, Notts Cottages, from the deceased, at 2s. 6d. a week—I know the prisoner—he is a coster<lb/>monger—he also used to hire a stable there—I do not remember his giving it up—I remember him keeping a barrow there—I have seen him and Smith together on many occasions; they seemed to be friendly—on Saturday, February 24th, about 11.15 p.m., I went to 1, Notts Cottages with my little boy to put away my donkey and barrow—I went in through the large gates of the yard, saw Smith come out of his shop, and shut the gate by which I had entered—I lighted a lamp in the stable when I got there, and there was also one in the shop, the door of which was open; the street lamp was alight in the road outside—I set about putting my donkey away, and when I had been there a few minutes the prisoner came to the gate, which was closed, with a pony and barrow—Smith was standing against the inside of the gate, and said to the prisoner, "You are not coming in here any more"—the prisoner began using bad language—Smith did not say any more—the prisoner seemed to me as if he had had too much to drink—Smith said, "If you were not</p>

               <p>drunk you would not have a word to say for yourself"—the prisoner said, "I am not drunk"—he was standing on the pathway outside, and near the gate; he had either a stick or a whip in his hand; his pony and cart were in the roadway—Smith had a stick in his hand; he always had one to walk with, he was a very old man—I did not know his age then—he was infirm through old age—the prisoner then used bad language, and struck at Smith over the gate with his stick or whip, who struck at the prisoner—the gate is about 4 ft. high—neither of them hit the other—then the prisoner ran through the little gate and struck Smith on the shoulder with the stick or whip, and said, "You old b——, I will kill you"—Smith put one arm to the other, and cried out, "Oh!"—he still stood in his yard—I did not think he was much hurt, and as I wanted to give my donkey some water I went into the stable to fetch a pail, and then went up to a pond at the back of the yard, leaving my boy Albert behind—when I came out of the stable with the pail Smith was inside the yard and Groves outside, against his pony—I got the water, and while I was coming back I heard cries of "Murder!" and "Police!" from Mrs. Smith—I had been away about 10 minutes—as I was entering the little gateway I saw a scythe lying on the footpath near the little gate—I had seen three scythes in the yard—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is one of them—I saw them there when I went in on that night against the wall furthest from the road—I went into the stable with the water—my son said something to me—I went straight to the door of the shop and looked in—I saw Smith lying down, groaning, between the counters, with his feet towards the door; Mrs. Smith was also there—I went out into the road then—I noticed that the scythes were gone—I saw the prisoner standing against his pony's head opposite No. 3, which is his own gate—I had not seen him as I went in—another man came down the road and said, "Harry, Harry, what is the matter?"—the pony and the barrow were taken away; I cannot say by whom—I saw no more of the prisoner—after a little time the police came, and a doctor.</p>

               <p>nothing the matter with him except losing his sight—the prisoner used to keep his pony and barrow in our stable a long time ago, and used to pay 2s. 6d. for it—after a while he only kept a barrow there and paid 6d. a week to my husband—on February 24th he owed my husband 1s.—I am not sure of the amount—before that night I had heard my husband tell him that he would not have him in there any more—on the night of February 24th we were at home—he went out at 11.20 to shut the big gate—I had not heard Jordan come in—my husband had just got it shut when the prisoner rushed at him—the prisoner had a pony and barrow with him—my husband told him he should not come inside that night—the prisoner said he meant killing the old b——; I said to my husband, "Come inside, and let him be where he is," and my husband came in directly—the prisoner rushed in after my husband, who tried to shut the door; and the prisoner said, "You don't shut no b——door here; I mean killing you;" and knocked him down—I do not think he had anything in his hand—the blow hit my husband in the chest some<lb/>where—the prisoner went away directly after that, and came back instantly with two scythes in his hand, and dealt my husband, who was lying on the floor, four or five tremendous blowb——he could not help himself—I said, "Pray don't hit him any more," and he said, "I will serve you the same," and he knocked me down, and hurt my back; I am suffering from it now—he struck me with the heel of the scythe—I got up after two or three minutes, and called out, "Murder!" and "Police!"—the prisoner went away—they took my husband to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at Enfield—on February 25th I was called about 12.15 a.m. to Notts Cottages, where I saw Henry Smith sitting in a chair in the room, in a state of collapse, cold and shivering, and his head covered with blood—I did not examine him then, but when he got to the hospital I did—I found that both bones of the right leg were fractured, and there was a comminuted fracture of the ankle joint—the bone was broken up into small pieceb——both bones of the right arm were broken—that was a compound fracture, and bleeding from the bone pro<lb/>truding—it was about half way down the arm—on the forehead I found two jagged wounds, one 2 in. long, upwards and downwards, and one smaller one, about 1/2 in. apart, bleeding freely; two at the back of the head, one about 2 1/2 in. long, right down to the bone, bleeding freely—both bones in the left leg were broken, about 3 in. below the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190004300042"/>
               <p>knee; that also was a compound fracture, and a great deal of blood coming from it—the skin of the left hand was driven in, and a rib on the left side was broken—I dressed the wounds as far as I could, and later on set the bones which were broken—he was in such a state of collapse I did not think it advisable to do anything then except put sandbags to his ribb——if I had done anything he would have died—at one time he was doing fairly well, but about March 8th or 9th the wounds in his arms and legs turned out badly, and he eventually died on March 20th, exhausted—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> by the Coroner's order—his body was that of an unusually healthy old man, after making allowance for his age—death was undoubtedly directly caused by the injuries he received—a series of blows upon his body with the heel of the scythe would have accounted for the injurieb——very great violence must have been used, especially on the left leg—I was shown one of the scythes on February 25th—there was a little blood on the middle of the blade then—I also examined Mrs. Smith on the 25th—she had a slight injury to her left wrist—she complained very much of her back—she said she had been knocked on her back—between 3 and 4 a.m. on the 25th I went to the station and saw the prisoner in the charge room—he said he had had a blow on the left side of the head—I examined his head, and found there was no bruise or swelling; there was a slight scratch, as if it had been done with the nail; there was no bleeding—it would be impossible to inflict a blow, such as to knock him down, and yet leave the mark that I found—that was the first time I had seen him that morning—he appeared perfectly sober—he stood quite steadily, and spoke distinctly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was time for him to have got sober to a great extent before I saw him—there was no indication of a blow at all—the deceased's skin was broken by the broken bones, but they did not come through the skin—the bones of a man of 85 would be much more brittle than those of a younger man, and less easy to heal—it is just possible that the two fractures of the right leg could have been caused by a fall over a scythe, and I say the same with regard to the fracture of the ankle—the fracture to the right arm was just below the elbow—I do not think it could have been caused by a fall on a scythe—I do not think the force would be enough to break boneb——the wound on the forehead was about 1 1/2 in. deep and jagged; that might have been done by the back of a scythe; it was not clean cut as if by a sharp instrument—when I examined the deceased at his cottage about 12.30 he was not insensible, he could just speak—I cannot say that he got much better at the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter, and live at 400, Euston Road—on Sunday, March 19th, I was keeping an hotel at 40, Fitzroy Street, and a young man named Felix Colin came with a woman, said to be his wife, and a child, about five years old—on the following Wednesday I went with Colin to the City Bank, in Shaftesbury Avenue, and introduced him to the manager—he produced some foreign securities to be changed, but the manager declined—I then went with Colin to a money changer named Shool in Shaftesbury Avenue, and the securities were produced, but he declined to change them—we then went to Morgan &amp; Co., of 26, Coventry Street—I had never been there before—we saw a young man and made an appointment for the next day—the prisoner was away—we went again next day and saw the prisoner—I addressed the prisoner as Mr. Morgan, and spoke English to him—Colin spoke in French, and I trans<lb/>lated it—the prisoner did not speak French on that day; everything that was said between Colin and the prisoner was said through me—Colin produced a great number of securities to Warren, who picked out six French Rentes and said he would try and sell them and put them on the market, and I think he gave a receipt for them—Colin wanted £50 or £60 at once, but no money was given to him that day—I went there next day and saw Colin sign this: "Sold to Thos. Morgan &amp; Co. two foreign bonds, the payment of which I guarantee.—F. Colin"—on March 27th I was there again with Colin and the lady I understood to be his wife, and saw him receive £50 from Warren and give this receipt (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Colin also got three tickets for the Alhambra for the evening—we then went to a public-house almost facing—next day, the 28th, I went again with Colin to Morgan's, and he produced other securitieb——the conversation all took place through me—Warren picked out some of the securities, and Colin asked for some more money—Warren said he would give him some more when he had sold the securities, and gave Colin this docu<lb/>ment (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Colin said that there were some securities</p>

               <p>not mentioned in the document, and Warren looked at it and added some<lb/>thing—no money passed on that occasion, and no price was mentioned—Colin and the lady left the hotel two or three days afterwards, and gave me their addresb——I went to 26, Coventry Street, with this letter from Colin to get some money—it is dated March 29th—I only got £15; but I went again on another day, and got a further sum of £5—the receipt was written the next day—I gave a receipt for all the money I received—the prisoner was called upon at Bow Street to produce the receipt, and that is the only one I received—I also received £10 or £15—Colin was then living in lodgings in Euston Road—I told him something at the end of March or the beginning of April, and he thereupon left London and wrote to me, and gave me his address at Southampton, in consequence of which I went to 25, Coventry Street, and asked for more money for him, but got none—I got information from a young, man, and telegraphed to Colin—I never got any more money for him, and never saw Warren again till shortly before the action in the High Court—I saw Colin's arrest in the paper—the woman was arrested too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Colin looked about 23 or 24, and stood 6ft. high—he told me that his father died without a will, and he had come into a lot of property, and that led up to his showing me the foreign securitieb——I bank at the City Bank—I was so satisfied with the truth of his story that I took him there, and he told the prisoner the same story that he had told me; that his father died intestate, and he wanted to raise money on the bonds for the purpose of travelling—the prisoner said, "Are these bonds your absolute property?" and Colin said, "Yes"—he said to Colin, "Your father left you a lot of securities?"—he said, "Yes, I have more than these," and took out a book and entered the numbers and descriptions of those he handed to Warren, and called Warren's attention to the fact that one bond was omitted—the French lady did not go with us when we had the wine, but I think she was in Morgan's place when we were there—she was about 27 years of age—it was a wine bar of an hotel—altogether I have received from Warren about £35—besides these receipts for £15 and £5, I think I received another £10, and gave a receipt for it; out of that he paid my hotel bill—Inspector Sexton and I had a conversation, and I went and told Colin, and he disappeared—I never saw him again till I saw him at Bow Street—I think Colin went to Morgan's more than once with me—these people had two or three Gladstone bags with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When we were in the public-house Warren said, "You get him to leave the other securities with me, and I will give you a com<lb/>mission"—I said nothing to that—Colin heard it, but he cannot speak a word of English—Morgan took me inside and said that to me.</p>

               <p>but the two Russian bonds were excluded; we did not know where they were; they were never admitted to have been in his possession—the bonds mentioned in paragraph 9 were handed to me in Court, with the exception of the two Ottoman bonds; he handed them to his Counsel himself, and I received them from the Counsel—the other Ottoman bond was handed to me at a later date—I was by no means satisfied that the bonds not in his possession were irrecoverable, and Warren was put into the witness-box and sworn, and cross-examined by Mr. Williamb——the case was adjourned to enable me to go to the prisoner's office and see the books; he had, up to that time, refused to let me see them—Counsel made the appointment in Court—I went there, and asked him to produce his books and documentb——he said he did not keep any, but he produced four letters, which were afterwards included in the impounded documents—the hearing was resumed on January 7th, and adjourned again for the defendant to pay the agreed due balance—on February 2nd I got a com<lb/>munication with reference to the two 3 1/2 per cent. Russian bondb——I com<lb/>municated with the prisoner by letter, and while my clerk was out with the letter I was called by the telephone, and recognised the prisoner's voice; he wanted to enter into an arrangement; but I declined, and said, "I give you notice that if you do not bring over to me at once the two Russian bonds Messrs. Noon &amp; Clark handed to you this morning, I shall apply to the Judge"—he said, "Yes; I am coming round to-morrow morning"—up to that time he had denied in his answers to interrogatories, that he had them—I first knew that he had them through the stockbrokerb——next morning, February 3rd, the prisoner and his solicitor called and handed me the two Russian bonds, and also one Ottoman—he offered no explanation about having them—they are the same bonds referred to in his interrogatories—on the morning of February 7th he and his solicitor called again, and handed me £80 in cash and a certificate of French Rentes in the name of Mme. Colin, with the figures "260" placed on it—the hearing of the case in Court was resumed that day, and the Judge was informed, in the prisoner's hearing, that the bonds mentioned at the last hearing had not been produced—the hearing was adjourned, and the Judge directed me to go with the prisoner to his office, and directed him to hand over the books to me, and bring them to the Court, and after some considerable difficulty I got them—the Judge directed me to keep them till further orders—on February 14th I produced them in Court, and they were impounded together with some other books produced by the prisoner which I had not succeeded in getting on the 7th, two letter-books, one ledger, and three day-books (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the prisoner's son produced a day-book on February 14th, and that was impounded also—in the letter-book on April 10th, 1899, there is a copy of a letter to Lombard &amp; Co., of Geneva (<hi rend="italic">This stated that bonds were enclosed, and asked for their return in cash</hi>), and on April 12th there is a telegram from the same to the same, "Are bonds sold? Reply, price"—here is a letter of April 11th: "We beg to acknowledge your telegram, and await your remittance; further, we enclose you four bonds, which please negotiate forthwith"—(<hi rend="italic">Other letters between the prisoner and Messrs. Lombard were read, enclosing bonds for sale, and asking for remittances</hi>)</p>

               <p>—Mr. Justice Bigham asked the prisoner what he had done with the Belgian bond, whether he could trace it in the books—he said, "No"—the Judge offered him a chair to support his books, but he said that it was of no use—when I got the books I traced it, and spoke to the prisoner about it through the telephone, and declined to have any discussion till he handed over the bond—I put it to him again, and he said, "Oh, yes, I will look for the bond at once"—that was on February 7th, after the hearing, I think—on Friday, February 9th, fresh Counsel appeared, and he was asked to make an affidavit of documents and deliver it to me on the Monday—I got it on the 14th, and the Belgian bond was included in the documents in his possession—among the documents impounded were the original documents coming from the Breslau Bank—they were not found in his possession—the hear<lb/>ing concluded on February 14th, and formal judgment was given on March 29th for £542 and costs, not a penny of which has been paid—I have examined the ledger account of Felix Colin, and compared it with the correspondence and with the day-book—I found that £207 17s. 6d. was received for the French Rentes, and only £151 15s. 6d. is credited, the deficiency being £56—the six Swiss bonds are credited at £60 14s. 4d., as against £78 14s. actually received; the deficiency is about £18—there is a deficiency on the Swiss bonds of £40—the two Egyptians realised £211 10s. 6d., and he has only credited £182 1s. 6d., the deficiency being over £21—the total deficiency is £143 against Colin—the prisoner kept two day-books; one shows the actual amount received, and the other the leaser amounts, so that if any person asked to see the account it would appear to be correct if he did not find the second day-book—I checked these accounts, and found them to be the true amounts—the prisoner himself produced Exhibit 67 before the Judge in Court, also Mr. Double's letter of May 16th, after the Judge called for it—(<hi rend="italic">This stated:</hi> "I am instructed by Madame Colin to ask you to hand over to me all the documents; unless they are handed to me to-morrow I shall proceed against you")—I got this letter from the executors of Mr. Double; it was put to the prisoner in Court, and he said that it was his signature: "We beg to say we have no knowledge of Madame Colin. We bought certain securities from Mr. Colin, etc, but the gentleman who attends to that matter is away for the Whitsun holidays, so must ask you to leave the matter to the end of next week"—the defence was delivered on August 12th, 1899—I do not think be ever had the Austrian bonds—paragraph 5 says that he never had the 2 1/2 Russian bonds, but we recovered them from him through Messrs. Noon &amp; Clark—the 8th paragraph says that the defendant purchased the French Rentes, the Belgian bonds, the Egyptian Unified, and the Swiss Federal for £473 14s., and they still hold £388 14s. to his order, and then they say that the remainder were deposited with the defendant for sale, and are still in his hands, and they seek to charge the plaintiff with the expenses of the sale.</p>

I live at 9, St. Ann's Street, Limehouse—the deceased was my husband; he was a provision dealer, and 35 years old—on March 19th he went out with Mr. Williams about 1 o'clock—I expected him back, and as he did not come, at 4 o'clock I went to look for him, with my sister-in-law, Ellen Pratt—about 8.30 we went to the King's Arms; my sister-in-law went in, and came back and spoke to me; we then both went in, and I saw my husband, Mrs. Williams, Mr. Donovan, the prisoner, and Lambert—my husband asked us what we would have; we said a small lemon each and a drop of brandy in it—the men argued among themselves; I do not know what about—the prisoner had an umbrella in his hand—my husband put some money down on the counter, and the prisoner swept it off with his umbrella, and said, in rather an angry way, that he did not require his drink—my husband said, "You have insulted me"—I think he put his hand on the prisoner's shoulder and said, "I think I know who you are; you are <hi rend="italic">Patsy</hi> Griffiths"—then he said, "Mind your umbrella," because the prisoner was swerving it too and fro; the point was on the ground, I believe—it looked a very good one—the handle looked thick—it had a gold band on it—the prisoner looked at it and said, "If you had the gold that that contains you would forget yourself"—Mr. Donovan said to the prisoner, "You leave my house; you have insulted a friend and a customer"—I do not remember if my husband said that he wished to speak to the prisoner outside, but they both went out, and also Lambert—I went out, and my sister-in-law—the prisoner and Lambert walked by themselves to the corner of the road—my husband was nearly level with them—the prisoner and his friend went into the public-house, and my husband followed—I went in, too—I was a very little distance behind them, but the curtain hid my husband from view—when I got in I saw my husband falling—he nearly fell on me—the prisoner tried to rush out—I believe he had the same umbrella in his hand—I caught hold of him, and said he had given my husband his death-blow—he swung me away from him, and rushed through the door into the street—Mrs. Donovan, the landlord's wife, went after him—my husband was picked up and placed on a seat—his cheek was bleeding, and his face ashen white—shortly afterwards Mrs. Donovan came back—her bodice was covered with mud—I took my husband home in a cab, and Dr. Welsh came to see him, and put some ice bags to his head—on March 20th I took him to the London Hospital with Mr. Williams—they told him, after seeing him there, to come next day—I took him home, and he got worse—he was unconscious most of the time—he died on March 23rd at 12.10 a.m.—I had never seen the prisoner before—my husband was a very sober man—he could not walk to the hospital—he was paralysed in his limbs.</p>

Between 7.30 and 8 on Saturday evening I went to a public-house. I had a drink. The prosecutor said, "Ain't the Boers winning?" We got into conversation, and had drinks together. The prisoner said, "I am going your way." We went together towards Great Tower Street. The prisoner got into conversation with a young lady. He asked me to have a drink, and he asked her. I declined, and said I was going home. Then he got hold of this young lady and pulled her about. I said, 'Leave her alone'; but he would not leave her alone. I struck him on the chin, and he fell down. Thinking he was hurt, I ran away. I was stopped by a police<lb/>man, and told him I had struck the prosecutor. I did not throw anything away. The prosecutor had been with another gentleman when I met him in the public-house, but he left us when we came out of the public-house. I think we were in the public-house a good hour."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of 112, Gurney Road, Stratford—on Monday, April 16th, I went for a little walk, and came back and went into the Steamship public-house to have a drink—my wife was there, and three or four women—I asked her to come home to dinner—when we got in she said she did not want any dinner, and that she would go to bed—I went down the garden, fed my chickens, and then came and cut my piece of meat and bread, and drew a glass of water—I had about three-parts finished my dinner when my wife came out of the room into the back yard, through the wash-house into che kitchen, stood at the end of the table, and said, "Where is my dinner?"—I said, "Half a minute, mate; I will cut it for you"—I am in the habit of calling her</p>

I did live at 20, Vivian Road, Peckham, but now at 2, York Terrace, College Road, Forest Hill—I am ledger clerk to the Frank Wright's Prepayment Gas Meter Corporation, limited, whose service I entered on February 6th, 1896—the prisoner was secretary—I acted under him—the books were under his control as secretary and cashier—they were a petty cash book, cash-book, a journal and ledger—Norris kept the petty cash book in his desk or drawer, but the entries were mostly made by me about once a month—the journal was a locked book of which I gave him the key in March, 1899, with the books, as he said he had instructions to keep them—I repeatedly asked for the petty cash-book between March and June, 1899—a share account was opened in this ledger—in it I do not find on May 21st, 1897, any entry of a payment by Mr. Cowley—I find an entry on April 30th of £20, with no year, but in the journal from which it is posted it appears as April 30th, 1899—it is in Norris's writing—in Vollner's share account I find no entry of £50 on January 21st, 1898—in the petty cash book there is on January 21st, 1898, "Amount paid into bank, as per pass-book. £50"—the paying in slip is Norris's writing—on July 23rd, 1898, I find no entry of money received from Mr. Vollner, but in the cash-book of April 30th, 1899, there is an entry of £100 received from Vollner—there is a memo. in pencil in the petty cash book on April 30th, 1899, by Mr. Burn, deceased, "Paid out of G. R. B.'s cheque £183 4s. 4d.," and on the other side is £l6✗7 4s.4d. connected with wages—upon the receipt side I find no entry of the £183 48. 4d. about that date—in July, 1898, the petty cash deficiency is £190, which Mr. Burn's cheque for £183 4s. 4d. puts right—there is no entry of £11 11s. 1d. on September 10th, 1898, nor of £26 6s. 6d. on December 15th, 1898—all these cheques have been paid into the Old Kent Road Branch of the City and Midland Bank, our bank—there is no counterfoil of the £26 6s. 6d., nor of the £11 11s. 1d. in the counterfoil receipt book, the numbers of which run from 1480, but should go up to 1500, 20 having been cut out at the end of the book—I do find a counterfoil in December, 1898, from the Johnstone Corporation of £11 11s. 1d.—No. 1134 is the receipt for £26 6s. 6d. given to the Abercarne Company, and not to the Johnstone Corporation—there is no entry on January 4th, 1899, of a receipt from W. S. Hill of £21 5s., which appears on April 1st, 1899, for the first time—on January 31st, 1899, or February 1st, the prisoner ought to have had in hand £219 18s. 5d. according to the petty cash-book, by the end of February £239 9s. 10d.—our audit was to take place in the first or second week in March—the prisoner knew that—there is no entry of a receipt from the Liverpool United Gas Company on February 8th, 1899, of £196 6s. in that month, nor of the receipt of £2 2s. 6d. from the Hereford Corporation—I see my entry in the petty cash book on February 15th, 1899, "Amount paid into bank, as per pass-book, £200"—I made it from the bank pass-book about March, 1899—I said to the prisoner, "Where does the £200 come from?"—he said, "From the petty cash"—he would then have to account to the auditors for £17 5s. 7d.—on March 3lst, 1899, I entered £26 6s. 6d. as received from Abercarne, the receipt for which is dated December 28th, 1895; also £196 6s. from the Liverpool Gas Com<lb/>pany</p>

S. commissions, as per list," of £625—£15 7s. 1d. is carried forward—I first saw that entry about February, 1900—but for the £6253 he would have been responsible for £640 7s. 1d.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 6, Bell Yard, Doctors' Commons—I am the son of George Roddam Burn, the chairman and director of this company from the date of its formation in 1895—my father died on February 22nd last—he left the management principally in the hands of Norris and Shuymer—in January, 1899, I became a director—the company was then on the verge of liquidation—I endeavoured to right it—on May 1st, 1899, I became managing director—on February 25th, 1899, the directors gave notice to Shuymer, the manager, and to Norris, the secretary—in July I dismissed Robey—the reasons were negligent management and being overstaffed—up to September, 1899, I knew nothing of the payment of secret commissions—the cheque for £2 108. to Mr. J. F. Gibbs must have been obtained by misrepresentation—on October 16th I first noticed it—Norris sent it to my father in a letter—I asked the prisoner from time to time to let me see the petty cash book—he put me off—he produced this subsidiary one in a brown cover—after May 25th, when the prisoner's notice expired, we continued him on as a weekly servant—Shuymer was to have a month's notice—in September, 1899, the prisoner went for his holidays—I investigated the accounts—in the result, on October 10th and 11th I communicated with him, desiring his attendance at the office—on October 13th I met him at Victoria Station and brought him to the office—I had then seen the entries, "Secret Service commissions paid to various gas companies, as per list"—I asked him to explain—Mr. Brown, Mr. Petigrew, and myself, directors, were present—the prisoner said, "I want to see your father"; I said, "You have to deal with me"; he said, "Can I have a private interview with you?"—Mr. Brown and Mr. Petigrew left the room at my request—I directed the prisoner's attention to the Secret Service entries—he said, "I have had the money; can I repay it by offering £700, which my wife could realise under reversions she is entitled to on the death of her mother," and said he thought I would do this for him rather than he should go to prison—I told him we could not entertain it——he said, "I have spent it in the West-end and in the City, boozing about"—I called in Mr. Brown and Mr. Petigrew—I said, "Mr. Norris admits having had the money, and having spent it on himself"—he again requested to see my father, and I took him to my father's office in Doctors' Commons—my father had gone out to lunch—Norris asked if he could write to him—I said, Yes, he could if he liked—I took him to my room, where I left him writing—I went downstairs—in about 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour I met him coming down the dairs—he handed me this document, which I read: "Referring to the items entered in the company's books, amounting to about £1,000, these sums have been utilised by Mr. Shuymer and myself during the past three years in pay<lb/>ment of expenses and commissions, of which no account has been kept, except as far as the entries appear in the petty cash book, and which book</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "I came home; I was drunk; I remember my missus taking my supper from me, and that is all I remember."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Lucretia Gardens, Kenning<lb/>ton—I was with my mother, Ellen Northcroft, on the afternoon of March 7th, in the Kennington Road—she was 56—we were at the top of Wincote Street, going towards Kennington Park, on the east side of the road—there was a tram in the road coming to a standstill at the corner of Fitzallan Street—we were going to get into it to go to St. Thomas's Hospital—it was going towards Westminster Bridge—we were on the right side of the road, going towards Westminster Bridge—we both stepped off the kerb together, and then my mother went slightly in front of me—when we left the pavement there was nothing in the road except the tram—then I looked to my right to see if anything was coming—we had both looked before we left the kerb—I did not notice anything when I first looked, but just after my mother had started in front of me I noticed three cyclists coming from the West<lb/>minster direction on their proper side of the road, the same side as we were on—they were just by the Ship public-house when I first saw them—they were riding abreast—they were two newspaper boys and the prisoner—the paper boys had sacks on their backs—the defendant was furthest away from us and nearest the tram lines—they were going very fast—I did not hear any bell rung—I called out to mother, but I do not think she could have heard me—then I saw her knocked down by the prisoner—she fell at once on her eye—I thought it was only a black eye at the time—the blow was very sudden—the prisoner was still riding on the outside of the three—I think the other two cyclists must have ridden a little way further—I saw them afterwards—I did not see the prisoner fall—I did not hear anybody say anything—people collected at once—I took my mother to Dr. Henry's surgery—she died the same night, about 10 o'clock—she was going across the road in a slightly slanting direction.</p>

I am a timber porter, and live at 84, Bonner Street, South Lambeth—on the afternoon of March 7th I was in Ken<lb/>nington Road—I was coming from the direction of Westminster—I had passed the Ship—I had not got so far as Wincote Street—I was walking—I heard some loud talking, and, turning my head, I saw three cyclists, two with papers on their backs and the defendant—the paper boys were nearer the kerb and a little in front, and the defendant nearer the tram lines, and behind—in front of me I saw two ladies, one in the road and one on the path—they were behind a timber carriage which was standing in the road, with the horses towards Kennington Park—it was near the pavement—I saw the deceased attempt to cross the road—she turned her head towards Westminster, and then made for the car—the bicyclists came along and shouted very loudly—they seemed to frighten her, and, being an aged lady, she hastened her speed, but had not got very far when two paper boys passed, her—she went in a slanting way, and the other one seemed to follow her and try to get round the off side of her, but he could not do it because of the car—they got close to the car, and the prisoner struck her—she seemed to be struck in the leg—the machine seemed to push her legs forwards—she put her arms out and fell backwards—I cannot say that she actually fell on her back—I cannot say the boys were going at less than 12 miles an hour—I ran across and placed her shoulders on my arm and slightly raised her—I saw that she was bleeding—I took her bonnet off and borrowed a handkerchief from her daughter and wiped the blood from her nose and mouth—I said to the prisoner, "This is your racing tricks that have done this"—he said, "I was not racing"—I am not a bicyclist—I have been a cabman.</p>

                  </hi>.

The external injuries I found were a small graz, on the left knee, and effusion of blood over and round the left eye. A slight shock to a person in her state of health would be much more serious than a more severe shock to a person in more robust health. I found no external wound on the head. I believe the roadway between the tram-lines in Kennington Road is paved with granite; I am not sure The injuries I found were not consistent with the fact that the impact between her and the bicycle was slight; there was nothing to show whether it was slight or not. I should not think being simply pushed, and falling so that her head struck the pavement, would be sufficient to account for the injuries; it would depend entirely upon the force with which her head struck the pavement. She was a woman of heavy build. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined:</hi> She was about 13 stone, and her height 5 ft. 6 in. The fracture of the skull extended right through the base of the skull to the middle line, about 5 in. The base of the brain was very much bruised, and there was haemorrhage into the substance; even in a healthy person such an injury as that would, I think, have been fatal.")</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 278, Brixton Road, with my father, who is a greengrocer—I am a cyclist, and have ridden for about five years—I ride for the Star newspaper, and have done so for about 16 months—on March 7th I was going along the Kennington Road with the prisoner and Ricketts, coming from the newspaper office, with papers on our backs—the defendant had no papers; he was not employed with me—about 12 or 15 yards in front of us we saw the women in tho road—we rang our bells and shouted, and the daughter halloaed out "Mother!"—I did not see the lady actually hit, as I was in front of the defendant, and Ricketts was in front of me—I was nearest the kerb, the defendant in the middle, and Ricketts on the right side—we were going about 9 or 10 miles an hour—I crossed to the near side of the deceased; Ricketts passed he before I did—I cannot say which side he passed her on; she was about three yards from me when I passed her—when we rang our bells she seemed to hurry a bit—T was riding my own machine—the shop from where we got the papers to the scene of the accident is about three-quarters of a mile—we left with the papers about 3 or 3.15, I cannot say for certain—we were going to the Swan at Stockwell—no other papers have publishing offices on the Surrey side of the river—there was no need for us to go at any great pace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have got to get to the Swan before the other papers—it may be three miles to the Swan; I am no judge—they do not always tell us at the office that we have to get there first, only on some special day—I was bending my back a bit—I had dropped handles—my machine was geared to 77 in., I had no brake—I should not call that a high gear; a high gear is 96, 108 or 112; they go up to 200, but you cannot get along fast on a 200 gear; about 90 would be about the fastest—the higher the gear the fewer the revolutions—the prisoner's machine was a light machine—I should not call it a racing machine—it is geared to 80 1/2, which is too high for road racing.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for my father, a builder, in the Clapham Road—on March 7th I was with the last witness and the prisoner in the afternoon, each of us on bicycles—the prisoner and I are both members of a local cycling club—on this day the prisoner and I rode together to a refreshment shop in Blackfriars, where I saw the last witness—I was at that time engaged in the afternoons in carrying newspaper for the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi>—we went to Pocock Street for the early edition, which was issued about 3.15—we got our papers, got on our machines, and rode away with the prisoner—we went into the Kennington Road—I was in front, and Kingdom next to me on the left, and the prisoner was on the right, and a little behind; Kingdom was also slightly to the rear—the prisoner was behind all the time till the accident—his front wheel was up to my back wheel—I was on the prisoner's machine, and he was on mine—there were two bells on my machine, the one the prisoner was riding—we were riding at from 9 to 10 miles an hour—that was about the pace we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190004300082"/>
               <p>kept the whole way—all of a sudden, about 12 or 15 yards in front of me, I saw the deceased coming out into the middle of the road—I shouted and rang my bell, and so did the prisoner—I managed to steer clear of her—she was on my right as I passed her—I turned round and came back—I did not actuahy see her leave the footpath—when we shouted she tried to quicken her pace, and succeeded in getting by Kingdom and I—I was on the wood paving—when I saw the deceased I back-pedalled—it is not true that we put on a spurt—9 or 10 miles an hour would be as fast as I could go on that machine—I could only just reach the pedals—there was no brake to the machine—it was geared to 112, which makes it harder to stop—you have not got so much command over a high gear as you have over a low one—there was no reason on that day why we should get to the Swan very quickly; there were no big races on then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The war was on then—we began to go a little faster when we got into the Kenniugton Road, because the road is better—my own machine is geared to 84—I was riding with dropped handles and no brake—I always ride with my saddle right down in the socket—these handle-bars are not the same as were on the machine on that day, but ones similar to these—there was no brake—the top and bottom bars were buckled—the top bar was slightly buckled before—I have not said so before to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cyclemaker, of 324, Clapham Road—I repaired the damage which was done to the machine which was being ridden by the prisoner on this day—the top and bottom tubes were slightly buckled, nothing else—a medium blow would do the damage—it would not be necessary for the machine to have been driven at a very furious pace to cause the damage—the machine was built for a light boy—it is a racing machine with roadster tyres—a roadster tyre is heavier than a racing tyre—being light, the machine would more easily buckle than a heavier machine—this is a 21 in. frame; a frame for a man of the prisoner's height should be 29 in. or 30 in.—I have seen the prisoner on this machine—I should think it would be impossible for him to get anything like a pace of 18 to 20 miles out of that machine—I think the best pace would be from 10 to 12 at the outside—it is too small for him—they can<lb/>not get the pace with their legs bent—the best unpaced road record is about 25 miles an hour under the best suitable conditions—a short person might get 14 or 15 miles at the most out of this machine—the average gear is about 78 in.; 84 is rather high—I was approached by the Crown in this case, and I made a statement—the machine was brought to me on the day of the accident to be repaired, and then brought in again after it had been ridden home.</p>
