The prisoner went up stairs with a candle on the evening of the 28th of February, and came down stairs again with a pair of shoes in his pocket. I then went up stairs, and missed my shoes, and ten guineas out of my box, which I had seen there on the 25th. I left my box locked, and found it locked. I challenged him about the shoes. He said he took them, but not to wear them. I charged a constable with him the next morning, and then accused him with having taken my money. He said he would deliver up all the things he had bought with the money, if I would let him go free; and he further said that he found the money on the bed. He gave up a watch, two coats, and a hat; they were all in the house but one of the coats. I found where he bought the watch, in St. James's-street, the day he had taken my money. He had 4 s. 6 d. in money. He came into the lodging on the Monday night; and this was the Friday.</p>

            . I am a constable, and was sent for to take the prisoner into custody on the 29th in the morning. He was getting out of bed. I told him that I had charge of him for stealing a pair of shoes and ten guineas. He denied it at first. I told him he must go along with me. Then he said, if I would let him go, he would give up the things he had bought with the money. He gave up a watch, which he bought for five guineas, a chain for 2 s. a silver seal for 2 s. 6 d. two surtout coats, which he bought in Rag-fair for two guineas, and a hat at the same place for 9 s.

               <p>Q. Now, as he wanted to make a condition with you when he offered to give up the goods he had bought with part of the money, if you would let him go, did you promise to let him go if he would?</p>

On Friday night the 27th of March, at half an hour after nine o'clock, my master sent me with a message to Oxendon-street. The prisoner overtook me at the bottom of Dean-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I have seen him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever speak to him before?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes. I have when he has been upon his stand; he is a <rs id="t17720429-2-deflabel11" type="occupation">chairman</rs>

I told him no; and that I was going about my master's business. He pulled me about, and hit me a slap in the face. This was at the bottom of Dean-street. I went along; and he followed me still; he came and gave me another slap in the face, and insisted upon my going with him, and pulled me about. Then I was got as far as Princes-street, when he pulled me from one side of the street to the other, and insisted upon my drinking with him. Then he took me in his arms, and carried me into a publick-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lift you from the ground?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes, and carried me to the Plow.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from this Plow when he took you up?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. The other side of the street; he carried me across the street to the house; he had a pint of beer, and drank it; I drank none of it. Then he wanted me to go backwards; the place lay backwards where the people drank; I would not go with him; he paid for the beer, and we both came out together. Then I said it was too late to go where I was sent, and desired he would let me go home. He insisted upon my going with him to another place, which I did not know. He led me about from street to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177204290004"/> street till I did not know where I was; and he got me into a street by <placeName id="t17720429-2-crimeloc12">Covent-garden</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you not know where you was?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Not till the next day. He told me I should not go home at all, that I should stay all night, and that he would get me a bed. He dragged me up an alley, when a woman came along with a pot of beer in her hand; he asked her to let me go into a house there; she said she would; I said I would not; she said I was a fool, and so pulled me in with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was nine o'clock when you set out from your master's, what time might it be when you got into this alley?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Near twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at the publick-house?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Not above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all the rest of the time you was about the streets with him?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What country are you of?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Devonshire?</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in London?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. About half a year. The man went into the house before me; and the woman pulled me up stairs by the hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you walked up, being pulled by her?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes. She took me into a room, she went out, and bolted the door on the outside. Then he strained my stays open with his hands, and took off my shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he undress you quite?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do then? Was he rude to you?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes.</p>

               <p>Hawkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer any violence to you?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. He pushed me upon the bed. I made a noise; and he stopped my breath with his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the room besides yourself?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Not in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any thing to you after he stopped your mouth?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell what it was. Did he threaten you?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No; he only stopped my breath when I made a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. By the side of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you after he stopped your mouth?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. He was concerned with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean he lay with you, had carnal knowledge of you?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes.</p>

               <p>Hawkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The last account you gave was, that he was standing by the side of the bed when he pulled you down on the bed. I suppose he altered that position before he had carnal knowledge of you?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. He fell down a top of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he enter your body?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he with you on the bed?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he stopping your mouth with his hand all the time?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. When I made a noise he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him after this?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. He still kept me there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you all the time upon the bed together?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No, we were in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay together on the bed?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I can't justly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. A quarter of an hour, or half an hour, or how long?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I can't justly tell.</p>

               <p>Hawkins. I can't.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get in the bed?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get out of the house?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. At eleven o'clock the next day.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you lie on the bed?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up from the bed was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. It was dark at first.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177204290005"/>Q. Did you lye down again?</p>

               <p>Q. Who let you out at last?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. The woman unbolted the door and I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out with you?</p>

               <p>Hawkins. Yes, I saw him go along the street a good way.</p>
               <p>Q. What street.</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I don't know the name of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you went home?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I did not go home; I was afraid as I had been out all night; I went to my brother's house in St. Ann's Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get there?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I was obliged to walk the streets all the next night, and went to my brother's on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him this story when you saw him?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No, I told my mistress of it on Sunday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No, my master and she could not be out together.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether, in all the time he was walking about with you, till he took you to the Plough, you called out for help.</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I was afraid he would murder me, as he had hit me two or three slaps on the face.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not at the Plough call out for assistance?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I thought he would let me go.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not call out for assistance to apprehend him, when you saw him in the street next morning?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I did not know it was proper to call out to strangers.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up?</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that they went to bed?</p>
               <p>Glover. They shut the door, and there was a bed for them to go to.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>Glover. Till seven next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they fasten themselves in?</p>
               <p>Glover. They pulled the door to; I don't believe there is any fastening; it is a little room like a closet, there is just room for a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise?</p>
               <p>Glover. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutrix. Did the maid drag you through the room where these men were?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. There were men and women in the room, I don't know who they were.</p>

            . I am a coachman; I lay in that house; two people came through, the room I lay in, to go to bed; I know the chairman, I don't know the woman; she came first into our room, she said she would not lie there unless she could have a room for herself and her spouse; the maid of the house said you may have one to yourself, so they went through our room into another room; the door was hardly shut; she must get upon the bed to go into the room; there were four or five beds upon the same floor, the partition was very thin; the woman went in first and sat down upon the bed, she must sit down upon the bed, for the bed touched the door; I never was in the house before, and never will go there again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any disturbances in the night?</p>
               <p>Robinson. There was no other disturbance but the maid of the house came up drunk and plagued us.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any crying out then, you must have heard them?</p>
               <p>Robinson. If they had spoke I must have heard them.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutrix. The witnesses sware you said you would have a room for yourself and your spouse.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never said any such words; when the maid dragged me up stairs, I said I would not lie in any such house, I was afraid it was a bad house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into any of the houses the prisoner has mentioned, to drink with him?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, only that one house at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sit with him all night in the chair?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I was walking about all night, I did not sit down at all, and I ate nothing all the time.</p>

When I was at some little distance from the house, I saw a light in the parlour; and, as I passed by the parlour-window, the shutters were violently thrown open against me. I thought it had been the maid, and called out what are you about, but received no answer. I stopped about a minute, while I scraped my shoes, when the prisoner jumped out at the window. In a moment after that, I heard Mrs. Sheild cry out there are thieves in the house. The prisoner ran away; and I pursued him up Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this Martlet's-court?</p>
               <p>Macardel. One end comes into Bow-street, the other into Russel-street. He turned into Broad-court, at the top of Bow-street; I still kept on; he turned about, and asked me what I wanted. A chairman came up, and we both laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other man in your pursuit of this man?</p>
               <p>Macardel. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the man that turned round in Bow-street was the man you saw come out of the window?</p>
               <p>Macardel. Yes, I never lost sight of him, but just as he turned the corner; we seized him. Mrs. Sheild examined the room, and a pier-glass was moved a little off the skrew; the glass was hung upon a skrew. I don't suppose that was done with an intent to be taken away; I suppose it happened by his endeavouring to get out at the window. We searched further; but we did not miss any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. How far was you from the window when the man jumped out?</p>
               <p>Macardel. I was at the door, near the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had the man got when you began the pursuit?</p>
               <p>Macardel. About ten yards; he had a particular dress; he was in a round hat.</p>

I went to the house; it was a house I had ready-furnished, which was not then occupied, but was ready for a tenant; it was about two or three hundred yards from my own house. I examined which way they came in, and found a pane of glass was broke in a window in the yard to come at the bar; I perceived farther the traces of their feet; they had forced the bars. I was sent for to the Justice's; there I saw most of my things; and the prisoner did own that they were my things, and came out of my house. I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

I rested about five minutes; then I heard a pane of glass break with amazing force, enough to wake any person in the house. I ran from the bed, opened my door, and went softly down stairs in my shirt, I had no weapons. I stopped on the middle of the stair-case, to see if I could discover any thing; but I could not. I stopped there about twenty seconds, and then heard the skrew of the window unscrew and draw out of the nut. I thought it would be best to get to the street-door, and then I could alarm the neighbourhood, and might perhaps be able to secure one of them. I went immediately to the street-door. From the time of breaking the glass to my opening the door was but half a minute, or little more. Upon my opening the door, the prisoner and another jumped from the top of the rails where they stood immediately against the window that was broke open; and as they jumped from the rails, I jumped down the steps. They kept about a yard and a half asunder. I took the prisoner about fifteen yards from the house. He threw me down, and hurt me; but I never quitted my hold, but rolled over him. He called out for his comrade, Peter, come to my assistance; he called many times, but Peter never came back. I called out for help, after having had hold of him five minutes; I called out to my opposite neighbour Mr. Keeler, but he did not come down: at last one

The lowermost middle pane in the uppermost sash was broke, the window was down, I had not given him time to get the sash up. Mrs. Hankey and the servants came down; and we carried him into the house. I put my cloaths on, and then we carried him to the watch-house for that night; and the next morning we took him before Justice Sherwood.</p>

            . I live at Mile-End; the prisoner lodged at one Price's, a brewer's clerk, just by me; he had lodged about the neighbourhood five or six months, I bought this whip and the spurs of him; I believe it was the 16th of March that Mr. Pigot had them of me, and I had then had them about a month; the prisoner came by me smacking the whip as I stood at my door; he came another day, and said he had a mind to sell it; as I kept a horse, I purchas'd it of him; I bought the spurs some time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a name on the whip?</p>
               <p>Francis. Yes; I did not take notice of the name then; he said a gentleman had died at Edmonton, and had left his whip, boots, spurs, and great coat, to his servant, of whom he had them; I went out with two friends to Little-Heath, on one side of Wormly, two of us in a chaise, and one on horseback; we stopped to dine there; from thence we went to Edmonton; I lay at a publick-house there; a man at the publick-house examined the whip, and then asked me how I came by it; I told him; he said it belonged to one of his neighbours, and that it was stolen out of Mr. Pigot's house; I told him I had bought a pair of spurs of the same man; my friends and I, and this person, went to the prosecutor's house on the Monday Morning, and shewed Mr. Pigot the whip, which he owned.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he sell you the whip?</p>
               <p>Francis. I was at my door; we went down to Mr. Horsenail's, and I agreed with him and paid him there.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not done in any private way, was it?</p>
               <p>Francis. None in the least, it was open to all the people that were in company. He was fully committed on Thursday, and on Saturday Mr. Wilmot sent after me; I went to Mr. Wilmot, who informed me that the prisoner had sworn against me, and that he must commit me. I sent for my father and several of my friends, and Mr. Wilmot indulged me with going to a sponging-house instead of a gaol; we were fully committed a second time, I and one Walby, who is a man of character and property; we were re-examined on Wednesday before six justices, and, when the justices had heard the whole of the case related, we were honourably acquitted; we were committed to the bailiff's house from Saturday night till Wednesday.</p>

               <p>Flanagan. No; he said it did not signify, for Mr. Pigot could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Pigot. I did swear it was my property before Justice Wilmot.</p>

On the 13th of March, returning from some workmen in a neighbouring house to my master's, I saw the prisoner come down the step of my master's door with the glass under her arm, and she had the winch in her hand; the lower part of the glass was not concealed by her cloak; I knew it to be my master's; I went and asked master if he had sold the glass; he said no; upon which I said I supposed somebody had stolen it; my master said, I saw a skirt of a gown go from the door, I thought it was a lodger; then my master and I went after the woman; we overtook her about twenty yards from the house, and we found this glass and winch upon her.</p>

Gratrix, who acted as the servant, opened the door; I told him my business; and he shewed me immediately up stairs. Mr. Sharpless was sitting with his hair a good deal powdered, and his face powdered; he was in a linen gown, to keep the powder from his dress, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. What, was his face powdered?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes, a good deal, rather more than there was a necessity for, I think. He asked me if I had brought some silk stockings, and bid me shew them; I opened several papers of stockings; he looked out three pair of coloured stockings, and three pair of white.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Gratrix in the room all this while?</p>
               <p>Hudson. He was in and out at the door; he asked me the price; I told him; then he asked me if I had silk pieces, and if I had not some black silk stockings with French clocks; I told him I had; he desired I would fetch some, and be pretty quick, for he should be in the house but a very short time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold him these silk stockings before you went away?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he asked the price, what did he say?</p>
               <p>Hudson. He bid me fetch some silk pieces; I put the stockings on a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing whether he would have the stockings?</p>
               <p>Hudson. There was no agreement made about the stockings; I did not take the marks off, but put the stockings on the back of a chair till I came back. When I came down stairs, I asked the servant Gratrix his master's name; he said Sharpless, and that he was a Berkshire gentleman. Then I went home, and brought the silk pieces, and the silk stockings; I suppose I was not absent more than ten minutes; I knocked at the door; the woman of the house opened it; she said the gentleman was gone out, and the servant had left word that I was to leave the things there, and the gentleman was to be at home at three o'clock; I told her I did not chuse to leave them, but would be back before three. I went home, and returned at about half an hour after two; I knocked at the door; the woman of the house opened the door; she said he was not come home; I asked her if she recommended them to me; she said she knew nothing of the matter; I asked her to let me go up stairs, to see if my goods were there; I went up; but my goods were not there; I would have taken them if they had; I searched the drawers and bed-chamber; there was nothing there; she told me, as I was coming down stairs, that, if he was a gentleman, I should serve him no more;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177204290021"/> I met another hosier as I came down, who had brought another parcel of goods; when he came out, he and I had some talk.

            , who is a servant to - Murthwaite, a pawn-broker, in Poultney-street, produced three pair of silk stockings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are three out of six pair that I carried to Sharpless that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. From Sharpless to the Prosecutor. Whether they were not agreed for, for half-a-guinea a pair, before you lost them?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No. I must have sold them for less than they were worth if I had; I sold them for 14 and 13 s. there was no agreement made at all.</p>
               <p>Sharpless. He agreed to leave the coloured ones for half-a-guinea, and the white for 12 s.</p>
               <p>Q. To Jenkins. Whom had you these stockings of?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I had them of Dunbar on the 14th of March in the afternoon; he was alone; I have seen Gratrix and Sharpless, or Hall, with him at other times in pledging goods.</p>
               <p>Q. How near this 14th of March?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I believe both before and after a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. What was lent on them?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. A guinea on three pair.</p>
               <p>Court. To the Prosecutor. Your marks remain on the stockings now?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Yes; the same marks.</p>

            . I knew the prisoners; about five or six weeks before this happened I saw them at their lodgings; they came there the night before this affair; I was in the room when Sharpless gave Gratrix directions to go to Mr. Hudson's, to order some silk stockings; he acted as servant, Sharpless as master.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Gratrix always the servant?</p>
               <p>Dunbar. No; at other times he has been in the same situation as Sharpless was then.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us for what purpose that lodging was taken?</p>
               <p>Dunbar. The same purpose it answered, to have some stockings there. We were, the day before, in St. James's Park; they had not any lodging at that time as I know of; it was agreed amongst us all, that the lodging should be taken; we had not proposed any particular lodging; we were all together when we found out this lodging; it was mentioned over night to get some stockings of Mr. Hudson. I went to their lodging next morning between nine and ten o'clock; they wanted me to go with the message to Mr. Hudson's; I went out with a pretence to go; when I came back, it was settled between them, that Gratrix should go as the servant, and Sharpless was to appear as a gentleman. Gratrix went, and brought word back that the stockings would come immediately. Mr. Hudson came about a quarter of an hour after; when he knocked at the door, I went into another room; I could hear their voices there, but not so as to distinguish any thing that passed; I came into the room again when Mr. Hudson was gone; I saw the stockings lie loose upon the chair; they agreed then to leave the lodgings; I put some of the stockings in my pocket, and Sharpless I believe had some; Sharpless and I went first; I think we went to the Yorkshire Grey at Buckingham-gate, and Gratrix came to us; we left the lodgings entirely. I went and pawned the three pair of silk stockings that have been produced, for a guinea; the prisoners stood at the corner of the street whilst I went into the pawnbroker's; Sharpless pawned the other three pair in the name of Hall at a pawnbroker's near Oxford-market; I gave him a shilling for the pawnbroker's ticket.</p>
               <p>Sharpless's Defence.</p>

            . On the 20th of April, about eight at night, I was told by Jefferson, that his servant saw a person open the door of the warehouse; I went down and saw the door broke open, and I put on a new lock directly; I went into the buildings to search at the two story warehouse; I found two paper bags full of sugar one two thirds full, and one empty; and beside the bags was a hat, that the prisoner had on the same day. I called out that I had found the goods. The people called out that the man had just jumped out of the warehouse. He had a great coat on, and his arms up to the elbows, all over sugar.</p>

I ordered a person there to let me know if any thing should be attempted to be moved, that I might seize for the rent; he came and informed me that the machine was about to be taken away; I went to the house; it was in the evening; I saw some of Ripley's the broker's men moving the machine into a cart; I asked them who they belonged to; they said one Ripley at Clerkenwell; I said they must put it back till the rent was paid; I broke into the front parlour, and in one corner of the closet I found these pieces of metal (producing some pieces of flated copper.)

            . Roberts took a house of me in Conway Court, Marybone, which belonged to Mr. Meake; Roberts lived in it about a quarter of a year; I lived next door to him at that time; I let it him in the last spring, he agreed with me for three years certain.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live in it?</p>
               <p>Wiggan. I believe two or three months; I don't know the exact time when he went away; it was about six weeks after Midsummer; he was to commence rent at Midsummer, but he came in before quarter day.</p>
               <p>Roberts. I was to have the house on trial till quarter day, then to have it three years certain if I liked it; when I came to it having a great family, and no water laid on, I did not like it; and Mr. Wiggan brought the agreement to me, and I would not sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay in the house after he said he would consider of it?</p>
               <p>Roberts. Six weeks or two months.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any agreement drawn up, and tendered to him to sign?</p>
               <p>Wiggan. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did he give for not signing it?</p>
               <p>Wiggan. He did not give any; he said there was some odd things to be done; I don't remember that he mentioned the water.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he staid any time after that in the house?</p>
               <p>Wiggan. I saw him there a month after Midsummer.</p>
               <p>Samuel Hall. I lived with my brother John Hall; he sent me to this house to move some things in the parlour; I saw the engine there, and I found several pieces of money in the closets of that house, in three different closets; I gave them to my brother (produced by John Hall) some stuck under the shelf, and some were wrapped up in pieces of paper.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with you when you found them?</p>
               <p>Hall. Only the man that was in possession, he is not here. There are thirteen guineas and a half; I found one on the first closet over night; the next morning I found two pieces in the first floor, and the rest were in a piece of paper on the two pair of stairs; they were sticking in the lime under the shelf. The first I had I paid to Mr. Snow; I did not know but it was good money; it was returned back to my brother next day; I took it for a good piece, and paid it away. The two I found next morning, the yellow of them was a little wore off, and they appeared whitish. I went into the country at Christmas, therefore delivered them to my brother.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Do you recollect how many days it was after the engine was stopped before you found this counterfeit money?</p>
               <p>Hall. I don't know.</p>

            . I am a broker; Roberts came to my house in Castle Street, Turnmill Street, Clerkenwell, and offered to sell me a stamp, which he said he had bought to let out to a man; I asked him what it worked at; he said he did not understand it, but the man paid him so much per week for the use of it; he said it was in Conway Court, Marybone. He came by another time and said he had sold it to another man, and had received a guinea earnest for it; about a fortnight after that he called upon me again, and told me the man had not fetched it away, and so had forfeited his guinea; he said he would leave the key of the out door, and I might go and see it at any time, when it happened to suit me; as I said I could not go then, he left me the key; I went to the house one day and looked at it; it was I believe in November. I found the number according to his direction; the house was shut up, so I enquired at the next door, if that house belonged to one Roberts, they told me it did, and I opened the door with the key; I went backwards into a little shed, and the machine was fixed in the ground; I suppose there are hundreds of them used in London in different businesses. I locked the door and went home; I sent him word, I think it was to Bull-and-Mouth Street, that I would give him so much money for it; he came next morning and told me, I might fetch it away; I was to give him 5 l. or five guineas for it; I sent my men to take it down, I think on Saturday; my men worked there all day. I was sent for next day to Sir

            , I think on the 30th of November, and said he had stopt a press belonging to Roberts, and that he suspected him to be a coiner; for that in searching the house they had found some counterfeit money; he said Roberts was off, but we might find him by applying to Ripley; I went to Ripley's house, and after some discourse I told him my business; we went up to Roberts's house at Marybone; there I saw the stamp; I desired Mr. Hall the rent-gatherer, to put his mark upon it, that he might know it again; which he did. We took the stamp to Ripley's, and he sent to Roberts to fetch the money; I attended with some others there, from seven o'clock till almost eleven; Roberts's wife sent word that he was not at home, but she would send him if he came home in time, if not next morning. I went with three men early next morning to Roberts's when the milk man came we got into the house; I fixed Taylor and Phillips at the door; I sent Broadhurst up stairs, I staid below. In the beauset in the parlour I found a blank die; in the cellar, this puncheon in a basket. I then went into the garret, there I found a furnace for melting, with skillets and tongs; that is what the castors use to run their metal in; I found some crucibles, a pair of flasks for casting some gilding wax, what is used in gilding, and here is what we call colour for gilding; after having gilt the metal they put this upon it; it is to turn any thing that is gilt of a more yellow colour; here is what they call cast metal, it is harder than iron, it is what the Bath stoves are made of; it is almost as hard as steel (producing the several articles.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is Roberts a lodger in the house? did you see any other family there?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I saw another family in the two pair of stairs; Roberts was a bed in the dining room. Mr. Patten was apprehended on the 16th of November; and he gave information of several people concerned with him in making of money; among them Bacchus was one; he lived in Cross Street, Hatton Garden; I went there and he was out; I saw his wife, and I told her I must search the house, which I did, and I found these little bits of metal and a file (producing them); the teeth of the file appear as if it had been filing bad silver. I waited three hours there before he came home; I asked him how he did; he answered, you have got the advantage of me; I said I wondered at that; then I told him there was an information before Sir

I told him I must search him; I took a letter out of his waistcoat pocket; whilst I was opening the letter, he snatched it out of my hand; I thought the letter must be of some consequence; I seized him by the collar and took it away from him again.

               <p>Patten. No; I lived next door to Roberts's house at Marybone. I did not then know where Roberts lived.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you coin?</p>
               <p>Patten. We used to work in the day time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the house open in the day time?</p>
               <p>Patten. Yes; the press stood in a shed in the yard; we cut them out of flated metal, with a bed and punch; a bed with a hole and a punch to fit it, then we strike the impression with the press.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of metal did you use?</p>
               <p>Patten. Sometimes metal, sometimes pinchbeck, sometimes silver, and sometimes silver and gold.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they disposed of; were any orders given to make them?</p>
               <p>Patten. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What proportion did they bear to the real value?</p>
               <p>Patten. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you make them represent the genuine money?</p>
               <p>Patten. We gilt them that were of silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue making money?</p>
               <p>Patten. About a twelve-month.</p>
               <p>Q. All at Marybone?</p>
               <p>Patten. No; we milled the edges with a double tool with nicks.</p>
               <p>Q. What use do you make of this tool that has been produced?</p>
               <p>Patten. We call it a hubb; we use it to sink the impression in the dye; I have helped to make dyes with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen either of the prisoners assist in making dyes?</p>
               <p>Patten. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. How much?</p>
               <p>Patten. We had different prices according to the size of the pieces: we were paid by Roberts, and sometimes Bacchus's father.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Bacchus's as well as Roberts's coin?</p>
               <p>Patten. Yes; I have seen them coin half and quarter guineas; I have seen Roberts coin guineas, but not Bacchus.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the stamp of a guinea stamped by them, upon any piece of metal?</p>
               <p>Patten. I have seen Bacchus assisting, and I have seen Roberts turn the fly, to assist in stamping; I have seen Bacchus make half guineas in the same manner, at Marybone; the counterfeit money that has been produced in court, is like that we made.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen them coin at any other place?</p>
               <p>Patten. Yes; in Bull-and-mouth Street, at Roberts's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were concerned in coining there?</p>
               <p>Patten. Cooper, Bacchus the father, the prisoner, Fuller and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that press?</p>

               <p>Q. Can that hobb be made use of in the business of coining?</p>
               <p>Yeo. This is the cast of an half guinea; the guinea is first moulded in sand, and in that mold they cast these of steel or iron, which has made the impression, being of a very hard metal; it is capable of making an impression in soft metal, that is the method we make dyes, ours are made stronger; but this will make the same impression.</p>

The surface appeared gilded, and on cutting, it looked silvery; on proper trial it was found to contain of fine gold seven grains, fine silver near fifteen grains, base metal above four grains; the value of the gold and silver together may be worth 16 d. or 17 d. and the piece was so well executed that it might easily have been imposed on any common observer for five shillings, and three pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Council. None of the guineas were milled I believe.</p>
               <p>Alchorne. No, none; the half guineas were and very well milled too.</p>

               <p>Mr. Parkins. It was made at the General Post Office, Lombard Street; the figures are not very visible; I rather suppose it to be the 18th of November.</p>

               <p>The house in Bull-and-Mouth Street is not my house; there is nothing in it mine, but my goods; the first and second floor only belonged to me; the other house was let on the 23rd or 29th of May, I am not certain which.</p>

               <p>Roberts. This engine belonged to one Cooper; I had orders to sell it to Mr. Bowyer, a button-maker in Moorfields. I am a baker by trade; I know nothing about making money, they have done it among themselves and want to throw it upon me.</p>

               <p>Bowyer. I believe not any body in particular; the key was left with me a fortnight; I went to a house somewhere in Marybone, I don't recollect the direction, to see it.</p>

I gave him 9 s. 4 d. we had been used to buy of him; I said it is a long while since you brought any; he said he had been ill. When he was taken, he confessed he stole them out of the cow-house.</p>

I missed two pieces of printed cotton from the field the 2d of January. containing fifty-six yards; a few weeks after that, one of my servants informed me, an acquaintance of his had bought some printed cotton at Uxbridge very cheap; I sent two people with warrants to search the house of the person who I was informed had some pieces; these are my pieces; (producing several pieces of cotton) there were never any printed of that pattern; and they are not finished; they were not in a saleable condition; they were cut into several parcels; they amount to within two or three yards of what I lost.</p>

I am a mantua-maker, and live at Uxbridge; I bought the cotton the first Friday of the new year of the prisoner; he brought three pieces of cotton; he asked me if I would buy a gown, I said I did not want it; he asked me to let him leave two, while he carried one to a customer; in his absence an acquaintance came in, and asked the value; I said he asked 2 s. 9 d. she said she thought the full value was 2 s. when he came back I told him; he said he sold none for less than 2 s. 9 d. when he came to open them, they were very much daubed on the wrong side; I asked how it was occasioned; he said, his feet were sore, that he got a lift on a dray, that his bundle lay between two barrels, which purged up and daubed them; I gave him 28 s. for fourteen yards; one piece had eight yards, and he tore off one yard from another piece; he said his name was

            . I am a callico printer, and servant to Mr. Witts; I know these pieces to be his property; they were lost from Mr. Witts's bleaching ground, on the 2d. of January. I know them by the pattern; I printed them myself; never any went to town of it before; none of that pattern had been sold. I went to Justice Fellows, at Uxbridge, and told him the affair; he granted me a search warrant, to search Mrs. Rickman's house; she cried and seemed almost out of her senses; she went to the justice's, and told him, she had sold them to these people; I marked the names of the people as they brought the goods into the justice's. I found the prisoner at Staines; he was waiting there to fight a cock; I told him I had a warrant against him, for selling of goods at Uxbridge; he said he would go along with me to clear himself. I spoke to the man at the inn for a chaise to go to Uxbridge; he would not let me have one. I sent for a constable; then the prisoner said, I don't know what reason you have to keep me; he said he would go make water; he ran in the yard and I followed him; he endeavoured to throw me down, I kicked him up several times; there were many people; they rescued him. Presently the man came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177204290040"/> with the constable, and he was taken at Colebrook.</p>

               <p>Milward. About an hour and a half; I shewed him a piece of the pattern; he denied he knew any thing of it, and always did deny it to the last.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the person who presented it; should you know the man if you saw him?</p>
               <p>Gething. He was a middle sized man; I cannot be positive to his person; I gave a ticket to the person for particular bank notes, according to his request, to the amount of the bill; I have here a memorandum of the bills.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. What did you take the memorandum from?</p>
               <p>Gething. From another memorandum taken by another clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the ticket put that you gave for the particular notes?</p>
               <p>Gething. It was put on the file of course.</p>

            . I am a cashier in the bank, and was so in the year 1765.</p>
               <p>Q. What way is the account kept between gentlemen who keep cash at the bank?</p>
               <p>Gething. There is an office called the drawing office; every gentleman that keeps cash at the bank, has a book of debtor and creditor, when he pays any money, it is of course entered by a proper officer. It is common to draw drafts upon printed checks which we give them.</p>
               <p>Q. How are the checks delivered out?</p>
               <p>Gething. We have them in books, a thousand in a book, which runs alphabetically; when one book is out, of course we begin the next letter; the checks are so cut out, that they tally with what is left; when any person wants checks they send their book to the discount office, and the proper officer delivers the checks, as they have occasion for them.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you know that Sir

            . I am a teller at the Bank; (I paid these six bank-notes, producing them,) one for 1000 l. I paid, I think, on the 29th, four for 500 l. each, and one for 600 l. that I paid on the 30th; it was before one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. To what sort of a person?</p>
               <p>Hodgkin. He seemed to be an outlandish man. He did not seem to be very quick at telling money, he told one parcel of it which he took away, and said he should come again for the other; I told him we had a porter that could take it home for him; he said I am only going to the compting-house, and shall be back before you go to dinner; he came back again in about a quarter of an hour for the other money, which he took up without telling. I said, do not you tell it? he said, no; it is right enough, you are generally right.</p>

               <p>Q. How much had he the first time?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think you should know the man again that you paid the money to?</p>
               <p>Hodgkin. It is a long time ago; he wore his own hair, and spoke broken English.</p>

             and Co. I do the out door business. I was with them in the year 1765. I fetched the checks from the bank, I always had 50.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you do with them, when you receive them?</p>
               <p>Russia. I separate them with scissars, and then put them in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any person in the compting-house access to them then?</p>
               <p>Russia. Yes;</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the company's book kept?</p>
               <p>Russia. In a desk, and sometimes in the store-room, but still the clerks might have access to it; that I believe is the book that belonged to the house, I always took it with me when I went to receive any checks.</p>
               <p>Council. Look at that draught, does the signature imitate Mr. Olivier's hand-writing, is it his hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Russia. I rather think not, because the draught is filled up with another hand-writing; I took that account at the bank and a note for 500 l. the ballance they gave me in a note, that there was but 500 l. when I came back with this draught in the box, I said it was not Mr. Olivier's writing. Mr. Walpole being abroad at that time, I am certain he came back soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been abroad before, a month or more?</p>
               <p>Russia. Yes, I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell when you left the book to be ballanced?</p>
               <p>Russia. I think about the beginning of November.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Your only reason for not supposing it to be Mr. Olivier's hand-writing is, the body of it was filled up by a stranger, and not by any body in the house?</p>
               <p>Russia. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Is it like his?</p>
               <p>Russia. Mr. Olivier generally writes larger.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion on the signature without the body?</p>
               <p>Russia. I could not take on me to swear; it really represents it very much.</p>
               <p>Q. But what is your opinion, whether it is or is not, in truth, merely by looking at the signature?</p>
               <p>Russia. It imitates it so much that I could not take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Then you had no other reason, but only it's being filled up with another hand, then nor now?</p>
               <p>Russia. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the suspicions you entertained of this draught, take any account of the checks, drawn or undrawn, and compare them with the checks you had fetched from the bank?</p>
               <p>Russia. I saw several checks in the drawer not used, and compared them with this, and this is a different letter and number from any I fetched; we looked immediately in the drawer they corresponded letter and number, but this was quite a different number.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. Was it not customary to leave this bank-book at the Bank for a considerable time together?</p>
               <p>Russia. Two or three days, perhaps, only to be balanced.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecutor. But it was never left when you went for checks?</p>
               <p>Russia. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. You said, you delivered the checks to a genteel man; is this witness the man?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this man Russia?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes; I have delivered to him checks. I have seen him there for checks.</p>

            . I was a waiter last January at the Antigallican coffee house, behind the 'Change. On Wednesday, the 15th of January last, about half past eight in the morning, one Mr. Wood came to the coffee house; he sent me to Mr. Walpole's, the banker in Lombard Street, for some checks, in the name of Mr. Oliver; the clerks said Mr. Oliver never sent for checks without a written order, unless he sent the book; and they refused to let me have any. I went back to Mr. Wood, and informed him of what the clerks had said, and desired he would send his name in writing: I gave him a slip of paper, and he wrote upon it - Oliver.</p>
               <p>Council. You must not relate any thing that passed respecting Mr. Wood, but come immediately to what you know respecting the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Perryman. Upon Wood's being detected in the forgery, Mr. Bourne, Mr. Walpole's partner, sent me to inform Sir 
               <persName id="t17720429-78-person695">

             of it. A thought came into my head, that if I went to Mr. Wood's friends, it might be a means of saving his life, as well as what might happen here; accordingly I went to Mr. Vestenburgh; the servant told me he was not stiring; I told him, I must see Mr. Vestenburgh upon business of the utmost importance; the servant carried the message up to his master, and brought word down, that I must go up; I went into his bed chamber; he jumped up in his bed and rested upon his arm, and said, waiter, what is the matter! I said, Sir I am afraid Mr. Wood has committed a forgery; Mr. Vestenburgh said, it is impossible! my God, it cannot be! I said it appeared too plain; I said if you will come and give him an item in Dutch to destroy the draught, it may prevent the consequences; then I went to Sir Joshua's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Vestenburg go to the coffee house?</p>
               <p>Perryman. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him at the coffee house afterwards?</p>
               <p>Perryman. I cannot say I have, though he might come in and out.</p>
               <p>Q. He came very often before I believe.</p>
               <p>Perryman. Yes; sometimes two or three times a day.</p>
               <p>Rev. Melchor Justus Vanhessen. The same day that Mr. Wood was taken up, Mr. Vestenburgh came to me at my apartments, No. 51, Threadneedle Street. I said what is the matter with you, you are so pale? he said he was frightned out of his wits, by a message from a waiter at the Antigallican coffee house; who told him that Wood had done a bad action, and that he was frightened for Wood; he said he had been at the coffee house; I asked him what he did there; did he speak to him? he said no; he asked me to interest myself in it; I said I would have nothing to do with such an affair, so begged to be excused; I told him I did not like Wood, and I wished he had never been acquainted with him; I said why do not you apply to his friends; he said he is your countryman, and you have a tender heart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear under any extraordinary agitation?</p>
               <p>Vanhessen. No; he appeared pale. On the next day (Thursday) I was invited to dine at a certain Tavern in St. James's Street; I went in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177204290044"/> the afternoon; the prisoner was there; the conversation fell upon Wood; Vestenburg appeared to be very uneasy, and wished he could lend him any assistance; and then he proposed writing a letter to his father; then he said the mail might be retarded, and proposed going over himself. I thought that the greatest friendship he could shew him, and the company present approved of it, was that he should write a letter to Wood, to acquaint him of his intention of going and doing him all possible friendship; and he wrote a note for a post chaise. I did not see him any more.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have known Mr. Vestenburg some years.</p>
               <p>Vanhessen. About eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not Wood and he townsmen abroad?</p>
               <p>Vanhessen. I believe so: I have heard them talk so long ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What character does Mr. Vestenburg bear?</p>
               <p>Vanhessen. As far as I know he is honest, and very charitably disposed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing strike you at that time?</p>
               <p>Tenbrooke. No; not till he was called for, and was missing, then, upon recollection. I thought I did observe a confusion; I thought he was not in his usual manner of behaviour; he seemed to be disturbed.</p>

Mr. Vestenburg went with us to our house at Islington, and staid there all night, as he had often done; we went to the St. Alban's the next day; the prisoner and my brother Nathaniel came together, and my brother Joseph and I went from the Change; and Mr. Vanheffen was there; the prisoner proposed going to Holland to Wood's father; we went from the tavern, to Mr. Vestenburgh's house in Austin Friars.

               <p>Hodges.

            . Upon my return home on Wednesday the 15th of January, I understood that Mr. Vestenburg was a bed at my house; I saw him the next morning at breakfast. I found there was an appointment to meet at the St. Alban's Tavern; my brother John, Mr. Vanheffen and myself went there; after dinner we talked off Mr. Wood's affairs; Mr. Vesteburgh said, he could not assist him with money, or to that purpose, but that he thought he could assist him essentially by seeing his parents.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you or any of your brothers acquainted with Wood before this?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of two letters having been wrote, and afterwards copied?</p>

               <p>Dear Sir,</p>
               <p>Since last Wednesday's conversation about our acquaintance's distress, I have been thinking of what service I could be to him in his distress, and after advising and consulting several friends, I cannot think of a better method than I have taken: you will perceive I have taken in the inclosed letter, which I should be glad you would deliver to our friend. I am acquainted, that some of the Old Bailey solicitors are the most proper persons to be consulted in this matter, if 8 or 10. guineas should be wanting in that manner, I shall be accountable to you for that sum.</p>
               <p>I shall see you as soon as possible, as I shall stay but a very short, time at Helvost.</p>

               <p>I am hardly recovered of my surprize of last Wednesday; unluckily I came a little too late to immediately assist you, however, I went directly to proper friends for advice, I did not meet with that success I expected; but, in the mean time, have neglected nothing for your good: my now pecunary circumstances exclude my being so forcibly your friend as I could wish, but I am determined to use the last effort of an old acquaintance and townsman. I have found from later information, that your case is far from being desperate, and though criminal, admits of many advantageous objections provided that you will take proper advice, which I hope you will by no means neglect: now as my affairs will not admit of my giving you any direct assistance with money, I acquaint you that I am gone over to your father to acquaint him verbally with your unfortunate circumstances, and persuade him to do all in his power to save you from this predicament, which I would have done by letter, did I not know what little attention he would have paid to it; this letter is under cover of Mr. Tenbrooke he was one of the first friends I spoke to about you, I make no doubt but he will be of service to you, at least, in recommending a capable person to assist you; I myself have frequently profited in my last troubles of his, and am persuaded his intentions are good. As soon as I see your father you shall hear from me, in the mean time, I hope my personal appearance for the good of his son, will have the desired effect on the heart of the father. May heaven afford you true courage, suitable to your present lamentable situation, and an happy extrication from it.</p>

               <p>in Case my Arrival should anticipate your Letter care shall be taken that it reaches me as soon as time and place will admit of. It's a pity we did not determine this point more exactly for in crossing the water and traversing the country it is impossible to six within three or four days my receiving any of your favours besides in France and Flanders and the Garrison'd Town of Holland names are punctually registered in and out in commerciall and large Towns I am too well known by somebody or another and consequently is resquing some disagreeable trouble therefore it will be necessary for me to endeavor to six upon another more convenient place mean time I am in great expectation of a circumstantial account till Tuesday 21 next</p>
               <p>I am amazingly tired and am going to bed immediately we propose to go to morrow by times should any thing occur shall add it to the P. S. pray receive my acknowledgements of your and your familys friendship towards me kindly, and remember me to Mr. Vanbeffen and Mrs. Fielders and all enquiring friends Bon Seir Mons.

               <p>Payne. Yes; he had been at my house, and was gone on board the packet; he was brought back again; then he sent for me into a back room, and desired I would endeavour to let him escape, by putting him into some hole or place, that was his words; he said, he imagined Mr. Russell would not take him back with him; he said he observed Mr. Russell and the gentleman that came with him, wink and laugh at each other.</p>

               <p>Mr. Russell.

               <p>Hernpeck. To the best of my remembrance I carried them to Moorfields, to a certain tavern, called the Globe, to Mr. Wood and Vestenburgh, and delivered them the notes; which according to my remembrance was the whole sum. I went for it but once; but I fetched the money at two times. I did not meet Mr. Wood, and not knowing where to carry the money, I carried it to his lodgings, at an inn in Bishopsgate street. I went back again to the Bank, and on the second time of coming from the Bank I met Mr. Wood; and he conducted me to the Globe tavern, where I delivered the money; Mr. Vestenburgh was not present. I was desired to dine with them the same day, at the Queen's Arms, St. Paul's Church Yard. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177204290048"/> went there and Mr. Vestenburgh was there; the affair was talked over, that it was a forgery, and Mr. Wood told me when I brought him the money the second time at the Globe Tavern, that it was a forgery: and that it was necessary that I should go off, because I should be known; and if I would, they would give me 4 or 500 l. the same transaction at the Bank was talked over again; Vestenburgh agreed to every thing that Wood said, that it was a forgery; Wood repeated what he had said to me, and Vestenburgh agreed to the same point, that it was necessary that I should go abroad. Mr. Wood and the prisoner agreed to give me 4 or 500 l. to go abroad; which I agreed to; 130 l. was paid me two or three days before I went abroad; Wood paid me 80 l. in cash, and Vestenburgh gave me a bill on Mr. Muilman and sons, in Amsterdam for fifty pounds; (a bill shewn the witness) this is the bill to the best of my remembrance; the indorsement according to my opinion is Vestenburgh's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive the draft of Miulman and sons?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you settle any place on going over in Holland?</p>
               <p>Hernpeck. No; I was there almost a year and a half before I settled in Holland. Wood and Vestenburgh desired that I should not settle; they said it was not yet time to settle, but that I should move about.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said before, there was an intimacy between Wood, you, and Vestenburgh.</p>
               <p>Hernpeck. Yes, I came acquinted with the prisoner when Wood and I lodged in the same house, through the means of Wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in company with Vestenburgh and Wood after receiving the money in London?</p>
               <p>Hernpeck. Two or three times we have been at the Globe Tavern. I went to Holland about the 5th or 6th of Nov. 1765. I received the money the day I left England.</p>

               <p>Q. When you went over to Holland, you say you moved several times?</p>
               <p>Hernpeck. Yes; Wood desired me not to keep long in one place. I have been in England since that time, about 24 or 25 months ago. I had been once before, about three or four years ago. I came over with a gentleman as a companion, and staid about three or four weeks; but I was only two days in London, the rest in the country.</p>

            , or order.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Muilman. Yes; he paid us for it, it has passed through all our books.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that bill was delivered to.</p>
               <p>Muilman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you can't say that Vestenburgh came for it?</p>
               <p>Muilman. I can't be certain; but I think he did, from the peculiarity of the letter of advice, which I have a copy of.</p>
               <p>Court. That cannot be read.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Tenbrooke clerk to you in 1765?</p>
               <p>Muilman. Yes; the writer of the bill is in Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tenbrooke. Do you remember the prisoner's applying to your house for a bill?</p>
               <p>Tenbrooke. I don't remember any thing in particular of that bill; he had credit for 300 at our house at Amsterdam on an uncle of his.</p>
               <p>- Shields. Hernpeck was an assistant with me; he left me on the 6th Nov. 1765, without any notice; I did not know of his going two or three days before he went; he said he had an estate left him, by a father or an uncle in Holland.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moore. Wood and Hernpeck lodged at my house. I have seen the prisoner come to Wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Were Hernpeck and Wood intimate?</p>
               <p>Moore. Yes, very intimate; they said they were of the same country.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have only to say that I declare myself innocent of the crimes alledged against me. As to what is advanced, in regard to the respect I paid to Mr. Wood, in going over to Holland, it proceeded from friendship; we were born next door to each other, in a country town in Holland; you have heard what Mr. Hodges has said of what passed between us.</p>
               <p>Council for the prisoner. My Lord, it may be proper to explain what is meant, where he desires no notice should be taken of his going to Holland for fear some disagreeable consequences should ensue.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hodges. Can you give the court a reason for Mr. Vestenburgh's conduct in that particular?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodges. He had had connections in the way of trade, with one Groneveil in Holland; and there is a dispute between them, so that if Vestenburgh had gone publickly to Holland, he would have been arrested; and if Groneveil had come over here, doubtless he would have been arrested.</p>
               <p>Mr. Muilman. I believe he was perfectly right in not letting them know he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hodges. Was not Mr. Vestenburgh in good business at that time.</p>
               <p>Hodges. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a man of extravagence or expence?</p>
               <p>Hodges. No, far from it, and he was very well respected.</p>

I did not know I had any other loss then; I got up, the watchman met me; whom I told, that I had lost my shoe and hat; the watchman said, there was a man just gone by with a shoe in his hand; the watchman and I went after the man that had the shoe; we stoped him; it was the prisoner; he immediately restored me the shoe. I took him to the watch house; the watchman bid me see if I had lost any thing else. The watchman by his lanthorn observed I had a cut in my breeches; I described what I had in my pocket, the same as in the indictment. The prisoner was searched in the watch house, and just that money was found on him. I am sure I had it in my pocket when I left Deptford.</p>

We went last Saturday sevennight; Jones, and I, and one Mr. Clarke, to the prisoner's lodgings, and found them both together. I laid hold of West, and searched him, I found upon him two quarters of a dollar, and a silver cross; I saw Mr. Clarke search the other, and take a ring out of his pocket. Jones had informed me they had a great chissel, I asked West where it was; he said he had no chissel but one, which a carpenter had left that had been repairing the house. I went into the garret and found these two chissels, (producing a large and a small chissel) we put them into a coach, and acquainted Mr. Faulconer with what had been done. Faulconer, I, and

Mr. Heley called me up last Saturday was a week, I went with him and Jones to Black-Fryars; we found the prisoners at breakfast, in the one pair of stairs room; I searched Lucas, and found 8 dollars, and 5 quarters. Jones said, as we were going to Black-Fryars, that there was a bad half-guinea in one of their pockets, which was taken at the time of the robbery, we found the bad half-guinea on Lucas, and in the same piece of paper was found this ring; and we found those things at the lodging.</p>

            . I was out with Lucas one Sunday, about a fortnight before Easter, when he told me he was tired of picking pockets, and asked me if I knew any house for them to break open. West was not with him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you out then picking of pockets?</p>
               <p>Jones. No; he was not out picking pockets then, he only said he was tired of picking pockets, and asked me if I would go a housebreaking with him, and if I knew of ever a place; I said I knew of Mr. Faulconer's; we all agreed to go and break it open on Saturday; we met West after, when he agreed to it; that was some time in the next week; we agreed to break it open on the Saturday, but they went and broke it open on Tuesday, unknown to me, as they informed me on Thursday following; when I saw them they said they had done it, and told me they had got this quantity of plate by them. They desired me to melt down the silver the first opportunity, I agreed to it. Last Friday week I thought I had an opportunity to melt it down, I went and told them, and they brought it to me; I was told there was 164 oz. of it, by my master, who weighed it. I was about melting it down when I was detected.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the prisoners lodged?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes, at Mr. West's; one is his son, the other his apprentice, he is a fan-stick maker; the master's name is West. The silver was all but 44 oz. when it came to me, melted down, they melted it down at a jeweller's, an acquaintance of their's; they wanted me to melt this 44 oz. along with 120 oz. to pour it into an ingot for them, to have it all in one lump. I went with Mr. Heley and Mr. Clarke to shew them where the prisoners lived.</p>

               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. I think you was not up the first in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The maid was up first, but she could not get into the part of the house that was broke open, because I had a key of a door between, which was locked. I forgot to mention, that I found a candle put out, that stood in one of my candlesticks near the door, that was taken off the hinges; the candle was not mine, I had no such in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell where the candlestick was over night?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot positively say; I am sure it was my candlestick.</p>
