                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, at 120, Bidder Street, West Ham—on 13th September the sanitary inspector, Mr. Evans, seized fifty-nine tins of condensed milk, which were exposed on my counter for sale at a penny a tin, and I was summoned before Mr. Bag<lb/>gallay at West Ham Police-court, and fined £5 and costs, because they were unfit for human food—I called the prisoner as a witness—I pur<lb/>chased the tins of milk from the firm in which the prisoner is a partner—I got these two receipts—the first purchase was on 21st August of two cases of 1 lb. tins at 2s., which would be halfpenny a tin—the usual price of a four-dozen case of 1 lb. tins is about 8s. 8d., more than four times the price I paid—the ordinary retail price of such tins in thoroughly good condition, and with labels, would be 2 1/2 d. to 3d.—my second purchase was on 28th August; I then had eleven and a half dozen at the same price—on 13th September there might not have been more than half a dozen of my first purchase perhaps—the fifty-nine seized were all purchased from the prisoner—I took the second lot home on the Saturday morning, and put them on my counter on the following Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday—I then found a few of them bulged, not very much; they would not stand flat on the counter, and so I put them in the canter of the pile with straight ones round them—I knew that bulging shows that fermentation has set in—as I sold them I opened them for the buyers—I found the milk was thick and rather dark in colour—they were sold to me as thick milk—there were no labels outside the tins; they had been stripped off; I could see the remains of some of them; they were in that condition when I bought them—I bought them at 23, Upper North Street, Poplar, the prisoner's shop—that address is on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189502250004"/>
               <p>invoice; it is an open public shop—the first lot were sold to me as "plain daily milk," which is a trade description of a brand of milk—they were sold to me to sell as retail again—there might have been a little difference between those opened on Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and those seized on 13th September; they would deteriorate by keeping—I did not notice any particular difference—I did not notice if any were bulged when I bought them—I don't think any of the first lot were bulged—I could not say how many of those were left on 13th September—when I opened some of the tins for my customers a little gas escaped, but very little—no gas escaped from others—the escaping gas was slightly acid in smell—I think I opened two or three on my counter for Mr. Evans—I noticed gas escaping then; from one especially—I think that gas had the same smell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner's brother called on me first, and told me he had got some milk that had gone a little thick, and asked if I could do with it at two shillings a case—there has been a quantity of thick milk about all the summer, even with labels on—condensed milk sometimes goes rather solid without being in any sense bad—I understood that that was the condition in which Pledge offered it to me, and I bought it, and that was the reason for the price—I said I would try two cases (ninety-six tins)—I took the ninety-six tins on the 21st, and tried it, and was satisfied with it—it sold fairly, and our customers were satisfied with it—I sold it as thick, but sweet—there might have been left six tins or so of that first ninety-six on September 13th, when I put the second lot on the counter—I had fifty-nine tins left on September 13th, having purchased altogether 238—I was satisfied with the first lot, and told Mr. Pledge so—I was making 100 per cent, on them—I know Pledger has a manager—I don't know if his name is Wilkinson—I cannot say that any of the second lot were blown when they came in on 28th, because I did not unpack them till the following week—if Wilkinson packed and looked them over, he would probably know if they were blown—I have no particular recollection of whether the weather was hot about August 28th or 29th, 1894—those I had left on September 13th were thick—I did not open one but what it was thick; I bought them as thick, but I considered, although thick, they were perfectly good—I don't suppose the prisoner had stripped off the labels; I believe he bought them without labels—I know nothing about it—they had had labels at one time—there might be considerable difference between the tins on Sep<lb/>tember 13th and August 28th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Justices of the West Ham Borough Police-court—on September 19th, 1894, William Porter was charged there with exposing for sale milk unfit for human food, under the Public Health Act, 1875—the prisoner gave evidence for Porter—I have this note of what he said: "I live at 68, Derby Street; I am a grocer, wholesale. The defendant purchased five cases of milk of me some time ago; a month or six weeks ago, the 28th and 21st August. Each case contained four dozen 1 lb. tins. It was bought at a grocer's sale by auction at Dalston, I cannot say the date, within the last three months. I have not looked at my books. It was bought at Lewis Joseph's sale at five shillings a case. I sold it at two shillings a case. We found it thick; that was why we sold it at a lower price. I said it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189502250005"/>
               <p>thick and sweet. I saw several of the tins when bought three months ago. I found them thick before selling them to Porter."</p>

                  </hi>. I am sanitary inspector for the Borough of West Ham—on 13th September I went to Porter's shop, 120, Bidder Street—I had previously purchased a tin of milk there—I saw fifty-nine tins of con<lb/>dense milk on the counter, marked 1d. apiece—Porter opened two for me—I did not select the tins; he picked them up himself—the whole lot were bulged at the ends—the milk in the two opened by Porter appeared a very dirty yellow colour and smelt very badly; it was a very sour smell—when he punctured the tin gas blew out—I examined the whole of the fifty-nine tins and told him I should seize them as being unfit for food; and I seized and took them to Dr. Saunders, the medical officer of health, and then before Mr. Ernest Baggallay, the Magistrate—about half of them were opened before him; they were all bad and were condemned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know nothing about the condition of these tins before September 13th—I do not think condensed milk would be unfit for human food if it were merely thick, with nothing else wrong—if the tin was blown I should naturally conclude at once it was bad—they were all blown on September 13th, some more than others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of health for West Ham—on September 13th fifty-nine tins were brought to me—they were all blown—some were opened before being submitted to me, and the others I took to Mr. Baggallay, and I saw them opened in his presence—in all the tins I saw opened the milk was thick, of darkish colour, in place apparently curdled, and with an offensive odour—when the tins were opened an offensive gas escaped—in my opinion that milk was quite unfit for human food—a robust individual might get over taking it; a person a little out of sorts would probably get indigestion from it or some gastric or internal irritation; it might be very dangerous to children, and it is largely used for young children's food—it would be harmful to infants and adults.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I look at thickness as being the first sign of decompo<lb/>sition—I know of no condition of a properly prepared condensed milk which is thick from simple causes—I should regard condensed milk, thick, but not otherwise wrong, as suspicious—I look on thickness as the first stage of decomposition—I think such milk should not be sold without a warning—I don't think it is necessarily injurious unless fermentation has set in; I object to its being sold—in my opinion it would be bad when it was thick; I cannot judge as to the exact stage of decomposition—I should not like to say how long before September 13th it had been unfit for human food, but I am of opinion that the tins would not have got into the state they were in during the thirteen days of September; that condition must have lasted at least a fortnight—decomposition would not be accelerated by moving from a cool to a hot place; heat would not start the decomposition.</p>

               <p>and other districts—I have bad considerable practical experience in the preparation of condensed milk—when tins of condensed milk are blown it indicates that fermentation of the contents has taken place—I could not say from that alone whether the contents were or were not fit for human food—it would not be safe to use the milk if the tin was blown—when a blown tin is punctured the gas which is causing the bulging escapes, and from the smell of the gas you can tell whether the con<lb/>tents are good or bad—I did not see these tins—in a suitable temperature of between 60° and 70° F. the milk might become very offen<lb/>sive in smell, dark in colour and curdled within fourteen days, not less than that—the milk first becomes curdled, and then dark in colour and offensive in smell; the curdling is the first stage in the decomposition—the whole thing might arise within about fourteen days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Decomposition might go on for seven days before you saw any external sign—in seven days under suitable conditions of tem<lb/>perature the tins would become bulged, and within fourteen days the milk would be so decomposed that you could see it—decomposition would be more rapid the higher the temperature of the air.</p>

               <p>a.m.—I had £11 in gold, and I might have had a few coppers; I think I gave them away—I went and had some dinner, and then went back to the ship—as I was leaving the ship again about half-past four I met Simpson, a friend, and asked him if he would come home to tea with me—we did not get home—we went to Leman Street Railway Station, and took train to the West India Docks—I bought some newspapers, and then we went into two or three public-houses—in the Blue Posts there were several men, and among them was the prisoner—I could not say if he was drinking with friends—Simpson gave him some money—when I and Simpson left that public-house the prisoner and another man followed us, and demanded money from me—he said, "Come on, give me some money; I want to get away"—he seized me by the throat and tried to force me over some railings three or four feet high, and the man with him came up and pulled him away from me—I said, "Leave off; we don't want any of that her"—he said, "Give me half-a-crown; if you don't give me half-a-crown it will be 5s. directly"—after the man got him away from me, I and Simpson went to the City Arms—the prisoner followed, abusing me all the way, and calling me filthy names—we went into the City Arms; the prisoner followed us in and demanded money of me—I said, "What I have got I earned, and I am going to keep it"—we had something to drink, and I said to Simpson, "We had better give that man something to get rid of him," and the prisoner had the change out of a florin or half-a-crown which I slid along the bar—we came out and the prisoner followed us—I insisted on Simpson going into the Waterman's Arms to have some more drink—when we came out we crossed the road, and as I passed a narrow passage between two shops, I turned and saw the prisoner behind me—I said to Simpson, "Here comes that man after us again"—Simpson said, "Let us make haste and get home"—the prisoner turned and struck me with his fist in the face and stomach, and knocked me against and through the door of the passage, and I fell full length in the passage—the prisoner fell on top of me—he put his two fingers into my mouth and round my gums, so that I could not call out, and then he caught me by the throat—I called out, "Pull this man off, he is murdering me"—Simpson had walked on ahead—the man with the prisoner was there all the time; when I got up he walked out of the passage after me—Simpson came back and tried to pull the prisoner off—the prisoner put his hand in my coat pocket and tried to take my money, which was loose in my pocket—I had about £9 11s. left—Simpson got him off me, and as he got up he kicked me deliberately in the back four or five times; I have been under a doctor ever since—I have not been to an hospital—I said to Simpson, "Hold that man; he has got my money," and the prisoner took to his heels and ran as hard as he could, and when he got to the kerb he spoke to the other man—a constable came up, and I was taken home—I had a nasty bruise; the doctor thought my spine was injured—I had a large bruise all down my face—I was bruised about the body and face—I can hardly get about now; I am afraid I shall not be able to go to an easy job they have offered me—the Police-court proceedings were adjourned on several occasions for my attendance in consequence of my injuries—I was in bed for nearly a week—I got none of my money back—about a fortnight afterwards I was taken to the station, and I at once picked out</p>

I met Orchard on 21st January and went to the Blue Posts with him—the prisoner and another man came in after us—Orchard and I went about from one place to another for about an hour; the prisoner followed us all the way—I gave him 3 1/2 d. at the Blue Posts to get a drink—at the City Arms half a pint of rum was called for, and he took it off the counter and put it in his pocket—he followed us then for about 300 yards, and then knocked Orchard into a passage—I saw them on the ground and pulled the prisoner off, and he got away—Orchard said he had robbed him—I could not see how the prisoner hurt Orchard because it was so dark in the passage, but Orchard's back was hurt—I went next door and got him some water—I think the prisoner walked away, but I cannot say, because I was looking after Orchard—I next saw the prisoner on 23rd January at the Police-station and picked him out from seven men—I have known him by sight for fifteen or sixteen years; I believe he is a dock labourer—I have no doubt he is the man—Orchard's spine was hurt; he was in great pain.</p>

I live at the Rising Sun public-house, 61, Carter Lane—I have known the prisoner since 1892—in January, 1894, I took the Bricklayers' Arms, and agreed with the prisoner that he should manage it, and he went into it in January, 1894—before he went in I applied to the Gas Light and Coke Company for gas to be laid on; and I signed this agreement, by which I undertook to pay a deposit of £6, and the charges for the meter, gas, and so on—I paid the £6 to the company the next day, and got this receipt, which I have kept ever since—I told the prisoner the same day that I had paid the deposit—he stayed in the house till September, 1894, when he closed it by my authority, because it did not pay—I was managing the Rising Sun, and am still—about the time the Bricklayers' Arms was closed—about the first week in September, the prisoner came to me—I did not know his address; he said he would let me know it; but he did not—I wrote to the Gas Light and Coke Company on 19th October asking for the return of my deposit—I had no idea before I got</p>

                  </hi> (410 <hi rend="italic">H</hi>). On 21st January, about a quarter past ten p.m., I was in Mile End Road in company with 409 <hi rend="italic">H</hi>, when I saw an old woman crossing the road from north to south in a diagonal fashion she was suddenly knocked down by a knacker's cart driven by the pri<lb/>soner—there are two tram lines in the road, and she was in about the centre of the near-side tram line—I should say she was struck by the step of the cart, but I could not say—she was between me and the cart—the cart went over her—I directed 409 to go to her assistance—I shouted out twice to the driver to stop, and he then pulled up within about fifty or sixty yards—when I first shouted he was about twenty yards from the woman—he got down from the cart—I asked him if he knew what he had done—he said, "The b—old fool should have got out of the way"—it was a two-wheeled cart laden with cooked horse flesh—it was a biggish horse—there was no light on the cart—I should say it was going at a pace of about eight or nine miles an hour—I asked the prisoner for his name and address—he said, "Why should I give it?"—I then noticed that he was drunk—I asked him to come back to where the woman lay—he said "You had better get someone else"—a private individual pulled the horse round, and the prisoner came back with me to where the woman was lying—he was very obstinate, and very indifferent—he said, "I want to see the old woman, and if I don't see her I shan't go to the station"—she was then being got into a cab, and I took him to the station—on the way he was very violent, and we had great difficulty in getting him to the station; he used most filthy and insulting language—he was charged with being drunk, and with manslaughter—in answer he only said, "Thanks."</p>

               <p>Prison, Holloway—the prisoner first came under my observation on January 18th—I have had him in the hospital ever since, and have ex<lb/>amined him very frequently—all the time he has been under my obser<lb/>vation he has complained of pains in his head—he has slept very badly at night; the pupils of his eyes have been unequal, and he has had Hallucinations of hearing—the first three weeks in the hospital he fancied he heard voices at night calling him—he used to describe what they said—for the past fortnight those voices have disappeared, and his mental condition seems to have slightly improved—he had undoubted delusions—he stated to me that Chester, whom he stabbed, he considered was employing a gang of men and paying them to annoy him, and that these men had gone to the lodgings where he lived and made statements about horrible conduct he had been guilty of to his wife, and daughter, and mother-in-law, and also made attempts to poison him, and had put ether into his room to stupefy him, and put poison into the food he took on two or three occasions, and that he had overheard certain observations which had been made by a man who was speaking to Chester, that led him to believe that the gang was in the pay of Chester—he said he could tell these men had been attempting to poison him by a peculiar sensation that came over him; he had lost power in his legs, and become giddy, and a peculiar smell, like that of rotten onions, came into his nose—from my observation and examination of him I consider he is at the present time decidedly insane—I examined him yesterday, and all the delusions he had when I first examined him still exist with regard to his persecution—I should say he was not sane on 17th January, and that he was unaccount<lb/>able for his actions—I thought he was capable of understanding this trial.</p>

I do not think he was in a state of mind to consider whether he was acting rightly or wrongly—I think he was not capable of realising the character of his act—I think he knew that using a knife would produce death or a serious wound, but I don't suppose he was in a condition to consider whether it was right or wrong to do that—he was merely acting under the delusion that the man was going to kill him—I think it was anirrational act done under the delusion that the person he was about to strike would injure him if he did not get rid of him; I think he thought that the person would kill him if he did not kill him first—he was capable of thinking that, and that it was desirable to get rid of him, and that a knife would be the best way of doing it—I think, if he had thought it out first, he would have known it was wrong to do that—I think he was capable, if he had attempted it, of realising that the law does not allow a person to stab another against whom he has a private griev<lb/>ance—I am of opinion that the prisoner did realise that to use the knife on Chester would be to kill or hurt him severely, and that he felt Chester was a person against whom he had a grievance, and that he was under the delusion that he had a grievance, but that he quite understood that if he put a knife into Chester the law would punish him—I think he thought himself justified in avenging his private wrongs against Chester, and taking steps to prevent Chester annoying him in the future—if he had thought the matter out he would have known it was wrong.</p>

Spiers and Pond's Restaurant, in Gray's Inn Road—I was alone—I saw a Mr. Wieland there—the prisoner and myself talked about this article published in this paper—I asked him if he did not write it—he said he had had a hand in it; he had supplied some of the material—he said a Mr. Herbert Winter had written it—I said, "Mr. Herbert Winter is not believed to be in existence at all"—he said, "Certainly he is in existence, I can produce him if he is required"—I then said, "I think you must know something about it"—he said, "Yes, I had a hand in it"—he said he furnished some materials and looked through some others and marked it together—he said nothing more about his connection with the article—that is all I remember—after his arrest I was shown some documents to translate, including "D"—I made a translation of it—it purported to be signed by Herbert Winter—it was written in English—I also made a translation of a letter purporting to be signed by the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Westphalian Gazette</hi>, dated the 27th November—I have got the letter in German—this is a copy of my translation—it is correct.

               <p>Road—this statement the prisoner sent to the customers for his collection every month, of the amounts due—his duty was to bring the money to Holborn—an account was made out for the purpose of including the 50 per cent, net profits which I promised him—the first was made out on 23rd May, 1894, by accountants; a sort of stock-taking—it showed a profit to January 12th, 1894, of £54 12s.4d.—I paid him the half by this cheque for £27 6s. 6d.—my cheques are all crossed—it may have been cashed at one of my desks—a similar account was made out to 21st November, 1894, which, including the previous account, showed a profit of £149 3s. 5d.—the cheque for his half of that, £47 5s. 2d., has never been paid—the reason for that was I was getting rather suspicious—that account was made out about a fortnight after the 21st November—we could not get a return of the petty cash from Peartree, so it delayed the balance-sheet till the beginning of December—I had applied to him for an account of the petty cash expenses every week—the pre<lb/>vious settlement was so unsatisfactory that I told the prisoner I would insist upon vouchers of the various amounts every week—that conversa<lb/>, tion took place at the previous stocktaking, about May—I asked him what he was doing for money, he was not spending very much—he said, he was using his own—I said, "Well, you are a great fool to do that, I do not wish you to use your money for my business," and he promised to bring me an account—I could not get it—I repeatedly asked him for it—Spencer Brothers and Messrs. Piggott, retailers, were customers—all I received from the prisoner from Spencer Brothers was £15 in notes, about the 24th December—I spoke to him about it in August and Sep<lb/>tember—I said, "Have Spencer's not paid?"—he said the account was so small he did not like to unsettle them by asking for it, no doubt he would get it in the course of a week or so—I sent him to Spencer's and be brought the money back—he said they were very busy, and had given him £15 on account, and we should have the balance next week—he paid in money on account of Piggott's; it was always in cash—I said, "How is it Piggott's pay such a large an amount of money in cash?"—he said they had got into a bad habit, they used to give him cash in the old business, but he would get them into a better one to pay by cheque—I preferred cheques from people like Piggott's—I did not endorse "Peartree and Co." on the back of any of these cheques—I did not authorise him to do so—it was his duty to bring them to me for endorsement—we never had such a cheque, if we had it would have been paid into my account by my cashier at Holborn—in the day-book, on 5th June, 1894, there is an entry in the prisoner's writing of 11s. 11d., goods supplied to Spencer Brothers—I find an invoice of the same date made out to Spencer Brothers, amounting to £2 13s. 5d., con<lb/>sisting of these three items: "12/33 No. 1 pouches, plain, 3s. 2d., £1 18s.; 3/33 silk vests, 3s. 8d., 11s.; 15 satchels, 3 1/2 d, 4s. 5d."—the entry in the day-book is 11s. for silks and 11d. for satchels—on June 12th the entry in the day-book is "Spencer Brothers, 17s. 7d.," in two items, and in the invoice supplied to Spencer Brothers £2 19s. 1d.—on June 23rd I find no entry in the day-book, but there is an invoice for goods supplied to Spencer Brothers to the amount of £2 7s. 9d.; on the 12th July, in the day-book, 12s. 6d., and in the invoice £2 13s.; July 14th, day book, £1 0s. 9d.; invoice, £5 3s. 9d.; August 2nd, day-book, 19s.;</p>

PEARTREE</hi>"—another is for September, 1894, £30 2s. 4d., and another for December, 1894, £16 3s. 8d.—those are Spencer's amounts—I never received them—of Piggott's I have one for April, 1894, £13 0s. 3d., August 10th, 1894, £43 6s. 11d., and September 1st, 1894, £33 1s. 10d.; September 8th, £27 14s. 9d.—I did not re<lb/>ceive those amounts—we had amounts on account brought in several times—these cheques produced appear to have been paid by Spencer and Piggott—they are open cheques—most of them are payable to Peartree and Co., or order—some are endorsed, "Peartree and Co.," and one or two are made payable to A. Peartree—the endorsements are in the defendant's writing—in January, 1894, I inquired of Spencer and Piggott as to the payments of their accounts—the prisoner absenting himself about the 5th January without notice, on a plea of illness, I went to his house—he was out—that was about three p.m., I saw him about seven p.m.—I sent his son to find him—in the presence of my clerks, Matthews and Dowling, I told him I had ascertained Spencer's accounts had been paid, for which there had not been any return, the money had not been handed in, and I asked him what he had done with the money—he said it seemed no use denying it, he had had it and spent it, and he had been all the week trying to get money to replace it—I told him he had stolen my money and I should prosecute him—I asked him if that was all—he said "No"—I said, "What about Piggotts"—he said, "The same remark applies to Piggotts"—I repeated I should pro<lb/>secute him—he begged me not to do so, he had a sick wife, and it would be his ruin—he promised to render a full account, and I gave him till 12 o'clock the following morning—he threatened to commit suicide if I did prosecute him—he came the next day and said he had</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have six or seven shops—I had known the defendant two years previous to employing him; three years altogether—I had found him straightforward—I had no fault to find with him—I found he had goods suit<lb/>able to my class of trade, and I bought of him—this water<lb/>proof manufactory was my business alone—it was wholesale—it was car<lb/>ried on in the name of "Peartree and Co.," because we supplied retailers who were competitors of my own retail businesses—that was his suggestion—I will not swear it was not mine—between December 21st and January 22nd I had five or six interviews alone in my office with the defendant—I did not first suggest going into business with him—he said he could make the factory pay—I do not remember the percentage we thought we could make—we discussed it—negotiations were not going on between us, only conversations—partnership was not mentioned—I had the agree<lb/>ment because I wanted the position clearly defined, and I could close the factory at a week's notice—I agree that was not signed till 28th, because we were busy about the 22nd and had to consult a solicitor—I paid the defendant £2 in the interval—I know Birnbaum's as a business house—Birnbaum never demanded about £100, the defendant's debt, on the ground of there being a partnership between us—there was nothing of that nature—no creditor of Peartree sought to make me liable; it is false to say I told Peartree so—the agreement was not to avoid such an at<lb/>tempt—Peartree never mentioned it—I did not press Peartree after his refusal to sign the agreement, nor say, "If you will do it I will give you my solemn promise that any such writing shall only be produced in the event of any creditor of yours trying to make me liable to pay your old debts"—that is the only agreement between us, excepting with regard to commission—I said so at the Police-court—the arrangement from the first was that the defendant was to have half the net profits—that was left out at the defendant's special request—I explained to him he would be running a risk, and was trusting to my word—he said he had his own reasons, and would trust to my word—I had a suspicion of his reason—he owed some money, but that was not my affair—as the agreement stands he would get £2 a week,</p>

               <p>and if he did not behave I could close it at a week's notice—the assignment was made to liquidate the debt—no money passed—the £40 was for money I had advanced him in September, 1893—I had had notes as against the £40 for part of the money—we did not know at the time what was due to me—now the account is made out we say £28 is paid—we knew that on February 27th, but the books were not made up—I did not then know that £40 had been advanced by me, as against a current account for goods to be supplied, and that goods had been supplied to the extent of £28—at that time I thought he owed me £40—I did not know what was paid off till after the Police-court proceedings—the remaining £12 has never been paid—it is credited—I suppose I owe it—the goodwill was about £10—I paid the defendant a cheque for £10 4s.—I say the £10 receipted in the assignment was paid in the £40 I advanced to the defendant in September—it was not paid separately—it was decided to have the two documents from the beginning—the accounts were to be taken at my discretion, and not agreed to be taken at four or six months—I should not be likely to delay them two or three years in my own interest—I agreed to pay the defendant a commission of half the net profits—the words I put on the counterfoil of the cheque of £27 6s. 6d. I paid him are "half profit <hi rend="italic">share</hi>"—the whole thing agrees with my way of putting it—I simply put it for my own guidance—we charge the prisoner with embezzling £350; I mean that is the total amount—the learned Magistrate restricted the amount—the defendant's share of profits would be about £50—there is due to him on petty cash a few pounds; between £40 and £50—it is not £49 odd; it is £49 less £5 he has had—I do not owe the defendant £113—in one way I do, but he has had the money—his share of profits would not be £20, £15, or even £10 for the winter season, which shows generally a loss, as trade is very slack—the defendant admitted the embezzlement, and I said I would prosecute him, but before proceedings were taken I thought £160 to £200 sufficient to cover the deficiency, but the deficiency was afterwards found to be, perhaps, £50 greater by the 18th January—I was willing the money I owed the prisoner should be allowed in the account—I said so to the prisoner—the question was not asked at the Police-court—Dowling was present at the whole of one Interview on 11th or 12th January—the prisoner never said, "What about the part<lb/>nership and my share of the profits?"—he mentioned the share of the pro<lb/>fits coming to him on the stock-taking balance, and that with what money he could get he would render a true account, and would refund every penny—I was surprised to get a writ—I know very little about water-proofing beyond buying; I could not now carry on the manufacture of water-proofs without a proper man to do it—the defendant was not ill; it was a sham—this is not my venom—the defendant said something about when the account was taken very little would be found due either way—we were waiting for the account—I had the security of the stock—the defendant did not say there was a difference in the invoices sent to Spencer's and Piggott's and the invoices I had, because they represented goods made out of stock that he had that could not be charged to my account—the stock is there still except one piece that he said he used—a similar book to this was kept before this one, which ends 21st April, or sheets of paper were made out every week; we do not keep those papers after a time—this</p>

J. Smith," when Detective King called on me, not before—it is not my signature at the bottom; it is my name, but not in my writing—there is a description of where I live and my occupation—the document is not signed by me or by my authority—I never paid the five shillings which I am here credited with.</p>

I am a general merchant, of Regina House, Claphain—the prisoner was in my service up to 5th January, when he had to account to me for his stock and hand over the goods and orders—he handed over the stock to me, with the exception of three musical albums, for which he produced orders—these are two of the three orders; they purport to be genuine orders by customers, and I believed them to be so—this signature (Perkins) is in the prisoner's writing—a traveller might make out the order, but it should be signed by the person giving the order; if the person could not write, he or she should make a mark, and it would be witnessed—the value of the albums was 30s.—we were to receive 4s. a month—the prisoner would be entitled to fifteen percent, commission—the first 5s. was accounted for on the order form; it was supposed to be paid at the time—I sent a collector to the address on those two orders to confirm the orders, to see if they were good—on the report received from him I wrote to the prisoner—he came to see me, and said he was very sorry; when he took the musical albums the customers would not take them, and since then he had disposed of them for cash—I said, "If that is the case you had better pay the money in at once"—he said, "I am not in a position to do that. I have got into a little trouble, but I will pay 10s. on account—I refused to accept 10s., and said he must pay the whole or none—since that the money has been paid—inquiry was made by the police, which resulted in my finding out that the prosecutrixes repudiated these</p>
