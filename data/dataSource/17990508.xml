When I got to Hackney, the prisoner came up to the pay-table with the other men; Mr. Hayes asked me if I knew which was the man; I told him, yes, and Mr. Hayes called him; I asked him if he recollected me; he said, no; I asked him if he knew the tripe-shop in Mileend-road, and why he did not come and fetch the floor cloth away which he had left there; then he said he recollected me very well, and that he had taken them form his master, and never intended to fetch them away, that he was ashamed to come for them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Are you a house-keeper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was day-light, and consequently there was nothing at all suspicious in his conduct? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted if he had called again, you would have given him the floor-cloths? - A. I certainly should.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. No, I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. He wanted the floor-cloths to be put in a place where they would be exposed to the view of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080008"/>every body; but you had not room for them there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. However, when you came to the pay-table, you saw him sitting among the other men, he recollected you, and said, he was ashamed to come to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, if he had come on the same day, or on the Monday, you would have given him the floor-cloth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not offer to sell it to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was there any thing in his behaviour to induce you to think that he was out of his senses? - A. Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER-DANIEL HAYES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What is the firm of your house? - A. Christopher-James Hayes, and Christopher-Daniel Hayes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that floor-cloth; was that manufactured by yourselves? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular about it? - A. Yes; in one corner of it there is my own name stamped; and, upon the other corner, in my own hand-writing, is the words "Spence, sold to Spence, of Walthamstow;" it was intended for him. but never delivered.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it paid for? - A. No; it would have been his property when delivered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was the prisoner in your employ upon the 6th of April? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He had access to those places where these cloths were deposited, and might have stole them if he chose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. Eight or nine pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was he in your service? - A. A grinder of colours.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Had you ever any reason to suppose he was deranged in his intellects? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you never observe any sort of frantickness or odd conduct about him? - A. No, only when he got drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this floor-cloth taken from the warehouse in Fenchurch-street, or from the warehouse at Hackney? - A. From the warehouse at Hackney.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. There is another indictment against them for taking a watch? - A. I did not find that; the greatest part were penny pieces; I heard no more of them till I was sent for to the Police-office to come forward.</p>

               <p>Mills's defence. This day week we were at a public-house opposite Shadwell Police-office, in company with two other men, and that man came in and said, neither of us were the persons; he went out and returned again, and asked the officers which two men he was to swear to; first they said it was the 4th of April, then they said it was the 2d.</p>
               <p>One witness was called to Mills's character.</p>
               <p>Bevan's defence. I have sent for a couple of gentlemen who are not here. This gentleman and lady came, and said, we were not the men; Mr. Haynes, and the other gentleman, said, they might rely upon it we were the men, and the young woman asked whom she was to swear to, and the officer said, to these two.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What mark? - A. It was a mark of red across the shoulders, about as wide as my hand, a single one.</p>

            : I know the prisoner at the bar, he had been in my service two years, I believe; he had quitted my service within about a month of this, perhaps; I had got my father and mother-in-law supping with me, between eleven and twelve o'clock on Sunday night; one door of my house comes into the manufactory, and the other comes into the street; I attended my company to the door about half past eleven, on the Sunday night the 7th of April; my dog took to the centre of the yard, and made a very uncommon noise; I went there and watched, I could see nobody, the candle would not keep a-light; I watched in the yard at the gateway, the place where I supposed he should have come over; I then heard the alarm of my servant, and my wife; I then saw a person attempting to get up, in the inside of my manufactory, into the street; I came round and went out at the other door, and when I got round, I saw him dropping down into the street; I could not perceive whether the person had any thing with him; I pursued him, and perceived another person, which was a watchman, coming to the alarm; the watchman met him first, at the top of Mary-le-bonne-passage, which is about twenty yards from my house; I heard a piece of iron drop; when I came up to him, I found it to be the prisoner at the bar; he then said to me, he hoped I would do him justice, I had always behaved well to him; I told him I most assuredly would; a piece of iron was found in his coat-pocket, I saw it taken from his coat-pocket; I saw two pieces that were dropped, and we went to look if there were any more, and we found another piece; there were between twenty-six and twenty-eight pounds of bar iron, valued at about three or four shillings; the iron was put into two parcels, between the railing, for the convenience of carrying it away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he read it in such a way as the persons in the room could hear it? - A. I was so very busy that I cannot say whether they heard it or not, I heard it.</p>

               <p>Q. They were persons that you had coupled together? - A. Yes; and in going out at the street-door, I saw an opposite door open, but I, and two others, went and told them to shut the door; the door was then shut, and upon turning on my left-hand, to go up the street, I saw one of the prisoners at the bar, Timothy Brian, with a stick, making a blow at me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body see Limerick? - A. No, he was behind our backs; we tried then to get Brian up, but could not get him up, and we were afraid of losing the people we had made prisoners; we went after them, and brought them to the corner of New Compton-street, Broad-street, St. Giles's.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was this after you had left the house? - A. It might be better than ten minutes; Birch said, for God's sake go back, for there is murder being committed; we then made all the haste we possibly could, till we came to the corner of Maynard-street again; then we saw

               <p>Q. In what situation was Grant at that time? - A. He said, oh Lord, oh Lord, go back for God Almighty's sake, for he was a dead man, and there was murder being committed; I then went back with Smith and Cockin to Maynard-street, to the King's-arms; the first thing I saw was Ravenhill, one of our officers, sitting in a chair by the fire, and the blood was making a clean breach out of him like water; I went backwards, and there I saw Beresford, the officer, lying bleeding, insensible; then we got a coach for Beresford, and the other walked.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go into the house? - A. I did not, I was outside the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you assist in conducting these persons to the watch-house? - A. I did, along with Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. AS you were going along to conduct those people, what happened? - A. When we were going along, a man came up with a shovel.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that at the time you had these people in custody, and were conducting them to the watch-house? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that man do? - A. He attempted to knock me down with a shovel, (producing a large shovel); I prevented the blow with my stick, and stepping back, something took me off my legs, and I thought he had knocked me down; I got up immediately, and he was making a blow at Jones with the same shovel; I then caught the shovel with the hook of my stick, and then I caught it in my hand; I struck the man upon the arm 
several times, and then at last he let it go all of a sudden, and, by getting hold of the shovel in a hurry, I fell down again.</p>


               <p>Q. It was slippery, frosty weather? - A. It was very slippery; when I got up again, I had the shovel in my hand, and the man was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, who struck at you and Jones, explain his reason, or say any thing? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you left the house with these prisoners, had the assault upon Grant began then? - A. I believe not, I heard nothing of the kind.</p>

He said something in Irish, but I did not understand him; then I went down near St. Giles's church, to see that those other people we had sent out before were gone safe along.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far was this house, the King's arms, from St. Giles's church? - A. I cannot say, I am so little acquainted with that part of the town; upon my return from St. Giles's church, I met Brian again, with this stick in his hand,(producing another), in Maynard-street, about ten or fifteen yards from the King's-arms; he was brandishing it about, and was going to strike us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that time? - A. Yes, in the same sort of language; he said it plainer then than he did before, but what it was I cannot tell; I seized him directly, and took this stick away from him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that after the fray happened or before? - A. After; he had a white-thorn stick half way in his hand; and he said, horroo, for the bloody Sarsenegs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the meaning of that word? - A. I have been in company with Irish people, a great many times, and I understand that Sarseneg means an Englishman.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that stick, and of him? - A. He was taken to the watch-house, and Smith wrenched the stick out of his hand; I went as far as Cross-street with them, and then Jones and me came back again to the house; the mischief was all done then, and the people were bleeding.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the people, that were there bleeding, your officers? - A. Yes; Grant was gone; there was only Ravenhill and Beresford there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At the time when you heard this expression, that you speak so correctly to-day, it was after he had been a good deal beat? - A. I did not see him beat; he had some blood upon his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn any other Irish expressions? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that is the meaning of the word Sarseneg? - A. I only go by information that that is the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear the meaning of it? - A. On the 26th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. On this very occasion? - A. Yes; and I have heard it before; I have worked with Irish people.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether this is a Welch word or Irish? - A. I cannot say.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable of St. Clement's: I went, with the other officers, to the King's-arms public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Grant one that went with you? - A. Duncan Grant and I went together; he was one of the captains of the patrol; we went, and I saw Miller read the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Miller read the warrant? - A. He read it in the back-parlour, at the Brown Bear, before we went; I never was inside of the door of the club-room at all; I went through the tap-room up one pair of stairs; and just before I went into the room, somebody said, take care of Kennedy, meaning the poker; when I went into the taproom, I took a large pair of tongs, and a stick, and went up stairs, and Grant with me, and Cockin; as soon as we got up stairs, two people were brought out, by Kit Jones, for us to take to St. Giles's watch-house, they were delivered to me, Grant, and Cockin; we took them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you take them through the taproom? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all quiet there at that time? - A. I saw nothing amiss in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might be in the tap-room at that time? - A. I do not recollect whether there were any or not, for I rather think they were frightened, and gone away; the tap-room was very clear when we came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Grant go with you to the watch-house? - A. Yes; then Grant said, I think we had better go back, and see after our brother officers; accordingly we did go back; just as we got to the corner of Maynard-street, we heard a terrible riot, fighting, and knocking about, in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the house when you heard that noise? - A. About as far as from here to that gallery; Grant said, they are fighting, we had better go in; says I, I will not part with you you may depend upon it; Grant brushed into the tap-room directly; I was going to follow him directly, and was cut right down the head.</p>
               <p>Q. With what? - A. I cannot say; I saw a long cutlass, fluted all the way, and turned up at the end; one man said to me, b-st me, or something like it, I can't be positive to the word, what you have come again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that person was? - A. I think Sullivan, but I cannot swear it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Look at Sullivan? - A. I think he is the man, but I cannot swear it; I saw Brian, he stood next to the bar, where the light was, and Sullivan next to him, that was the way that I saw the cutlass; I was at that moment beat back into the passage; as soon as I had got half-way out at the door to get into the passage, somebody came behind me and beat me most unmercifully, and got me down; I then began to fight and clear my way, and somebody caught hold of the cutlass which I had in my hand, from behind me, I drew it through his hand, and recovered it, and kept it; immediately as I had done that, I had a cut come across my fingers, which broke the guard of my cutlass; I then made my way into the tap-room again, I got into the room, and there I saw Grant lay; somebody came behind me, and cut me across my wrist and my arm, I do not know who did it; I said to Grant, I was sorry to see him lay there, I would help him if I could.</p>
               <p>Q. It broke your arm, did it not? - A. Yes, in two places; it cut the bone through.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080018"/>Q. How long had you parted with Grant before you saw him in that condition? - A. The whole was not above five or seven minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did these people chiefly consist of the patrol, or the persons you found there originally? - A. There were more of these people than of our party, because we were weakened by some going away; they were mostly strangers, and were fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Grant parted from you? - A. He was hustled by the people in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between that and your seeing him again? - A. It could not be above five minutes; if it had, I do not think I should have lived myself, I bled to that degree.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You say you are sure you saw Brian and Sullivan in the room upon your return? - A. Yes; but I cannot swear that they struck me; and there was a short man with them in a brown jacket which I laid hold of, but he was rescued from me.</p>
               <p>Q. When Brian was standing next the candle, how far was that from where the deceased was knocked down? - A. About as far as from here to where that gentleman sits. (Pointing to the shorthand writer).</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw the cutlass in somebody's hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you observed Brian and Sullivan, did you see a cutlass in their hands at all? - A. I did not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons besides the officers that had a cutlass? - A. Not that I observed; I had enough to do in the confusion, for my hat was pulled over my eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who pulled your hat over your eyes? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. The officers had cutlusses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cutlass that you saw by the light, a cutlass of the same sort with those of the officers? - A. No; it was larger, and longer a great deal; I thought it was a recruiting-officer's cutlass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do I understand you right that there was a disturbance in the house? - A. Yes; the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Brian and Sullivan were standing in the room, what part of the room? - A. Brian stood against the bar, and Sullivan next to him, and that short man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a fire-place in the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they near the fire-place? - A. No, they were the other side of the room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Grant had been to the watch-house, and upon your return to the tap-room, you saw nobody at all in custody? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Upon your oath, was there not any body in custody at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the tap-room, was the prisoners, Sullivan and Brian, in custody at that time? - A. Not to my knowledge; I am almost confident they were not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other officers in the tap-room when you came in? - A. Two or three more.</p>
               <p>Q. You all had cutlasses? - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was the deceased? - A. His head lay towards the wainscot of the tap-room, and his feet towards the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether any of the officers were upon the stairs then? - A. No.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you see any below stairs afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any cutlasses in the hands of any but officers? - A. I cannot say that I did; I had enough to do to keep the blood out of my eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw this sword before you were struck? - A. No; I saw the stroke of a cutlass at me, but I cannot say who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the prisoner, Sullivan, was taken into custody? - A. Yes, and made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your warrant to apprehend rogues and vagrants? - A. We went to take all idle and disorderly persons, and deserters; so, I suppose, the warrant said.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the warrant read to you? - A. Yes; in the back room at the Brown Bear.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you one that accompanied Miller up stairs? - A. Yes; but I did not go into the clubroom.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Sullivan dressed? - A. He had a blue coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not a blue livery coat - do you not know he is servant to the Countess of Antrim? - A. I do not know, I have understood so since; I think, when I went in, he asked me how I did, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had he a blue coat on? - A. He had.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080019"/>Q. Tell us what you saw of Brian that night? - A. That night, after all the people had been conducted to the watch-house, I came down into the tap-room from the club-room, there was a man and a woman tied together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all quiet then? - A. Yes; there were three or four women in the tap-room sitting by the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else was in the tap-room? - A. I do not recollect seeing any other man there but myself; there were some other officers up stairs; Brian came in without any stick in his hand, and bleeding; and said, where is the bloody thieves, where are they all; he directly turned round and went out of the tap-room; he had been gone out but a very few minutes before there were a dozen or fourteen men came in, with bludgeons and cutlasses; I ran before them, and went up stairs into the club-room to Miller, and some other officers; I desired Miller to come down stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Of these twelve or fourteen men, can you be sure whether any of them were officers? - A. I am sure they were not; Miller and I came down to the foot of the stairs, and I was no sooner at the foot of the stairs before my hat was pulled over my face, and I was pulled on the ground; I received a violent blow with a stick, or some weapon, over my shoulders, and was trampled upon by the people.</p>
               <p>Q. Who those people were you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Grant at that time? - A. I saw him laying with his head towards the door-way as you go out of the tap-room, and his two knees up towards his face; I went towards him, and pulled a pistol out of my pocket, and said, the first man that attempted to come in doors I would shoot him, there was a mob of them at the door then; that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this poor fellow, Grant, after the riot was over? - A. Yes, I saw him lying down after they were gone; he was cut almost to pieces, and bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you help to convey him to the hospital? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you went up stairs to call Miller, you left Grant in the tap-room? - A. No, I did not see him; he must have come in at the time they were fighting; I did not see him come in.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time these people rushed in, soon after Brian had gone out, did you hear any expressions made use of? - A. I cannot say that I did, for I ran up stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say who did? - A. No, there were so many of our people.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you and Miller, and the other officers, drive the persons out of the house? - A. No; I believe they ran out, after seeing the danger they had run.</p>
               <p>Q. After the scuffle, in which you were knocked down, they all ran out of the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a light in the room then? - A. Yes; there was a candle, or there might be two.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not both knocked out before the riot ceased? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom Grant received the wound, you cannot say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a small room, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all fighting, and the confusion was very great? - A. Yes, for the time it lasted; I was trampled under foot most of the time.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of that warrant, did you proceed to the public-house in Maynard-street, St. Giles's, with these constables, to execute the warrant? - A. I did, there were a number of persons, like labouring men, sitting in the tap-room, drinking and smoaking; I heard a fiddle up stairs, and I took a party of the officers up stairs to execute the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the persons that you took up stairs to execute the warrant, was Duncan Grant one? - A. He was.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you sent the men off in execution of your warrant, before any thing happened to you or any of the officers? - A. I believe they were all gone off.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time the disturbance commenced, were there many of them sent off? - A. Yes, the major part of them, I believe, were gone; when I came down stairs into the tap-room, there were a great number of people fighting and cutting at our patrole.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say cutting, did you discover any weapons they were using? - A. Cutlasses and bludgeons; I drew my cutlass when I got to the bottom of the stairs; I then saw Grant on his legs, standing, with his head very much cut, and leaning forward; after I came down, he received a violent cut with a cutlass; I saw the blow struck, for I was as close to the deceased as could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who struck him? - A. I am not positive, but, to the best of my recollection, it was Sullivan; it was a tall man, in a blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say this with certainty, or not, that it was one of the persons who was attacking the patrole who struck Grant? - A. I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

             at the time that Grant received the blow which brought him to the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. That blow was upon the shoulder? - A. Yes; he fell upon his back, and drew his knees up, and said, mercy, mercy, oh Lord, I am murdered! but, before he had well uttered the words, the prisoner, Patrick Holland, stooped, and made a blow at him over his legs or thighs, I am not certain which.</p>
               <p>Q. With what did he strike this blow at his legs? - A. It was with a cutlass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see at that time whether the blow took effect or not? - A. The man was lying upon his back, as I was endeavouring to defend the other Irishman off from him, it did strike him, and I had my cutlass in my hand, and cut him over the face, which he bears the mark of now; upon that, after I had struck the blow at Holland, Donohough came up, and pulled my hat over my face, and bound me down, and at that time my cutlass was wrenched out of my hand; I had two slight cuts in my face by a cutlass; I had several blows with sticks, till I was senseless for a short time, and when I recovered myself, I found all the Irishmen, who had been fighting against us, gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the deceased been removed before he recovered? - A. He was removed; there was not a man left in the place but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see Duncan Grant? - A. Not till I saw him in St. George's hospital, I think, the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. He died in the hospital, I believe, on the 22d of January? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. This was St. Stephen's day, you know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that is a day of merry-making among the lower class of Irish? - A. Yes, I believe among the lower class of people in all countries.</p>
               <p>Q. You called this a cock and hen club; most clubs have regular meetings; you do not know whether they had ever met before or not? - A. I did not understand that it was a regular club, it was a club where they paid sixpence a-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. I saw the money in the plate.</p>

               <p>Q. Then of course you never could have said, that you could not identify either of the persons? - A I never said any such thing that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively, that you never said you could not identify any of them? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before the Coroner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Amongst the persons you did apprehend, were there any that turned out to be deserters? - A. There were men that the captain claimed as deserters.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were there any persons taken in the tap-room by you? - A. There were several taken by the patrol.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not all the persons taken in the taproom, taken when you were up stairs? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if all those persons were taken away before the riot happened? - A. Those below were, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080023"/>Court. Q. At the time you were before the Coroner, you had not seen the man who you tell us cut the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But you always said, before you did see him, that you could identify him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. And you never said, before the Coroner, that you could not? - </p>
               <p>Court. He says this: before the Coroner, the deponent cannot take upon him to identify any of the persons who beat the deceased, or cut him with bludgeons and cutlasses, at that time; but that he could always know the person who cut him when he was down if he saw him again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Had you, at that time, seen any of the persons now accused? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Holland was not in custody at the time you were examined before the Coroner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Sullivan was? - A. Yes; I only spoke to Sullivan from belief.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, yourself, receive any injury upon this occasion? - A. I was the first that was knocked down in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person that knocked you down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the prisoners at the bar? - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time you came into the tap-room was there any person bound, or in custody? - A. There was only one man that remained in the house, he was in custody, and I stood by him, he and a woman were tied together with a handkerchief; when they found they were coming, the man made an attempt to unloose himself, I was paying attention to him when they rushed in; there came then two sticks over my head as fast as they could pelt, and in falling, the man that I stood by, knocked the staff out of my hand, and got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it after he got away that this accident happened to the deceased? - A. Yes, as I understood, for I was insensible; I never saw Grant at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, after they came in, they had nobody to liberate, for the man and woman had liberated themselves? - A. Yes, when I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man and woman been bound together up stairs, or below? - A. Up stairs; they had just come down.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the Bow-street officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when this mischief happened to Grant? - A. I was up stairs; I came down upon hearing the noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to point out any of the people who committed this injury? - A. Yes, Sullivan; the man in the blue coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to speak positively, or only as to belief? - A. Positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at the time that these people were attacking the officers? - A. When I came down stairs, there was Sullivan in the tap-room, I had known him before that; I heard a great noise of cutting, and sticks going backwards and forwards; I went to go into the passage, and, from some person on my left-hand, I received a blow with the point of a stick upon my collar-bone; I immediately afterwards received a shove, from some person behind me, across the tap-room against the table; I had my cutlass at the time in my hand; in that situation, I received a violent blow upon the left-side of my head, which cut me to the bone.</p>
               <p>Q. From a stick, or a sharp instrument? - A. From a stick, I believe; I was stunned, and my cutlass was then taken from me; after that I received two cuts with a sharp instrument on the top of my head, and two afterwards upon my shoulder to the bone pretty near.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you retain your senses, or lose them? - A. When my blood began to run pretty freely from me I began to recover, and I supported myself upon one hand; as soon as I was recovered, I saw Grant lying upon the floor, near the fender, or on the fender, I cannot tell which; he lifed up his hand, and said, Ravenhill, help me, I am murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. He was afterwards conveyed away to the hospital? - A. Yes; I was too much hurt to be able to assist him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you came down stairs, you saw Sullivan in the tap-room? - A. Yes; and two men standing behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. He was in custody, was not he? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been in custody? - A. Not that I knew of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room with Miller? - A. My situation was at the top of the stairs; Miller went in first.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the room, what did you see Miller do? - A. I was not in the room, my business was to keep the stairs clear.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At the time this riot commenced, how many were there in custody? - A. There were about eighteen sent away.</p>
               <p>Q. How many remained? - A. Only the women.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where were the women in custody? - A. In a little room, on the right-hand of the stairs, by themselves; they were there till the men were gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any other persons there that Sullivan spoke to? - A. I do not know that he directed his discourse to any body in particular; he said, what do you stand there for, and see people cut to pieces, or something similar to that; to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. When he went out, what became of Berry and Holland? - A. Berry, if any body was to say he went as far as the scene of action I would not believe them, for he returned directly; Holland followed Sullivan, I believe; I think he did, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. How long might he be gone? - A. I suppose, about a quarter of an hour; I did not know that it was him in the condition he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his face afterwards washed? - A. It appeared so, the blood was wiped off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then know the man? - A. It was Holland.</p>

               <p>Q. And that man was Holland? - A. It might be the same man that was bloody for any thing I know.</p>

            , and Herne, upon which they all retired from the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I humbly submit to your Lordship, that, taking for granted the evidence which is now given discloses the whole of this transaction, (reserving to my clients nevertheless all the benefit of further evidence to be adduced), the offence proved amounts to no more than manslaughter.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am not disposed to controvert the law, as it has been laid down by my learned Friend, Mr. Knowlys, in his opening, that where a constable is acting legally, under a legal warrant, he is so far protected by law, that the killing of him will be murder; but I submit to your Lordship, that this case is not the case stated by my learned Friend; for that the warrant, under which these officers acted, is not a legal warrant; and that the officers, who were executing that warrant, were not the persons who by law ought to have executed it.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the warrant is founded upon the 6th section of the 17th Geo. II. ch. 5. I will read the whole of that clause: "And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the Justices of the Peace for every county, riding, city, borough, town corporate, division, or liberty, or any two of them, shall, four times in the year at least, or oftener, if need be, meet in their respective divisions, and by their warrant command the constables or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080028"/>other peace officers of every hundred, parish, town, and hamlet in their several divisions, who shall be assisted with sufficient men of the same places, to make a general privy search in one night throughout their several respective limits, for the finding and apprehending of rougues and vagabonds." That, I believe, is the whole of the clause which applies to this warrant, but I will read to your Lordship the whole of the clause: "And every Justice of the Peace shall also, on receiving information that rogues and vagabonds are in any place within his jurisdiction, issue his warrant to the constable or other officer of such place to search for and apprehend such rogues and vagabonds; and such rogues and vagabonds as they shall find and apprehend upon such searches, they shall cause to be brought before the Justices." I say, my Lord, I believe it is the first part of this clause upon which the warrant is grounded, because this is a warrant for a"general privy search," which is authorized only by the first part of the clause: the last clause empowers a single Justice to issue his warrant for searching a particular place, upon a particular information received by him.</p>
               <p>I submit to your Lordship, that it ought to appear upon the face of the warrant that it is executed by two Magistrates at a meeting. It is not merely a ministerial, it is a judicial act: the Justices must "meet" in order to perform it. They are directed by the statute to meet"four times in the year at least, or oftener if need be." It is not pretended that this was one of the "four times;" it must be, therefore, one of the extraordinary occasions for which the statute has made provision; the law of the four times of the year, or upon one of the special occasions supposes the warrant to be the result of the deliberation of the Justices at a meeting; and I contend that it cannot be a legal warrant for this purpose, unless it does so purport to be executed by the Justices at a meeting.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am confirmed in this point by a precedent of some authority, in the 4th volume of Burn's Justice, folio 397, from which it appears that this has been considered to be the construction of the form required by the statute. The precedent given for a general privy search warrant is thus: -</p>
               <p>"Westmoreland -To the High Constable of Lonsdale Ward, within the said county. At a meeting of the Justices of our Lord the King, assigned to keep the peace within the said county, held at - for the division of Lonsdale Ward aforesaid, &amp;c. by us -, two of the said Justices assembled at the said meeting, being resident, living, and dwelling within the said division, we do hereby command you forthwith to issue your warrants to all the petty constables within the said ward for making a general privy search for rogues and vagabonds, according to the form herein indorsed." Then follows the form of the high constable's warrant.</p>

               <p>But I submit to your Lordship with confidence, that it plainly appears from the Act of Parliament alone, without the authority of Burn, that it must be at a meeting, for it is only at a meeting that the Justices have the power to do this act. This is a statute, conferring upon Justices extraordinary power, and prescribing to them, at the same time, the manner in which that power shall be exercised by them, and if they do not exercise that power in the manner prescribed to them, they transgress the law.</p>
               <p>My Lord, the next objection I have to make to the warrant is, not only that it does not appear upon the face of it to be executed at a meeting, but, it is proved by the evidence, that it was so executed, as to be no warrant at all for the purpose for which it is issued. It is proved, that when the name of Mr. Floud was subscribed, the warrant was a blank paper, a printed form, the blanks not being filled up; that after it had been subscribed by the name of Mr. Floud, it was filled up; that then Sir William Addington signed it, and he gave it to Miller, the person to whom it was directed. I venture to say, without fear of contradiction, that this statute never meant to authorize Magistrates so to act; when it requires Magistrates to do a certain act at a meeting, when the least number allowed for the doing of that act is two, it never meant to say, that one Magistrate might execute the warrant in blank, leaving it afterwards in the power of the second Magistrate to direct the blow wheresoever he pleased, to be executed by any persons whomsoever, whether they were legally authorized, or not legally authorized, to leave it in short to the discretion or indiscretion of one Magistrate to do any thing the most opposite to that which the Act of Parliament prescribed. Therefore, I submit to your Lordship, that instead of "a general privy search warrant," which it purports upon the face of it to be, it is no such thing; for a general privy search warrant must not only be executed by two Magistrates, but must be executed by two Magistrates together at a meeting. In the first place it is proved that it is not executed by two Magistrates together, for that Sir

             executed it alone; and in the next place it is proved, that in truth it was never executed by Mr. Floud at all; for the signature of a Magistrate to a blank paper never can be deemed to be an execution of a warrant -</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. I do not know whether I may not stop you here in some degree, because I put it to the Counsel for the prosecution, whether they found their prosecution upon the idea that this is but manslaughter, supposing the warrant to be bad; for I hold, that if the warrant was good, it never having been read below stairs, but being carried up stairs, it would not alter the offence; but what I shall state to the Jury is this, that whether the warrant is bad or good, does not signify a straw, for the warrant is functus officio; for these men come into the tap-room, and there they execute their malicious purpose, founded upon some malice preconceived by the conduct of the officers. I shall suppose the warrant as bad as you wish it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then, my Lord, I shall take it that the warrant is illegal, and therefore I shall further submit to your Lordship, (taking the facts to be true which have been spoken to by the witnesses), that this case comes within the scope of cases already determined, which make it manslaughter.</p>
               <p>My learned Friend, Mr. Knowlys, in his opening to the Jury, stated a case which he has attempted to substantiate by evidence, that the officers going to this house to execute a lawful warrant, did apprehend certain persons, supposed to be such persons as were described in the warrant; that some of those persons were taken away, that others were in custody, and were not taken away;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080029"/>that one man and a woman tied together were in the custody of the officers upon the staircase, and coming down the stairs for the purpose of being taken to the watch-house, at the time these persons came to the house; that a number of women were in custody up stairs, and that the prisoners, and others, came to the house for the purpose of rescuing those who were in the custody of the officers; and, for the purpose of so rescuing them, committed the assault. My learned Friends consumed a considerable portion of time in proving acts of violence on one of the prisoners, Brian, prior to the rushing of the persons into the tap-room, namely, attacking the officers in the street for the purpose of rescuing those persons who were being conveyed to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Therefore the case stated, and supposed to be proved by my learned Friends on the other tide, is not the case of a quarrel between the persons now charged with murder and the officers, upon any other ground than the execution of that warrant, and the taking persons into custody under that warrant; and the only motive which has been imputed to the prisoners at the bar, is, that they wished to assist their friends; and they are attempted to be connected thus: that one of them, Sullivan, was, in fact, liberated by an assault upon the officer who had him in custody, by a person charged to be connected with the prisoners now at the bar; that he, Sullivan, afterwards went to a neighbouring public-house, and called out other persons, which other persons are now charged with coming to the King's-arms for the purpose of rescuing the women, and the man, who were then in the custody of the officers, and some of whom were in the course of being conveyed to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>These being the facts of this case, and this the motive, which my learned Friends have spent so many hours to six upon the prisoners, and which facts and motives would, if the warrant were legal, and the warrant was good, would amount within persons executing it, the persons authorized by law to execute it, constitute that act of killing with malice prepence, which the law denominates murder; then, I submit to your Lordship, that, taking the warrant to be bad, and not to have been executed by persons having a right to execute it; because the persons having a right to execute it are the constables of the district, division, and so on, - when, in point of fact, it is not directed to the persons to whom it is necessary it should be directed, for it is directed to Mr. Wild, high constable, and to the several petty constables, of the county of Middlesex; whereas the statute requires the warrant to be directed to the constables, or other peace-officers, of every hundred, parish, town, or hamlet, who, it is true, may have assistants, but they must be "sufficient men of the same places." None of the persons who were sent to execute the warrant were the persons authorized by law to execute it. I submit, therefore. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. I have admitted that to you. Suppose the officers committed a trespass in executing the warrant, then you are to prove that these people had a right to kill them for it - that is your mode of arguing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I beg your Lordship's pardon, that is not my mode of arguing; and I own I did not expect, when the whole of my argument is built upon a confession that the prisoners are guilty to the extent of manslaughter, that I should be told I was proving, or attempting to prove, that they had a right to kill the officers, because the officer had committed a trespass.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. That is, that we have a right to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter on that account.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. That certainly is my argument; and I will endeavour to convince your Lordship, upon the authority of cases, that this crime is only the crime of manslaughter.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I will begin with the case of Hopkin Hugget, which is in Kelynge, folio 59."At a Goal Delivery of Newgate, in April, 1666, upon an indictment of murder, against Hopkin Hugget, a special verdict was found to this effect: we find that

            , whereof he instantly died." The question was submitted to the Judges, whether that this was murder or manslaughter. It was considered by all the Judges of England, who met at Serjeant's-inn. The Report says, "The Lord Chief Justice Bridgeman, Lord Chief Baron Hale, Brother Atkins, Brother Tyrell, Brother Turner, Brother Browne, Brother Archer, and Brother Rainsford, having had the notes of the special verdict three days before, delivered their opinion as then advised; but, they said, they would not be bound by it, that this was no murder, but only manslaughter." Lord Chief Justice Keylinge, and three others, held it to be murder. The eight Judges who decided this case, certainly qualified their decision at the time, by saying they would not be bound by it; but I do not find that they ever recanted that opinion, or that it was ever revoked, or even softened down. It has never been shaken by any subsequent determination; and I take the liberty of maintaining that it is law; "They said, that if a man be unduly arrested, or restrained of his liberty, by three men, although he be quiet himself, and do not endeavour any rescue, yet this is a provocation to all other men of England, not only his friends, but strangers also, for common humanity sake, as my Lord-Bridgeman said, to endeavour his rescue; and if, in such endeavour of rescue, they kill any one, this is not murder but only manslaughter."</p>
               <p>My Lord, I submit to your Lordship that this case,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080030"/>(supposing the result of the evidence to be what I have stated), is precisely within the principle of that case; because there, there was a person illegally arrested, for the liberation of whom, certain persons, who appear to have been strangers to him, interfered, and committed an assault upon the officers who had him in custody; and, in the course of that assault, they stabbed one of the officers, who instantly died in consequence of that stab. Here, for the purpose of rescuing persons, those who were illegally restrained of their liberty, persons interfered, and assaulted the officers who had the others in custody, and one of the officers died in consequence of the wounds he received.</p>
               <p>But, my Lord, there is another case in which this principle is recognized, and in which this law is applied to: a case, in my opinion, infinitely less favourable to the defendant, than the case of the defendants now before your Lordship. I speak of the case of the Queen and Tooley, 2d Lord Raymond, 1295."An indictment was found against the defendants for the murder of one Dent; and, upon not guilty pleaded, the Jury found a special verdict;" in which special verdict these facts were stated: "That by a statute made the 27th of Eliz. for the good government of Westminster, it is enacted, that for reformation of disorders in that city, the Dean, High Steward, or his deputy, or two capital Burgessss, may hear and punish incontinencies, according to the custom of London; that, by the custom of London, any constable of any ward, parish, or precinct, may execute his office throughout the whole City; that within the City, Borough, and Liberty of Westminster, it has been used, that every person duly appointed constable, of any parish within the Liberties of the Borough, and the Vill of Westminster, his office of constable, in and through the whole Borough of Westminster, and Liberties thereof, has executed, and used to execute. That, the 8th of March. 8th Ann, three commissioners duly appointed, by virtue of the Act for recruiting the army, for putting the Act in execution, by virtue of that Act, made their warrant, under their hands and seals, directed to the constables of the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster, within the City of Westminster, thereby commanding the constables to make search within the said City and Liberty, for persons within the description of that Act; which warrant, after that day, was delivered to the constables of the parish of St. Margaret, to be executed; that after that day,

               <p>Now I submit to your Lordship, that, in that case, where there had been no previous disturbance, where there was only one constable, and his deputy, assuming a power which turned out to be illegal, where the constable had apprehended a person, where he had lodged that person in safe custody, and where no reasonable harm could be expected to come to her, though the persons who assaulted the constable were strangers to her, yet, as the constable was acting illegally, it was decided by Lord Holt, and six other Judges, (five undoubtedly being diffentient), that it was not murder but manslaughter only, it does appear to me utterly impossible to distinguish the principle of that case from this; for -</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. You might as well state, at the same time, what Mr. Justice Foster says, "That case stands, as I conceive, on no better ground than the opinion of seven learned Judges against five."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Your Lordship could hardly suppose me guilty of such folly, as to attempt to conceal from your Lordship any thing contained in the book of Mr. Justice Foster, with the whole of which your Lordship must be so intimately acquainted. I certainly did intend to notice that observation, though not exactly at this moment, because I did not doubt it would be cited by my learned Friends on the other side; but as your Lordship has called my attention to it, I will do it now. No man does, or can entertain a higher respect for the name and character of Mr. Justice Foster than I do; but yet, I cannot bring myself to yield the authority of Lord Holt, and Lord Hale, even to Mr. Justice Foster.</p>
               <p>I was stating to your Lordship, that the principle of this case is not to be distinguished from that of the Queen and Tooley, Here is an illegal warrant, executed by persons who are not the persons authorized by law to execute such a warrant, even if it were legal; they had taken a number of people into custody; in their way to the watch-house with some of their prisoners, they say, they were assaulted by Brian. For what purpose? No purpose can be stated but that of rescue. Another of the prisoners at the bar, Sullivan, they say, was drinking at the public-house, they took him into custody, and were conveying him to the watch-house, when they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080031"/>assaulted, and he was rescued out of their hands; and then it is in evidence that he went to a public-house, and said. why do you suffer men to be cut to pieces thus; that he called two persons out, one of whom is now at the bar; that they followed him to the King's-arms public-house, and commenced a violent attack upon the officers, in the house; which officers were some up stairs guarding the prisoners there, some of them on the stairs, and one of them in the tap-room actually conducting two of their prisoners out, a man and a woman, who, by means of this attack, were actually rescued. This case comes, therefore, I contend, precisely within the principle of that case. Then, the question is, what authority that case is entitled to? Mr. Justice Foster, in discussing that case, and disputing its authority, does not touch very strongly upon the case of the King and Hugget, but he maintains, that the decision in the case of the King and Hugget, does not warrant the decision in the case of the Queen and Tooley; and, my Lord, undoubtedly the authority of Mr. Justice Foster is entitled to considerable weight; but, I shall submit to your Lordship, that both those cases are law, and it is not even the authority of -</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. I shall certainly consider it as my duty to hold these cases to be law. I shall not think myself at liberty even to speak flirtingly of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I was sure I should anticipate something of that kind from your Lordship, that where seven Judges have determined a point, even though five Judges dissent, that point, so determined, is the law of the land; and therefore, I trust, I need not argue any further that these cases are law. I humbly submit to your Lordship, that the principle upon which these two cases are determined, is the principle which must decide this case. The attack upon the officers can be referred to no other motive, connected as it is with an attempt to rescue and an actual rescue, than that of rescue. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. If you put that to me, I must submit it to the Jury. I shall state to the Jury the ground upon which those cases went; I shall state to them what I think of this case; and I shall put it to them, whether they think there are, in this case, the same ingredients that were in that case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Undoubtedly, my Lord; I do not mean to argue that the facts are exactly the same, but that they are so similar as to bring the cases within one principle. The facts of two cases may differ in many particulars, and yet the principle of both be the same.</p>
               <p>My Lord, There is a subsequent case, which I need hardly quote to your Lordship, a case in which there was the interference of a third person, for the rescue of another who was arrested; and, indeed, I have cited now; but cases of the interference of third persons, I have confined myself to such cases as appear to me to apply strictly to the present. I should have consumed much more of your Lordship's time, if I had gone into the cases of persons resisting arrests of themselves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. In the present instance, it does not appear that either of the prisoners at the bar were arrested.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Yes, my Lord, Sullivan was arrested.</p>
               <p>Mr Justice Grose. He had been arrested, but was at liberty at the time the riot commenced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. At the time of the last attack in the public-house, he was at liberty, and he is charged by the witnesses with being one of the assailants; but that was only a few minutes after he had been liberated from this illegal arrest, and his blood had not had time to cool, and, therefore, is intitled to the humane consideration of the law, which makes allowance for the passions and infirmities of human nature.</p>

            , who was a constable of the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields, to the house of one Ward, in Castle-street, in that parish, in whose house the prisoner cohabited with a man of the name of Farmello. That Prothero went to the house of Ward, accompanied by Barnet, for the purpose of apprehending Farmello, as an idle and disorderly person, under the stat. 19 Geo. II. chap. 10. That Prothero had a general search-warrant for that purpose." Then here is the case of an officer acting in his own district, and there is no objection to the warrant on the ground of irregularity of form stated."That upon Prothero's coming to the house of Ward, he, together with Barnet and others, went up stairs to the lodging-house of Farmello, in which Farmello and the prisoner cohabited at that time. That Prothero did not know Farmello. That Prothero knocked at the door, and demanded to be admitted; that a male voice called out from within, "who's there?" That Prothero answered,"it is me;" upon which a servant maid belonging to the house said, there was another door by which they might enter, the bolt of which was on the inside of a room not belonging to Farmello's lodging: that this door was unbolted, and opened by two men of the name of Ellis and Stephens. That Prothero and Barnet then entered Farmello's room. That Prothero said to Farmello, "you must come along with us." Farmello said,"for what?" That Barnet said, "come, come, you must go." That before Prothero could answer Farmello, the prisoner stepped past Prothero, and struck Barnet under the left arm with a knife she then had in her hand, saying, "by G-d, he shall not go." That the knife was left sticking in the side of Barnet, who turned round, saying he was a dead man. That Barnet died of that wound about four o'clock the next day. That Farmello was not an object of the said Act of Parliament. The question was, whether the offence amounted to murder or manslaughter. This case was argued in the Exchequer Chamber, on the 19th of April, 1780, by Mr. Howarth, for the Crown, and Mr. Erskine, for the prisoner, before ten of the Judges;" and the cases I have cited to your Lordship were, with others, cited and relied on. Mr. Leach says, in a note, "It is said that the Judges held it to be manslaughter only, but no opinion was ever publicly given." However. the prisoner, after laying eighteen months in jail, was discharged.</p>
               <p>If, therefore, I am not entitled to state this case as an explicit and unequivocal decision that the crime proved amounted to no more than manslaughter, I think I may state this, that if the Judges had been of opinion it was murder, she would not have been discharged. In that case the warrant was regular, and the person executing that warrant was the person who ought to have executed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080032"/>Mr. Justice Grose. No, the warrant was illegal. The book says, "If a woman, who, in a transport of passion, kills a peace officer, who is about to take the man she cohabits with to prison, under a warrant which turns out to be illegal," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The marginal note says, it was illegal; but I submit to your Lordship, that that marginal note is an incorrect conclusion from that part of the case, in which it is said, that Farmello, the person arrested, was not an object of the Act. There is nothing in the case which implies that the warrant was irregular, and therefore I humbly conceive I was correct in staring, that the warrant was regular.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. If he was not an object of the Act, the warrant was illegal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. With great deference to your Lordship, I submit that the regularity or legality of the warrant cannot be affected by Farmello not being an object of the Act, because this is not stated to be a warrant to apprehend Farmello, by name; it is stated to be "a general search-warrant." The officer erred in the execution of it, inasmuch as he attempted to apprehend a person who was not an object of the Act.</p>
               <p>In that case, I submit to your Lordship, the warrant was regular in form, and it was executed by the proper officer, the constable of the parish. In the case now before your Lordship, every thing is wrong; the warrant is irregular in form, it is void and illegal in substance, and it was executed by persons who ought not to have attempted to execute it, because the law has confined the execution to other persons. Upon the whole, therefore, I submit. that the offence proved by the evidence for the Crown, is no higher than manslaughter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I shall trouble your Lordship with a few observations on the same side with Mr. Gurney, and though the case has been ably and fully argued by him, and the hour of the day is far advanced, yet feeling an imperative duty to submit my humble opinion to the Court, I am perfectly satisfied the good old rule of justice will be attended to, "that the accused shall be fully heard before judgment shall pass upon them:" and that therefore your Lordship will favour me, their advocate, with that attentive and patient hearing, which, under the circumstances of this important case, I may require.</p>
               <p>Convinced of this fact, I shall take the liberty to contend with confidence, though with humility, that the offence which has been proved against the defendants, cannot by any possible construction, amount to murder, for the facts, as I understand them, are shortly these:"A warrant was issued by the Bow-street Magistrates, directing Miller. and other officers belonging to that office to make a privy search in the parish of St. Giles, and to apprehend all rogues, vagabonds, idle and disorderly persons, and particularly such as they should find in the house of one Flannery, a publican, in Maynard-street, in the said parish; and under this warrant, the officers force into the house of Flannery, without notice, and arrest a number of persons there assembled, amongst whom were some of the prisoners at the bar, but who, at the time they were apprehended, were not guilty of any act of riot or disorder: that in consequence an attempt to rescue ensues, and that, in the affray, the unfortunate deceased received the wounds whereof he died." -</p>
               <p>These are the facts, together with this important one, that the warrant under which they acted is admitted to be illegal and void.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. No such thing has been admitted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What I assert has been conceded by the Court; and there is not a school-boy, however ignorant, much less a man professing an acquaintance with the jurisprudence of his country, who can deny this fact,"that a warrant, (as that in question has been proved on the cross-examination to have been). signed in blank by one Magistrate, and, at a subsequent period, signed and filled up by another, when it should have been the joint act of both, signed by both together, at a meeting held for that purpose, is illegal and void to all intents and purposes; and was it necessary for me, on this occasion, after what has fallen from the Court, to argue the point, I could demonstrate, beyond a possibility of doubt, that the warrant was not only issued in a manner unprecedented and informal, but that it is illegal and void from the beginning to the end. However, since the point has been allowed by the express declaration of the Court, I will not waste time in pointing out its manifold iregularities; but, taking the warrant to have been illegal, I shall contend the arrest was unjustifiable, that it was a violation of the liberty of the subject, and that, by consequence; the homicide which followed, cannot be considered murder.</p>
               <p>That the arrest must be illegal, since the warrant was illegal, is manifest as the fun at noon day, for it is through the warrant only the officers derive their power. If, therefore, the warrant, which was the foundation, fails them, their proceedings must be without authority, and by consequence illegal. When I said they must derive their authority through the warrant, I only state what the statute has directed, 17 Geo. II. c. 5, for without warrant they have no power to make a privy search under the Act, and at common law they have no such authority at all; the only case in which they can arrest without warrant under this Act is, where they see an act of vagrancy committed in the public streets; in such case they may arrest without warrant, (for I will not blink the act), but in such case only; and they have no earthly authority to enter the house of any man for the purpose of a privy search, without a warrant regularly signed and issued by two Magistrates: and, miserable indeed would be the situation of the inhabitants of this land, if their houses, which our ancestors proudly called their castles, were liable to the incursions of every low and common officer, who might think sit to enter them at his own pleasure, without warrant, perhaps for oppressive purposes, though under the cloak of justice!</p>
               <p>I hope it will not be said, that by the common law peace officers, without warrant virtute officii to enter the house of any man for the purpose of arresting those whom they shall consider rogues and vagabonds, or idle and disorderly persons: if this is asserted, I shall expect to have it proved, for mere assertion without proof cannot operate with me against that which is the result of serious and attentive enquiry; for I submit, that at common law peace officers have no authority to arrest virtute officii, and without warrant from a Justice, but where they see an offence committed immediately in their presence; as for instance, where they see a riot going on, they may arrest the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080033"/>parties; but, if the riot is over, they cannot arrest those concerned without a warrant from a Magistrate, much less can they enter into another man's house, as they have done on the occasion under consideration, and deprive men of their liberty, to whom not even the smallest irregularity is imputable. Hence, therefore, I submit, that as at common law they had no authority for what they did, and since, by the statute they had none, their authority under that, viz. the warrant failing, I shall be glad to learn from what source they can derive a power which neither emanates from the common law, nor flows through the medium of the statute? To me it is manifest they had none, that they acted without authority illegally and unjustly, that consequently they are trespassers, and must submit to that which resulted from their own misconduct; for surely it cannot be denied, that when officers are trespassers, by arresting men on whom they should not have laid their hands, and in an attempt to rescue those, whom they have illegally restrained, one of the officers, who are the wrong doers, is killed, the homicide, in such case, cannot be more than manslaughter: for this is a principle so fully established, that I should have thought it would not be disputed; however, to put a case, suppose a riot has been committed in the street, and, after it is over, a constable, endeavouring to arrest the rioters, not having a warrant from a Justice, is killed, would such homicide, in point of law be considered murder? Certainly it would not, because the officer had no right to arrest virtute officii without warrant, after the riot had ceased. To prove that I am not arguing hypothetically, I will mention a case in which this very point has been held; it was that of

            , (tried in this place in the year 1789, before Mr. Justice Gould, present, Mr. Justice Wilson and your Lordship). He was indicted for the murder of one Wilkinson, who was an officer, sent to take Power into custody for riotous behaviour: when, as it appeared in evidence, that the riot was over when he endeavoured to arrest Power, the Court held that he was proceeding illegally, and that where a person does an act that causes the death of him who illegally restrains his liberty, the offence certainly cannot be more than manslaughter. Then taking this case for law, of which there can be no question, I will ask, is it not authority by which the present should in some measure be governed; for in the case now before the Court, the officers were trespassers, they acted without authority, and, under the pretence of seizing idle and disorderly persons, they arrest men whom they are forced to admit were sober, quiet, and orderly, for thus they speak of the landlord of the house, Flannery, thus of Sullivan, one of the prisoners, whom, notwithstanding, they had the andacity to handcuff, and drag, like felons, into the public street: then were not these officers the worst of trespassers? Did not they violate the sacred liberty of the subject? And doth not this case, therefore, come within the rule laid down in that I have just mentioned? Shall not the same principle govern this, that governed the cases of

            , and the Queen v. Tooley, mentioned by Mr. Gurney? By-the-by, there is an observation made by Lord Chief Justice Holt, in delivering the opinion of the Judges on the last of those cases, which I will take the liberty to repeat, as it is in itself coming from so great authority, abundantly sufficient to establish all I have been contending for to-day. He says, "the prisoners had sufficient provocation; for if one be imprisoned on unlawful authority, it is a sufficient provocation to all people, out of compassion, much more where it is done under the colour of justice, and where the liberty of the subject is invaded, it is a provocation to all the people of England; for the people should be concerned for Magna Charta and the law; but he who imprisons another against law, is an offender against Magna Charta." And he expressly says, in another part of the argument, "a constable cannot arrest but when he seen an actual breach of the peace; and if the affray be over, he cannot arrest without a warrant." On these words, which are not only the language of this great Judge, but which are to be found in all our books, I might pin my faith, and ask, are they not decisive on the present occasion, when the officers are to be considered as acting without warrant? Therefore, without authority; and consequently improperly restraining the liberty of those they apprehended; may, doth it not follow, a fortiori, in this case, that the homicide cannot be murder, when it is recollected that, in the Queen v. Tooley, the officer was killed in a second attack that was made upon him half an hour after the first, when the human passion might have subsided; whereas, in the case before the Court, there was no interval, the attack was momentary, and the accident just as sudden.</p>

            , Knight, when he never was knighted, but a Baronet, it was held an ill warrant; and that, therefore, killing the officer who executed it, was not murder. So I submit, in the case before the Court, the arrest by the officers was illegal, they restrained the liberty of their fellow subjects without authority, and, therefore, the homicide which followed cannot be murder.</p>
               <p>These cases which have been mentioned, appear, in my humble judgment, decisive in favour of all the prisoners; for from them it is manifest, that the offence, as it applies in general, cannot be more than manslaughter; for in each of the cases as reported, the homicide was by third persons, who were, notwithstanding, so far protected by the law, as to be held free from the crime of murder; how much more favourable does the case of the prisoner, Sullivan, appear, who was one of those illegally arrested; in favour of him the books are full of authorities; and, I submit, that as to him, the homicide is no more than se defendendo; and that this is the law as determined in modern as well as ancient times. There is a case, mentioned by Lord Coke, 4 Inst. 333. in which it has been held, that when a man is illegally arrested, and kills the assailant, his offence cannot be more than homicide, se defendendo; and, I believe, it has never yet been over-ruled; this was the case of Simpson, which <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080034"/>happened when the Court of High Commission was in existence, whose odious authority must be known to every man; from this Court a warrant had been issued to arrest one Simpson, for adultery; and it was directed to

            , an officer, who arrested Simpson, and was killed by him; and the question was, whether under this warrant Butler had a right to arrest Simpson, for if he had, it was murder; but if not, only a small offence, se defendendo; and after conference, and long consideration, the Judges resolved, that the High Commissioners had no authority to issue a warrant to arrest in that case, but should have proceeded by way of citation; and that therefore the arrest being illegal, the killing was not murder: then let me ask, can I have a greater authority than my Lord Coke, the very oracle of the law? And after this determination, can the case of Sullivan be considered more than se defendendo? I am sure it cannot, unless the established law is overturned; and I am equally sure your Lordship will not introduce a change, or alter the law as it has been held, not only by Lord Chief Justice Holt, but at the time the Institute was written.</p>
               <p>These observations I felt it my duty to submit, and shall add but one or two more, applying them to the misconduct of the officers: Mr. Justice Foster has stated, in his book on the Crown Law, p. 319, that "when officers misbehave, even in the execution of legal process, they forfeit that protection the law would otherwise afford them;" then, even on this point, had I no other, I might safely put the issue, for the conduct of the officers has been, as proved by themselves, most grossly improper; for they not only refused to show their warrant, on entering the house, as they were bound to have done, but they seized, arrested, and handcuffed men, as rogues and vagrants, not one of whom was of such descript on. When I assert this, I am authorized to do so, for the fact has not been proved against me; therefore the maxim will apply." at non existentibus, et non apparentibus eadem est ratio." But I am not driven to this necessity; for it is clear, from the evidence, that there was not in the house a single person who could be deemed a rogue and vagrant, or idle and disorderly, within the meaning of the statute; for the statute has clearly described all such as shall be so considered, and not left it to the power of construction; and the terms, as used in the Act, are widely different in their meaning from that which in common parlance we apply to them; for instance, he might, in common speech, be called idle who loiters in a public-house, but he would not be within the scope, or meaning of the statute; again, we call him idle who is less attentive to industry than he should be; and I would call the learned Gentleman who conducts this prosecution disorderly, if he were to interrupt me whilst addressing the Court; yet it would be absurd to say he was disorderly within the meaning of the Act of Parliament; then let me ask, who was there disorderly in the house of Flannery, the publican? Was the landlord disorderly when he was wantonly assaulted by the officers, and that in his own parlour? Was the prisoner, Sullivan, disorderly, who was sitting peaceably in the tap-room? Certainly not; nor was there an appearance of disorder until the officers had created it, by illegally arresting and handcuffing men, who were peaceable and orderly, under the unjustifiable pretence that they were rogues and vagabonds; here, therefore, I say, the officers were trespassers in having so misbehaved; first neglecting to shew their warrant, and, secondly, in restraining the liberty of men who, even had the warrant been a legal one, were not by any means within the meaning of the law. And from this I may conclude, in the words of Mr. Foster, that the officers, by their own misconduct, have forfeited the special protection of the law.</p>
               <p>With these observations I shall conclude, submitting, as I have contended, that as to Sullivan, his offence cannot be more than se defendendo; and that of the other prisoners, manslaughter only; first, because the officers, even supposing they had a legal warrant, refused to shew it, grossly misbehaved, and arrested men who were not objects of the Act of Parliament; and, secondly, I rely on this, not only that the warrant was illegal and void, and therefore the officers trespassers, but also that the assray was sudden and momentary; that no time intervened for the human passion to have subsisted, and that, by consequence, the homicide cannot be murder.</p>

            , of Arundel-street, you have no right to take me, I am not the man. Upon that principle it was that that case was decided; it is a case as precisely different from this as can be.</p>
               <p>The next case that is mentioned, is the case in the 4th institute; and to be sure, if that case can be thought to bear upon this, it must be most strange indeed. - Here is a man comes to apprehend a person upon a warrant for an offence, which he himself must know was no temporal offence, and gave him no authority to take him; for the crime of adultery is not a crime punishable by imprisonment, and therefore he comes there perfectly without authority, and the consequence was it was held not to be murder.</p>
               <p>There was a case cited, by Mr. Gurney, from Lord Hale, and there a bailiff has no power to grant writs, undoubtedly; if the Sheriff's bailiff comes to execute a warrant, which is interlined after it is sealed, he has no right to act upon it against any person whatever, in any degree whatever, and therefore he is, in that case, acting without authority, and he must take the consequence, it certainly would not be murder if he died under the execution of that wrongful process.</p>
               <p>Then, my Lord, there are two other cases which are supposed to apply - but when I am arguing in this way,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080035"/>and it is supposed that the legality of the warrant is given up, I am ready to argue, whenever it may be necessary, that it is legal; but in the present stage of the argument, putting the warrant entirely out of the question, I say that those two cases do not apply; and I will tell your Lordship why I conceived they do not apply: My Lord, with respect to Hugget's case, that to be sure is as widely different from this as one Pole can be from the other - what is that case? Some persons lay hold of a man, and it is expressly stated that it was done "without warrant, for ought appears to us," they "impressed a man who is not yet known, to serve in his Majesty's service in the wars against the Dutch nation." My Lord, let us see what a serious case that is: some men come and lay hold of another to carry him out of the realm, to kidnap him: - My Lord, surely that is a case in which it might be expected that the passions of men might be roused, they were not going to carry him to a place where he might be amenable to the laws of his country, but to send him abroad; that case might be very properly ruled to be manslaughter; indeed, I have no right to consider it as properly ruled, for the Judges did in that instance, saying, they would not hold it as a precedent; they did it with the greatest reluctance, and said, they would not be bound by it; they looked upon it as a case just upon the verge of the one crime or the other, and that they would never rule in favour of any person, under any circumstances before them, unless these circumstances tally in every iota with the circumstances of that very individual case which stands so determined.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Is it supposed, or pretended, or can any man living suppose that this man, who was going to be carried out of the kingdom, is to be compared with the present case, where they were going to be put into a course of legal enquiry? - Therefore that case does not apply to this in the least.</p>
               <p>With respect to the case in 2d Lord Raymond, it is as wide from this as a case can be. The facts stated are, that he was a constable, that he was walking about and he seized this woman, whom he laid hold of, she was committing no act of disorder; though she had formerly committed disorderly acts, she was at that time an unoffending person, and therefore that case does not apply.</p>
               <p>Then, my Lord, with respect to that part of the evidence which these gentlemen have quoted, it makes a strong case of malice against Sullivan indeed, and against those who were with him: it is expressly proved, that Sullivan submitted to that apprehension without any sign whatever of resentment; he was perfectly calm and collected, and said, he would go with them and would make no objection to the arrest: afterwards he is let go, and let us see what he does when he is let go; he comes to the public-house with a most evident falsehood, a falsehood calculated for what? Calculated to rouse the resentment of every person there. He says, "why do you suffer men to be murdered thus?" Upon which the other persons accompany him, and they proceed to commit this shocking barbarity upon the officers, of whom Sullivan had never made any complaint. My Lord, I would put that as strong and cogent evidence indeed, that the intent to rescue was not the intent of his mind, but mixed with another intent, which the law will never countenance, an intent to revenge upon these people for an arrest which he never suspected to be illegal, because he never made an objection to it. Is it not proved, that at the time this man went into that public-house, all was quiet and all peaceable? Is it then true, or could it be true, that these officers (whose conduct was unknown to the men to whom he addressed himself, in order to rouse them to resentment), were murdering people? That is a falsehood issuing out of his mouth, upon which all the after barbarity was founded. I say, therefore, that this is strong evidence of malice against the officers, and therefore that will go to implicate him, if the facts are believed by the Jury, of which they of course will judge. But, my Lord, is it to be said, that this was without colour of authority. I did not give up this point: but I submit to your Lordship, that these officers themselves, even without a warrant, were justified in laying hold of people in an act of disorder. It has been said, that they had no right to enter into this house. My Lord, it was a public-house, in which there must be a recognizance entered into to keep good order; a house into which police officers and constables are bound to go and see that they do keep order: they found an unlawful assembly in that house - a club, consisting of a mixture of men and women, with dancing and music, and that sort of disorder, a meeting that never could have been licensed upon an application; that never could, in the fair exercise of the discretion of a Magistrate, have obtained a licence. They found there likewise persons, who were idle and disorderly persons, whom they had a right to take; for I take it that any constable, and there were two constables here acting with these people, that any constable has a right to take persons acting disorderly, and there were persons who did afterwards turn out to be men of that description; for it is in evidence, that two of them were deserters; and therefore I contend, that, without any warrant, the custody of some of these people was lawful; and, if the custody of any was lawful, these officers had a legal right to take them, and were then in the exercise of a legal authority. At the time they were conveying away, all the persons, except Sullivan, were perfectly ignorant of what was passing; Sullivan knew that they submitted to it, and made no objection whatever. If, therefore, we are to have reformers and speculators upon the law, who, when they see a constable, shall take upon them to decide whether the warrant is a lawful one or not, I hope the parties who do so speculate, will suffer the consequences of taking the law into their own hands. I am extremely sorry to have troubled your Lordship at this late hour of the day, and I will not add another observation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. My Lord, I shall certainly abstain from arguing the legality of this warrant, although my learned Friend, Mr. Knowlys, has professed himself perfectly ready to meet me, whenever it may be necessary. I shall only say, I am perfectly ready to meet him. But I take it that your Lordship has said, the warrant is illegal, and therefore the question will be, whether this case does or does not come within the principle of the cases that I have cited. My Friend has endeavoured to distinguish this case from them; but I submit that he has distinguished them only in trifling circumstances, and that he cannot distinguish them in principle.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080036"/>My learned Friend says, Hugget's case differs from this, because there the parties intended to take the person they arrested out of the kingdom, and therefore Hugget and the others were entitled to decide upon it at once, and prevent an unlawful imprisonment and transportation from the realm of the person arrested; but the principle is the same; a man has a right to protect his own liberty from unlawful restraint; he is entitled to the assistance of other persons, even of strangers, to protect and rescue him; and if, in the scuffle that ensues, the man, imposing that unlawful restraint, is killed, the law gives such allowance to those persons as to the persons so rescuing, the law considers that homicide as manslaughter, and not murder.</p>
               <p>My Lord, in Tooley's case, the facts are infinitely short of the facts in this case. My learned Friend, Mr. Knowlys, says, here was no violence, no disorder, till the prisoners at the bar interfered; so there was no violence, no disorder, till those persons interfered, who were strangers to the woman, and who did not commence the attack till the woman was actually in the round-house. Now let us compare the facts of that case with the facts of this. The house is beset by these officers, under court of a warrant, now proved to be illegal; some of them go in, and others keep the door; every person in the house is taken into custody; those of them who were in the lower part were actually carried off towards the watch-house; one of them is rescued; he goes to a public-house; and says to some people there, why do you suffer people thus to be cut to pieces? and collects some assistants there. Another of the prisoners attacks some of the patrol, to rescue the persons out of their custody; first one stick is taken from him, and then another, and he continues in acts of aggression almost uninterruptedly from the beginning to the end. Other persons are taken into custody up stairs, some of them are conveyed away, and others are kept in custody there. My learned Friend supposes, for the purpose of this argument, that the officers had discharged the whole of their duty, or what they imagined to be their duty. Certainly not, because if they had, they would have left the house; certainly not, because some of them were conducting a man and a woman out of the house; certainly not, because some of them were keeping guard upon the rest of the women who were up stairs, till the other officers, whom they had sent to the watch-house, should return. Then this comes exactly within the decision in Tooley's case and in Hugget's case; the liberty of the people in the house was unlawfully restrained by these officers, and these persons came and assaulted the officers for the purpose of rescuing those people.</p>
               <p>But, my learned Friend states, that the officers had a right to arrest the people who were at the public-house, even without a warrant. I was a little surprized that my learned Friend should state such a position, that, without any warrant, they, not one of them being constables, of the parish of St. Giles, had a right to arrest these poor people, because they were amusing themselves with dancing. I take it that they were acting wrongfully, under colour of authority, and therefore the law does not give them that protection which it does when they act legally. But what will my Friend say to their arrest of the persons in the tap-room, of whom Sullivan was one, who were drinking their beer quietly and peaceably, and to not one of whom can any disorder be imputed, till these fifty-eight officers, armed with cutlasses, rushed into the house; themselves the authors of all the disorder that followed their illegal conduct, the primary cause of all the mischief that ensued.</p>
               <p>My Learned Friend asks, are we to have reformers and speculators upon the law? Are persons to speculate upon the legality or illegality of warrants? I will not answer my learned Friend in my own language, I will answer him in the language of the Judges of England, in the case of Hugget: "If a man be unduly arrested or restrained of his liberty, by three men, although he be quiet himself, and do not endeavour any rescue, yet this is a provocation to all other men of England, not only his friends, but strangers also, for common humanity sake, to endeavour his rescue; and, if in such endeavour of rescue, they kill any one, this is no murder, but only manslaughter." In that case, the persons produced a paper as a warrant; Hugget and the others speculated upon its being no warrant; and the Judges, because they speculated rightly, reduced the offence to manslaughter. Here the prisoners might speculate upon that warrant, which turns out to be illegal; they were acting for the rescue of those persons who were illegally restrained of their liberty; and, therefore, I trust your Lordship will coincide with those great and venerable judges, in reducing the offence to manslaughter. This cannot be imagined to be a case of antecedent malice between the parties, for it does not appear they had ever seen each other before the arrest of the persons in this house, some of whom were conveyed, and others conveying to prison, was the only ground of dissention between them: that unlawful arrest provoked the prisoners to that violent attempt to rescue, in consequence of which the homicide took place.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am sure neither your Lordship, or any one who hears me will suppose that I am justifying the conduct of the prisoners: I am not maintaining that it is commendable for persons to take by violence what is called the law into their own hands; I shall not be supposed to be vindicating their conduct, but I am standing here as an English lawyer, bound to do my duty to my clients: that duty I hope I have now discharged; and I trust, that upon the authority of these cases, your Lordship will be of opinion, that such of the prisoners as are implicated in this transaction are not guilty of the crime with which they stand charged by this indictment, but of the crime of manslaughter only.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Some observations have been made by the learned Gentleman of so strange a nature, that I think they certainly require an answer. The learned Gentleman began by mentioning the case of Sir Harry Ferrers; he says, it arose on a warrant which stiled him Knight, when it caught to have stiled him Baronet, and that therefore they had no right to take up the person whom they did take up. Now that is exactly what I contend for, and so that case approximates to this; for I say that the officers had no right to take Sullivan while he was demeaning himself peaceably and quietly, nor any of those whom they arrested, for there was not one of them an offender against the statute.</p>
               <p>Again, as to the other cases, he has argued in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080037"/>favour, and drawn the chain tighter, if possible, against himself. He says, the persons taken into custody made no resistance; they were taken, and they submitted as they ought to have submitted. So I might say in the case of Hugget; he had submitted, but said, that did not justify the officers, they were still trespassers: the restraint of liberty was improper and illegal, and therefore it was held to be manslaughter only. The same observation applies in the case of the Queen and Tooley; the woman was in custody at the very time, at a distance from the place where the assault was committed, and the prisoners first drew their swords, and attacked the officer, and the heat of passion had abundant time to subside, but what did they do? They made a second attack upon the officers, and drew their swords again; but here the attack is all sudden, no interval, no time for the passion of the human mind to subside, and therefore it is as strong a case in favour of the accused as it can be.</p>
               <p>There is only one observation more. My learned Friend has said, that they had a right, without a warrant, to go into this house: I was surprized to see any lawyer stand up here, and lay down such a position; and he says, it was a public house; admitting that, if it was not a public-house, they would have no right to enter it; that is the sort of argument that he is driven to: but had they a right to enter it as trespassers? Had they a right to take away that man, who was sitting quietly, drinking his pint of beer? Had they a right to take away those persons who were up stairs, where no rogues or va gabonds were assembled? Let me suppose a case, that a number of high and noble persons were to assemble, an a number of officers should come, because they heard a fiddle where they were met, would it be contended they had a right to enter that house, and apprehend them? Certainly not: Then where is the difference? Does the law make any between the rich and poor, the noble and the labourer, the peer and the peasant? Forbid it, justice! the law of England has forbid it! and, I trust in God, it ever will!</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. In this case I have no difficulty at all, because I agree with all the cases that have been cited, and all the learned authorities that have been cited, but those cases only go to prove that if a man, in endeavouring to rescue another who is unlawfully, or whom he supposes is unlawfully arrested, does that in consequence of which death ensues, there, under the circumstances, it may be manslaughter and not murder. I agree to that law; but I shall state to the Jury, when the case comes for me to state it to them, that allowing all that is said by the Counsel to be true respecting those cases, they are to judge whether or not, at the time this unfortunate man was killed, there was not a total end of that illegal imprisonment; and the question for them to determine will be, whether what happened did not happen from a precedent resolution to commit murder upon these officers, because they had done what they had done, that I shall leave to the Jury, and therefore you will go on with your case.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am the landlord of the King's-arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Miller, and the other officers, coming to your house on the 26th of December? - A. I do very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they come? - A. Some minutes past eight; I was in the parlour with two men in company, the parlour door was open; I can see from the parlour door into the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the two men with you? - A. One was Mr. Harris, in undertaker, and the other was Quin, a market man; the officers all rushed in, in a hurry, with their swords over their heads (in this manner); they rushed in at the parlour door; I said, what do you want, gentlemen; one of them said, there is the landlord, handcuff him; I said, what is the matter, I have done nothing amiss; I said, I will go with you without being handcuffed; they would not have me go without being handcuffed; I was very unwilling to be handcuffed, and we had a tussel about it; they handcuffed me, knocked me down, and cut my head with a staff, and my hand with a sword; they threw me back upon a chair, pulled the chair from under me, and put their feet upon my breast; I struggled and got up; then they had the door locked up, and I could neither get out nor no one come in; my wife was there, and they took hold of her, and pulled her by the hair, and tore her cap and handkerchief off; then one of the officers came up; my wife said, you know my husband, do not ill use him, that was to Mr. Jacob, the officer; Jacob advised me to be handcuffed, and go quietly with them; I asked them why they handcuffed me, and they would never let me know the reason.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they show you any warrant? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask them for a warrant? - A. I never asked about a warrant, I knew nothing about the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they handcuff any other persons who were with you? - A. Not in the same room, but they took Harris and the other; I did not see them handcuffed; they took them to one watch-house, and me to another.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any disturbance in your house till the officers came there? - A. They were as quiet as company could be in a house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him that night? - A. I saw him standing with his back to the fire in the tap-room.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was there any row in the street when they took you? - A. I suppose not, because I was inside then; upon my oath there was not a row in the house till I got out of it; and when I got outside the door, I said, let us go this way, and take care of ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not say, that if you had known, there should not one of them come away alive? - A. Not at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. And you heard a row near the door? - A. Yes, on the right hand side, and I advised them to turn to the left, and so they did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many doors off might that be? - A. As nigh as I can imagine, it might be six or seven doors off; it was a very dark night, I could hardly see four yards before me; there were only three lamps in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is the street? - A. I suppose four times as long as this Court.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. Did you say any thing about music being in the house? - A. There was some music.</p>
               <p>Q. What music? - A. A fidler.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a carpenter and undertaker, in business for myself, I keep a house in Swallow-street: On the 26th of December, I was drinking a glass of rum and water, in the parlour, at Mr. Flannery's.</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner did the officers come into the house? - A. I had been there about ten minutes, and the officers came in, I heard a great noise like the rustling of so many horses; after that, several men came into the room, six or seven, to the best of my knowledge, they had got cutlasses in their hands; they then laid hold of the landlord of the house, and he asked what it was for; he said he would go quietly with them, not to use him ill; they said, come, come, that will not do, and endeavoured to handcuff him; they had a long tussel, and after that, they got him down upon the floor, he got up again; he asked them repeatedly again, what it was for, and said he would go with them, he had done nothing amiss; they then had another struggle, and after that they handcuffed him, and got him down a second time; and after he was handcuffed they opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When they got him down, was any thing done to him? - A. To the best of my knowledge, two of them learned upon his stomach with their knees.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know who the men were? - A. I did not, they were two of the patrol.</p>


               <p>Q. Was Flannery at all hurt? - A. He was, with a staff, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he hurt any where else? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any weapons at all? - A. No; they had cutlasses; they then handcuffed me; there was another person that they handcuffed with me, and then they took us out of the house together; I repeatedly asked what it was for, and could not get any intelligence; they took us to Covent-garden watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you doing any thing more than drinking a glass of rum and water quietly? - A. Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it began the disturbance and riot? - A. The officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Would there have been any disturbance if they had not come? - A. None in the world; I did not know there had been any body else in the taproom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You did not know there were any persons up stairs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did not hear them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been thirty or forty persons in the room you must have heard them? - A. I did not hear them at all; I had not been in the house ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard the fiddle playing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any dancing? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you hear any noise over your head arise from dancing? - A. None in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only disturbance was the officers coming in, and the resistance of the landlord by a struggling with them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you heard nobody come down stairs from the club-room at all into the parlour where you were? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever been in that house before? - A. Once.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of this Cock and Hen club kept at that house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did the landlord resist for any other reason than because they would not tell him what they wanted him for? - A. Nothing else.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080040"/>The prisoner, Sullivan, called eight, Brian three, and Holland six witnesses, who gave them an excellent character for peaceable and quiet behaviour.</p>
               <p>Summing up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. Gentlemen of the Jury. This indictment charges the prisoners at the bar with the most serious and heavy offence, of which, during your attendance here, you have had occasion to enquire; indeed, it is the most beinous offence that can exist in society: that of one man committing murder upon another.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, at the outset of this business, there were ten persons who were accused of this crime, but the candour of the Counsel for the prosecution have eased you and me of some trouble, because, they have fairly acknowledged, that the evidence is hardly so strong against six out of the ten as to induce them to expect you to convict; for, undoubtedly, nothing but proof, amounting to clear conviction, in the minds of a Jury, ought to convict any man of a crime, more especially so heinous and important a crime as that of murder.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, I will state to you, in a very few words, what I take the law to be upon this subject; and I will then state to you what the question for your peculiar attention is; I will then read to you the evidence, and in going through that evidence, I will make, as I go on, such remarks, upon what the different witnesses may say that at all comes home to the point in question, as seems to me material, or that will at all direct your verdict. Gentlemen, the crime of murder is the killing a man of malice aforethought, as it is said; and, Gentlemen, wherever one man is proved to have killed another, the law presumes malice; and it is then incumbent upon that man, against whom the killing is proved, to shew, by evidence, that it does not amount to the serious crime of murder, but that it is either manslaughter, or self defence, or something or other which may fairly justify the person who committed the act, in doing what he did.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, In the present case, much has been said to you, and cases have been cited to you, (all of which I have no sort of objection to your recollecting, as far as you can) to induce you to suppose that the law of those cases is applicable to this case, that these prisoners are not guilty, upon the ground, that they interfered only for the purpose of rescuing some people who were illegally taken up. Now, Gentlemen, upon that subject, I will not enquire whether this warrant was perfectly legal or not; perhaps there might, in strictness, be some objections to the warrant, but still, if a man is taken up by an illegal warrant, and the person who takes him up, after the business is over, goes about his business, and there is an end of it, why no other man has a right to suppose he is to go and kill the person who has executed the warrant, and, therefore, the question in this case is not the question that was made in some of the cases you have heard; for in those cases, the persons were endeavouring to rescue others illegally taken up, and in the course of that rescue it happened that somebody or other was killed; the Jury, upon that occasion, said, or the Court said, that that was not that sort of killing called murder, but that it was manslaughter; now I take the present question to be of another sort, and if it is not of that sort I tell you, you should acquit the prisoners, which is this: I take the question to be, whether that which has been done, supposing it to be done by the prisoners, has not been done in prosecution of a premeditated design in the prisoners, or some of them, to weak their vengeance upon the constables, and, in so doing, this murder was committed. You will therefore consider, whether the killing of this man, which I tell you is murder, till the contrary is proved, has not happened from a premeditated design in the prisoners to wreak their vengeance upon the constables, and desiring so to wreak their vengeance upon the constables, this accident has happened; for after this business was over, that is, after these people were taken into custody, these persons being in the house, and there being no person to rescue, they violently, and with cutlasses, did that from which death ensues, why, to be fare, there is no pretence to say that that was for the purpose of rescue; but it was for the purpose of wreaking their vengeance upon them for something they did not like. I wish you, therefore, to attend to this: whether they did it for the purpose of rescuing; if you think so, you will tell me so, or say they are only guilty of manslaughter; but if they did it not for the purpose of rescuing, but from some premeditated malice, entertained by them against the person of the deceased as one of the officers, then, to be sure, the case differs from all those circumstances you have have had read to you, and it is in point of law murder; and therefore I wish to put the question to you, whether you think the prisoners have done it in consequence of premeditated malice, for the purpose of wreaking their vengeance upon them, for having done that which was not perfectly agreeable to them. Now, I will read to you the evidence, which is pretty long, in the best manner I am able.</p>
               <p>(Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence for the prosecution).</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This is the evidence on the part of the prosecution; and now, Gentlemen, in order to induce you to believe, either that this evidence is not true, or that the officers were the only persons to blame, and that this sort of accusation against the prisoners at the bar is not at all founded, they call two witnesses, or three, whose evidence I will read to you; (reads it). Gentlemen, this is the evidence on the part of the prisoners; to contradict the fact, or to make such impressions on your minds as it ought to make, to induce you to believe, that in reality what has been deposed on the part of the prosecution is not true; the other evidence that has been brought, has been to the character of the witnesses, and I will read you that: (reads it).</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, this is the evidence to character; and all I shall say upon the subject of character is this: if, upon considering the circumstances of the case, you are doubtful whether the prisoners are guilty, take what has been said of their characters into your consideration, and if you think it sit to weigh in favour of innocence, let it have its weight; at the same time, it is my duty to make one observation: that it is extraordinary that all these prisoners should have had the character of being sober, honest, and quiet, quiet in particular, when they are found, on the 26th of December, at night, collected together in the form of a club, forty or fifty of them, a Cock and Hen club, with dancing, and singing, and fiddling, and doing what you have heard done; at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080041"/>same time, as far as character can go, let it weigh with you; why then the question is, whether the accident that has happened to the unfortunate deceased was not in consequence of something done in prosecution of a premeditated plan, for the purpose of wreaking vengeance upon the constables, and not for the purpose of rescuing any one.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you find, with respect to Brian, no less than six witnesses who speak to him, and you find their evidence introduces him, first in the street with a stick, committing violence before the disturbance took place in the tap-room; next you find him in the tap-room; and then you find him in the same street after the disturbance took place. Gentlemen, you recollect the whole of his conduct, I will not repeat it to you, but you will judge from his conduct, and from the conduct of the rest, whether the whole of this scene did not proceed from premeditated malice against the officers, who were doing their duty in executing, as far as they could, this warrant, legal or illegal, for I put it so to you; and you will recollect, it appears, by the majority of the witnesses, that at the time that these men, I mean the persons who are at the bar, and the other persons, went into the tap-room, there was no pretence to say, when the mischief happened to the deceased, there was a creature they could liberate, the persons were all gone; and if the purpose of liberating any body had been their purpose, we should have heard who they had liberated; but if it was their purpose to liberate, what occasion had one or two persons to give the officers severe blows, such as might have put an end to others as well as this man; and what occasion was there to have struck this poor creature who is dead upon his legs, upon his arms, and other parts, which there is no occasion to mention; but that is not all, for this man was not the particular object, for almost all the officers, called to you, one or other of them, as they happened to be in the tap-room, received different blows from different parts of this party, who were combined together for the purpose, that I think you see very clearly. Well, thus it stands as to Brian; with respect to him, it seems the strongest evidence that is given.</p>
               <p>As to Donohough, you will recollect what they say respecting the swing of the stick; it is strong, but not the same number of witnesses as respecting Brian; the witnesses who speak to him are, Miller and Smith; you have heard the evidence, I will only take notice, that there are not so many different acts proved with respect to him as with respect to Brian. With respect to Holland, I make the same observation; as to him, Miller is one witnesses, to be sure, a very strong one, and Egan is another witnesses, and the facts are very strong, if you believe the evidence, when I observe, that with respect to one there are six witnesses, and with respect to another only two; I do not mean that those two witnesses may not prove facts as decisive and as strong as the others; but I think it my duty to state that circumstances to you, that there are not so many witnesses; one of them proved a very strong circumstance indeed, the circumstances of striking a blow upon the leg, which was confirmed by she surgeon.</p>
               <p>With respect to Sullivan and, the character you have heard, there are no less than time different witnesses; one of them proves him to have been in the mob, and apparently consulting and concerting what should be done. Now these are the witnesses who say any thing material with respect to the prisoners, I have stated to you the evidence, and, if you are satisfied that that which was done was done in prosecution of a premeditated plan and design for the purpose of wreaking vengeance on the constables, then undoubtedly it is murder; if you can believe it was done in consequence of any other plan, if there is any thing which can justify you in saying that their crime is manslaughter, according to that which has been argued by the Counsel for the prisoners, and not murder, why then, in that case, you will say they are guilty of manslaughter, and not of murder, but you will observe the difference: I stated to you, that those cases which were stated from the different books were cases in which rescue was attempted of made, and the death happened pending the rescue: then apply all that, and find, if you can, an attempt to rescue; you cannot, according to my idea, but it is for you to determine: it cannot be contended, as it seems to me, that it was done in prosecution of such an attempt; at the same time, if you have the least reason in your minds to say it was not done with that premeditated malice, you must find them guilty of manslaughter: but, remember how material it is in this great town, that the peace should be preserved, and how material it is, that persons, if they will meet in such clubs, should keep themselves quietly, soberly, and according to law, I say, if you recollect that, and then attend to this evidence, and are satisfied in your own minds that these men had the pernicious, premeditated plan, of doing mischief to the officers, and not of a rescue, then your duty to the public calls upon you to say they are guilty of murder, and not of manslaughter. However, you will lay your heads together, and I am very happy to observe, in a case like this, that you have given such attention as you have given. I am firmly persuaded, that when you lay your heads together, your verdict will be formed upon good sense and justice, and that, with that verdict, the public will be perfectly satisfied.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Is your house in Mile-end? - A. It is in what they call Old Town, it is in the parish of Stepney, it is called St. Dunstan's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. When your house was robbed, between the 10th and the 11th of April, how many did your family consist of? - A. My wife, myself, the servant, Harrison, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife, at the time, able to go about your house? - A. With a great deal of help, she could walk about the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed on the night you were robbed? - A. I believe about nine o'clock; we generally go to bed between nine and ten; my wife and I went to bed nearly together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave your servant up? - A. She always went to bed after we were gone to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the house in a state of safety when you went to bed, were the doors shut? - A. They were, I had not taken any particular notice of them, but I did not observe any doors open; between four and five o'clock I received an alarm, that my house had been robbed, it was about day-break; I did not get up directly upon the alarm, I was very ill, and my wife got up first; it might be three quarters of an hour before I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up, did you observe what had been taken away? - A. I cannot say in particular that I missed any thing just at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you miss any thing yourself? - A. As soon as I came down stairs, I found the drawers were stripped in my parlour, and the drawers locked again; they were locked before I went to bed; they had been opened by the keys belonging to them, by taking my wife's pockets from under her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the keys of those drawers on the night before the house was broke open? - A. In my wife's pockets, she always carried them to bed with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were those pockets kept in the course of the night? - A. Always put under her head.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up in the morning, were the pockets under the head of the bed? - A. No, the pockets were taken out and carried down into the parlour, and there emptied of every thing in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep any thing else under the head of your bed? - A. I had my watch under the head of new bed, and I am sure I had it that night, and it was missing in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your servant, Harrison, know that you kept your watch, and your wife her pockets, under the bed's head? - A. Yes, she did; I will tell you how she came to be acquainted with this; when she came to help her mistress up, I asked her to take the watch from under my head, to see how the watch and clock agreed; this she had done eight or ten times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else lost from under the head of your bed, besides these pockets and watch? - A. Yes, the keys, and there was money in my wife's pockets, three guineas and a half in gold.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed, did you see any money at all in your wife's pockets? - A. No, that is what my wife told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else in her pockets, besides the keys? - A. There was some silver besides, I saw it; there were nine shillings and sixpence of new money; I know that of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any pin-cushion? - A. I saw the pin-cushion on the night of the robbery, when the maid undressed my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that pin-cushion left in the night? - A. It was in my wife's pocket, under her head.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up in the morning, did you see any thing of your wife's pockets or pin-cushion? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in the course of the day? - A. It was found in the course of the day, hid under the prisoner, Harrison's bed, by the side of an old window-blind, between that and the wall; there were a good many other things found then, but I cannot tell what; there were pieces of new linen cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present when that search was made? - A. One of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing particular about the house? - A. I cannot say I perceived any thing particular; there were the candlestick and things stood about the room as there had been every morning, and the breakfast things upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was your loss altogether do you think? - A. It might be between fifty and sixty pounds altogether.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live at No. 10, Cromsby's-row, next door to Mr. Wade.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us what you observed? - A. I got out of bed about half past four o'clock, to look at the weather.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day-light at that time? - A. It was just grey-light, not fairly day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough, at that time, to distinguish the features of a man? - A. Not at that time, if he was at any distance.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe, when you were looking at the state of the weather? - A. I saw something lying in my own garden, which I supposed to be a box.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any sence which divides Mr. Wade's yard from your's? - A. Yes, a brick wall; I put on some of my clothes, and went down to it, and found it to be a trunk; I took it up to my bedroom, it appeared to me to be full, I did not open it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the box afterwards? - A. I carried it back to Mr. Wade's, it was never examined in my presence; I delivered it to the prisoner at the bar; I went to bed again, and was nearly going to sleep, and I heard some noise which disturbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that be? - A. I should think it was nearly half an hour, not so much, perhaps; I then looked out of the window, and, in a few minutes, I heard a woman scream out, and cry murder, several times; I then put on my shoes, and went to the window, and saw Susannah Harrison leaning out of her master's window, and I found she was the person that made the alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this alarm, where did you go to? - A. I asked her what was the matter, and she said somebody was in the house; I put on some of my clothes, and called my brother to get up; I went to the front of my own house to look at Mr. Wade's house, which was close shut, all fast, and secure at that time; I then went back into my own garden, and called to Harrison, and asked her how I could get in; she said, if I could get over, the back door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get over? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when your brother found your back door open? - A. It is a gate which goes into the passage, my brother pushed it open; my brother got first to the back door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080044"/>Q. Were you in sight? - A. I was; I saw my brother hit it with a stick, and it went open.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you perceive then? - A. When I got into the house, it appeared very dark; not being used to the house, I asked Harrison to give me a light; she said, yes, she would give me one; she was up stairs in her room, I suppose; I did not see her, but I spoke to her.</p>

               <p>Q. When you saw her at the window, did you observe whether she was dressed or not? - A. I did not take any particular notice one way or the other; after she came back, she said her candle was gone, and she immediately came down stairs, and opened one of the parlour windows.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came down stairs, how was she dressed? - A. I did not take any particular notice of her dress, she had part of her clothes on, I cannot say what part, she was not fully dressed, she had a gown on and a flannel petticoat.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then? - A. After she had opened one parlour window, and going to open the other, we heard a noise, which very much frightened her, I was afraid she would have sainted away; I opened the other parlour window, and then opened the kitchen window.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had opened the kitchen window, in what state did you observe the rooms? - A. I looked round, and saw nobody, but there was a bundle lying in the passage, which, she said, were sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards examine it, to see whether they were sheets or no? - A. No, I did not; I know nothing of it any farther; she then said, that all her clothes were gone; I went out of doors, and took up a bundle lying there, and said to her, perhaps these are your clothes, this was about two yards from the door, the back side of the house; she said, no, that was dirty clothes; I then told her I had found a box; and she said, it was her mistress's.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave that box? - A. I gave it to her, and she carried it up stairs; I then left them, there was nothing more passed.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were in the house, did you observe any bottles or candlesticks? - A. I did not take any particular notice; there were some things on the table; I saw a candlestick broke, with the bottom off, and a piece of candle burnt down near to the socket, it appeared to have guttered and run down; I then went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the officers been sent for before you went away? - A. Not to my knowledge; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say, at the time you first went down, it was not very light, not light enough to distinguish the features of a man, without you were close to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that box from the window? - A. I think it was from ten to fifteen yards, but I could not distinguish what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it before you were alarmed, after you looked out of the window? - A. It was near half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Harrison, my Friend asked you about her dress? - A. I observed that she held her gown round her, and I saw her flannel petticoat under her gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what she had on, might have been put on in a minute? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BROWN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a constable, belonging to the Police-office, Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. What time were you sent for to Mr. Wade's house? - A. About eleven o'clock in the morning, Mr. Wade came to the office; I, in company with Cooke and Holbrook, went to examine Mr. Wade's house, to see how it had been attacked; we examined the front door and windows, and the back windows, and we found no violence whatever; at the maid-servant Harrison's window, we observed it broke, it was up stairs; we tried to see whether we could get out hands in at the hole of the window, and unfasten it, but we could not; we were very well satisfied then that the prisoner must be concerned in it, then we left the house; Mr. Wade had sent the prisoner, Harrison, off upon an errand, and we watched her back to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing more observed-Did you see where she went to? - A. No, I only watched her home.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where did you see her first? - A. We saw her about a hundred yards from the house, returning home; she might have been sent out an hour or two; I was not present when she went out; we followed her into the house, and brought her into the parlour; we told her, from the information we had received, and the window being broke in that manner, we suspected her to be concerned; she seemed a great deal frightened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. And did you not add, you had better tell? - A. No, I did not; then we took the prisoner, Harrison, into her bed-chamber, in company with Mr. Wade; upon the teller of the bed we found two neck-cloths and two handkerchiefs, a red pocket-book, a piece of new Irish cloth, and a pin-cushion.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find that? - A. By the side of he maid-servant's bed, behind a window blind, close to the wall; I was obliged to take away the blind before I could take it up; that is all I know upon he 11th.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see in what state any candle or candlestick was? - A. No, I did not; on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080045"/>the 16th I went to

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him, or did he give any account how he came by it? - A. He said the girl had either sent it to his house or brought it to his house; I know nothing more than finding the property. (That part of the property produced which was found at Carter's house).</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. What distance might Carter's house be from the house robbed? - A. It might be half a mile; one thing I omitted, which the prisoner, Harrison, told me concerning the key I found in her pocket, she said that Carter's wife gave it her to unlock at closet.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Carter's house four or five days after the robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not tell you that the things, which had been taken to Carter's house, had been taken at that time? - A. No, she did not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the constables belonging to Shadwell-office: I went to the prisoner Carter's house with the last witness, Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the prisoner Carter's house, did you see the prisoner, Harrison, before you went to Carter's? - A. No, I did not; I went with my fellow-servant, it was near about four or five o'clock in the morning, on the 16th of April; upon Brown's knocking, Carter looked out at the window, and said to Brown, in my hearing, I know what you are come for; I found in his bedroom a bundle tied up of wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it tied up in? - A. I cannot tell what, it was a spotted something, it seemed to be a piece of linen, that I brought away; I know nothing more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to Mr. Wade's house with Brown? - A. I did; I was not present when he found any thing backwards; upon the tester of the bed I found this parcel.</p>
               <p>Court. What I want to have proved, is, the time when they were last seen in the prosecutor's house.</p>

               <p>Q. This was five or six days after the robbery, therefore it was likely an account of this robbery had got about the town? - A. Most likely it had.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand that he is a man employed by the East India Company? - A. I never heard it only from himself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whereabouts in the house was it? - A. Close to the bed's-foot, tied up in the chintz gown.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live in Cromsby's-row, just by Mr. Wade's.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that chintz gown, and tell me whether you know any thing of it? - A. I know it, I made it for Mrs. Wade; I knew it by the work when I saw it in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make it? - A. The latter end of last summer; I don't know that I have seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Wade.) Do you recollect seeing this chintz gown, and how lately before you were robbed? - A. It might be a month, or six weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to any other articles of apparel? - A. I know that is my wife's gown.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What I want to know is, can you tell us the last time you saw any of these articles; had you seen any one of them the day before? - A. No, not so late as that; I believe the chintz gown was the latest thing I saw, and that is a month or six week; some of them I am sure I had not seen for a great while.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I understand you to say that the chintz gown was the last thing you saw? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Can you tell us whether there is any of your property in this box; here are the table-spoons? - A. They are mine, there is my name upon them; that penknife is mine. - (Another box produced). This is my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it worth twenty shillings? - A. I hope it is worth forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these two spoons? - A. The two table-spoons cost me six and thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is some money? - A. There is some of both new and old silver; I can speak particularly to the new money, there is nine shillings and sixpence I know, my wife had it in her pocket, I have seen it a dozen times, it is in this King's reign, it was money that my son made my wife a present of at Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find a pin-cushion in that parcel? - A. It is not here. - That little box in mine, there is one ring in it; and in another box is the ring which bears my picture; the other is a garnet ring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say you went to bed and left your servant up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The fastening of the doors and windows were left to her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not stay to see whether they were fastened or not? - A. I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you cannot say whether the back door was fastened or not? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. That is such a box as the woman could carry out? - A. Yes, it is of no great weight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. My Lord, I submit to the Court, that there is not sufficient evidence to support the specific offence charged against the prisoner, Carter, on this indictment, he living at the distance of half a mile from the place where the offence is stated to have been committed, nobody having seen him near the place at the time; and five days having elapsed before the officers went to his house.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not for me to determine whether that prisoner has committed a burglary or not, the Jury must decide that; and to support the charge, there is sufficient evidence to go to the Jury. - Melancholy indeed would be the state of the subjects of this country, if, because a man robs a house in the dark, and nobody fees him, he is not to be convicted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I don't know whether Mr. Wade spoke to the shoe-buckles that were found in the prisoner's, Carter's, house?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you on that day sign any draft for the payment of 1981. with several others, about the same day, or a day or two after? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other, besides that, of that sum? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it drawn upon? - A. Masterman's house.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 16th of March where did you place it? - A. In an open drawer in the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you put it there? - A. For the purpose of answering a bill of that sum, which I expected to be called for, which I had accepted; it was entrusted to the care of all my clerks, or either of them, if I should not be in the way.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, when did you expect this bill to come in? - A. On the 17th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it come in? - A. Not on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the draft again? - A. I saw it so far as the 3d of April; on the 4th of April I did not look into the drawer; but on the 5th, I found several drafts in the drawer, but this for a hundred and ninety-eight pounds was missing; I sent Garnham, one of the clerks, to the bankers, and he learned that it was paid; Garnham produced me a draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same draft you had drawn upon Masterman, and put into the drawer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your inspection of the draft, was there any thing particular that you took notice of upon the draft? - A. I did not observe any thing particular, it was the same draft, only there was a one altered to a two.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. However, you have no doubt it was the same draft? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Benbacock. This is the draft.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon looking at the draft, can you venture to say it is the same? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How many years had this young man lived with you as clerk? - A. About four years.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that time, I believe, you had entrusted him to the amount of many thousands? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suspect, that in any one instance, except the one now in question, he has ever injured you in the smallest degree? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you found, upon examination into your books, that this bill became due at a later time than you expected it would? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You, I believe, recovered all your property excepting a small sum? - A. I have not recovered any yet, it is in the hands of the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not firmly believe, in your own conscience, that at the time that bill would have been presented for payment, all the money would have been ready to discharge it? - A. From what I have heard since, I think it would.</p>
               <p>Q. You had, I take it for granted, an extremely good opinion of this young man, and his principles? - A. I always had.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing he was to remain in this country, have you that opinion of his good principles that you would trust him again in you service? - A. I would; he has got into some companies, and if he would relinquish them, I should have no objection.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing at any time, hereafter, he were to be proposed to you as a clerk, and to be trusted as before, would you again receive him? - A. I would.</p>
               <p>Garnham. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are clerk to Messrs. Benhacock, and Co.? - A. Yes; this draft was put into the drawer, and was under my care.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it last? - A. On the 4th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave it you? - A. The bankers, Messrs. Masterman, and Company.</p>
               <p>Q. It had been paid? - A. It had, about an hour before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. It lay in the drawer with other drafts, which might have been made use of likewise? - A. Yes, which were not made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. And it lay there three weeks after it was drawn? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a Police-officer belonging to Whitechapel; I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday, the 13th of April, at a house in White's-alley, Coleman-street; he was in bed with a young woman; I took up his clothes, in the presence of his cousin, and found a guinea, six half-guineas, and one seven-shilling-piece; in his inside coat-pocket, I took out a little red morocco pocket-book, and found a Bank of England note for the payment of one hundred pounds; it is a hundred pound Banknote No. 5384; a fifty pound note, No. 9588, a twenty pound note, No. 9134, I believe, but it is almost defaced. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him before he said any thing, to induce him to say any thing? - A. I had been with his father, and with his cousin, all the morning, to try to find him out before he had spent the money; when I found him, I put him and the girl into a coach; I asked him if this was the whole of the money; he said, there was a twenty-five pound note which was changed; I asked him how he came possessed of it, was it money that he had collected for his master; he said, no, it was part of a banker's check for a hundred and ninety-eight pounds, he said he had taken it from the accompting-house, from out of the drawer; I asked him if the drawer was locked; and he said, no, it was not, it was in a drawer with some other checks; I asked him if he received the money for the check; he said, no; a Mr. Smart, who was a sadler at the corner of Short-street, Moorfields, an acquaintance of his; that Smart had got a twenty-five pound note changed somewhere in Cheapside, but he did not know where, and had purchased some cloth to get it changed; I asked him if Smart knew that the note was a stolen one; he said, yes, he did; and was to have half of it for getting it changed, and that he had only received twelve pounds back as his share out of the note; I took him to the office, and Smart, by his information, was apprehended. (The draft read.)</p>

               <p>No. 142, White-hart-court, Lombard-street, 26th March, 1799. Messrs. Masterman, Walker, Peters, Mildred and Co. pay to Lightfoot and Tabrum, or bearer, one hundred and ninety-eight pounds.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I applied to Smart, begging him to return me the money, that it might be appropriated to the purpose for which it was intended; he told me had given it to this woman to get it changed; I went with him to find this woman, and we could not; we went to several linen-draper's shops to stop her from changing the note, that I might have it to return; when she came back, I said, I must have all that you have got; I did not abscond from my business in any part of the time, expecting to make the money up.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Benbacock). Q. Did the prisoner return to your house? - A. Yes, regularly, till the Thursday; this draft was paid on the Friday.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a messenger of Excise; I had received directions from the Board to detect the prisoner; On Friday, the 3d of May, I placed myself in No. 19, principal story, chief office, Excise.</p>
               <p>Q. The Excise-office is furnished at Government expence? - A. Yes; I observed the prisoner go past No. 19 with his eye turned towards the door, which attracted my attention; I observed him pass and repass No. 19 five times; I passed him in the long passage, and went through No. 20 to No.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080053"/>18, so that No. 19 was between the two; I held the door in my hand, to watch his passing me again; he came from the direction of No. 19; I stopped him about seven yards from No. 19; I laid hold of him, and saw these tongs under his coat on the left side; I had seen them in their place about ten minutes before I found them upon him; I took him to No. 19, and the tongs were missing; I then took him before the Commissioners, and then it was that I took the tongs from him; he said, in No. 19, that he had taken them from that place, pointing to the fire-place.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no situation in the Excise-office? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I saw the poker, tongs, and shovel, in the room, the door was open; I was looking for a gentleman that had said he would collect a few halfpence from the gentlemen there for me, as I was distressed, that made me walk backwards and forwards to look for him.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Shadwell. In consequence of an information that I received, I went to a public-house nearly opposite Giltspur-street Compter; I called upon Mr. Clark, the City marshalman, to meet me there; I marked a half-crown piece and two shillings on the edge, with two marks on each piece, with a knife; that half-crown that I first marked, and the two shillings, I gave to Comber; I put two marks nigher to each to each other upon that half crown piece that I marked the second time than the former; I gave that half-crown piece to Gill.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these marks such as to enable you to speak to the coins when you saw them again? - A. Yes; I shewed all the marked money to Riley; after that I desired Comber and Gill to go to Cock-court, Snow-hill, according to the information I had received; I gave them the marked money, and desired them to purchase counterfeit money for it if they could; they went out, and we followed them, to see if they would go into Cock-court; we waited outside in the street till we saw them come out of Cock-court; we went one way and they went the other, and we met at this public-house in Giltspur-street again; we went into the parlour, and Comber produced seventeen counterfeit sixpences and five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these? - A. I suppose these may be them, but I did not mark them; they were all bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these, and see if they are bad? - A. Yes, they are all bad; I desired him to take particular care of them; Mr. Clark came into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080055"/>room according to appointment, and then Clark, Riley, Comber, and I, went instantly to the house in Cock-court; I went up before Clark, and ran up stairs; Clark went in below stairs with the prisoner, Ryan; Mrs. Joice was in bed up stairs; I saw no man in the house at that time; I desired Mrs. Joice instantly to give me her pockets; her pockets were about her in the bed, or under the bolster, for she handed them to me instantly; there was a quantity of silver in a purse in one of her pockets, and a quantity of halfpence loose, and seven guineas and a half, and a seven shilling piece in good gold in a box, as well as I recollect; I tied the pockets very tight, and took them all with me; I took the prisoner into custody, and when I went to the public-house, I examined the silver to see if the marked money had been in the pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the silver in the purse? - A Yes; I saw the shilings and the half-crown that I gave to Comber to purchase, and also the half crown that I gave to the other person,

               <p>Q. Did you hear any rattling down stairs, or any thing of that kind? - A. I cannot positively swear; I was in a hurry searching the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those picked up by Comber on the stairs? - Do you believe them to be counterfeit? - A. They are.</p>

On Sunday, the 28th of April, I went, in company with Rogers, Clark, and Comber; Rogers and Comber went up stairs in this house in Cock-court; Clark and I staid below; I assisted Clark in searching the prisoner, Ryan; she was very loth to be searched; I held her hands, while Clark searched her; after Clark had done searching her, I heard something like the rattling of money upon the landing-place of the stairs; Comber was out of the front room upon the landing-place before I got to the top of the stairs; he was then picking up a quantity of pieces resembling money; he gave me fourteen pieces resembling sixpences, and three pieces resembling shillings.

               <p>Q. Did you see any money that Rogers marked? - A. Yes; two half-crowns, and two shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where were you when you say you heard the rattling of money, were you in the room, or out of the room? - A. In the room, with Clark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut? - A. The door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Comber at that time? - A. Up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently you could not see him? - A. I saw him pick up the money after I came out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, for any thing you know, that money might have been thrown there by Comber himself; and he picked them up when you came out? - A. I cannot say any thing to that.</p>

            : On Friday night, the 5th of April, about ten minutes after nine, I locked my shop up; the next morning about nine o'clock, I came to the shop and found it was broke open; I missed four legs of mutton, two shoulders, one neck, a saw, and a saucepan; in consequence of some information that I received I went to Bow-street, on the 6th of April, and two officers went and searched a house, the Marquis of Granby, in the Almonry-yard, about half past nine o'clock; we found two legs and a shoulder of mutton, and a saw, they were produced by the landlady; and then we took them to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the Marquis of Granby at all? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with stealing the mutton and the saw? - A. He asked the landlady for the saw that he gave her in the morning; I took the saw in my hand, and looked at it, I swore that was my saw have the mutton who would; then the officer asked the landlady whether there was any thing else that that man had left there; and she said, no; then the officer looked round in two or three rooms, and, in the inner room, he saw two legs of mutton and a shoulder, covered over with two or three cloths.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You do not believe that the prisoner stole this saw? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- BARTON sworn. - I am a carpenter and joiner, in the Almonry Coach-yard, Broad-way, Westminster: The prisoner brought a saw to sell, which I knew was this person's saw, and I told him it did not suit me; I knew the saw, Erscott bought it of a carpenter to saw his meat with, I had seen it about a week before; after that, he offered me a leg or a shoulder of mutton at my own price; I told him I had killed a hog, and it would not suit me to buy any; I told him of a person coming to work with me that might buy the saw, perhaps, if he liked it; he went away with the saw.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let him go? - A. Because I knew where to find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know the prosecutor before? - A. I do not know that he knew me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not chuse to buy the saw for a shilling? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to ask the price of it? - A. That I might be sure it was the same saw, till I could go to let the butcher know.</p>
               <p>Q. As you can swear to the saw so easily, I take it mutton is just as easy to swear to? - A. I cannot swear to mutton. On the 5th of April, I saw him filing a key against a post, opening the wards; I went to him, and told him I was sure he was at no good.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on Friday was it? - A. In the afternoon, about one o'clock; says I, you are going to break open some place, St. Paul's, or something or other; I supposed so by his making that key, it was a master-key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did not you prefer a bill of indictment, and afterwards go back to the clerk of the indictment and prefer another for a capital offence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do not you know there is a forty pound reward for a burglary? - A. I do not understand the law.</p>
               <p>Q. But the fact we want; do not you know there is a forty pound reward? - A. I never heard any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear there was forty pounds reward upon conviction of a person for breaking into a house by night? - A. Yes, when they are found guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do understand, that if a man was found guilty, and you were to be a witness, you would be entitled to a share of forty pounds? - A. No, I did not want it; I would not have it if it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say, that if the forty pounds reward was to be divided among the witnesses, your virtue would not suffer you to take it? - A. I do not understand these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go before the clerk of the indictments, with the prosecutor, to give instructions for the indictment? - A. Yes; I told what I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. And you then went away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went back again? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state, just now, that you had been twice to the clerk of the indictments? - A. No, I did not go but once.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us you went a second time, to indict the man capitally? - A. We went up the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never in a Court of Justice before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor before a Magistrate? - A. Yes; I went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. No where else? - A. Yes; I was once had to Queen-square for what I know nothing about; we had no bread to eat, and my wife went and pawned a sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were charged with stealing it? - A. No; we paid for the fetching it back again.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were it you or Erscott that recommended that he should be charged with a capital charge? - A. It was both, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. He was first charged with stealing the mutton? - A. He was charged with taking the meat and the saw.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was afterwards charged with breaking the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080057"/>Court. (To Erscott). Q. Was the charge of breaking the house, and the stealing, all made at once? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back a second time to prefer the indictment? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell the officer? - A. I told him that I had had my shop broke open such a night? - A. Did you give any instructions about a charge to affect the prisoner's life? - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave it with the officer? - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Erscott). Q. Did you ever see a saw with such spots as these upon it before? - A. No; unless it had been laid by and got rusty.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had, it would have these spots? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Barton). Q. What is the value of this saw? - A. About five shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing at all about the saw, nor the mutton either.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called nine witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you feel her hand in your pocket; - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080058"/>I felt her hand about my pocket; but I had two bags in my pocket, and feeling one of them there, I did not miss the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her hand in your pocket? - A. I felt her hand rubbing all round my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt now, that the time she had her hand about your pocket was the time you were robbed? - A. Yes; I am clear of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to see her at the time? - A. Yes, by the light from the linen-draper's shop at the corner; after that, she absented herself, and I was searching for an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might she be with you? - A. About a minute and a half; the next evening I went through Scotland-yard again, as I was going that way; there was only the prisoner and another that attends that corner, and I got intelligence from that other woman where to find her, in Tothill-street, Westminster; on the Saturday I went, and they denied that she lived in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find her in Tothill-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure it was the same woman? - A. Yes; they said, if I had a letter for her they would take care of it for her; I went up stairs, and there she was lying upon the bed, and then she screamed; she seemed in liquor, and I got myself used very ill in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found any of your property since? - A. No; she was taken up the Sunday following.</p>

               <p>Q. How happened it that you did not stop him at the time? - A. He is a person that frequently worked at Mr. Houlditch's for his master, and as he was at work there, I did not suppose he took it away with an intention of stealing it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen him fall down? - A. No, I had not; the first I saw he was lying under the horse's belly; I held up my hand in this direction to the coachman to stop; the prisoner at the bar was a <rs id="t17990508-36-deflabel216" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

               <p>Q. Did he stop? - A. He did not stop then, and the fore wheel of the carriage went over Mr. Gray.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the cause of his immediate death?</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. A. No, my Lord, he lived three weeks after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the coachman hear you call to him to stop? - A. I do not exactly know that he did; I kept still calling to him to stop, but he did not stop; he went round the corner into Duke-street, and there I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he driving Furiously? - A. He was going by no means fast, I think the jog trot of a hackney-coach; I attended to the man, got him out of the road, and he was sent to the Middlesex Hospital; I examined him, and found that his thigh was broke, and one of his arms.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was this? - A. On Monday, the 15th of April, last Monday was three weeks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. This was a gentleman's carriage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was driving no more than the pace of an ordinary hackney-coach? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he heard you call to him, you cannot tell? - A. No, he might not.</p>

             sworn. - On the 15th of April I had a warrant to apprehend the prisoner; going to the office, I said to him, coachman, why do not you take more care, and stop your horses; says he, I called out to the man, he would not get out of the way; says I, why did not you draw your horses on one side; he said, it was his own fault; I told him he did not know what trouble he was bringing upon himself, but his troubles were nothing to the poor old gentleman's, with his broken arm; says he, it serves him right if his neck was broke.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long was this after the accident? - A. About an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. By that time had he not rendered himself insensible by intoxication? - A. Yes, he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. It was as much as he could do to walk, was it not? - A. No, he could walk very well.</p>

On the 6th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I had been to seek for a place; as I was going along, I saw the two prisoners look very hard at me, and then they looked in at Mr. Jackson's shop at a piece of cloth; they went past the door as far as the coffee-house, and then came back again; I stood at the corner of Cavendish-street; they both went up Cavendish-street, talking to one another, and looking back; they went round, and came through a court by Oxford-chapel; then I saw them come back to the same shop, and look at the same piece of cloth; it hung out at the door upon a piece of board, there were several pieces by it; then they went to the same coffee-house again, and then they turned round, and Hughes, the youngest one, took it up, and gave it to Madden, and she put it under her cloak; Hughes stood looking at some muslin, when Madden ran up the court as hard as ever she could; I then went in and told Mr. Jackson of it, and two of the men came out; I ran up by Oxford-chapel, but could not see Madden, I saw Hughes, and told Mr. Jackson's men that she was one of them, and they took her home to the shop, and sent for Mr. Bates, and he took her to the watch-house; about a quarter of an hour after I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080062"/>Madden again; I went to the public-house the corner of Vere-street, I saw her there; she asked me if I would have any beer; I said, no, I thank you; then she was going out; I set my back against the door, and called for assistance; I told the landlord she had been robbing a shop in Oxford-road of a piece of cloth; she said, she had got none; she pulled her apron on one side, and then I saw a bit of it hanging under her cloak; I lifted up her cloak, and pulled it from her cloak; I gave it to Mr. Bates, and he has got it.(Bates, the officer, produced the property.)</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. (To Crosswell). Q. I should be glad to know how you get your livelihood? - A. I have neither mother nor father, I am a potboy when I am in work.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the owner of the public-house here where you took it from her? - A. No; I go a plaistering in the summer time; I am out of place at present, but I am going to a place at Mr. Thorogood's, a plaisterer.</p>
               <p>Jackson. Somebody informed me, not the boy, that a woman had got a remnant of cotton at a public-house the corner of Vere-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the boy say to you? - A. He said, that there were two women came to the door, and one of them took the linen from the door, and gave it to the other; one of my young men immediately went after them, and they caught the young one, Hughes; she pretended she had been with no other women at all; I immediately sent for a constable; I did not see the other till about ten or fifteen minutes afterwards; I was told she was taken at a public-house; I went to the public-house myself, and the prisoner had then this cotton in her possession, she had got it in her apron.</p>
               <p>Madden's defence. This girl that stands by, is as innocent as the child unborn; I never saw her in my life till I saw her at the watch house; that boy has been tried this Sessions at the Hall for felony; he has been in the same prison that I was in; he makes a property of swearing people's lives away; I had the property; I picked it up in the street; I am a poor distressed widow, and have three small children; I have been sick these five weeks with a decline.</p>
               <p>Hughes's defence. I am as innocent of what is laid to my charge as the baby unborn.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Crosswell.) Have you ever been tried? A. No; I have got neither father nor mother, and I was taken up in the street late at night as a disorderly person.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not taken up for felony? - A. No; Mr. Bates took me to Marlborough-street, and I was sent to Bridewell; it will be a month next Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Bates.) Did you ever take up Crosswell? - A. The watchman brought him in as disorderly, and I took him down the next day to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not charged with felony? - A. No, he was not.</p>

             sworn. - I was constable of the night the boy was brought in; he was brought in by one Brunton, one of our watchmen; he said, he had no place to go to, and the watchman had brought him there to fit up in the watch-house; then Bates said, if Brunton did not charge him as disorderly, he would, for he wanted him to be an evidence against these two women; he was committed not as disorderly, but for the purpose of being an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Bates.) Q. Is what Mr. Brown has said, true? - A. I do not deny but what I said I would charge him as disorderly if Brunton did not, for I wanted him as a witness against these women; I had the possession of the property.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what gentleman Evans is <rs id="t17990508-41-deflabel241" type="occupation">clerk</rs>

               <p>Q. In going from his house to Broad-street, he goes through the streets in Bristol through which the Mail-coach goes? - A. Yes; Quay-street is in the way; there are two ways in which he might go, but either way he must cross Quay-street, either at one end or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the sort of articles that are sold at the prisoner's shop to be bought at Clifton? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the distance of the prisoner's house from Clifton? - A. About a mile, or a mile and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoner again? - A. The next day that I saw him was on the Tuesday following, the 15th, at his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did a letter come on the 31st of December to your house from Worcester? - A. It did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and the prisoner on the Tuesday? - A. I asked him again about the postage of this letter; I asked him if he was sure it was one shilling and seven-pence; he persisted in it that it was; I told him, that I supposed he must be correct, having received the postage back from Taylor, as he told me, within an hour; and I asked him whether he had given Taylor five pennyworth of halfpence out of two shillings, or whether he gave him eighteen-pence and a penny.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him next? - A. At the Council-house, the week after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him write there? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. (To Gibbons.) Q. Did you deliver any other letter at the prisoner's house that day? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Abbott. I am clerk in the house of Messrs. Hazard, and Company.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter, and bill for 15l.; did you receive that letter, and that bill in it, at your house? - A. I did, on the 14th of January; it has the Bristol Post-mark.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Fry.) Is that the Bristol Post-mark of that day? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Did you send the tickets? - A. No; we did not like the appearance of the bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. (To Mr. Daubeny.) Q. You saw the prisoner at the Council house at Bristol? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that occasion, did you see him write? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Evans, at any time, told you he expected another letter? - A. He had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body dictate to him what he should write? - A. Yes, I dictated to him word by word; I dictated copies of two letters, one to Hazard, and one to Hornsby, in the presence of six other Magistrates; upon receiving information from London that a second bill had been presented, my suspicions were strong with respect to Evans; I took the letter to Mr. Snook's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the papers that he wrote? - A. Yes, these are the papers that he wrote.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. We are going to shew your Lordship, as a fact, the correspondent spelling of some words in each of these letters.</p>
               <p>Q. How is Gloucestershire spelt? - A. Gloustersheire; the word Price is spelt with a z in both.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the word inclosed spelt there? - A. In Closed, as if it were two words In Closed.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the word sufficient spelt? - A. Sufficient.</p>

            , who wrote these copies in your presence? - A. I believe so from that circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form an opinion of the letter addressed to Hornsby's? - A. I believe this letter to be the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the letter addressed to Hazard - are you or not, able to form an opinion of that handwriting? - A. I believe this to be the hand-writing of George Evans.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever happen to hear of any gentleman of the name of Samuel Taylor, at Cliston? - A. No; I have made a great deal of enquiry, but have not heard of such a person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is Clifton a place where persons resort for amusement as well as ill health? - A. It 
is a watering-place.</p>


               <p>Q. Is it not a pretty common thing for swindlers to go to such places? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And change their residence pretty often? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, gentlemen of that description might have one place at Bristol, and another at Clifton? - A. Very probably.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more likely to recommend a man to business than his being civil? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And if a gentleman, with his servant, should ask him to take in a letter, is there any thing more likely than that he would grant it? - A. Nothing more likely.</p>
               <p>Q. And he said this man seemed to be a man of fashion, and likely to be a good customer, from his appearance? - A. Yes, he said he was a gentleman with a livery servant.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of any thing more likely to engage a man to permit a person to have parcels or letters left at his house than purchasing articles of him? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. This man himself represented to you, that this person, who assumed the name of Taylor, had bought some goods of him, and therefore he had permitted him to have letters left at his house? - A. He said, he had requested him to take in the letters for him, which he had agreed to do.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt but he went to Clifton with the officers? - A. I have none.</p>
               <p>Q. This account, which he had given, was likewise confirmed by his wife, in his presence, upon the instant? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Your enquiry, was respecting the name of a person which you suspected to be forged to this bill? - A. I had my doubts from the good character of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Your enquiry, was respecting the person whose name appeared to be forged to that bill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not find any such person as Samuel Taylor at Clifton? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This man did not hesitate in giving you this account? - A. He did not hesitate much; he appeared a little struck at seeing me with the constables, which it was very natural that he should.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are a Magistrate too? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this Taylor, he represented as having seen but twice, and once through a glass? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. However, he did not at all represent himself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080066"/>as a person intimate with him? - A. I doubted even whether he would be able to fix upon the man when he went to look for him.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 12th; the prisoner remained in his house, and in his business, and perfectly visible to all the world, from the 12th to the 15th? - A. Yes, he did, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 15th you made fresh enquires of him, I believe? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him into custody on the 15th? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he taken at last? - A. I think at his master's; he was in his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, though an enquiry had been once made, and that followed up three days afterwards by subsequent enquiries, still the man remained visible, and open to any steps that might be taken against him? - A. He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he was apprehended, he still remained in the employ of Mr. Snook, who is a man of character? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, he gave you an opportunity of comparing what you pleased with his actual hand-writing, for at your request he copied two letters for you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And he is taken up on a charge of forgery, writing that which he ought not to write? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet he actually copied just what you chose to dictate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he submitted his hand-writing to every investigation you could possibly make, of his character and hand-writing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Though he was charged with forgery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoke of the character of the handwriting, now, I would ask whether you have not, before you gave your evidence to-day, repeatedly, and repeatedly, compared the

             in the letter with the Samuel Taylor on the bill? - A. I certainly have; otherwise, I should not have given the evidence I have given.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cause the prisoner's house to be searched, or assist in the search? - A. I caused it to be searched some days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the search, have you ever discovered the half ticket, or any one of the six quarters? - A. The officer told me he had found no such thing; he brought some books of his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. You have looked likewise at his own books, to form your opinion of the hand-writing? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. This man has bore a very good character? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you put him to write, though he spelt some words like the person who actually wrote that letter, yet, in some words, or some word, he differed from it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it happens with a great many people who make a fine appearance to spell very indifferently, especially these sort of gentlemen? - A. Very likely.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. Q. His wife had often seen Taylor? - A. She had seen him often; and once changed a ten pound note for him.</p>
               <p>Q. My learned Friend has asked you a great deal about the company at Clifton; is it a probable thing, that a person residing at Clifton, should go to a house like the prisoner's, at Bristol, to buy huckster's goods? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. And he had come to this house for a month or six weeks before, at different times? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wife say that in his presence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From having seen that hand-writing upon the bill, and having seen him write, you form your opinion that it is the prisoner's hand-writing? - A. Yes; and seeing him write is the principal ingredient of my belief.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you state to the prisoner any motive for your wishing him to write two letters? - A. No, I did not; we gave him to understand, that we had no faith in his account of Taylor, and desired him to write these letters, which he complied with instantly.</p>

               <p>Q. What letter was it that he did copy? - A. He wrote this letter, (producing it), in my presence, from my dictation; while he was writing it, he asked me as to the spelling of the word price; he said, is it not spelt with a zad; and he spelt it with a z.</p>

            , R. Dubley, Samuel Taylor.")(A letter addressed to Messrs. Hornsby, and <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080067"/>Company, stock-brokers, Cornhill, London, read, dated Clifton, Gloucestershire, January 8, 1799.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I perceive there is another difference in the letter, which Mr. Daubeny did not mention; in the one it is return, in the other, ruturn; and in one, plase, and in the other, pleas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hasselden. I am not certain whether the sum in the bill is 27l. or 28l. I believe it to be 28l. I have a doubt whether it is an eight or a one; I made a copy of it, and copied it as a bill of 28l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The indictment is a bill of 21l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hasselden. I cannot say whether it is 21l. or 28l.</p>
               <p>Jury. We believe it is 21l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. That which makes it appear like an 8, is a streak of dirt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. (To Humphreys). Q. It was sixteen days after that he was taken up? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. He had been pursuing his ordinary vocation? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stated that Mr. Alderman Daubeny wished him to copy this letter, he did it instantly from your dictation? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him write before? - A. No, I never had.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not had this means of comparison, you would not have been able to form an opinion? - A. Certainly I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a man of extremely respectable character? - A. I always considered him an honest, good kind of man, I never heard any thing against him.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You live at Bristol? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was your porter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the usual hour of his coming to your house in the morning? - A. About seven.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant is his house from your's? - A. Not near a quarter of a mile, about the half quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in the habit of seeing him daily; what time in the morning did you generally see him? - A. We have a large yard behind the house, and he goes there to look after horses, so that I do not see him sometimes till nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect, about the 30th or 31st of December, what time he came in the morning? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether he was or not correct in his attendance from the 30th of December? - A. From the 5th to the 14th of January, he was absent nine days; there were two Sundays, so that it was a week; he had received a fall, as I understood, that was the consequence of his being absent.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he been in your service? - A. Four years.</p>
               <p>Q. He bore a good character while he was with you? - A. Yes; he has been intrusted with large sums of money.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, you have seen him write frequently? - A. I never saw him write any thing but his name and signature to an order book, to prove the delivery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to write his christian name at length? - A. No, Geo.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think from that, that you can form an opinion of the character of his hand? - A. I do not think I am competent to judge of his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. He goes from his house to your's the same way that the mail goes? - A. I should have thought not; but I have been told since that the mail did come round that way that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You understood this absence was occasioned by some accident? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him a faithful and diligent servant? - A. O I should not have kept him so long.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him from a respectable house? - A. Yes, one of the first in Bristol.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have trusted him very largely? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And would trust him again? - A. Yes, I would; he bore a vere fair character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot.(To Fry.)Q. What is the price of a single letter from London to Bristol? - A. Seven-pence; a double letter, one shilling and two-pence, a treble-letter, one shilling and nine-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What letter, coming from London, would have been charged one shilling and seven-pence? - A. No letter at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then there is a mistake of two-pence in the amount of the treble letter.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they appear to be in company at the time? - A. They did; on missing my pocket-handkerchief, I asked the prisoner if he had seen any thing of it, he was close to me at that time; he said, he saw nothing of it; I said, that he did, and I insisted upon searching him, which he was ready to admit of; he was immediately behind me, which made me suspect him; I took him out of the bustle into Panton-square, which was about ten yards distance; there I searched him, and found a pocket handkerchief.</p>

             sworn. - I can only identify the property, I know nothing of the loss; the husband of the prisoner worked for me, and she has been in the constant habit of carrying work to and from my shop; and she was stopped on the 22d of last month, with some shoes that she was attempting to pawn, they were not shoes that her husband made, and therefore, I presume, they were shoes she stole from the shop, when she came backwards and forwards; I found eleven pair of shoes at another pawnbroker's, in consequence of her having dropped a duplicate in my shop, about a fortnight before; they were all my property.</p>
               <p>- BERRYMAN sworn. - I am a pawnbroker,(produces three pair of shoes): On Saturday, the 20th of April, I received a pair of shoes of the prisoner at the bar; on the Monday following, she offered me another pair, and I questioned her about their being her property; she told me she lived at No. 15, New-street, she said she kept a house there; I thought, from her appearance, she could not live there; she afterwards told me she lived at No. 15, St. Martin's-lane; and before I sent to No. 15, St. Martin's-lane, I jumped over the counter and felt her pocket, and asked what she had got there; and she pulled out another pair of shoes; she said she came to pawn them for a man who lived at a hairdresser's shop; my young man found a hair-dresser's shop there, and a man of that name, but he said he had not sent them by her, nor had not seen her for a long time; he was a shoemaker, but said he never made up such shoes; and I stopped her, and sent for an officer.</p>

            ; there was about seven guineas in gold, and the rest was in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. In what place was it contained? - A. In a mahogany writing-desk, in the room behind the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had the keys belonging to the desk been placed before that? - A. I had left them upon a round mahogany table, by the side of the wainscot.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it when you last saw these keys upon the mahogany table where you left them? - A. About three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it that you heard any thing that induced you to go and see if the keys remained there? - A. I wanted them to settle some accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that had you seen the keys? - A. About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that was said by any body, did you go up to see if the keys were upon that table? - A. I went up stairs on purpose to find them, to settle that account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the keys upon that table? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find them any where else. and where? - A. Yes; they were put upon another table, which was covered by a piece of green baize.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they under the green baize, so as not to be visible? - A. They were under the green baize.</p>
               <p>Q. Finding them concealed in that way, did you give any directions to your family respecting those keys which you had found so concealed? - A. I told them to let them remain where they were.</p>

               <p>Q. After you had given those directions in your own family, did you find them again in the same place or not? - A. About an hour, or an hour and a quarter; after that time, I went up stairs on purpose to see whether they were removed or not, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Those keys were the keys that would open the bureau where the money was put? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you perceived these keys had been removed, did you see the prisoner, and how soon after? - A. I fancy it might be about half past six o'clock; she came into the kitchen to do some little domestic concerns.</p>
               <p>Q. She had the use of the kitchen? - A. Yes, always; the prisoner at the bar then told me, that Mr. Thorpe, a banker at Loughborough, in Leicestershire, had been there in the morning, requesting that I would meet him at the George inn, in Aldermanbury, at eight o'clock; I replied to the prisoner at the bar, that my health had so indisposed me, that I was incapable of going out that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing to that? - A. She immediately replied, she wished me to take the two lads along with me, in case I might be more indisposed than I was, that I might send one of them home to inform my daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. You have two sons, have you? - A. Yes, one is John, and the other William, they are both here.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is John? - A. I think John is between fifteen and sixteen; William was thirteen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080071"/>the 9th of last month. The prisoner at the bat was very pressing for me to go; I told her I was very incapable of going.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any more than two sons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your two sons and your daughter were the whole of your family? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lost your wife? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she living in that house at the time? - A. No; she lives in Northamptonshire; I went down to see her the week before last.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any servant in the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the whole of your family consisted of yourself, your daughter, and your two boys? - A. Yes; after that, the children said to me, while she was in the kitchen, that they would advise me to go to speak to Mr. Thorpe; I then took the two boys up stairs with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were to go to the George, in Aldermanbury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Thorpe an acquaintance of your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner know that? - A. Yes; she answered him in the morning, I heard her answer him as I lay in bed in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come for in the morning? - A. I heard him say to the prisoner at the bar, that he would be glad that I would meet him at eight o'clock at the George, in Aldermanbury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. At that time, where were you that you heard him say so? - A. I was in bed in the parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. After that conversation, what did you do? - A. When the prisoner seemed so over pressing for me to go, I ordered my little girl to bring a candle, and I went up stairs, taking my two boys up, and the girl, leaving Mrs. Lacon in the kitchen by herself. My eldest son is very hard of hearing, the youngest I thought would be the most proper object; I placed him in a cloaths-press, which is a kind of cupboard, where I hang my cloaths, and desired him to be seated there until I came home; I had communicated to them my suspicions, and the circumstance of the keys having been lost; I shut the door, and left him there seated; there is no lock to the door of the cloath's-press, it is a kind of a three-corner, and he was seared in one corner, concealed behind some cloaths that hung before the door. My daughter then shewed me a light, and I and John went out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out, was the prisoner in sight to observe whether you went out with one or both sons? - A. She was not.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it that you left your own house, as near as you can guess? - A. About eight o'clock, that was the time appointed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you returned to your own house? - A. The watchman was calling ten as I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the George or not? - A. I went to the George, and staid till that time, except the time of walking there and back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Mr. Thorpe there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned, did you receive any information from your son whom you had placed in the closet? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that information you received from your son William, did you examine the drawer where you had left your money? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any sum deficient, and how much? - A. There was 16l. 10s. gone out of the 20l. 13s. 9d. and likewise the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What note do you mean? - A. It was an account of the money put into the bag, which I had put within the bag, containing an account of the quantity of gold, and likewise the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you put that note into the bag? - A. On the Thursday, as this was on the Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the information your son had given you, and the loss you found you had sustained, what did you do upon that? - A. I went immediately up to the prisoner at the bar, accompanied by the child that saw her take it, and John went with him likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner? - A. I went into the dining-room, where she was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the dining-room join her bed-room? - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the apartment that you let to her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she was in bed? - A. There was a chair-woman there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you went in so as to see her in bed, or do you only collect it from information? - A. I only went to the door of the bedroom, and the children with me; William told her respecting the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did William charge as having committed that robbery? - A. He charged her with having committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. In your bearing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner asleep, or did she make any answer to it? - A. She said, no my love, you may depend upon it I should never attempt to rob your father; the child told her, but, ma'am, says he, you have.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you had discovered your loss, and received the information from your son, that you went up to this bed-room with your son? - A. As soon as I had done unlocking my desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass that evening, that is material to tell us? - A. I told her I thought it was a very cruel circumstance for her to rob me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080072"/>when, at the same time, she knew my situation in life.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your situation at that time distressing? - A. I have been distressed.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been distressed for money at that time? - A. I had, and that through losses in trade.</p>
               <p>Q. You were at that time distressed for money? - A. Yes, I was distressed in one point, for this money was not mine, it was other people's money.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you were collecting your debts, for the benefit of your creditors? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all that passed that evening? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing afterwards pass from her, or in her presence? - A. I went up the next morning again, Sunday; I took the children with me; she appeared to be very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you at that time? - A. I repeated the same business to her again.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you mean by the same business? - A. The same as before the robbery; she said, if she had got it, she would keep it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing afterwards pass as from her, or any friends of her's, in her presence? - A. There was nothing more passed that day; but I observed a woman that used to wash and chair for me, to be let secretly into the house, and I then went to that woman's house, on purpose to know her business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in consequence of pursuing that woman? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. When you left your shop on Saturday night, who had the care of it till your return home? - A. My daughter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. After this, was there any thing passed between you and any of her friends, in her presence? - A. Yes, on Monday, and Mr. Holbrook called.</p>
               <p>Q. The Monday after the robbery, which, was on the Saturday? - A. Yes; he said, I had no right to detain the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you taken the prisoner into custody at that time? - A. No; I told him the door had never been locked upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. You will tell us nothing but what passed in her presence? - A. No, this was in her presence; he then asked me, why I did not pursue public justice; I told him, I was immediately going to Bow-street; I went there, but was too early.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the office open? - A. No, it was not, this was just after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that after Holbrook left you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How early was it then on the Monday morning that Holbrook called upon you, and held this conversation about the matter? - A. I think it must be between eight and nine.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, what did you do? - A. I then went about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after that? - A. I called there again in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. At Bow-street, do you mean? - A. At Carpmeal's house, which is close to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what passed at Carpmeal's, did you go to the office for a warrant? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you obtain any warrant at the office, or not, that evening? - A. I did not; the clerk said, it was too late.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing afterwards pass, either that evening, or subsequent to that evening, between you and the prisoner, or any friend of the prisoner's, in her hearing? - A. Not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This woman, the prisoner at the bar, lodged in your house for two years and a half? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lived upon excellent terms with her? - A. I can say, very much to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. She has had three half-years warning.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the three half-years, had you lived upon good terms? - A. We were not always, to be sure, quarrelling.</p>
               <p>Q. Not always, but pretty much so? - A. Yes, I had a reason for it; the whole of it was, I wanted her to depart my place.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard something about your wife-your wife does not live with you? - A. No, she does not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did not all the time she lodged with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she live? - A. At Kettering, in Northamptonshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at separate maintenance? - A. Yes, she has.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my learned Friend, you were rather distressed in your circumstances? - A. I remarked that, and that it was from the loss of money in trade.</p>
               <p>Q. You have compounded with your creditors twice, have not you? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Never at all? - A. No; it was about two years back I asked them for a little time, but I paid twenty shillings in the pound.</p>
               <p>Q. You then never offered eleven shillings in the pound? - A. I offered twelve shillings, and the first payment will very soon commence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what circumstances this woman was in? - A. No, she never told me in her life.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard? - A. I have heard other people say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in good circumstances, or not, from the information you have received? - A. That says nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080073"/>Q. But it does say something in this Court? - A. It has been generally understood that she was left a woman of property.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, do you believe that she was a woman of property, from the information you received, or not? - A. I cannot say but I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon your oath, at any time an oath is a serious thing? - A. Very, it is with me, I assure you.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you ever made application to her to become security with you for the payment of any of your debts? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she never sell out any stock of her's on your account? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But, from the information you have received, you believed her to be a woman of property? - A. I believe nobody disputes it.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife being at separate maintenance from you, you never proposed any terms of marriage between you and the prisoner at the bar? - A. Marriage!</p>
               <p>Q. You seem thunderstruck and surprised? - A. Enough to surprise me.</p>

               <p>Q. Never? - A. No, never, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor never said so to any body? - A. Never, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor ever drew any bills, which she accepted? - A. She never in her life accepted a bill for me.</p>
               <p>Q. I caution you, because I will prove it to you by-and-by; I put it again; have you never drawn bills which the prisoner has accepted; I will shew you the bills? - A. Never in her life; she has paid me for goods with bills, and paid rent with bills.</p>
               <p>Q. But you never drew a bill upon her which she accepted? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I take it for granted, you have never offered at all to compromise or settle this business, either by yourself, or any of your friends? - A. Never, I always refused it; it will be proved very shortly, I have sufficient witnesses to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you never desired any friend to make any offers of that sort? - A. I never did; it was proposed to me by

               <p>Q. What day of the month was it you lost your money? - A. The 6th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she remain in your house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080074"/>after you charged her with having stolen the money? - A. I do not know, I am sure I fancy it was a week, I am not exactly clear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my Friend, you went to Bow-street twice, once early in the morning, before the office opened, and in the evening after it was shut? - A. No, the office was not shut, but it was too late for a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You live at Clerkenwell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Hatton-garden office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there? - A. No, I did not go there for a certain reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go, during the fortnight the prisoner was in your house, to any office for a warrant? - A. I did not, I was advised not; I waited till the Sessions commenced at Hicks's-hall, to find a true bill against her.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that was the only reason? - A. I mean to say, that they had been to three different offices, her and her party, and I conceived it better for me to file a bill against her at once.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, in fact, you did not proceed by warrant from any office in town at all, but preferred your bill first? - A. I went to Bow-street for a warrant, and should have apprehended her.</p>
               <p>Q. But did not prefer any charge against her at any office, till you preferred your bill to the Grand Jury? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet she lived in your house a fortnight after you charged her with the robbery? - A. I do not know whether it was a week or a fortnight, I am sure I believe it was only a week.</p>
               <p>Q. The only reason you did not go to any office to prefer your complaint was, from the advice you had received from your friends? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any complaint made against you, and of what sort, at any office, by the prisoner? - A. I do not know by what means there could be any complaint.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether, in point of fact, there was any complaint made against you at the instance of the prisoner, at any Police-office? - A. Why, you know it was in consequence of Davis and Pugh, and their indiscretion, who acted contrary to my orders.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not ask you why or wherefore: I ask you, in point of fact, whether there was any complaint, and you know that I know there was a complaint made against you by the prisoner at the bar? - A. There was something said, but it was proved to the contrary that there was no complaint against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you before the Magistrates? - A. Yes, at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. And of what nature was the charge and that complaint? - A. That I shall never know.</p>
               <p>Q. But it was made known to the Magistrates? - A. I believe not; I believe the Magstirate was misinformed very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any complaint made by the prisoner, or at her instance, against you at the Police-office, in Hatton-garden, and when was it made, if you can recollect, perhaps your memory may not serve you? - A. To be sure I was at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon a charge at the instance of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you, if you can, try and recollect yourself, and tell us what the charge was that was made against you there? - A. I am sure I cannot, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know what the charge was? - A. I do not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps I may refresh your memory a little; was it any thing like this sort of charge, extorting money for the compounding of a felony? - A. It cannot be.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether there was any such charge against you for extorting money for compounding a felony? - A. They wished to prove that, but it could not be.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there such a charge? - A. It was proved to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask, whether, in point of fact, there was such a charge made? - A. I believe it was generally proved that there was no charge made; they wanted to make a charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was there such a charge made? - A. It was never my desire for any money to be extorted, nor I never saw any money; I did not extort money.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, was not the charge that was made against you at the time you were at the Magistrates in Hatton-street, for extorting money for the compounding of a felony? - A. I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not? - A. I do not know that it was; if it was, it was unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not an examination take place of witnesses, because my learned Friend was there, and examined and took a great deal of pains about it, and another learned Friend of mine too, relative to a charge of that sort, and in your presence? - A. I was there, but I never understood that I was there upon extorting money by false pretences.</p>
               <p>Court. He must know what the nature of the charge was; he has been hanging back, and has not given evidence in a way that he might have done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I ask you, upon your oath, whether the charge was not for extorting money? - A. If it was, it was unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a charge against you for <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080075"/>extorting money? - A. I said before, if there was, it was unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not witnesses examined before the Magistrate to make out that complaint; did you not hear them examined? - A. I heard them examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them examined upon a charge of extorting money? - A. I do not know that it was, my memory will not carry me to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a charge, then, made against you for obtaining money under false pretences? - A. There perhaps might be that, but if there was, it was not so, in no respect.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, whether it was so or not, the Magistrate was not fool enough to commit you to custody for it, and you were in custody four or five days? - A. To be sure I was in prison four or five days, but I was never heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, and I put it to you, and there is a gentleman by me who knows the fact, though Counsel for the prosecution - upon your oath, were not you discharged, because the Counsel, who attended for you, contended it was not a legal charge; and therefore, upon that account, only, you were discharged? - A. It was proved it was not a legal charge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Does your Lordship think arguments of Counsel are to be gone into in evidence?</p>
               <p>Court. A. It is not necessary I should answer that question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you never received any money for settling this business? - A. No, not a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor no Bank-note? - A. No; at Hatton-garden I saw some times in Mr. Dickinson's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What notes were they? - A. I do not know, for I paid no attention to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you taken up? - A. At the Horse-shoe, in Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you there? - A. A gentleman of the name of Cummins, a silk-mercer, in Cheapside, went with me there.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you go there to settle the business? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go there to meet Davis and Pugh? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not know of any money being received by any body else on your account? - A. I did not till after I went into the Horse-shoe, in Goswell-street; I went there, and Mr. Cummins went with me, to see if Mrs. Lacon was not there, and he was to keep her in conversation till I got a constable to take her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not go for the purpose of settling the business at all? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Davis and Pugh were at that house? - A. They were not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Davis was there? - A. No; he told me before I went out, that he was to meet Mrs. Gilbert at the Horse-shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Davis married her sister; and he told you he had made an appointment to meet Mrs. Gilbert, who is the prisoner's sister, at the Horse-shoe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Davis tell you, before you went, for what purpose he was going to meet Mrs. Gilbert? - A. I told him, in the afternoon, I was determined that evening to take up Mrs. Lacon.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, whether Davis told you the purpose for which he met her? - A. He told me he should meet her for no other purpose than this; because he had promised her that he would meet her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you have told us of this little boy; after he had told you of this business, had you ever any conversation with him upon the subject? - A. The conversation I have had with him has been this; my dear, keep within the bounds of truth, and say very little; I never gave him any instructions.</p>

               <p>Q. You never gave him any instructions as to the nature of the evidence he was to give? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the child ever repeated to you what he was to give in evidence to-day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Never? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that from the time he first discovered it to you, to the present time, he has never repeated the story about the discovery? - A. He has frequently talked about the badness of the crime, what a terrible thing it was, and all that; there were three or four gentlemen in Cheapside sent for him, to examine him, but I never went with him; they did it for their own satisfaction, to know whether the robbery had been committed or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You made no charge against this prisoner at Hatton-garden of this sort that you are now indicting her for? - A. I never had any opportunity at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your boy examined? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sworn? - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was not he sworn? - A. I do no know; the Magistrate did not swear him.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know any reason why? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor any reason given by the Magistrate? - A. I do not know that he assigned any reason at all; he seemed to wish to postpone the business to another day, on purpose that he might have an assistant.</p>
               <p>Q. It was Mr. Kinnaird? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, at another day, he had an assistant, and a pretty intelligent one, Mr. Bond? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sworn then? - A. No; none of my witnesses were asked a question; there was not one of my witnesses admitted into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you expect to be indicted yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080076"/>Q. This Sessions? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath you did not? - A. Upon my oath I did not, by any means; I was convinced to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The complaint that was made against you before the Magistrate was dismissed, and you were set at liberty? - A. I was.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What age are you? - A. Fourteen, last Lord-Mayor's-day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember walking out with your father in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your father well or ill before that? - A. He was very ill indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening did you go out? - A. I fancy it was somewhere about six or seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. To what place did you and your father go? - A. To the George, in Aldermanbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any body accuse Mrs. Lacon of having done any thing wrong? - A. Yes; I heard my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on that day Mrs. Lacon was accused of having done any thing wrong, that you went out with your father in the evening? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see what part of the house your father kept his money in? - A. Yes, it was in the desk in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the parlour to the shop? - A. They are both joining together.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, at the back part of the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see what money your father had in the desk? - A. Yes; there were twenty pounds thirteen shillings and ninepence, in a purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice, when you saw the money, what sort of money it was, Bank-notes, or gold, or silver, or what? - A. I believe there were three or four seven-shilling-pieces; and, I think, one guinea, and silver, but no notes, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you at all recollect the exact quantity of gold and silver that made up this money? - A. I cannot be correct as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this charge against Mrs. Lacon was it that you saw the money? - A. I believe it was about four or five days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any silver? - A. Yes, a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to speak positively as to the very day that you saw it, or that you can only speak within a certain time? - A. I cannot be positive to the exact day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect exactly, the precise time before this, that you did see it? - A. It was about four or five days.</p>
               <p>Q. It was within that time you are positive? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many brothers and sisters were living with your father at that time? - A. I have one brother, and one sister.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them went with you and your father to the George? - A. There was none that went but my father and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where your brother was left? - A. He was left in a closet in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose directions was he left in the closet? - A. My father put him in himself, I was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what time it was that you returned home at night, as near as you can guess? - A. The hour was ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home, was any thing said by your brother to your father? - A. Yes, immediately as he came home.</p>
               <p>Q. You must not tell us what. - After your brother had told this to your father, what did you, or your father, or any of you, do? - A. My father took the candle, and went to the desk in the parlour, I went with him, and he opened the drawer where the money laid, and the bag was open.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How could he open the desk without the keys? - A. Mrs. Lacon had put the keys, after she had done this, under the pillow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where he took the key from, yourself? - A. No; my brother found the keys before he came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was your brother who furnished the keys to your father? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When your father examined the desk, did you see in what stare the bag was? - A. Yes, I did; the bag was wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your brother give the key to your father? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag was open you say? - A. Yes, in a drawer in the desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bag in the same state, as to money, as it had been before you left it? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was missing from the bag? - A. There were sixteen pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of that deficiency, or was it what your father told you? - A. I did, because I helped my father to count the money over, and I had counted it over myself when he put it into the bag.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. If you counted the money with your father, you can certainly tell how many guineas there were? - A. I am not positive in that, because my father generally puts upon a bit of paper what it is, and I put it in the bag, but the silver I counted over myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing missing from the bag besides the money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean money-was there a ring, or any thing whatever? - A. No, nothing else.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080077"/>Q. How do you know that there was this money in the bag? - A. Because I counted the silver over myself, and my father told me how much gold there was, and I put it into the bag, and in the whole, it made twenty pounds thirteen shillings and nine-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether there was any account taken of it in any book, or any where else? - A. No, only upon a piece of paper that was put into the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that note gone when you returned, as well as the money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After your father and you had found this money missing, what did your father, or any of you do? - A. My father and me, and my brother and my sister, all went up to her bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your brother say any thing to Mrs. Lacon when you went up to the bed-room? - A. Yes; he told me of the circumstance that was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what he said to her that she had done? - A. He told her that she came into the parlour and called the dog, then she opened the parlour-door to go into the parlour, and then she opened the glass-door which looks into the shop; he told her, after she had done that, that she opened the door which looks into the closet where he was, that he laid down, and covered himself over with coats; that after that, she took the keys out of her pocket and went to the desk, she pulled one key out of her pocket that was on the bench, and that did not do; then she took out another key, and that did undo it.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did he say to her that she had done? - A. He said that she had opened one drawer belonging to the desk, and that was full of halfpence, and that he supposed she did not want; then she opened the other drawer, and that was the drawer that she wanted, where the bag of silver was in; then she put her hands into the bag, and filled her pockets; after she had done that, she locked the desk, and put the key behind the pillow upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any bed in that room, the parlour? - A. Yes; after she had done that, she went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Were these keys put behind the pillow of the bed where your father slept? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. When he said that, did she deny it? - A. She did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect the words as well you can? - A. She said, why then if I took the money I will keep it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after your father had missed his money was it that you went up, and your brother accused her of doing this? - A. We had been in the house about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after your father had missed his money was it that he went up and accused her of it? - A. Immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that before or after your sister had been out? - A. Before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go to fetch the rush-light before or after she had taken the money? - A. After.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when she went out for the rush-light? - A. I went down Cow-cross-street, my sister opened the door, and Mrs. Lacon called, and said, who is at the door, and my sister said, I am going to stand at the door, ma'am, and then I went out, and when I came in, Mrs. Lacon came in with a rush-light in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your sister when she went in, standing at the door? - A. Not that I know of.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were a constable of St. Sepulchre's parish? - A. I was, when this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Sumner? - A. I have been trying to recollect, and, as far as I can learn, between six and seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to you? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was it? - A. I am pretty sure it was of a Tuesday, I suppose about the 9th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time in the day? - A. A little after two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you of some complaint he had respecting Mrs. Lacon? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to his house? - A. I did not go to the house immediately, I went about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any previous friendship or acquaintance with Mrs. Lacon? - A. Never; all I know of Mrs. Lacon is, as a professional man, being a watch-maker, I cleaned a clock for her about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Mrs. Gilbert, Mrs. Lacon's sister, before that? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, though you are Mr. Sumner's acquaintance, I expect you will tell me the truth? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Sumner introduce you to Davis? - A. As far as I can charge my memory, I really cannot be certain, but I believe it was either that day or the next that he introduced me to Davis; I recollect it was on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation between Davis and him, and you, respecting the taking of any money? - A. As near as I can charge my memory, it was between Mr. Sumner and myself; he told me Mrs. Lacon had robbed him; I told him I supposed it was an odd kind of business, and so on, I thought it was best that they might settle it; I told him I did not like to interfere in a thing of this kind, it was not handsome, for it was in another parish, but I did add, imprudently, as a peace-officer, that I thought it were best if they made it up; he, on his part, told me, there was a Mrs. Gilbert, that wished, from the anxiety she felt, to release her sister from the difficulty that she laboured under, that Mrs. Gilbert would settle the business; he then told me that Mrs. Lacon had taken from him, I think, 16l. 10s. and there were about 9l. due for rent; the whole sum amounted to 25l. 10s.; he told me, I think, it was he informed me, I cannot remember every particular circumstance, but I think it was he informed me, if I met Mrs. Gilbert at the Horse-shoe, in Goswell-street, that she would pay the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that on the Tuesday or the Wednesday? - A. It was on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Davis present in any part of this conversation? - A. I rather think not, but I am not quite positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass between you and Sumner at that time? - A. Nothing more, than that I was to go at seven o'clock that evening, the Tuesday evening, and I should have gone to the Horse-shoe, and have taken of Mrs. Gilbert this 25l. 10s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass that evening? - A. I saw Mrs. Gilbert at the Horse-shoe, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080082"/>anxicty she was in made an impression on my feelings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Sumner again the next day, the Wednesday? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you the next day? - A. On the Wednesday I certainly did see him, but it was when I saw

               <p>Q. Did what passed take place between Davis and you, or Sumner and you? - A. Between Sumner and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Sumner the next day, Wednesday? - A. Yes, at the Golden-horse, in Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet by accident, or did you agree to meet? - A. My memory does not furnish me to answer that question.</p>
               <p>Q. However, you did meet? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A. I think about two o'clock, it was half past two.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between Sumner and you when you got to the Golden-horse? - A. I do not know, it was defultory conversation, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it about this money? - A. Yes, I told him I had been to the Horse-shoe, and that I had told Mrs. Gilbert we could not take the money; when I told her we could not take the money, either Davis and I, or both of us, I cannot tell which, told Mrs. Gilbert we could not take the money, we had had the advice of an attorney, and it might be the ruin of us if we touched the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Sumner say to this, when you told him? - A. I do not know that he said any thing to it, for he supposed it would drop there.</p>
               <p>Q. What else was said? - A. We went into a conversation about indifferent things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him any more that day? - A. Yes; at his own house about a quarter after five; I waited there at Mr. Sumner's for Mrs. Gilbert, we chattered upon indifferent subjects.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again the next day, the Thursday? - A. No; I stand corrected, for I saw, him at New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive any directions from him respecting any offer of money? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to this talk of your's to accommodate that, they might as well compromise it, for you thought it an,odd affair-had you been applied to by Mrs. Gilbert, or any other person on the part of Mrs. Lacon to do it? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not at the request of her or any of her friends? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you did not know Mrs. Gilbert? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mrs. Lacon with Davis? - A. I never saw Mrs. Lacon from the time I cleaned her clock, till I saw her at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him when he received the twenty-six pounds? - A. No; I would fcorn it to fly in the face of the laws of my country, after I was told what the law was.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you spoke of its being an odd affair, had he told you what his son had said? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. - Q. Let me understand you; in the first place, you were a constable at that time? - A. I was headborough.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were then, and are now a man of an excellent memory? - A. No; my memory has got very bad, like all my other faculties.</p>
               <p>Q. And, besides that, you did very wrong upon this occasion? - A. On the Tuesday, beyond a doubt I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying, and upon your oath too-far be it from me to fly in the face of the laws of my country? - A. By receiving the 25l.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not first of all advise that it should be settled? - A. No, I did not; for he had thrown out the idea of its being settled.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he ever throw out any such idea, except telling you Mrs. Gilbert wished to settle it? - A. He himself told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is what you call throwing out the idea of settling it? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not, though a constable, advise him to settle it, after he had told you Mrs. Gilbert wished you to settle it? - A. I have told the Court I did so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a constable? - A. So long, that I promise you I will never be again.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, Mrs. Gilbert's anxiety had made an impression upon your feelings? - A. Yes it had.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you tried to persuade Mr. Sumner to settle it? - A. I wished them all to settle it, for it was an awkward business.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said Mr. Sumner never proposed it himself? - A. It might be proposed by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, I ask you, did Mr. Sumner ever himself desire that it should be settled? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not just now tell me he never did propose it to be settled? - A. I never did tell you so, I am no logician, I am but a plain mechanic.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you not told this Jury, that Mr. Sumner never proposed to settle it? - A. No; if I have indirectly said so, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I will tell you what you said, that you did it at the request of neither, that Mr. Sumner never did desire it, but that you did it from your own feelings? - A. I felt it was an awkward piece of business; he told me he had lost so much money, and I knew he was a distressed man; he told me that Mrs. Gilbert was very much distressed about it; and if I have said any thing wrong, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080083"/>hope you will forgive me, as I hope God will for give me, for I came here to tell nothing but the truth.</p>

I went in, she was in bed crying; I asked her what she laid there for; I told the servant to go and ask Mr. Sumner to come up stairs, she went down three times before he came up; I asked him what business he had to keep her in custody; he said he did not keep her in custody, for the door had never been locked upon her; she had told me she was kept in custody; he said he had been robbed; I said, if you have been robbed, why don't you do your duty? he said, I had no business with it, it was nothing to me; says I, if you won't do your's, she shall do her's; he then said he was going about it; he went down stairs, and I went to Clerkenwell sessions to see if I could get a warrant; I did not get one; I then came back to Mrs. Lacon, and told her she must go herself about it, and with that I left her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her again? - A. After that she called upon me just after she had taken this man up, and desired me to come to Hatton-street.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an officer of Hatton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You took up the prosecutor? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose directions did you do so? - A. By order of Mr. Kinnaird.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany Mrs. Gilbert at the time the money was paid? - A. I was there at the time the money was paid in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. But did you accompany Mrs. Gilbert to the Horse-shoe for the purpose of the money being paid? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that money so paid by Mrs. Gilbert, under the directions of the Magistrate? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the money paid to? - A. The money, I believe, was paid to Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the adjoining room? - A. Yes, there was a glass looking through from the taproom into the kitchen where the money was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. You took Davis just afterwards? - A. Yes, and Dickinson searched Davis in my presence, and he took out a ten pound note, a five pound note, a guinea, and nine shillings, making sixteen pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take the prosecutor? - A. During the time I was searching Davis, Mr. Sumner came into the kitchen, and then I took him into custody, by the direction of Dickinson, for I did not know him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any resistance made? - A. Very great by Sumner, and by Davis likewise; Davis struck me several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any resistance made by Sumner? - A. Yes; he made all the resistance he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Sumner what you took him up for? - A. Yes; I told him I had orders from the prisoner at the bar, for extorting money under false presences for compounding felony; he said, at your peril detain me, if you dare.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Upon your oath, have you not been in and out of this Court several times since the trial began? - A. I have been in once, and I have been out once.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, during what time of the trial did you come in that once? - A. During the time two people were examined, I cannot particularly recollect the time.</p>

               <p>Q. And when did you go out? - A. When I was called.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the witnesses for the defendant were examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you come as a witness for the defendant too? - A. I do not know that I do service to any party.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not come here as a subpoenaed witness for that woman? - A. No; I have attended voluntarily without any subpoena at all.</p>
               <p>Q. And staid in Court while the witnesses on your side of the cause were examined? - A. I suppose I might have been in about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Hearing what the witnesses had to say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a constable in the Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, therefore, in the habit of attending Courts of Justice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know then, that it was particularly ill in you to attend the Court when the witnesses on both sides were ordered not to be in hearing? - A. If it is improper I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, for what purpose did you come in and hear the witnesses, knowing it to be wrong? - A. I do not perceive that my evidence is of any use on either side, as an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, knowing it to be wrong, why did you come in and hear that evidence, on your side the question, for half an hour? - A. I cannot say any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give us any reason, and upon your oath-do recollect you are a constable? - A. I know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then can you give these gentlemen any satis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080084"/>factory reason why you have been in Court, hearing the evidence on your side the question, give it an answer? - A. I cannot say; I did not conceive my evidence of any use whatever, I was only the officer that went to apprehend the party.</p>
               <p>Q. You can give no reason for it, but are sorry for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Sumner resisted, and told you to take him at your peril? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce a warrant to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you had none? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you believed it was paid to Davis; upon your oath, have you any doubt upon earth that the money was paid to Davis? - A. I believe it was, because it was taken from him.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were in the act of taking it from him before you saw Sumner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Sumner came in with a gentleman? - A. I believe he did, but I cannot say, in the scuffle I could not distinguish.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there was such a croud and scuffle, that you could not tell whether he came alone or not? - A. No, I cannot; there were a great many people in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them come in? - A. I cannot say whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the money was taken from Davis did you see Sumner? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner called five witnesses who had known her from seventeen to twenty-three years, and gave her an excellent character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a fisherman, residing at Stroud.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember, in December last, a person of the name of Drake making any application to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney objected that this could not be evidence, unless they could shew that the present prisoner and Drake were in company with each other.</p>
               <p>Court. I am perfectly of opinion that he must be connected with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raine. We shall certainly prove a connection between Turnbull, Honey, and Drake.</p>
               <p>Q. An application was made to you by Drake? - A. Yes; for the boat to go a pleasuring in; in consequence of which I came up to town along with Mr. Drake; I went to his house, the sign of the Bell, in Lower Thames-street; when I had been there about half an hour, Bryce came.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the Bryce that was tried and convicted here? - A. The same.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you first saw Honey? - A. I took it to be Pollard's Inn, but it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect where the house was? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the Pollard that was tried and convicted here too? - A. Yes, the same; there was Pollard, Bryce, and Honey altogether at the inn, and two chaises were ready.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What day was it you came up to town? - A. It was on a Friday or a Saturday, I cannot say which.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. How long did you stay in town? - A. One day and a night; we went away on the Saturday about six o'clock in the evening, Pollard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080085"/>Turnbull, and myself, went in one chaise, and Bryce and Honey went in the other, they went off one chaise just before the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to? - A. I do not know the name of the place; we went about twenty-two miles, changed horses, got tea, and set off directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the name of the landlord? - A. No; I did not hear his name mentioned to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you stop next? - A. We went eleven or twelve miles.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the place? - A. I do not know; there we hired a guide to conduct us over the marshes to Holly-haven House, by the river side, and a man to carry the portmanteau, and our fowling-pieces, we gave him half-a-guinea for his trouble; they had two guns in their chaise, and we had one in our's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps Holly-haven House? - A. One Richmond.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get there? - A. As near as I can tell, about four o'clock on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that what they call the Sluice-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you breakfast there? - A. Yes, and dined there, in the same party; the boat was not there till three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You went on foot to the Sluice-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that? - A. About six miles, over fields and marshes; it is a by-road, like.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of walking was it? - A. There was a great deal of snow upon the ground, we were over our knees sometimes in snow; we tumbled up and down, it being quite dark, and in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you left the chaise? - A. About one in the morning, I think it was, as near as could be, and we were about two hours going.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the Sluice-house, do you remember what became of Bryce in the course of the day? - A. Yes; he went in a short wherryboat about half past two, or three o'clock, from the Sluice-house to Gravesend, in search of my vessel, to see if it was come away; my vessel was to meet me at the Sluice-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he to go? - A. Seven miles from Gravesend; before Bryce took the boat, he and Pollard went out a shooting the whole day, and the prisoner Honey was at the Sluice-house with Turnbull and me all the day, he was not out of my sight, I dare say, ten minutes the whole of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did your vessel come? - A. At three o'clock in the afternoon on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go on board? - A. A little before six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went on board your vessel? - A. Only Turnbull and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Just before Turnbull went on board, did any thing pass between Turnbull and Honey? - A. Pollard and Honey shook hands with him, and wished him a pleasant voyage.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positively sure Honey is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you get for this? - A. I received ninety-eight pounds; I let Bryce have two pounds out of the hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you take Turnbull? - A. It blowed very hard on Sunday night, I took him to Sheerness, it blowed so much wind I could not go to sea; then we went into Ramsgate Pier.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go over the water? - A. No; he wanted me to go to France, to Calais, Boulogne, or Oftend; but I would not go there for pleasure, unless he would go into Dover and get a pass, to protect me and my people; then I took him to Dover, and he and I went to the play together; we were three days and three nights before he was apprehended; he never tried to get a pass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You thought this was only a party of pleasure? - A. I thought no otherwise; if I had thought it had been Turnbull, I should have brought him to London, and have made a good job of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you were to take him upon a party of pleasure for three or four days? - A. We made no agreement about the time.</p>
               <p>Q. It was charming weather for an excursion on the water? - A. It was not very fine weather.</p>
               <p>Q. It was last July, or August, was it not, that you had this excursion upon the water? - A. Just after Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. In pleasant weather, I dare say, a person would give a very handsome price for an excursion; how many tons is your vessel? - A. Ten.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hands has she? - A. Myself, two men, and my son.</p>
               <p>Q. You had the guineas down? - A. No, I had no guineas, it was in Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were paid in London? - A. No, only fifty pounds; I received the other forty-eight from Turnbull, Bryce gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. And you made an agreement for one hundred pounds, with Bryce and Drake? - A. No, Drake made an agreement with me.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had no doubt upon earth that it was for a party of pleasure upon the English Coast? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. And you looked to Drake and to Bryce for payment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, will you look these gentlemen in the face, and swear that you supposed it was for a party of pleasure, and in such weather, for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080086"/>which you received so enormous a sum? - A. I thought the gentlemen were going on a party of pleasure.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the most you ever received for such a trip before? - A. I never went on pleasure before.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go for then? - A. Oysters and fish, and soon.</p>
               <p>Q. You never carried a gentlemen before? - A. No, only just for pleasure up the river, or so.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you receive then? - A. A guinea, or so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive ten guineas before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose I wanted you to take me out in your boat for a fortnight, what would you expect? - A. Twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not think of asking one hundred pounds? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make diligent search to find him? - A. I did; he had not been there, nor was expected there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use all the means in your power to discover whether he was there or thereabout? - A. I certainly did, but could learn nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any letter from Honey's wife, during this search of your's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards continue your diligent search there and elsewhere? - A. Yes; I attended night and day at his house for six weeks, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the first of your search, till he was forthcoming? - A. From nine to ten weeks, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use all the means in your power? - A. Yes, night and day; we employed five or six officers at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had followed his occupation, and resided at his usual abode, must you have found him? - A. Surely.</p>
               <p>Q. Rufford went with you to the Marine Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you him in custody of an officer? - A. No; he surrendered to me at Stroud, and gave up the money immediately; I went from Stroud to Sheerness after him, and missed him, he had come round another way; when I came back I understood he was returned; there was a gentleman of considerable fortune with whom I understood he was intimate; I went to him, and he produced him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he berray any reluctance to give up the money, or himself? - A. No; he sent his wife for a parcel, which, he said, had never been untied, and she brought it immediately; the parcel contained a forty pound, and ten pound, and other small notes, to the amount of ninety-four pounds; it was tied up in a white rag</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come with you to town willingly? - A. Yes; indeed I placed some confidence in him, for I was tired, and went to sleep in the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not in custody after he came to town? - A. No, he lodged at a public-house within a few doors of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, at that time, he was not under the controul of any body? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Then you went into the country to search for Rufford, supposing he was a party concerned in aiding Turnbull? - A. Yes; when he told me the story, I asked him where the money was; he said, at home, at Stroud.</p>
               <p>Q. But before he told you any of the story, did you not tell him you came for the purpose of apprehending him? - A. I told him I came down to take him into custody, supposing him a party concerned with Turnbull; I had a warrant in my pocket, which I never produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080090"/>Q. Did you tell him you had a warrant? - A. I don't think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Rufford ever give you any account till you told him you had a warrant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a pistol in your hand? - A. No, I had pistols in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you, if he had made any resistance, have let him escape? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have let him escape, before he came to the office? - A. He might have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have thought it right in you to have permitted him to escape? - A. I knew he would not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not consider it your duty to keep him in custody till you brought him to town? - A. Surely I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then was he not in your custody? - A. When I brought him to town, I left him in Holborn to go where he pleased, before he was examined at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he would tell you every thing he knew, provided he was not prosecuted himself? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You went down to Ware? - A. Yes, seven or eight miles below Ware.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, perhaps, it may have happened to you to tell your wife you were going to one place when you were going to another? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this man come, and voluntarily surrender himself to justice? - A. Yes, he did; after being promised that no advantage should be taken of his person.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to your house, and told you, if no advantage was taken of him, he would go and surrender at the office; and you, like an honourable man, did not take advantage of him, and he did go and surrender himself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. If you had found it necessary, you would have taken Rufford into custody? - A. Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not find it necessary to take him into custody? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is your situation? - A. I am a gun maker, and attend prosecutions on the part of the Mint.</p>

               <p>Q. And after that, you come here to give him a character? - A. I never heard any thing amiss of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any property of your's? - A. I missed the gratings from our area, on Good Friday morning, about half past six; I had seen them about ten o'clock in the evening, before they were missed, over the kitchen area.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they iron bars? - A. Yes; in consequence of information from Mr. Wood, I went down to Mr. Wyllie's, a smith, in Golden-lane, where we found the iron which we supposed to belong to our area.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us why you supposed they belonged to your area? - A. Because they fitted in exactly.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a victualler, I keep the White-lion, in Brick-lane, Old-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Chant? - A. Yes; I saw him on Good-Friday morning, nearly about ten o'clock, he had a sack which, by the appearance of it, contained iron, it appeared to be very heavy; I saw the corner of an iron bar through the sack.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you see it through the top or the bottom of the sack? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the end of the iron bar pierce through the sack? - A. No, there was a hole in the sack; it was a very little bit through the sack, and that led me to a suspicion that it was iron.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that a hole at the top of the sack, or the bottom of the sack, or the side of the sack? - A. Very near the bottom part of that end that was hanging behind him; I followed him about twenty yards, and sometimes ten, to a yard in Golden-lane, to a smith's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. It was Wyllie's shop, was it? - A. I believe it was Wyllie followed him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the shop? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What length did the bars appear to be? - A. Four or five feet long.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they straight? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Jury. (To Allcock.) Q. The bars you lost, of what sort were they? - A. They lay in a frame upon the ground, with a turn up towards the house of about five or six inches.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What inducement had you to follow the prisoner? - A. Because I had come down Gee-street, and coming round the corner to Noble-street, I saw Chant; I had seen the grating was gone from this house before I saw Chant.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Wood.) Q. Where was it that you saw the prisoner? - A. Coming out of a house No. 41, Noble-street; it was a house that had been shut up, and I followed him to Wyllie's.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. On the 22d of March, Good Friday, I went with Allcock to the very top shop of a yard in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. It was Wyllie's? - A. Yes, he was not in the shop; I looked through the shop-window, and saw bars that I thought very likely came from this house; I am in the iron way myself; I stopped at the shop that nobody should take the bars away while I sent Mr. Allcock for the constable; Mr. Allcock returned with the constable,

            , and there found all the bars belonging to the two areas.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you find the bars belonging to Allcock's area? - A. Yes, they had been broke up; soon after Mr. Wyllie came, and his wife, the constable took him into custody; then, from the information I received from him, the constable, and me and Wyllie, went to Chant's house in the Yard, in Old-street, it is just under the gate-way.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to Chant's, was Chant at home? - A. Wyllie knocked at the door, I believe Chant opened the door himself; Wyllie says, what a pretty mess you have brought me into by buying this iron of you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first thing that was said by Wyllie? - A. The first thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it made known, at that time, to Chant, what sort of bars they were? - A. No; then the officer took Chant into custody; Chant said, we must be quiet, do not make a noise, and I will take you to the man that brought it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in Chant's house? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080093"/>A. No; at that time we all went with Chant to No. 41, Noble-street, Brick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the house that had been robbed? - A. Not more than a hundred and fifty yards; Chant knocked at the door, but the house was close shut up; Chant, and me and the constable, went to two or three public-houses; Chant said, he made no doubt but we should find him, his name was Phillips.</p>
               <p>Q. Phillips was the man that he supposed to whom the house belonged? - A. Yes; there were several people in all the public-houses we went into, but he could not identify the man at all; then we took Chant and Wyllie, and conveyed them before Mr. Kinnaird, at Hatton-garden; after that, I went with George Longden, that same day, to No. 41, Noble-street, and found the house shut up as it was before; Longden searched the house, he got in at the back-door, he forced it open; I saw Longden pull some pieces of iron out of the closet; there was one piece of iron, a square bar, as if it belonged to the area; he found a great number of duplicates; then we went to Chant's, and found some pieces of lead which had the appearance as if iron bars had been fixed to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try these pieces of lead with the iron bars afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the bars, found at Wyllie's, were fitted to the area? - A. Yes, Mr. Allcock's area.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. They fitted, did they? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many areas in London do you suppose they would have fitted? - A. I cannot suppose that they would have fitted any other.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not off the corner of his house? - A. They were the same bars as near as could be, representing the other grating.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that the common size of area bars? - A. I do not know that it is a common size.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a smith? - A. An edge-tool-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that was not a common size area bar? - A. It is the same size with the rest of the bars in the street; the whole grating is made alike nearly.</p>
               <p>Q. And like the areas in many other streets? - A. It may be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then do you not believe it is a common size area? - A. I do not think there are any of the same size areas round about your neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear it is a common size area bar? - A. I do not doubt of its being a common size.</p>
               <p>Q. The bars that are not quite large enough will fit, because it is fixed in with mortar and lead? - A. No, the knuckle of the bar must fit exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other iron at the prisoner's warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bars were there? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a very large quantity of iron? - A. I dare say there might be a ton or two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Were there any other area bars missing in the street? - A. No, mine were forced but not taken away; except Mr. Doyle's and Mr. Allcock's.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live in George-yard, Golden-lane: On Good-Friday morning the prisoner came to my house, between nine and ten o'clock, with some iron, it seemed to be party grating, some of it was broke, and some whole; he brought it in a sack.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any observations upon the sack? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether there was a hole in the sack or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What length might the iron be? - A. Some of it might be four or five feet long, and some of them turned up; he had brought me a lot of iron; he and I broke it up to weigh it, because my scales would not weigh above a hundred and a half at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at all at the time you were breaking it up? - A. Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same iron that was afterwards found at your house by Allcock? - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the iron? - A. I laid the iron down in the shop, and he told me he had got another load of iron for me, down at his shed; I went and fetched that up, and this man came and picked the iron out, and said, that was iron that was stole.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the other iron? - A. I laid it down in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Mixed it with the other iron? - A. No, I threw it down by itself.</p>
               <p>Q. And that iron that you placed by itself in the shop, was the same iron which Allcock, and the constable, came and took away? - A. Yes; I went with the officer to Chant's, and said, Mr. Chant, what a mess you have brought me in about buying this iron; Chant said, he could take the gentlemen to the man that he brought it of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. Nine months; he keeps a horse and cart, and collects iron; sometimes he has brought me iron, either upon his back, or in his cart, as it suited him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the fair regular price for it? - A. I gave 16s. and 6d. per husband for it.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is the fair regular price for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was for working up in the course of your business as a smith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was brought perfectly open in the day<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080094"/>time? - A. Yes, between nine and ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no concealment about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He desired you not to make a noise when you went to his house? - A. I never heard such a word.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am rent-gatherer to Mr. Christopher Norris. I was in company with the officer when he searched the prisoner's house; we found some pieces of lead, which appeared to me as if they belonged to Allcock's grating; I saw the iron bars at the office, I tried them the next day with the area, and they fitted.</p>

               <p>Q. There was a large quantity of iron there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found the things lying in a proper place for them for a dealer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the Magistrate thought fit to commit him for receiving, did he not? - A. The Magistrate did as he thought fit.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that he was committed for receiving, and not for stealing? - A. I understood the term was a misdemeanour.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was admitted to bail, and comes here surrendering himself to take his trial? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp I am a constable of St. Luke's: At the desire of Mr. Allcock, I went to Wyllie's house, and apprehended him; we found this iron lying upon the ground (producing it); they afterwards went to Chant's house, and took him into custody, I did not find any thing there.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time Wyllie and Chant were together, do you recollect Wyllie saying any thing to Chant? - A. Chant said he had a journeyman of the name of Phillips; I went in search of Philips, but could not find any such person; he said he lived in Noble-street; there was nobody there; I then took Wyllie and Chant to the Sitting Magistrates in Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Wyllie saying any thing to Chant? - A. No; I tried the bars at Mr. Allcock's; there were twenty-two of them, and they fitted.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. About the 1st or 2d of March, my wife was brought to-bed of twins; her illness caused me to pay great attention at home; I used to be frequently at home by eight, or half past even every night. On Thursday night before Good Friday, particularly, I went to bed about eight o'clock, and laid till about seven in the morning. On the Good Friday, I came down stairs, got my breakfast at home, and then it might be a little after eight o'clock; a person came enquiring after the welfare of my wife, who stood in conversation with me; at the same time, a person came up of the name of Philips, and told me he had got a load of iron that would suit me, if I thought proper to go and look at it; I asked my friend, who was in conversation with me, to take a walk with me; accordingly he did; we went with Philips, who I am not able to produce, to No. 41, Noble-street, where I saw Mrs. Philips, as Philips called her, and a man standing close to the fire-place; he produced a load of iron, and I agreed with him for fourteen shillings a hundred, which is a very fair price for a man to support a horse and cart, and get his living out of it. The iron was weighed, I paid him for it, I brought it upon my shoulder, and carried it to Wyllie's, which I had frequently done, sometimes in a cart, and sometimes on my shoulder, which was most convenient; but it being Good-Friday, I thought it was not proper to bring my cart out that day; I have two witnesses, if your Lordship will hear them, that I hope will give your Lordship and the Jury the satisfaction that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080095"/>I had not been from home any of these nights during my wife's illness, which is the nurse.</p>

             sworn. - Q. I was nursing Mrs. Chant; she had lain-in three weeks and four days before Good Friday; she had twins, this is one, the other is at home: On the Thursday evening he came home a little before eight o'clock; his wife and he were having a few words, and he left his supper upon the table, and went up stairs to bed; I took particular notice of it, because it was the only time I had ever observed any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did his wife go to bed? - A. It might be ten or half past ten; I went to bed about half past three on the morning of Good Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner sleep? - A. In the same room with his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the wife to bed? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I warmed the bed, and felt his feet in the bed; I slept in the same room with the twins, and three small children; besides, I gave my mistress some caudle, and I am sure he was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time he got up that morning? - A. It might be seven, or a quarter after seven, as near as I can recollect; he could not come down, without coming through the room where I was; I was up at half past five to feed the children; as they did not suck, I was obliged to be up very often with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he breakfast that morning at home? - A. Yes; he did not go out till half past eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any family yourself? - A. I have one son,

               <p>Q. When did you see your son again? - A. On the Friday morning, to leave the key, when he went to work; Mr. Chant was coming down stairs at the time, and he gave me some breakfast; on the Friday evening my son came back again about the time that Mrs. Chant was going to bed, and he had one of the children for near two hours after that.</p>

               <p>Q. How many times has he begged of you to speak of what you know? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have not talked with any body about what you should give in evidence? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. But this morning, Good Friday, you are perfectly certain about it? - A. Yes, because of the boy getting up.</p>
               <p>Q. So you warmed the bed, and he in bed? - A. Yes.</p>

            , and myself, took some hemp out of a craft lying at Iron-gate, into a lug-boat.</p>
               <p>Q. By what authority did you take it? - A. We stole it out of a lighter; we took it up to Ranelagh gardens; it might be about twelve or one o'clock in the morning when we took it out of the lighter: when we came to Ranelagh-gardens, between three and four in the morning, Brandall went ashore to call Mr. Hardy; when he returned again, Hardy and Ridley were with him; the hemp was put into a summer-house and was weighed; we put it into the summer-house, and Ridley assisted us; Hardy was at the weighing of it; it was a summer house belonging to Ranelagh-gardens; Ridley was the gardener.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the scales? - A. I do not know; there were about fifteen or sixteen hundred weight of it; I cannot say justly to a hundred weight; I left it in the summer house, and Ridley and Hardy with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now state when you applied to Hardy for any money? - A. It might be four or five days after I received a guinea on account of the hemp from Mr. Hardy; I told him that was very little; he said, he was very sorry he could not give us any more, for he had not got the money for that hemp that we had taken him up; in about a week, or rather more, I received another guinea of him; he told me he had sent the hemp to Reading, in Berkshire; he desired us to bring him up a little more hemp,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080098"/>and a little black flax that he wanted, and he could sell that for ready money; he said, as soon as he had got the ready money, he would pay us for what he had had, and likewise for that too; we told him, if he could not pay for what he had had, he could not pay for any more.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Brandall? - A. A shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Allen? - A. A waterman.</p>

               <p>Q. For the mere love of justice? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Merely that the guilty persons might be punished? - A. And for my own safety.</p>
               <p>Q. Now which of those two motives happened to be the most powerful, the love of justice, or the desire of safety? - A. The desire of safety.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a great many examinations before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you recollect seeing me there? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. With directions to you to look it over? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you carried it about you, in your pocket? - A. No; it laid in the housekeeper's room; I looked at it sometimes to rub up my memory.</p>

             in his defence says, that Brandall came to me, about nine months ago, while in the Spilling-grounds, and offered to bring up some stuff, meaning hemp, in three or four days; Brandall, Thompson, and another man, brought it up; I told him to bring it to a bridge near Ranelagh-gardens; he brought it to the gardens about daybreak in the morning, Brandall came to me and forced me out of bed; I went down, and carried scales, to Ranelagh Summer-house, where it was weighed, and I brought it up through the garden upon my back, assisted by a labouring man, about ten or eleven o'clock the same morning, making many turns, there being about sixteen hundred weight of it in all; in a day or two after this, the same men came with another freight, consisting of seventeen hundred weight of hemp; Brandall called me as before, and assisted in carrying the scales, and it was weighed as before, it was between four and five o'clock in the morning, and Ridley in the gardens at Ranelagh, who was then up, assisted in weighing it; I agreed to give twenty-six pounds, I was not asked more; if I could have given the money down they would have taken a guinea a hundred; it was not the prime hemp; it was long rough hemp, and worth about thirty-five shillings per hundred weight, in regular trade; I brought it up upon my back as before, assisted by one of the Chelsea pensioners; Brandall, and his associates would have brought me a great deal more if I could have paid them ready money; I sent some of the hemp to a person in the trade, namely, a man in Kent-street, fourteen hundred weight, I believe his name is Wilson, and the rest of it I worked up; I told the sailors that I had sent it to Reading, but that was not true, it was in consequence of their teazing me so much for money; I made seven or eight partial payments in small sums, for the hemp, and was afterwards prosecuted for the balance, and arrested for eighteen pounds eleven shillings, for which my brother granted a note, and released me from a spunging-house near Oxford-market, where I was confined three days."

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner sign that? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Are you attorney for the prosecution? - A. Mr. Chetham conducts the prosecution.</p>

               <p>Q. You are one of the attornies for the prosecution? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it the practice of your office, in cases of an accomplice, to give them a copy of their examination? - A. I was not aware of any inconvenience.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask what is the practise? - A. The practise is, we read over his deposition to him, he signs it, and subsequently a copy is made for the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any sees for that copy? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you do in all cases of accomplices? - A. And in other cases.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems to me to be a novel practice, and I think it my duty to throw out this observation, that it seems to tend much more to injustice than to justice: a man in the light of an accomplice, states facts to you and gets a copy of his deposition, that he may have an opportunity of continuing in the same story; I never heard of such a thing before; I throw it out now, that the Magistrates may know that the Court disapproves of such a practice, and that they may take it into their consideration to prevent it.</p>

            ; we told him we had got a load for him to take up at Chelsea; accordingly he went with us about five o'clock in the morning, with a cart, to Ranelagh-walk, Chelsea; when we came there, the cart went down the yard and was loaded, Ridley and Avery lent a hand to load it; we directed the man to drive to Worcester-place, Thames-street; when we came there, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, Mr. Smith's man, and his boy, were waiting, there is a warehouse there; the man's name is Meares, and the boy's name is Jem.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose servants they were? - A. Mr. Smith's, I believe, I have seen them at Mr. Smith's house a long while before, at Mount's Gateway, East Smithfield; I was present when they were examined before the Magistrate; it was weighed at the warehouse in Worcester-place, and there was about eighteen or nineteen hundred weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that warehouse situated? - A. Up about three stories, or there away, it was the third tier to the best of my knowledge; it was craned up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who assisted to get it into the warehouse? - A. Brandall, Allen, and myself, and Mr. Smith's man and boy.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Brandall? - A. A shoe-maker, and Allen is a waterman; after it was weighed, we came away; about a week afterwards Brandall received the money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any conversation with Mr. Smith respecting the money? - A. Never but once, I received eighteen shillings from him; I told him there was more money that that to come; and he told me Brandall had had a bottle or two of wine, and a ham of him, and he could not think of paying any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that eighteen shillings the balance of an account? - A. Yes; there were two pounds altogether left him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this hemp transaction? - A. Yes; and he gave me half-a-guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, and a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. You are a block-maker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Allen was a waterman, and Brandall a shoemaker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it that applied to you to go and rob upon the Thames? - A. Allen was the first.</p>
               <p>Q. That must have surprized you a good deal, a man of character, working at his business as a block maker; it must have been matter of great surprize to you? - A. He asked me if I was agreeable to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which, of course, you knocked him down for proposing such a thing to you, a man of character? - A. No, I went with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You hesitated, of course, and remonstrated with him, for proposing such a thing to a man of character? - (The witness hesitates).</p>
               <p>Q. You knocked him down, did not you? - A. It was not the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been once or twice before, by way of practice? - A. I have been here once before.</p>
               <p>Q. That may happen to any of us? - A. I was honourably acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, having been here once before, and honourably acquitted, you were particularly cautious of your character in future? - A. I was till within very lately.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately is it since you were honourably acquitted? - A. About eight years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a long spell of honesty indeed; how long did the sit of honesty last? - A. Till within these nine or ten months, when I got acquainted with Brandall.</p>

               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you only did this that you might be able to detect thieves and villains? - A. Not at all; I never meant to be a thief again, please God.</p>
               <p>Q. But the sit came on again, there was no resisting it, and being in the act of stealing upon the Thames, Brandall and Allen had the luck to get away, and you were lest, and they took you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many months had you been at your old courses, new revived, when that happened to you? - A. About nine or ten months.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know how that trade is carried on, do you make Saint Mondays, or every other night, or what? - A. I have been in the impress service.</p>
               <p>Q. But I am speaking of this voluntary service? - A. I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. So they took you in the very act of thieving? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080101"/>I was taken by a Marine Police-office boat, with some stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. With some stuff; that, in your language, means stolen goods, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They took you to the office, and there was no chance of your having the same luck again of being honourably acquitted? - A. I voluntarily acknowledged having been guilty.</p>
               <p>Q. Being taken in the boat with the stuff upon you, you voluntarily acknowledged your guilt, that was a great concession certainly; pray how many persons did you accuse, I will not quarrel with you for half a dozen, but how many persons before the Magistrate did you accase? - A. Five of six.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it you were honourable acquitted here for? - A. Robbing on the water.</p>
               <p>Q. You never practised in any other line? - A. Only my own trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Any thing is a man's trade that he takes to; I want to know whether you confined your practice to robberies upon the river? - A. No; I did not make a practice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You only made an amusement of it for nine months, three times a week? - A. Sometimes once a week.</p>
               <p>Q. According to the catch, I suppose; but you never practised in any other line of roguery? - A. What I was here for was, for robbing a gentleman in a boat.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a highway robbery upon the water, you never practised in any other way; is your name Robert? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never practised in any other line; you understand my question? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were never accused of any other offences but offences upon the water? - A. I do not remember any other.</p>
               <p>Q. An innocent man may be accused; but recollect if some person did not accuse you of going out of your regular beat of business upon the water, and breaking in upon other men's province? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a large acquaintance, a man may forget some of them; do you remember a gentleman of the name of Germaine? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he concerned with you in the robbery of the gentleman on the Thames? - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of him? - A. He is at sea.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is he now? - A. He is at sea.</p>
               <p>Q. An acquaintance of your's? - A. They were here with me.</p>
               <p>Q. He was tried for that robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person robbed? - A. I do not know the name now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he was? - A. No; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he an Excise officer? - A. He might be, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never charged with a footpad robbery upon the land? - A. I never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that positively? - A. Yes; I never was charged with one in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were taken up upon that occasion, you were honourably acquitted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not offer to turn evidence for the Crown, and was refused? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never applied to be a witness for the Crown? - A. This here, do you mean?</p>
               <p>Q. No, no; when you were tried in company with your friends, Germaine and Perry, for robbing the Excise officer? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the articles of which that man was robbed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a pocket handkerchief one? - A. I remember there was something about a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. You were honourably acquitted, and therefore I may ask you, whether you ever offered to any body a silk pocket handkerchief, which you described as being round the neck of the person when he was robbed? - A. No; I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know M'Call? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is an acquaintance of your's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about the Excise officer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never offered him any handkerchief? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you detained in custody at the Police office? - A. I have been there ten or eleven weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. And of course must remain in custody till these persons, who are to be tried, are disposed of, and you then expect to be discharged? - A. I cannot say; I do not expect any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you to be detained for afterwards? - A. I do not know, I am sure, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that ten or eleven weeks, how many times have you been examined? - A. I believe, four of five times.</p>
               <p>Q. How often has your examination been read over to you? - A. Not very often, about three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not very long? - A. Yes; there is a good deal of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it read over to you last? - A. I read it over myself about a week or two back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the last time? - A. I had it in my hand last night, just to look at it, but I had it not five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave it you last night? - A. Nobody; I took it as it lay on the dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. And knowing this cause was to be tried, you very naturally took it up to look it over? - A. I just looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your original examination, singed by the Magistrate, or a copy of it? - A. A copy.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made that copy? - A. I do not know; it was made and given to me.</p>

               <p>Q. You said just now, I desired her to go to an acquaintance of mine, that I know was an acquaintance of Mr. Smith to see if she could learn what he said about it; I did add, that I could make my escape if I would - now do you mean to repeat that you did not desire your wife so to do? - A. I told my wife not to let Mr. Smith know any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those gentlemen and tell me what your wife was to communicate to your friend, that you could escape if you would? - A. I had no inclination for going.</p>

No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no proposal at all about money? - A. No; my wife might say so; but I did not; I told my wife I did not mean to go.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the turnkeys of Newgate, under Mr. Kirby.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. She was every day in the prison, backwards and forwards, to a man that she called her husband: On the 25th of March I let her in; she had been there some little time, about half an hour, and went out to get some refreshment for the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when she came out? - A. As nigh as I can recollect, about one or two o'clock, and then she went out; she returned again in about twenty minutes; I was walking backwards and forwards in the passage, and I said to her, what have you been after; I thought she might have been out for spirits, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080106"/>Q. Was she within side the door of the prison at that time? - A. She was next the main yard, close to the main gate; I asked her what she had got; says I, give me the bottle that you have got.</p>
               <p>Q. Spirits are not allowed to capital convicts? - A. Nor to any other if we know it; she said she had none, and I put my hand down her side, and felt something in her pocket; then I took her into the tap-room and searched her, and in her pocket I found these things,(produces three spring saws, and four gimblets); then I said, you have got more things about you; I then felt her breast, and found something concealed down her bosom; then I sent for Mr. Kirby, and I saw these two chissels, and handles, taken from her bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Could these things assist a prisoner in making his escape? - A. The spring saws would cut any iron in the world, the setters, or the bars of the prison; and the chissels would break the walls for them to get out.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you at all consent, or give any approbation at all, for bringing such things in? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was perfectly without your consent or approbation? - A. Yes; when we found these things, we sent for Mrs. Sells, a woman in the place, to search her, and we withdrew.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of gimblets? - A. They would make holes in the door, one after another, round, and would take any panel out of a door, with a saw; the chissels are to force away the stone.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am keeper of his Majesty's jail of Newgate: Pitt called me into the jail, when I got into the jail he had found the saws and the gimblets, and he said there was something in her stays; we searched her, and pulled out the chissels, and the two handles; she said, she was sent out by a man with a bushy head; I knew by that she meant Harper, a man who is under sentence of death, and has a very bushy head; and she told me he had given her a paper, which she gave to me, (produces the paper, and is read); "three spring saws, four spike gimblets, two strong chissels, the saws with frames," and then there is a sketch of the saws. I can swear that it is Harper's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that Harper who is under sentence of death for personating a seaman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, had she your approbation at all in doing this act? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she further searched by any body while you were out of the room? - A. She was further searched by Mrs. Sells.</p>
               <p>Q. These things are proper to facilitate the escape of a prisoner? - A. Certainly they are. (Produces a keyhole saw).</p>
               <p>Q. How many turnkeys have you? - A. Pitt and Alport, no other to these doors.</p>
