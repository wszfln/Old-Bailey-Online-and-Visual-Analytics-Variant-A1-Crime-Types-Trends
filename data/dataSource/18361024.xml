                  </hi>. I live in Herefordshire. I took some heifers and sheep from Herefordshire into Essex, to sell, and on returning I came through Hanwell, on the 17th of October—I stopped at the Duke of York public-house—I took some refreshment—I could not get a con<lb/>veyance, and intended to sleep there, but the landlord said I could not—I went out to get a lodging—a person came out of the Duke of York after me, dressed in a flannel jacket—he said, "Old man. I can find you a lodging"—I walked a short distance with him, and then two others joined us—I had not got above twenty yards from Hanwell when they joined us, and said they were going the some way, and we all waked together—they took me over some fields and there was a hedge or two—they took me to a hay-rick—I could not see any public road there nor any foot-path part of the way—when we got to the hay-rick one of them seized me by the throat, and pinned me to the ground while the other two rifled my pockets—I had four half-crowns about three or four shillings in silver, and two or three sixpences, which they took, and four cotton handkerchief, and a bunch of about six keys out of my pocket—the prisoner was in the public-house when I left it—he was dressed in a flannel jacket—it was about nine o'clock when I left the public-house—it was rather a dark foggy night—there was no moon, that I could observe—it was very dark—the prisoner is the same height as the man that was in room—I have not the least doubt in my own mind he is the same person who came out of the house after me—I heard his voice in the room, but had no conversation with him—I am positive he is the man who was in the room, I have not the least doubt that he is the man who robbed me—they attempted to take my boots off, and strip me of my clothes—I begged and prayed of them not to take my clothes off—they were in the act of doing it—they were pulling to take my boots, and had hold of the handkerchief which was round my neck—they desisted when I desired them, and threatened, as they left me, that they would kill me if I make noise—I heard one of them say so—I cannot say which it was—they left me, and I remained</p>

               <p>there till day-light, as I did not know which way to get away—they said, if I did not remain there they would kill me—I was not it all acquainted with the road or the country.</p>

                  </hi>. I am horse-patrol of Hanwell. The prosecutor came to me on Tuesday morning, the 18th of October, about o'clock, and gave me a description of the things he had lost—he told me one of the parties who robbed him, had a flannel jacket, and the others were in dark clothes—he described where he had been robbed, and I went to inquire at the Duke of York what parties had been there that night—Hanwell is a large parish—it extends more than a mile round the Duke of York—in consequence of information, I took the prosecutor on to the rail-road, where people were at work, and told him to keep at a regular distance from me, and I would point our different men, who I though were concerned in it—I lost for a time, and then sent my partner after him, and I put myself in possession of the prisoner till he came there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that in consequence of the prosecutor's description? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he had given me an account of his having a flannel jacket on, and by speaking to the landlord, I got possession of the prisoner at work on the rail-road, and went for the prosecutor—as soon as the prisoner saw him, he walked away from his work—he walked between the arches of the rail-road, and kept a little distance till I saw him out of sight—I then walked a little distance, and saw him on his hands and knees, between the tiers—thirty or forty yards from where he was at work—I followed after him, collared him, and brought him back to when I had seen him on his hands and knees—my partner came up, and I told him to go and look in the gravel in that part, and he found four pocket-handkerchiefs and a collar there—I asked the prosecutor if he knew them—he said, yes, they were his, he could swear to them—I then searched the prisoner, and found a box and knife which the prosecutor has sworn to as his own.</p>

On Saturday, the 24th of September, I went to No. 2, and attempted to get in with the usual key that I have always been accustomed to use in opening the door—I put the key into the lower lock, and found it in a very different state to what I had left it in a few before when I came out' I had double-clocked the door—when I put the key in I found it on the single lock—I pushed against the door, and made a considerable noise—I conclude the holt at the top of the door was fastened inside—I immediately suspected some person were inside the house—I requested my eldest son, who was with me, to go to his house, which was nearly opposite, to got the keys of No. 3, to get over the back premises, and see what was going on—the went, and returned in a minutes or two, as he was approaching with the keys—I saw White come out of No. 3, and as he was passing the down the loser stop of the door, I took hold of him by the arm—he was going up the street, towards Trinity-square—I said, "My good Sir, what have you been about in this house?"—he said, "Nothing, I have not been in the house at all, I was only passing"—I said, "You must stop till I have better proof of that," and just at that moment four or five person gathered round the door—one of them said, "There is another man come out of the other house"—that turned out to be Poole—I immediately turned round and took hold of him—he said, "What are you going to do with me?"—I said, "You have been in that house, I must know what you have been about"—he said, "I have been passing down the street"—I said, "that is impossible"—on that a young woman came over, and said, "Mr. Hill, I saw that man come out of the house the day before yesterday, with a large copper on his shoulder, containing a considerable quantity of lend"—I then sent for an officer and gave them in charge—he took them to the station-house—I then opened the door, which I could not do before, with the same keys—I went into the back kitchen of No.2, and saw it in a deplorable state—I found the brick-work, which contained the copper, broken the cop<lb/>per gone, and the lead-work in the sink was loosened all round, ready to be moved—a pump was also removed and a large pipe, which supplied the cistern with water, turned up to remove, and lead—I then went to the station-house, and they searched the prisoner—I went back to the house—the officers soon followed—we examined, and found the box staple of the lock of No. 2 broken—we went into the kitchen, and found things as I have represented—we went up stairs, and found a brass lamp taken from</p>

The prisoner was employed to work in his warehouse—on the 22nd of July, I missed a pair of stays, and two pairs before then—I accused the prisoner—she positively denied it—these stays are the property of Mr. Bord—I give the stays out to the work-people—I know these by the manner of making—the prisoner made this pair—they were never trimmed—we give them to two people to make—these stays were made for a particular order, and then we could not find them.</p>

On the 4th of October, the prisoners, Brown and King, came to the shop—King asked to look at some prints—I took them to the top of the shop, and they looked at eight or ten, and selected one, and wished me to put it by for them, as they had not sufficient money to pay for it—they were about twenty minutes in the shop—they said they would pay off 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and they would call on the following Saturday and pay the re<lb/>mainder—I put that one by, and while I went to fetch the paper and get change for a shilling they gave me, I suppose they stole the other print—I did not miss any thing till the policeman came, about eight o'clock in the evening, and produced this print—I had shown it to them, and I think they all had it in their hands.</p>

On Sunday, the 9th of October, about a quarter to five o'clock, Scott came and told me to look at my turkey—I found two were missing—they had been in an enclosed field, a quarter of a mile from the house—my husband accompanied Scott, and the two turkeys were brought home dead—I knew them to be ours—the prisoner was taken up instantly—he lived about two miles off—he keeps a donkey, and goes about with sand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and live in Black<lb/>smiths' Arms-place, Back-church-lane, in the parish of St. George East. David Stanhouse, a seaman, lodged with me about three weeks—on the 10th of October we all left the house—my wife left last—I went to the King Harry, in Red Lion-street, Whitechapel, between seven and eight o'clock—my wife came there to me in about an hour—Stanhouse was with me—my wife remained with me till eleven or twelve o'clock, and we went home together—Stanhouse went away before us, and did not sleep at the house that night—when we went back to the house I asked my wife to give me the key to open the street door—I unlocked, and found it a usual—I went up stains to the middle room, on the first floor—that was about twelve o'clock or near upon one—I found door forced open—it was the room I used to live in—I came down stairs again—I found the box of the door was forced open, and a large screw on the bottom of the box<lb/>staple forced out—the lock had been slipped back, as if it was unlock—there was a latch to the door—no injury was done to that—I did not miss any thing night—I got up just before eight o'clock next morn<lb/>ing, and went out—I came, in about half an hour, and went up stairs and in consequence of what my little boy said, I went to the closet, and found a trunk which had been in the cupboard, put out into the room and broken open—there was no lock on the closet—the trunk belonged to Stanhouse—it had been given to him my daughter, and he had the key of it—the prisoner was at the public-house when I went there—he left shortly after my wife came—I think that must have been after nine o'clock—the pri<lb/>soner did not lodge at my house—he used to come now and then or in<lb/>quite for my son, but he did not live there, and had no business their—he came back again to the public-house—he was absent about hour and a half—the public-house is not half a mile from mine—I went out next morning, about half-past ten o'clock, and looked for a policeman, having suspicion of the prisoner—I told the policeman of the circumstance, and he went and found the prisoner and brought him to me before eleven o'clock—I asked him if he knew any thing at all about David's box being broken open—he said no, he knew nothing at all about it—I said, You had better own it, it will he better for you"—it was not a spring lock on the room door—it was to the house door—I suspected he had got in the back way, as there was a pane of glass broken in the door at the back of the house—it broken before I left the house—there is a bolt inside, and by putting an arm through the window you can unbolt the door—I did not notice whether that door was bolted or not when I left the house—it was open when I came back—there was no lock to it, only a latch—it was shut to—there was only bolt to it—my wife is not here.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ—it was his duty to make sales—he was a confidential servant—I purchased about fifty dozen of French gloves, and on the 5th of September I directed him to force some sales, and ten dozen boxes of 120 pairs were taken by him to Sewell Cross, at knight-bridge, to office them to Mr. Pontez, the glove-buyer there, and particularly to say that I could allow but 1 1/2 per cent on those French gloves—I mean discount, our usual allowance, for our own manufacture, is 2 1/2 per cent—the following day he told he had made the dale of ten dozen, and I par<lb/>ticularly questioned him if he had told Mr. Pontez that he was only to have 1 1/4 per cent a dozen allowed on the goods—he told me he had, and</p>

The property stolen was as order, part of which was only put up—the two hams and pickles were sent in to be packed with our goods—they had been packed, I should say, three days—we lost them on Saturday evening, the 1st of October—the parcel was directed to M'Cleod, Esq.—they were packed in a cask—I saw it last a five o'clock that Saturday evening—I did not observe this till Lee the officer told me of it on Monday morning—I afterwards saw it at Lambeth-street office—I gave a list of the contents to the officer, who emptied the cask in my presence—it was all correct, with the exception of one bottle of pickles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. A person came to the office about eight o'clock on the evening of the 1st of October; and from information I went to the house No. 5, Old Montague-street, Whitechapel, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, in company with Shelswell—we knocked at the door—it was opened by the female prisoner, who said her name was Dale—we went into the room in the lower part of the house, and the prisoner Dale was sitting by the fire—there was a cask full of straw, in the corner of the room, and on the floor were a number of bottles, and eleven tin cases containing salmon and other things—I found the articles stated in the indictment, standing on the floor, unpacked—I asked Dale if the cask and the contents belonged to him—he said no; and he was not at home when the cask was brought in the cart—he wished me to ask a person of the name of Telley, up stairs, if he was at home, who, he said, would prove that he was not at home—I went on the stairs and called to Telley—he was in bed—I asked if he knew any thing of Dale being at home—he said he know nothing about Dale or the cart either—a woman came out of Telley's room into Dale's and he said to her, "You know I was not at home when the cask came"—she said she could not say any thing about it, she did not know whether he was at home or not—Giles then said the cask had been brought there about an hour before, by a young man in a cart, and he said he would call for it again when he had</p>

               <p>put his horse and cart up—I asked her if she knew where he lived—she said no, she did not—I then asked if she knew his name—after some hesitation she said his name was Church—I then asked Dale if he knew who the man was—he said he knew him—I asked him who the man was work<lb/>ing for that day—he said he did not know, but he was working on the Friday for a Mr. Mephan—by the side of a cask was a hammer and chisel, by the window-ledge—Dale said they belonged to him—and there was a broken hoop in the corner of the room, which appeared to have come off the cask—there was part of the top of the cask in the room, partly burnt, and some wood was on the fire, burning, which appeared similar to this—this is one part of the top—Shelswell had taken Dale to the station-house at Spitalfields—he was gone about half an hour, and returned with Dale, as they would not take him in—just at the time the door was opened, Church came and stood by the door of the room—I asked him what his name was,—he said, "Church"—I told him I had been waiting for him some time, and asked if he knew any thing about the cask in the room—he said, what was that to me? and was rather unruly—I told him I believed it had been stolen, and asked where he brought it from—he said from Mincing-lane—he said a man had met him in Tower-street, or Tower-hill, (I do not recollect which,) and told him to bring it to this house, but I forgot to mention that—I asked Giles who unpacked the cask, before Church came in—the said, "The young man that left it took the things out, and the top was loose"—that was while Shelswell was gone with Dale to the station-house—I found a book in Dale's drawer with the name of Church in it—it is mentioned in the depositions—I showed the came property to Mr. Kilner.</p>

On the 5th of October, about twenty minutes to eight o'clock, I was sitting down in the kitchen, and heard a noise in the passage—I looked round, and saw the parlour door was fastened, and the key hanging up—we have a private drop<lb/>bolt to the parlour door, which we pull up by a wire—I saw that was down. and felt satisfied all was right, but in about three minutes more, I head a dreadful noise up stairs in the passage—I took the candle off the table, and ran up stairs, and I saw the prisoner go from between the parlour door and the street door as I got to the top of the kitchen stairs—the parlour door was open—the prisoner ran into the street and shut the door in my face—I opened it and ran after him—I was not above a yard or so behind him when he shut it—I followed him, calling out, "Stop thief," and he was pursued by Wood, a policeman, and stopped—before I heard the noise Henry Hendley came to the street door, and brought me home three pinafores—when he went away the door was shut—before I could get out of the kitchen to open the door to Hendley I heard somebody go out and shut the door after them—I did not say any thing to Hendley—I took the pinafores and went down stairs again, and directly afterwards heard this noise—the parlour door was shut when I was up stairs to Hendley, for I put my hand against it—I had no light—it was locked with a key, and an inside, drop-bolt—a wire leads from that bolt into the kitchen—by pulling the wire up, if the bolt is down, you can get into the parlour—the street door opens by a latch-key—when I followed the prisoner he turned the corner of Foley-street into great Ogle-street, and then turned the corner of Marylebone-street—I there lost sight of him—he was brought back by the constable in about ten minutes—I had never seen him before to my knowledge—I knew him to be the same man I saw got out of the street door—I went into the parlour—it had been opened—I did not miss any thing from there—the bolt was broken off the door—there were eleven impressions of a crow-bar on the door and post—I am sure I latched the street door after I took the pinafores from Hendley—I was the last person who had been in the parlour before that—I am sure I locked it—a skeleton key was pro<lb/>duced by the policeman, which I tried to the parlour door, by the Magis<lb/>trate's order, and it opened it—it would not open the street door—I lost nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-maid in the service of Messrs. John and James Tullock, of Montague-place. The prisoner entered their ser<lb/>vice on the 8th of March last as footman—he had the care of the plate, which was kept in the pantry—I was in the pantry on Sunday, the 18th of September, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the pri<lb/>soner was there also—I saw every thing as usual—I cannot swear that it was all there—I saw some of the plate there—I saw three waiters—there were four, but I cannot say I saw more than three that evening—and I saw the tea-pot and milk-pot—some part of it was on the dresser—the tea-pot and milk-pot went up for tea at nine o'clock—I remained in the pantry a few minutes—the prisoner went out once that evening between seven and eight o'clock—I think that was the time, but I am not positive—it was before I was in the pantry—he staid out about half an hour—I supped with him that night between nine and ten o'clock, and I saw him at eleven o'clock—he slept in his pantry—next morning I went to call him to breakfast, at about a quarter after eight o'clock—I called him, and not re<lb/>ceiving any answer, I went into the pantry, and discovered that he was gone, and all the plate—the plate-basket was out of its usual place, the lid open, and no plate in it—it was the prisoner's duty to shut the house up—I believe he did so that night, but I cannot say—he was the last of the servants up on Sunday night—I missed a small wicker basket or hamper which had been in the passage down stairs, it had a small handle to it—I informed my master—I had heard the prisoner take up my master's water as usual, at about seven o'clock on the Monday morning.</p>

The two prisoners came to my shop on Monday morning the 26th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock—Castanos asked to see some seals—I showed him a tray containing forty or fifty—they were there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, but bought none—I have since missed three seals—two of those produced are mine—one I can swear to most positively—I sold no seals at all between the time of their calling and my seeing the seals—I am certain I had sold them to any body.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Sunbury. The prisoner was in my employ for a long time as carter—on the 6th of October I sent him with a cart of straw to Fulham—the cart left my premises about two o'clock in the morning—I followed him till it came to the Castle at Isleworth—there I saw him put down a truss of straw—I got there a little before five o'clock—I had followed him all the way, sometimes on my pony and sometimes on foot—he pursued his journey—I waited some time to see if any one came to take it—there was no one up—I then went to Brentford; after a policeman—they would not come off their beat—I came back and saw the straw in the same place, at the yard where I left it—I took off the band of it, and put it into my pocket—I then went to Hounslow, called up a constable, and took him to the place, and the straw was gone—I called the ostler, and asked him to give my horse a feed of corn—I went into the stable and saw the straw there—I said to him, "You have only got one</p>

I went to Hall's about half-past twelve o'clock on Monday night or Tuesday morning—I found him in the room—I asked if his name was Robert Hall—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if a female had been delivered of a child—he said, "Yes"—I asked him what had been done with it—he said he had put it away—I told him I apprehended him on the charge of putting away this child—I believe I said for concealing the birth of it—he seemed surprised—he said, turning to the female, "The officers are here, they are come for me"—the female was in bed in out cornet of the room—I told him he had better put his shoes on, and come with me, and he was conveyed to the watch-house, before the Lord Mayor, and to Giltspur-street—on our way to the Compter, I asked him what induced him to do it—he said well, he believed the child was dead when he took it down—in fact, he said, he had put another child away—I did not tell him it would be better for him to say any thing—I asked if the child was alive, he said he believed it was dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you not asked him in the room when the child was brought forth? and did not he tell you he believed about four o'clock?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he said he saw no appearance of life in the child—he begged, when we took him, that every care might be taken of the woman, and he was told there should be—the room was a miserable, wretched, poverty-stricken hole—the woman had only a pallet in one corner—no bedstead, and scarely any clothing, and, I should any, nothing to eat or drink—I think there might be a chair, but it was as much as there was—the window frames were filled up with paper, and they were altogether in the most abject state of misery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Bishopsgate-street—I have been in practice twenty years. On the 10th of October, about half-past one o'clock in the afternoon, I went to No. 2, Sweet-apple-court, and examined the female prisoner—she was in bed—I found her to have been recently delivered—I inquired what had become of the infant—she informed, me it had been out away—I then asked her if it was alive, and she told me it was—I desired her to be cautious, and asked her how she knew it was alive—she said she had heard it cry—I made no further inquiry respecting the child, but attended to the state of her health—she appeared in a state of great wretchedness—I saw the body of the child the next day at the workhouse—its appearance was that of a child at the full time—it was plump and well formed, with hair on its head, and its nails perfect—the naval string was not shrunk—it was not secured—it had not been divided—the cord remained united to the after-birth—no ligature had been</p>

               <p>put upon it—it all came together—I examined the lungs—they appeared of fill the cavity of the chest—they appeared to have been extended and inflated with air, and were of a bright red appearance—that indicates that the lungs must have been in contact with oxygen or atmospheric air, and that blood must have circulated, that the child must have been alive—a child may cease to respire without any violence offered to it—I have known a child die very soon after birth, although come to full maturity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When a woman has no assistance, may it not happen a child may be suffocated and smothered in the mess in which it is born with? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I con<lb/>ceive it may very easily happen, without any intention of the kind—it does not necessarily follow that because it comes to full birth and is perfect, and is heard to cry, that it must have died of violence—I conceive it is possible a child may cry when first put forth, and still be dead before delivery is complete—children very frequently cry as soon as the head is protruded—it takes two or three pains generally before the delivery is complete, and it might be suffocated before those pains are over—my opinion is the child died from suffocation, but whether at the birth or from the soil I cannot say—it might be either. (Here the witness detailed several circumstances under which the child might be heard to cry, yet not be completely born alive, and other circumstances under which it might die immediately after its birth.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If it should turn out that this was the first, child of the woman, all these circumstances would become more probable from her ignorance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Much more probable—I considered her a woman of very dull mind, not possessing much information—I think it very probable death might have arisen from suffocation in the way suggested—I think is very likely the discharge might produce death, she being without assistance, in the state of mind and body in which she was—for some hours after, women are generally in a very great state of exhaustion and helplessness—many of them are incapable of moving at all, being in a very exhausted state, especially of body, and if the mind be dull, it would he more likely to in<lb/>capacitate it then if it was acute—I never saw two persons in a more wretched state, and I have seen a great deal of misery in London—I did not see a pan there—I beg to state there were no external marks of violence on the child.</p>

I slept at home on Sunday night, in the same bed with the two prisoners and my younger brother—the prisoner got up in the night two or three times to use the pan—after she had used it the last time my father took it down stairs almost directly—I did not hear any child cry—there was a rush-light in the room.</p>

                  </hi>, I live at Camden Town. On Wednesday, the 5th of October, I was at work at the top of No, 4, Molesworth-place, Kentish Town—I saw the prisoner and another boy drive the ducks into the carcase of a house, and put them into a bag, at the back of Jeffries-street—they were afterwards claimed by the prosecutors—two woman were standing at the corner of the street, who, I think, had something to so with it.</p>

I was on duty in Kentish Town about twenty minutes after eleven o'clock in the morning, and the prisoner was given into custody, charged by Gillingham with stealing five ducks, which he had in a small bag—I took him to the station-house—he said a man employed him to drive the ducks into an empty house, and promised to give him a penny—I found a halfpenny on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an established labourer in Saint Katha<lb/>rine's Dock, in the tea warehouse, letter C. On the 10th of October I was on the fourth floor—I saw the prisoner on the floor, and, believe that he had no business there, I watched him, and saw him go round some chests that were lying on the floor, for people to examine—I saw him sit down, take off his hat, and put tea into a yellow silk handkerchief in his hat, three several times—I waited till he returned to the staircase, and then rushed out from where I had concealed myself, and seized him—we struggled—I called for assistance, and the prisoner with his left hand, took his hat of, and scattered the tea on the floor—I was thrown against a pile of goods but I never lost hold of him till the arrival of the superintendent, into whose hands I gave him—it is a customary things for people who are entitled to it, to take a little tea for a sample, but they must have an order—he was not entitled to do it without an order.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased in the hospital—he came there on the Thursday morning, about a quarter to eleven o'clock, the day after the fight—I found him in an insensible state, evi<lb/>dently labouring under compression of the brain—we were aware it arose from violence, from the statement made at the time, and seeing external marks of violence—he had a black eye—the pupils were dilated, but they contracted a little to the light—I am perfectly satisfied there was injury of the brain—we made incisions to ascertain if we could detect any fracture—he rallied during the time we bled him—we bled him largely, and it re<lb/>lieved him—he would try to speak, but we never could get any thing dis<lb/>tinct from him—he at last became as bad as ever, he had paralysis at Friday, and died on Saturday—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—there was a fissure on the right side of the skull, extending not very far—it was at the anterior angle where he had fallen—we took off the scalp and opened the skull, and on the left side, the opposite side to the fracturs there was an extensive laceration of the left hemisphere of the brain—there was an effusion of blood on and beneath the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>—I have no doubt his death was caused by some injury he had received—a heavy fell on a pavement would account for the injury of the skull—it might pro<lb/>bably be worse if the man was drunk than if sober—I am clearly of opi<lb/>nion</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the deceased and Watkins outside the public-house, on the morning in question—I cannot say which came out first, for five or six, or perhaps more, came out together, and I saw them collected about the door—I did not see either of them come out—when I first observed them together, they both appeared in a sort of spar<lb/>ring attitude, with open hands—they were not three yards from the door—I observed two persons backing the prisoner, urging him on to fight; and one supported Gaywood—after a little sparring they commenced fighting with doubled fists—Gaywood clenched his fist for about two rounds—they had a regular fight—Gaywood had the worst of it—after about two rounds. they made a sort of stand-still, and the deceased was in a state of stupor, not able to speak, and stood with his arms alongside him, supported by a man who was holding him up to be struck—he could neither speak, stand, nor walk—they stood for a minutes or two in that state, when the two per<lb/>sons who were backing the prisoner urged him, on to strike Gaywood again, and he did strike him a blow—the deceased did not raise his hand—he had not power—the prisoner struck him a severe blow on the temple, and he fell backwards lifeless on the pavement, his coming on the pavement with a very severe concussion.</p>

On the 9th of October, I was going with my brother and Mr. Freeman towards Smithfield—when we got out of the coach, the coachman observed that that was the Swan, pointing to a public-house, which I believe was the Bull—we asked a person, who appeared to be a lad who attends to water the horses, and he directed us further on to a house with a light—we went on, and arrived at the public-house, and saw two woman standing, off the stones—we asked them where the White Swan was—they gave as indecent answer—I heard Freeman say, "You may as well be civil"—I turned my head for the purpose of finding the place, and I received a blow in the face from one of the woman—I said to her, "You had better mind how you behave yourself, or I will give you in custody"—I was immedi<lb/>ately knocked down by a blow from behind, before I had scarcely finished the words—I did not see the person who struck me—I had an umbrella with me—after I was knocked down in the first instance, I endeavoured to get up, but as often as I did so, I was knocked down—I defended myself with my umbrella, which was torn from my hand, and I did not find it again—I did not see the prisoners, not to recognise them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a milkman, and live in Great Harcourt-street, St. Marylebone. On Sunday, the 25th of September, I had a quantity of cows in Hyde Park—on going there early on Monday morning, I found one of them dead—I went to Abbott, a butcher in Newport-market, and gave him directions to fetch the cow away—in consequence of information,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183610240115"/>
               <p>the same morning, I went to the prisoner's residence, near Cow-cross—he is a slaughterman—I saw him standing, in his shirt-sleeves—I asked him if he had a cow come into his slaughter-house that morning—he told me he had—I saw my cow lying in the slaughter-house, stuck and bleeding—I told him it was my property, and cost me nineteen guineas, and should be glad to take it away, that I had Abbott's cart outside, and would take it away—he said I should not have it away, it was not my property—I told him it was, and I would make him remember it—Mr. Legg and him too—he had said it was Mr. Legg's property—he said he would get her hide dressed in about twenty minutes—I stood by while he dressed it—Legg is the gatekeeper at Hyde-park—he keeps cows—I had not given Legg authority to send the cow to any body except Abbott—one of the slaughtermen said, "Halloo, here is something amiss here, look down here"—I looked down, and at the back part of the elbow of the cow there was a very great bruise near the heart—I had not observed any bruise on it when I saw it dead at first, nor when I saw it in the park—I saw the prisoner again, a fortnight afterwards—I asked him to go to Hatton-garden with me, and he said he had some very particular busi<lb/>ness, much more particular than mine was—I said, "When will you go"—he said, "Wait till three o'clock, and I will go with you"—I went down about ten minutes before three o'clock, and said, "Will you go now to Hatton-garden with me?"—he told me no, he would not go with me any where—he told me I might go, that he had paid Mr. Legg for the cow, and the skin was marked in Mr. Legg's own name—he then said, "Go away, I don't care for you; why will you not keep the law on me?—I had put it into an attorney's hands, but he did not care for the attorneys nor me either—I saw him afterwards, at Marylebone-street—the Magistrate issued a summons, and he said he would not attend to it.</p>

I saw the prisoner give her the shillings—I took it to Mrs. Gates at the corner, and she gave me six penny pieces and a sixpence—she laid the money down, and I laid the shilling down—I told her to jink it, to see that it was good, as I thought it was bad, as the sixpence she laid down did not correspond in colour with the shilling—she jinked the two, and I said, "I do not think it is good, give it to me"—I bit it, and said, "It it bad"—I went and got Eusam, the policeman gave him the shilling, and took him to my mother's where the prisoner was.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Bedford-street, and have one partner—I am a gold and silver-lace manufacturer. The prisoner came to our ware-house before the 19th of September and wrote a note, stating, that if the executors of Mr. Nash would apply to Mr. Williams, an attorney at Lin<lb/>coln, they would obtain a settlement of their accounts—(Mr. Nash had formerly lived where I do)—he came again, and I asked how business was at Lincoln—he asked how business was at London—he said, as re<lb/>garding himself, he was rather busy—that he did the greatest part of the names as a draper—he did the most respectable business, being the most respectably connected—and said, he wondered we did not travel there—I said, we had done so—he said he dealt where he pleased, and I asked him if he would be disposed to deal with us—he said he did not know, he did not think it would answer his purpose—he accordingly went away—he stated he was dealing with other houses, and had no wish to change—on the 19th of September he made his appearance again, at about seven o'clock in the evening, and stated he had orders on his memorandum-book, for gold and silver lace, to supply Sir John Byng with laces to appear at Doncaster races, and he must have it—his manner was rather hasty—we endeavoured to put him of, saying we had not got the right patterns—which we had not—he said he must have the nearest we had to them—and he required us to be hasty about them, as it was near mail time; and if he did not and them that evening, it would be of no use—he accordingly chose some other patterns, which he said he thought would do very well—when they were ready, he said, "I shall now sleep comfortably, as I am certain I can got them off by the mail"—he said he had not got the whole of Sir John's custom, but he had no doubt he had no doubt he should get it all—we let him have seven hat-bands, and four yards and a half of silver-gilt vellum, believing he was in business in Lincoln—we then came to speak about the payment—he had said not a word about that—he said, "I have very little time to get these off, but I think I shall, and I shall call in a day or two, as I have other memorandums, and you will see what you can do with them"—we let him go—and, in consequence of my saying I wondered it this was all true, my assistant left the shop to go after him—the prisoner came again a few days afterwards, and agreed to take more lace, and said he</p>

I saw the prisoner, on the 27th of Octo<lb/>ber, go out of the passage—I followed him, and he dropped this bundle, containing these things, which are my master's—a young man took him to the station-house, and the officer fetched me.</p>
