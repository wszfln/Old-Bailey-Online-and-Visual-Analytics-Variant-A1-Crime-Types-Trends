I happened to be passing by my own door the 30th of July, about 5 in the evening, and saw the prisoner going by with a bundle: about 200 yards from Mr. White's house a young woman came running, and said the house was robbed, and cried out, Stop thief; and the prisoner threw down this bundle, and run. These things (which the prosecutor claimed) were wrapt up in this coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the coat?</p>
               <p>Bromley . 'Tis like it.</p>
               <p>Mr. White's Servant. About a quarter of an hour after five I had almost cleaned my house; I heard the street door clap; I opened the door, and saw a man running along with these things, and I went and called out, Thieves. The prisoner was stopt, and he said he knew nothing of the matter; but he was seen by Mr. Bromley to drop them.</p>
               <p>Bright Wilmott . There was a person that cried out, Stop thief, and I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Wilmott . No; he was running as fast as he could, and cried out Stop thief, himself.</p>
               <p>Q. So there was no-body before him.</p>
               <p>Wilmott . No; he was the first man himself, and I was the second after him.</p>

               <p>William Austin. On the 30th of August last, between 1 and 2 in the morning, I heard a noise, and it being moon-light, I went to sleep again, and slept about an hour and an half, and then I got up, and found my house was broke open, and the chamber-window up one pair of stairs open, and this knife lying by it, and a pane of glass was taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there shutters to this window?</p>
               <p>Austin. No; and the next day there was 19 yards of velvet missing; there was more than 19 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does it belong to?</p>

            . Last Monday was sevennight, about 1 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner called me up, and asked me if I would take a walk along with him; and we went to Mr. Austin's house in Vine-court Spittle Fields. He said he had given a man a pot of beer, but he could pay himself for it; so I agreed to go along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what he was to do?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Yes; and he said he could not do without a ladder; but I lent him a hand, and helped him up, and he took a knife out of his pocket, and took out a pane of glass, and went in at the window. This is the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay there?</p>
               <p>Lewis. About 10 minutes, and brought a bundle to the window, and threw it into my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it?</p>
               <p>Lewis. It was rolled up; I felt of it, and found it to be velvet, and then he jumped down, and we both went away to a young woman's house in Golden-lane and about 9 o'clock we carried it to the house of one Life Chitty, a Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave it there?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Yes; he laid it upon the bed, and asked him 7 s. a yard for it; and the Jew told him he asked too much money for it; and a person came and took the velvet before the money was brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does this Jew live?</p>
               <p>Lewis. He lives in Gravel-lane in Houndsditch. A person came into a house there, and asked whether

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174809070005"/>Q. What made you suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Taylor . Because he and another man, who is now in prison for the murder of a man, came into my shop, and bought several things, and pretended they could speak no English; and I was forced to shew them in Portugal money what the things were worth.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they buy?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Sometimes silver buckles, and sometimes other things. They asked for something, and I shewed them 12 guineas, as the price of the goods, and they put their hands among them, and mixed them . They came again the next day, and my man charged them with it, and they said they belonged to the Tripoli ambassador; but when I went to the ambassador's house, they knew nothing of them: and I charged the man at the bar with stealing the 2 guineas, and he took me aside, and said he would give me the 2 guineas. I said I did what I did for the sake of Justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner . You say you produced 12 guineas, and that the prisoner and the other man mixed their hands among the money; but you cannot say the prisoner took it.</p>
               <p>Taylor. This man was the nearest to me, and I believe he had the money; for the prisoner finger'd the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other touch it?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brugar. I am servant to Mr. Taylor. The prisoner was in the shop at the time Mr. Taylor said he pulled out 12 guineas, and another man was along with him. I don't know how many guineas there were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desire he may be asked whether I had not money upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Brugar. He had money of his own upon the counter, but I did not think of that before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure whether it was Mr. Taylor's money, or not, that he finger'd?</p>
               <p>Brugar. Upon my word I cannot be sure.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you give him for it?</p>
               <p>Courtman . I gave him the full value, and more. I think it was 5 s. 3 d. and he said he would come again. On the Monday he came again, and I not being at home, my wife bid him come again. He came on the Tuesday, and brought some more; I asked him how he came by them; he said he made up brushes for himself: I told him, if he would bring any body to prove them to be his property, he should have the money for them; and on Wednesday he brought a woman, who said they were his property: I said, these are stolen, and I know them to be so; and then they both fell down on their knees, and he said he had stole them from his master, one Mr. Lyon, in Crooked-lane: but I found that it was not so, but that he stole them from Mr. Pickle.</p>
               <p>William. When I took the prisoner, he told me they were his master Mr. Pickle's hairs, and that he took them out of his shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any money on the 23d of August?</p>
               <p>Pearce . I lost two 36 s. pieces, a moidore, and a half moidore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any guineas?</p>
               <p>Pearce. I had a great many guineas, but I am certain to 8 guineas, and 12 or 14 half guineas, that I lost: my wife miss'd the money, and that night the prisoner was brought home in a chair, very drunk.</p>
               <p>Pris. Counc. Did you see the prisoner offer your wife any money?</p>
               <p>Pearce. I was busy, and did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think any thing of that being your money?</p>
               <p>Pearce. I did not suspect it at that time; and my wife was persuaded to get more money from him, in order to keep it for him; but he was very obstinate , and would not part with any. My wife seeing him have so much money, said she was afraid the cobler had robb'd us; and I found I was robbed, and got a warrant to take him up on suspicion on the Tuesday, and carried him before a justice; and he was very rude and faucy to the justice; and on the Friday following he was ask'd how he came by the money, and he said, where's the letter the constable took from me when he took the money? And the constable said, he did not take any letter or paper from him. He was asked again how he came by the money. At first he said he had it sent him for the use of his sister, and afterwards he said, how do you know but I earn'd it? for I have got 6 s. a day in my stall. My wife said, the more rogue you, that you did not pay your way as you went. I never before saw him master of a guinea in my life; and he said before he would say any more, he would do thus [making a motion with his hand, as if he would be hang'd if he did] and his sister brought my wife half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. Where was it you kept this money?</p>
               <p>Pearce. It was in a chest of drawers in the room where we lay, and the drawers were lock'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark your money?</p>
               <p>Pearce. No; I never mark any money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner give a moidore to your wife, in order to keep it for him, after he had paid the rent?</p>
               <p>Pearce. He did not know whether he had given it to her, or not; and he did not know it the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not he bear a good character in the neighbourhood?</p>
               <p>Pearce. His neighbours will give him a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character , to your knowledge ?</p>
               <p>Pearce. He will stick to his work sometimes , and sometimes he will run out, and lie out o'nights.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pearce. The day I was robb'd, in the morning, I put two 36 s. pieces, and other money, into a purse; the whole was 20 l. and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there when the prisoner was brought home?</p>
               <p>Pearce. Yes; and he had a great deal of gold and silver. I ask'd him for my money, and he put his hand in his pocket, and gave me a guinea; and I robb'd the guinea off, and said there was 14 s. 3 d. halfpenny remaining; and he put his hand in his pocket, and gave me a 27 s. piece, and afterwards he gave me a guinea more, for he had forgot that he had given me the moidore. I went up to look for the money, and the purse and all was gone. I said to my husband , I am afraid the cobler has robb'd us; because he had not a farthing in the morning, and was so flush of money then: he said, God forbid; and we went up, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say, with respect to how he came by the money?</p>
               <p>Pearce. He said a staymaker brought his sister 12 l. out of Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any more?</p>
               <p>Pearce. He said he would hang before he did: and he said afterwards, how do you know but what I earn'd it? for he had got 6 s. a day in the place. And I said, the more shame for you, not to pay your debts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lyne (Constable .) Mrs. Pearce came to me, and begg'd I would go with her to take up the prisoner, which I did; and I search'd him, and found in his breeches a 36 s. piece , 1 guinea, 3 half guineas, and some silver. I examined his thighs, and felt a bunch; and I opened the knees of his breeches, and cut a hole, and took some money out which was sewed up; and I cut open another part of his breeches, and took money out of that. I ask'd him how he came by the money, and he bid me set down a person's name, and that person could tell me how he came by the money; but he said the man was a stranger, and just come out of Ireland, and he could not find him: and he said, the letter that I took from him would give an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174809070007"/> account how he came by the money, and that the money was sent to his sister ; but I did not take any letter from him. I asked him before the Justice , how much money was sent to his sister; and he said about 12 l. or 12 guineas. Said I, you have given an account of more than that already, with what you have paid; and he said he would say no more; if he did, he would come here [ making a motion, as if he would sooner be hang'd] and 3 or 4 days before he had not money to buy a pint of beer, and I gave him a pint of beer my self .</p>

               <p>Fish . No: we went down Chick-lane, and he was at an alehouse-door. I asked him for the handkerchief , and he called me an impudent dog, and gave me a punch in the face, and set me a-bleeding. He owned he took the handkerchief, and had sold it for 7 d. halfpenny; but he did not say where; and offered the prosecutor the 7 d. halfpenny.</p>

               <p>Decosta. It was about half an hour after ten when we set out; we were about a hundred yards in the Back Lane when he demanded our money, and we delivered it to him. His hand trembled exceedingly, and I believe it to be the very first fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be the first fact ?</p>
               <p>Decosta . I have enquired about it, and I don't believe he was ever guilty of any such thing before; his father is a very honest Man, and the prisoner is but 19 years of age.</p>

               <p>Noake. Near Broad St. Giles's; there are very disorderly people live there. The prisoners were carried to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Shuttlewood . About three days afterwards there were several persons taken up, and put into Whitechapel watch-house; I sent my wife and maid to see whether they could hear any thing of the shirts, they being the best judges of the linnen; and they found them, and were both positive they were my shirts that were taken from Bethnal-green. And there was a boy, one Sheppard, who owned he took them off the line; and said they sold them, and that they divided the money between them.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>Mumford. About 10 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prosecutor any silver buckles when he went to bed?</p>
               <p>Mumford . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had he?</p>
               <p>Mumford. He did not tell me what money he had.</p>
               <p>Q. What buckles had the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Mumford. They were either copper, or brass. These are the buckles that the prosecutor had; there's W M upon them . The prosecutor ask'd for the prisoner, and I said he was a long-side of him. He said he was gone; I jump'd out of bed to piss , and he said the money was all gone too, and I came down, and found the window-shutters and the casement open; and I said, bear a hand, as fast as you can, and after him, and we met with him in Leadenhall-street. He was searched, and he had the 3 l. 12 s. piece between his stocking and his foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he carried before a magistrate?</p>
               <p>Mumford. Yes; and he said the 36 s. piece was changed at one Mr. Haynes's in Darkhouse-lane .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said the other night, in Newgate, that he would hang me.</p>

               <p>Lambert. In a place called Love lane near Kensington , and I went with him with a candle and lantern, and he could not find it then, it was so dark; and we went the next day, and saw the mo ney as plain as if it stood upright.</p>

               <p>Smith . She called out to several people, and I was afraid of losing the other things I had about me; and I thought I should meet with her another time.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw her do it, did you?</p>
               <p>Smith. I saw her take my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take her up?</p>
               <p>Smith. Last Sunday morning, in Catherine-street.</p>

               <p>Smith . I was a little, but I was very sensible, tho' I had not the use of my legs ; and I carried her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard any thing of these things since?</p>
               <p>Smith. The watch was sold for 18 s. and she said she wished she had known my buckles had been silver; if she had, she would have had them.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, on the 10th of March, 1746. one Bailey, who kept a coffee-house in Yarmouth , had occasion to go to Horsey , and there was a gang of smuglers there, and they expected their cutter, and thought he came as a spy; and they went to one Manning's house, where this Bailey was, and whipp'd Bailey in a cruel manner; then they brought him out of Manning's house, and carried him into the church-yard, and brought out a caseknife , and told him they would cut his throat if he did not answer all the questions they asked him: and they asked him what he came there for; he said he came to see his acquaintance Manning: and they tied a rope about his neck, and almost strangled him, and tied him up to an arm of a tree, and left him almost dead. And the next step they took to get this man to shew his great thanks to them was, that they made him down on his knees, and thank them for not hanging him; and made him swear damnation to his soul if he revealed what they did; and then they let him go. And they took him into custody again the next day, but they did not treat him so ill as they did before. But, gentlemen, you must consider, that he was in very great terror; and this man having been treated as a spy without foundation, he thought, as I have been treated so ill, now I will see what these people are about; and he very cunningly pretended to be going another way; and he followed them so close , as to see what was going forward; and he saw a gang, to the number of 40 or 50, running and landing of goods; and he says the prisoner at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174809070017"/> the bar,

I said to the good woman, why did not you take them all? and she said she thought she had got enough.

               <p>Mr. Finlinson Constable. The prisoner was hurried into my house by a number of people, and a woman had a spoon in her hand which she said she took from the prisoner, and she told the prisoner she believed she stole it: the prisoner said she found it in Fleet-street; and after asking her some other questions, she said she found it in a cherrybasket in the Fleet-market; and afterwards upon a dunghill. I said, if you will not confess where you had it I will send you to prison; then she said she took it from the Rising-sun ale-house in Clare-market: I went and enquired there, and they said they had lost no such thing: I heard the prisoner declare before the Justice that she stole the two salts and the two spoons.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any talk with the prisoner about the things?</p>
               <p>Day. Yes; and he said he was sorry for what he had done, for I had been a father to him, and wish'd he had been hanged before he had done it; he said he had been upon Hounslow-heath , and at the close of the evening he came and put back the wicket, and that he afterwards got in at the bar-window.</p>

             (Constable at Portsmouth.) Mr. Day came to me the 19th of August between nine and ten o'clock, and ask'd me if I was not a constable, I said I was; he told me of his misfortune, and that he believed the villain was at the playhouse ; I was willing to do him all the Service I could, and ask'd him whether he knew who the villain was; he said it was a servant of his; I went with him to the play house, and told the people of the house I was come to search for a villain who was guilty of a robbery, but I would not disturb the house; and we had not been in the house above two Minutes before Mr. Day seiz'd him by the collar; and the prisoner said he did not know Mr. Day, and when he was carried before the Mayor he said his name was Wilcocks .</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any reason for changing his name?</p>
               <p>Norris. I believe he did; but it was some triffling reason which I don't remember, and the Mayor order'd me to carry him to the Town-clerk , and go and search his lodging; and as I was carrying him to the Town-clerk's he was under a good deal of trouble, and he said if I would let him go to his lodging he would give us the things ; and he gave me the tea-pot , spoons and strainers , &amp;c. He said he had been upon Hounslow-heath, and that he got in and robbed his master, Mr. Day's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he got in?</p>
               <p>Norris. He said he got in at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you whether he opened the window, or whether the window was open before?</p>
               <p>Norris. No, he only said he got in at the window.</p>

            . I was out of town , and when I came home I miss'd eight pair of Holland sheets , eight damask and two diaper Table-cloths, a green<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174809070020"/> silk gown, a yellow damask gown , and I lost several other things which were not in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to accuse the prisoner at the bar ?</p>
               <p>Havard. She said she had made use of them, and that Nicholson was in the house to help her, and Winepress said she had pawned the sheets in Hart-street, and Nicholson own'd she had pawn'd the China handled knives and forks in Stanhope-street .</p>
               <p>Prisoner Winepress. I was indebted, and the people threatened to arrest me, and I pawn'd these things to make them easy .</p>

             . I live in Tottenham-court road. On the 17th of August, between 5 and 6 in the evening, I met the prisoner in Holbourn, and he asked me to go and drink, and then he carried me to see his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him?</p>
               <p>Harriot . No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go with a strange man?</p>
               <p>If it had been a strange woman, it would not have been so much out of the way.</p>
               <p>Harriot . The prisoner asked me to go and spend three half-pence with him, and we went into the Coach and horses; then he took me into the coachyard, and he and two women took me to see his new lodgings, and we all went up stairs ; and when I got up stairs, they threw me upon the bed, and then run down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you above stairs ?</p>
               <p>Harriot. Not above 3 minutes, and my watch was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took it from you?</p>
               <p>Harriot. I could not tell who it was that took it, and when I came down stairs there was no body in the house, and I found Mary Ryley in about half an hour, and she ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure the prisoner then?</p>
               <p>Harriot. No, for I was alone; I spoke to him about my watch and he ran away.</p>

               <p>Dover. Because I was afraid of my father-in-law .</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you could not keep it a secret any longer?</p>
               <p>Dover. By reason of the very great pain I was in; and then I told it to my mother, in the same manner I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Dover. A week afterwards .</p>

               <p>Dover . Yes; I was carried to a great many.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her how long she knew me before .</p>
               <p>Dover. I knew him the summer before , and I believed him to be a very honest man , for he never offered any thing unhandsome to me before; and I had fetched shavings from him a great many times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her if ever she came after this .</p>
               <p>Dover. Yes, I did, and he said he would not give me any shavings.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to send her to him?</p>
               <p>Northam . Because he was at work in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>

               <p>Q. How long was your daughter gone?</p>
               <p>Northam . She was gone better than half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring some shavings ?</p>
               <p>Northam . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing to you then?</p>
               <p>Northam . No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she at any time make any complaint to you of being used ill by the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Northam . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that ?</p>
               <p>Northam . About a week afterwards I observed one night, when I was at supper, that she did not sit down. I did not say any thing to her that night .</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say to you afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Northam . She said the next day, that her water scalded her so, that she was so hot, and so sore, that she could not fetch up a pail of water for the world. When she told me this , I told her, in 2 or 3 days she would be better, and she must not mind any such thing .</p>
               <p>Q. Was she better then ?</p>
               <p>Northam. She continued much the same .</p>
               <p>Q. Did she sit down the next day?</p>
               <p>Northam . No; she always hung on the backs of chairs, or leaned upon a table, till she had told what had been done to her.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this thing done to her?</p>
               <p>Northam . On the 6th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it?</p>
               <p>Northam . On a Thursday ; and the Wednesday following I sent her for some more chips and shavings, and she said she could not go, for there was a hole before the door; and she cried, and desired I would not send her .</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174809070024"/>Q. Did she go then?</p>
               <p>Northam. No, she did not, and it went off; and the next day I said she should go, and drove her down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing in her gate?</p>
               <p>Northam. She walked very badly , but I did not think any thing of what was the matter with her. She brought me some shavings then; and she said, Mamma, don't be angry, for he was stronger than I; don't send me any more, for I never will go again; and she cried most bitterly.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose this raised your curiosity . Give an account, as near as you can, in the words that she spoke.</p>
               <p>Northam . She fell down upon her knees , and said, I could not help it, indeed , for he was stronger than I; for when you sent me last Thursday , he bid me come up stairs, and he laid me down upon my back, and pulled up my petticoats , and put something into my body, &amp;c. and cried very much. Said I, why did not you cry out with all your might. She said, Oh mamma , I could not, for he stopped my mouth. I said, why did not you tell, me when you first came home . She said, because he threatened to murder me, if ever I told of it. I sent her to my midwife in Holbourn , who is now sick in bed of a fever, and to Mrs. Peters .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her body ?</p>
               <p>Northam. Yes ; but she was so sore, that she could not bear me to touch her; and she appeared to be abused , and in a very vile condition . We have been forced to wash her three or four times a day, and tent her with fine line .</p>

            . The child was brought to me, and looked like the picture of death .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the child ?</p>
               <p>Peters. Yes; and her linnen was in a most miserable condition?</p>
               <p>Q. How did she appear to have been used ?</p>
               <p>Peters. The inside of her body was sadly torn , and her private parts appeared to be scratched , and in a most miserable pickle , both before and behind.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Peters. About a fortnight, and they were healed then ; and her groin was black , and very much swelled.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by scratch'd? Were they lacerated, or torn ?</p>
               <p>Peters . The skin was almost torn off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she look as if she had been abused by a man?</p>
               <p>Peters. Yes; and I said it was my opinion that the child had the foul disease.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bavan (an Apothecary .) On the first of August I was desired to go to Mrs. Northam ; and the child and her mother gave the same account to me as they have delivered in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the girl?</p>
               <p>Bavan . I examined her body, and found the parts almost healed, with respect to the laceration ; but she had a great running upon her, which appeared to be venereal.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was a venereal case?</p>
               <p>Bavan. I see a great many cases of this kind, and I am sure 'tis a venereal case .</p>
               <p>Prisoner . My lord, I never was concerned with her in my life.</p>

             . On the 12th of August last I lost two gold watches and two silver spoons .</p>
               <p>Q. Whose were the watches ?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim. They were my sons; the prisoner came but the night before, and when I came down in the morning I looked at the watches as they hung up, one upon one sconce and the other upon the other sconce by the chimney; it was seven o'clock by one, and 20 minutes after b y the other, the prisoner was then washing the door. I had not turn'd my back above 5 minutes, but the watches and the prisoner were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the watches found again?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim. Yes; they were brought to me by Mr. Wilks a silver-smith by Cripplegate; for I had published an advertisement offering ten guineas reward; but there was not the whole of the things brought.</p>

            . Servant to Mrs. Pilgrim. I miss'd two silver spoons and the prisoner was taken up: before Justice Dennet she owned that she took the two watches and the two spoons, and that she sold one of the spoons for 11 s. 6 d. to a silversmith near Barbican, I can't remember his name; and the other she sold to Mr. Wilks ; the prisoner came the night before this thing was committed and personated her sister, who is a person of a good character, and lay at Mrs. Pilgrim's that night , and the next morning she went away and took the watches and spoons with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nash (Marshals Man.) I had a search-warrant and went with Mr. Pilgrim to search for these spoons, and found one at Mr. Barlow's in Barbican, and the other at Mr. Wilks's, both by the prisoner's direction.</p>

               <p>Pilgrim . Yes, and he said the person got away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you when they were brought to him?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim . He said on the Saturday morning. Mr. Wilks demanded the reward of me, and I told him I would give him but nine guineas, because there was not the whole; for the spoons were not there; he said he would have the ten guineas, and wrote down his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deliver the watches to you then?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim . No; he shew'd me the watches, then I offer'd him 10 l. and he would not take the 10 l. but said he would allow 6 s. for the two spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whether they were pawned or sold to him?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim . I did not ask any thing of that.</p>

Mr. Wilks said he knew nothing of the spoons; my mistress offer'd him nine guineas, and he said that was not in proportion, and he said he would allow 6 s. for the two spoons, and my mistress would not take it, and she said she would leave it till my master came home; and he would not trust the watches in any person's hand but his own; I had hold of the strings, but he would not part with them out of his hand 'till he had the money.</p>

             . I went to Mr. Wilks's to demand the watches and spoons, he said he had got the watches but knew nothing of the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak of one spoon, or both?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim. I asked him about the spoons, and he said he knew nothing of the spoons; he said he would have ten guineas; I asked him what he would abate for the spoons, and he said 7 s. 6 s. but afterwards he agreed to abate 10 s. and I paid him 10 l. and then I had the watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by them?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim. Yes, he said a woman came with a watch to sell, that she shew'd him one watch at first, and then she said she had another watch, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174809070027"/> put her hand into her pocket and pulled out another, and gave it him. Said I, why did not you stop the woman, for there is an advertisement of five guineas reward for apprehending her?</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Pilgrim. He said he left Davidson in the custody of his wife, and he took his wife up stairs and desired an acquaintance of his to secure her, and in the mean time, while they were gone up stairs, the prisoner got away.</p>

               <p>Blisset Woodwardson. I was with Mr. Pilgrim at Mr. Wilks's shop when he paid him the money; and it was with a great deal of difficulty that he reduced it to 10 l.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say with respect to the spoons?</p>
               <p>Woodwardson . When the marshals-men went with a search-warrant to search for a spoon , Mr. Wilks denied having the spoon, and his wife was by, and I believe she had been eating bacon and greens, or something like that; for her mouth was very greasy , and Mr. Wilks was charg'd with letting the woman out at the back door, and he said he had no back door, for it opened into the street.</p>

             ( Marshals-man .)

I had a search-warrant and Mr. White and I went back and made use of Mr. Wilks's name and searched the house; she said the spoon was not there; and she spoke to the maid, and then Mrs. Wilks produced the spoon.</p>

Then the prisoner at the bar, and the man that rushed against me, knocked me in the face , and my wife in the face, and I thought they had no good intention; and then he came behind me, and gave me a blow on the side of the head with his fist , and knocked me down, and then put his knee at the pit of my stomach, and search'd it; there were 3 keys there, and he left them in it; and the prisoner came to the left pocket of my breeches , and pinched me by the throat, and almost throtled me; then she quitted my left pocket, and came to my right pocket, and took out my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the silver along with the gold?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton. Yes; and when she had got the money, I saw no more of her .</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton. He gave me several blows on the side of my head, that the blood gush'd out at my mouth and nose ; and I thought I should have been murder'd, as well as lose my money; and then they made off toward, Bishopsgate. Some people ask'd me what was the matter; and I said, a man had knocked me down, and a woman had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton. There were about six people; and they said they thought it was a quarrel, and that the man was gone towards Bishopsgate .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the people more?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton. I only said I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife knocked down?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton . She was taken from me by another man, and carried down Houndsditch .</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton . I had a warrant for her the 28th of June .</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you did not take her up sooner?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton. Because I could not find out her name before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take her up?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton. At a house where she was a servant .</p>
               <p>Q. What house was that?</p>

               <p>Thrumpton. I had seen her several times before.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her before?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton. I had seen her several times in Bishopsgate-street .</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you her name?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton. Several people up and down.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are those several people ?</p>

               <p>Q. Why did not you go in there?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton. A little man in grey took me round the waist , and pulled me down Houndsditch; and he hit me a slap on the face, and run away .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out all this time ?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton . I called out, Watch!</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else but the watch?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton . No; only the watch .</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton. I looked about for my husband , and found him in the crowd .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the people at the pastry-cook's shop?</p>
               <p>Thrumpton. I told the gentlewoman of the shop.</p>

I search'd him, and found 2 guineas and an half in gold, 11 half-crowns, one shilling, and 10 sixpences, and the other things mentioned by Mrs. Sterry; and he was carried to the watch-house that night, and committed on Monday morning: and he desired I would go to Stepney, to see whether the key he had would unlock the room where the prosecutor liv'd, and it unlock'd the door better than the key that was made for it.</p>

               <p>Bailey. Yes, but not 'till the smugglers called him by his name; there were several smugglers there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at Horsey on the 10th, 11th , or 12th of March?</p>
               <p>Bailey. I went into the town on the 10th of March, and saw

             on the 10th of March, and I had been at my friend's house; but a little before the house was broke open and I fled to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Holt in his hand?</p>
               <p>Bailey. He had fire-arms in his hand; I am unacquainted with the names of fire-arms, but he had a piece in his hand about the length of this stick, and I did expect he would shoot me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they come for besides?</p>
               <p>Bailey . They came to run goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this on the 10th of March, or the day after ?</p>
               <p>Bailey. The day after; I was got into the bar, and they could not find me at first, for they thought I was come as a spy, and cut my face in a terrible manner, and beat me with a leather belt; I went to bed, and after I was in bed they came to the door and knock'd for me, and the landlord said he is in bed, and he will be quiet if you will let him be quiet: the only man that I can swear assaulted me was Holt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take you away?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Yes, and I said to the farmer as Shakespear said, I am going I don't know where I am going, or how I am going; I said I believed they had a design to take away my life, and I said don't put me to this terror; if you intend to do it, do it at once; and one of them asked me if I had a handkerchief, and I said I had . About one o'clock on the 11th of March in the afternoon there was a cutter came in, and they had spyingglasses . Said I, you are a parcel of blind Sons of whores, for there is your cutter; and Holt said, where are my arms?</p>
               <p>Q. How many had arms?</p>
               <p>Bailey. There were 45, and I saw Holt and the rest of the company armed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many had arms?</p>
               <p>Bailey . I am sure most of them had arms.</p>

               <p>Bailey. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I desire to know why his name may not be John Brown?</p>
               <p>Bailey. You know best, because you are a Counsellor at law. I know that Holt was parish-clerk at Benacre in the county of Suffolk.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to follow them down to the beach?</p>
               <p>Bailey. Because they had used me very ill, and I was willing to make the most of them; for they took me along with them in order to hold their horses.</p>

               <p>Bailey. Nine miles .</p>

               <p>Brandson. I did not see any; and he said, if I took Holt, I should keep his family; and I said, those that brought him to destruction, should keep them: and there was a man came there with firearms , who was a rider to Fox.</p>
               <p>Q. What, a smuggler's rider?</p>
               <p>Brandson . 'Tis a title they give themselves to ride for to sell goods. There was a fellow levelled a blunderbuss at me, and I stepped into Cullington's house at Benacre , and there was one Goodwin there ; and I asked him whether he would stand by me; and he said, he would die with me; and Fox and the other run away.

               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Brandson . About 11 at night; and the smugglers came up to the house about 11 o'clock at night .</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of them?</p>
               <p>Brandson. About twelve; they spoke to Holt, but I did not hear him speak to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any of them?</p>
               <p>Brandson. I knew one Leader.</p>

               <p>Q. When Welch's house was so beset, what did you do then?</p>
               <p>Brandson. I intended to go to the back-side of the house to get fire-arms, that I might be a match for them, for I would have parted with my life rather than have parted with Holt. They fired into the house afterwards, and they killed two horses.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the man that keeps the house?</p>
               <p>Brandson. He is a carpenter. They got a crowiron, and knock'd the horses on the head. One died directly, and the other died the next day.</p>

             . I keep the house at Kessingland where Mr. Brandson and Mr. Goodwin were at 8 at night, and Holt was there as a prisoner. I heard some horses come up, and my wife and I were afraid; for there was a firing at the windows, and there were two children lying in the room that they fired into. They fired one piece, and then said, D - n your b - d resign your prisoner.</p>

               <p>Carr. About twelve days last Tuesday evening I had occasion to go to the other end of the town, and went to the White Hart in Rosemery-lane , and I had eighteen-penny worth of punch: Leader came in and sat at the other end of the table; and I said, My lad will you drink a glass of punch; and I ask'd his partner that was with him; I was going away, and went to pay for the punch, and he said I should not go 'till he had his in.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Carr. I belong to a private ship of war: I was a lieutenant of marines; and another man came in and they began to be very merry; and he said he hoped he should have a good dinner on Thursday or Friday; I ask'd him whether he belonged to the Sea, he said no; and he said he had got four men in Newgate, and he was to swear their lives away: I ask'd him whether he knew them, he said he knew some of them, and some he did not know , he said he had been shown them twice, and he should be shown them twice more; and I said, if you know the men you do well to do this, for the service of your king and country; and he said afterwards in farther conversation, that he did not do it for the good of his king and country, but only for the sake of a reward.</p>

               <p>Carr. Yes I was, and he said he was to have 800 l. and he said he would give some of the money to his father, and buy an estate with the rest; and he said he had 50 l. owing to him now by the government; he said he had seen Fox, and he was a little man.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were there?</p>
               <p>Noake. One Fox, one Griffith and one Solomon, and I think Mr. Carr was there, and Leader said he was to have six or eight hundred pounds, but I cannot tell which, and he said he was to swear against some people; that he had been shown them twice, and that he should be shown them twice more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Leader before?</p>
               <p>Noake . I have seen him before there, for I used to pass away a little time with a shipmate of mine in playing at skittles, and he forced his discourse to me and ask'd me what I was; and I said I was a barber and perriwigmaker, but I had belonged to the sea; and he ask'd me whether I would undertake a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it that he wanted you to undertake?</p>
               <p>Noake. He said it was to swear against some persons; I said I would not do it; and he said you fool 'tis no harm at all; I have some people in Newgate only swear for me, and I will give you five guineas in hand, and a promissory bond for 20 l. more.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to give you the 20 l. for?</p>
               <p>Noake. For swearing against these people if they were convicted, and he would have sent me to Newgate to see them in order to convict them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Carr before this?</p>
               <p>Noake. I never saw him in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Carr of it?</p>
               <p>Noake. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Carr say?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174809070037"/>Noake. He said, this ought not to be concealed for the world; for it was a piece of justice to discover it.</p>
               <p>Co. for. Cro. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Noake. In Litchfield-street Soho; I am a journeyman barber.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your master's name?</p>
               <p>Noake. Rogers.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you think this was a bad thing, to persuade you to take a false oath?</p>
               <p>Noake. Yes, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take him up?</p>
               <p>Noake. Because I did not know so much then.</p>

               <p>Ranwick . We put it into writing. He said he would confess who were there, and hop'd he should be an evidence for the king. And he own'd that he was at the rescue of Holt, and gave us an account of the names of several persons who were present, which I have here; and he bid me put his own name down first.</p>
