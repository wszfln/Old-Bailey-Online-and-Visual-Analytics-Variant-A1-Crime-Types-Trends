We missed, also some brasses. She had used the mug to throw water up against the window. We suspected the prisoner to take them, nobody being in the house at the time. I did not know where to find her; but knowing she had a child in the hospital, she told me where her mother lived; but Mr. Harding, a goldsmith, advertising the mug, I went to him, and there found the mug. We took up the prisoner, and she confess'd where she had sold the chamber pot and brasses in East Smithfield, where we went and found them.</p>

            . I live in the Minories, am a goldsmith. On the th of November about seven in the evening, the prisoner came to offer this mug to late. I asked her how she came by it? she said her husband was a soldier, and in the Westminster-Infirmary, and as she was going to see him in the Broadway, Westminster, she found the mug about half full of pease porridge; I said I must advertise it, that the right owner might have it again; she would have taken any thing for it. I advertised it, and Mrs. More came and owned it as her master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it?</p>
               <p>Harding. It is worth about 3 l. 10 s.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wilmot. On the 25th of November I was attack'd by a companion of the prisoner; he made an attempt at a lottery ticket I had in my hand. Seeing him join the prisoner and another man, I made it my business to observe them. I saw the man in their company (named Curd), point over the way to the prosecutor, as a man may do to a dog, crying hi ver. Immediately the prisoner went over to him, and put his left hand into his pocket, and took out his handkerchief. I went and took hold of, and closed the prisoner's hand with the handkerchiefs in it. I said to the prosecutor, Is this your handkerchief? He look'd at it, and said he would sware it was his property. Then we took the boy before Justice Welch. and the boy confessed that Curd and Williams; were the names of two who were with him, and said that was the fourth handkerchief he had taken that day.</p>

The other company went away about three in the afternoon, and left them three halfpence to pay. Some little time after, I look'd in the tap-room, and saw they were gone also. I ask'd my servant if Little had paid the three half-pence. I was told he had not. Then I said, see you tell his wife of it, when she comes at night with her oisters. (I did not then miss the tankard.) The prisoner and his wife used to be at my house most evenings, but they did not come that evening, nor the next day. I missed my tankard, and told

             of it, and that I suspected the prisoner. He told me he had seen the prisoner and his wife in a silversmith's shop in Cheapside, either buying or selling something. I sent him and one of my daughters to the shop (it was Mr. Briscoe's, at the corner of Friday Street ) to buy a second hand tankard. They were shewn several, but did not see mine. Then I went there with a friend of mine, and asked Mr. Briscoe what the prisoner and his wife were there for; he passed a little, and said he bought the handle of a mug or a tankard of him, and produced it. There was No 2 upon it, the same which I lost; upon which I got a warrant, and took the prisoner up. When I took him before the justice, he did not deny it, but said his wife gave it him. I have four tankards, which are all mark'd with a cypher and number'd; they are No. 1, 2, 3, 4; it was the No. 2 that was missing.</p>

            . I was going down Cheapside, and saw the prisoner and his wife in Mr. Briscoe's shop, a silversmith there, on the 3d of November, about four in the afternoon. Mr. Smither telling me he had lost a tankard, I told him where I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was only at the door, I was not in the shop.</p>
               <p>Hodgen. They were both in the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Briscoe. On the 3d of November, about four in the afternoon, a woman came into my shop with this bit of a handle to a tankard, and asked me whether or not it was silver. I touched it, and told her it was. She asked me whether I would buy it. I asked her how she came by it, and she told me she found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body came with her?</p>
               <p>Briscoe. There was a man stood at my door, or in the shop, but whether he was in or not I am not certain: I do not know that I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to have any concern with the woman in the selling it?</p>
               <p>Briscoe. When I paid the woman, as she was going out, I think she said she was going with her basket to sell oisters; there was something passed between them, but I can't tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has spoke just as the thing was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I will give a just account of what I know of it: The day the tankard was lost, I, my wife, and two or three more in company, were drinking at the prosecutor's house; after dinner, I said to her, Hannah, if you will go to Billingsgate and buy some oisters, I will go home and fetch my knot and hat. Before I returned again the gentlemen were all gone; my wife had got her sieve upon her head coming out of the house; I said, are you going? she said she had not money enough, but she would go and borrow 6 d. of her landlady. She went and did not return. I went into Chancery-lane, she had not been at home, I staid for her pretty near an hour, she did not come; then I walked down Fleet-street into White-Friars to a house we were just removed from, and there I found her. I asked her if she had borrowed the money, she said no, but she had something that would fetch some money, and pulled out a little bit of silver, and said she found it by St. Dunstan's church among some rubbish; we went to several silversmiths in Fleet-street, she sold it to one on Ludgate-hill, and after she came out of the shop she shewed me four shillings; then we went to St. Paul's church-yard, there she told me she had got something more; then we went to Mr. Briscoe's shop and sold another bit; what she got for that I cannot say. Then, I said, let us go to Billingsgate; she said, she did not purpose to go there to day, so we went to her mother's in Beach-lane, from whence we came back into Fleet-lane, and from thence into White-friars. She went up stairs, and came down in two or three minutes. Then she said we will go as far as my uncle's in Norton-falgate. After we got cross Moorfields she pulled out the body of the tankard from under her cloaths, and said, I have got something that will fetch a good deal of money still. I took it out of her hand, and asked her how she came by it. She said, very honestly; that she found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040005"/> It where she found the other. Then she wanted it out of my hand again. I said, I will not give it you, until I know how you came by it. She d - d me for a scoundrel, and said, if I had a good thing put into my hand I would not make the best of it; and said, if I would carry it among the Jews I might sell it. I said, I will leave it with my cousin until I come from off guard at Kensington, then I should have time to enquire how she came by it. I carried it to my cousin, and told her I had it of my wife, and desired her to let it be there till I came off guard, and then I should know how she came by it.</p>

               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. At what time did the prisoner and his wife go away from your house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They staid a little time after the other company. I believe they went away about three o'clock, but I did not see them go away.</p>

I never knew him guilty of any thing bad. He always behaved well. When this unhappy accident happened his discharge was wrote, but the gentlemen postponed giving it him, hoping that as he bore an honest character he would be acquitted. I have lent him money in, and he has always paid me.</p>

I told him my master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040006"/> would find me out; then he would give me money, a penny or two pence, and told me he would learn me my trade.

I had strong reason towards the latter part of his time to suspect him of robbing me (his having a quantity of money about him.) I carried seventeen shillings in silver to an engraver in Gutter-Lane, for him to put a private mark on each, which he did. Then I gave 8 s. 6 d. to one Wilson, and the like to Mrs. Rayner, to come and lay out with the prisoner before I got up the next morning, at nine o'clock. When I got up, I went and look'd in the money-drawer, and there I found 11 s. 6 d. and no more; then I went to the two persons, and found the woman had laid out with him 6 s. 6 d. and Mr. Wilson 8 s. 6 d. which made 15 s. Then I asked the prisoner what money he had taken, he said he had put it all in the drawer. I asked him what Mrs. Rayner had laid out, he said 4 s. 6 d. I said has she not laid out 6 s. 6 d. then he said yes she had. I asked him what Mr. Wilson had laid out, he said 6 s. 6 d. I said if you recollect, he laid out 8 s. 6 d. which he own'd; then I sent for a constable, and desired he'd let me see what money he had about him; he readily pulled out about 9 or 10 l. I said I must search him; when he found that, he pull'd out 3 s. 6 d. from his waistcoat pocket, and flung that on the table: Then I sent for the engraver who mark'd the money, and he pick'd out that 3 s. 6 d. which he took from his waistcoat pocket, and the 11 s. 6 d. in the drawer. All mark'd money. The constable has got it in his possession now.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that the prisoner had put the money into the till and taken it out again?</p>

               <p>Q. Who keeps the key of the till?</p>
               <p>Sterrop. There is no key at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to trust him to take money for you in the shop?</p>
               <p>Sterrop. Yes, I had frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the money he laid down on the table?</p>
               <p>Sterrop. He said he had been robbing me for 3 months past, and all the money he had was mine.</p>

Having lost things out of it several times, I ordered my boy to go out into the street and watch her, and I went on the other side the shop, and saw her fingers several times in the glass case; she lifted the case up at the corner several times. I saw a silver chain drawn out, and saw her grabble it with her fingers. I went to a constable over the way; he advised me to take her up, which I did, after she was got into Bartholomew-Close. We brought her to an alehouse, and my maid and the maid there searched her, but found nothing upon her. There were two other girls with her; but whether they belonged to her, or she delivered the things to them, I know not. I missed four silver chains which were in the case not an hour before, and some seals.</p>

On the 29th of Oct. about seven at night, the prisoner came into our shop, and said she wanted a pair of stockings; I took down some, and told them over. She asked the price of a pair; I said half a crown. She took up 3 pair, and said let me feel the weight of these; she weighted them and gave them a toss down. Then I saw but two pair lying on the counter. Then I told the parcel over again; and there wanted a pair of the number. She sat down and shew'd me her leg, and said I must have a large stocking, for I have a large leg; as I look'd over the counter I saw the other pair of stockings lying on the ground by her feet. Then she took off her garter and measured the calf of her leg, then measured a pair of stockings on the counter, and said these are not big enough. Then as she went to tie her stocking, I saw her stoop very low with her right hand, and she brought the pair or stockings upon the ground under her petticoats. Then she would give but 21 d. for the stockings she had measured. I look'd over the counter, and saw the stockings were gone; she was going to the door; I throw'd myself over the counter and said, you may as well have them, you will get none cheaper. She said I'll give no more, and went out. I went after her, and brought her back; and said she had taken a pair. She said she had not; and as I was going to feel about her coats, there lay the stockings on the ground, by her feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the stockings did not lay there before ?</p>
               <p>Hayes. I am certain they did not. I am very sure she took them out and brought them in again, for there were none upon the floor when she went out. After that she call'd her husband; he came, and began to call her names; and said she had been in bad company.</p>

            , Esq; the prisoner married a fellow servant of mine; they were permitted to live in my master's house, while the family were in the country. They came to town on the 24th of October; then the goods mentioned in the indictment were missing.</p>
               <p>Court. Name the things.</p>
               <p>J. Baterson. There was a silver saucepan, 7 linen tablecloths, 2 shirts, 1 damask napkin, and a pair of black velvet breeches; these were the property of my master: one pair of black silk stockings, a crimson velvet shag waistcoat, and a black coat and waistcoat; these were my master's son's. We had a suspicion of the prisoner, because the young woman said nobody was in the house but him and her. We took him up, and he confessed he had taken the things, and where he had pawned them. I was at the finding them at the several pawnbrokers.</p>

            . I have seen the prisoner begging about our neighbourhood, at times, for about 3-qrs. of a year. She used to sit near an empty house, where my children used to pass as they went to school. I saw my children go out to go to school, they had their stays and things on as usual, and they came home late without their stays.</p>
               <p>Q. What are your children's names ?</p>
               <p>Bailey. The eldest her name is Elizabeth, she is about seven years of age; the other's name is Sarah. I know nothing of the robbery but what the children told me. I advertised the things on the Monday following, and stuck up bills; the prisoner was taken on the 28th of October; she was charged with taking the cloaths off the children, she own'd she did, and had pawn'd one pair of stays for a shilling, and sold the other stays for 21 d. My wife went to the pawnbroker she mentioned, and return'd and said, that the pawnbroker said he knew nothing of the prisoner. Then I went and got a search warrant from Sir

On the 24th of October I sent my children to school, dressed as usual, with their stays on; they were brought home about five in the evening without their stays, and some other of their things.

               <p>E. Bailey. She had lost her stays, her under petticoat, her cap, ribbon, and handkerchief.</p>

               <p>E. Bailey. She was seven years of age last Midsummer, the other five in May last. The prisoner was taken up on the 28th. I went to her at the Black Horse in Mill yard where she was in custody; they put her in a room with a dozen women. I had put my children in at a neighbour's house; I went and fetched my youngest child first, and asked her if she knew the woman that took her stays; she ran to the prisoner directly, and said, This is her, and clap'd her hand on her knee; the prisoner said, you are mistaken, it was not me; the child said, yes, it was you, and this is your child, (which was the child the prisoner held in her arms.) After that my eldest child was brought in, and she insisted upon it the prisoner was the woman, the same as the other did. The prisoner still denied it, but before Sir

I asked him what he had been doing in the warehouse; he said a cooper had given him some sugar. I sent Paterson up stairs, and he returned and said there was no cooper there; I searched him, and his trowsers had a large pocket on each side full of sugar; I made him pull them off, and the trowsers, sugar and all, weighed 30 pounds. He was carried before my lord mayor the next day, and there he said as before.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there sugar in that warehouse where you found him at the door?</p>
               <p>Coats. There were then 6 or 700 hogsheads in the building.</p>

I went with him, as my master has given an account; and when we were at Mr. Wright's, I asked him how he spelt his name (to see if his writing and the order were alike.) So he wrote this name at the bottom.

               <p>Merry. I did. I think I heard the prisoner tell my master he saw Mr. Wilmot write the order; or he wrote it while he was in his house. He said he was coming from Shoreliam, and he called upon Mr. Wilmot; and Mr. Wilmot told him he had occasion for present money, and would be glad if he would take a draught to town; and as a letter would be safer carriage than cash, he took the draught, and paid the money for it: And that he was a shop-keeper at Shoreham; and two or three times he spoke of the hardship of staying for money when they come with a draught for it. I immediately told my master if I went to Mr. Wright's I might know farther of it. When I came out of the compting-house, I told him my master traded with Mr. Wright, who traded with Mr. Wilmot, and I believed there might be a mistake; but if there was any money due to him, he should have it. So then we went there; then I found that the writing was not at all like Mr. Wilmot's hand. Then we contrived to get him into the compting house; and sent for a constable.</p>

            . I did not know the prisoner or deceased before. That night I and Yarbury lodged at the Hat and Tun. We came in at about nine o'clock, a fortnight ago yesterday; there were people dancing and merry. Presently came in a sidler; the deceased said I will give you a halfpenny if you will play me a tune; he play'd, she danced; after that there were two more women gave him a halfpenny each at last. The Fidler went out. The husband was sitting by (he seem'd to be angry with) his wife; and said she had more need to keep her money to buy some supper. She used many ill words, and said she would do what she pleased. They had more words, and she fell a beating him very much with her double fist about his head. He did not offer to resist; he held his hand up, and once said, I here I kept that blow off. She very much abused him with her tongue, and call'd for gin and beer. She seem'd to be pretty much in liquor. After that she sat down in a box, and he and she had a few ill words, especially from her. She seem'd to aggravate him very much. He asked for the key of his room door, to go home. She said you dog you shall not have it yet, I'll have some more beer before I go; then she call'd for half a pint of beer. He got up and struck her, while the boy was gone for the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the blow fall ?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I think under the jaw; it was not very severe, but a pretty sharpish blow. She sat on her seat about half a minute, or hardly so long, and then drop'd with her face on the ground, and rowl'd on her back, and made a little noise in her throat, and died.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she drunk at that time?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040014"/>Tompson. She was pretty full of liquor whilst I was in the house; which was about an hour. She drank gin two or three times; and she seem'd pretty full of liquor when came in. After she had laid some time-her husband came and looked at her; and they said she was very subject to his. They did not struck her dead at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Was is a blow with to much violence, that had she been sober it would have killed her ?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I don't think it would. I do not think he had a design to kill her, any more than I had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has not made any mistake; I can't ask him any thing more.</p>

            . I was present with the last witness at the Hat and Tun. There was the deceased merry, and in liquor. There came in a sidler; she insisted upon giving him a halfpenny, and she'd have a dance; the sidler play'd to her, and 2 other women joined with her in the dance; at last her husband came in and said she had better keep her money; she said you dog I'd do as I lease; and call'd him cagmag dog, and Welch dog, and struck him. After that she sat down in a box. Her husband had been out, and came in and said you have been drinking gin now; she said she'd have some more beer; he rose up and struck her; she rose up and pitch'd down on her face; he lifted her up, and call'd for some water, and said she is apt to be in fits; he put water on her face, and wiped her face; after some time we perceived she was dead; then they sent for the parish-officer and took him up.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was sent for by the coroner to inspect the body of the deceased. I found a bruise upon her forehead the breadth of half a crown. I cut through it, in order to see if the bone was fractured; there was no injury done to the bone. I likewise examined her jaw, but there was no injury there.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you think she came by her death?</p>
               <p>Chapman. The evidence seem'd not quite certain where the blow was given; and that she was greatly in liquor. The fall might contribute to her death, or the fall itself might occasion her death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>She has been troubled with fits nine or ten years, and has fell in the streets, and been taken up for dead. Please to call Mrs. Tompson again.</p>
               <p>C. Tompson. She has had several sits. I have seen her in two. I believe her passion threw her into them. I know the man is a lab orious hard working man.</p>

He left me in August. On the 9th of Nov. my maid was in my bedchamber; she came down, and said, she thought she had heard some body at the chest. I went up, and found somebody had been there, and had strove to break my buroe; I went out of my house, my neighbours told me there had been somebody upon my house. I mistrusting the boy, went to his father's house and asked for him, but he not being at home his father came to me; then I charged the boy (who was with him) with robbing me of 10 l. the boy denied he had stole so much, but owned he had taken 7 guineas from me; and that the time my mind heard some body in the closet he owned he was there, and not having time to break open my buroe, he took a parcel of halfpence out of a bag that stood by, and he had been and hid them among some bricks in Lincoln's Inn Fields; where we went and found about 20 d. in halfpence; I have them now here.</p>

            . I belong to Bartholomew's hospital. There was a report there had been a child born in the ward where the prisoner lay, and the treasurer gave orders the vault should be searched. There was a piece of heavy iron fixed to a rope and let down; it stopped after it was gone a little way down, but by raising the iron and letting it down several times, the passage was opened; then we went to search the sespool; this vault vented itself on the left side; I ordered them to search, and soon a fine male child was taken out. I observed a wound on the side of the head, which I imagined was given by the iron instrument that was let down. It seemed to be a full grown child.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it nails on its fingers?</p>
               <p>Clutterburg. I think it had; and hair. It was as fine a child as ever I saw. It appeared to have been fresh thrown in.</p>

               <p>Mr. Avery. The prisoner lived servant with me two years and three months; she believed modest, sober, honest and careful; I never heard her spell an ill word.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she come to live with you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Avery. She came the 4th or 5th of September was two year, and she imagined she had a dropsy, and went from my house to the hospital.</p>

On the 14th of November the prisoner was stop'd with some copper at the house of Mr. Child; he sent for me to know if I knew the prisoner. I said I did, he work'd with me; I was told there was some copper stop'd at his house, and the prisoner. I went and saw two saucepans unfinish'd, and some other pieces of copper. I have sworn the saucepans are mine. (produced in court, and a poled to) There is a piece of copper also, which he was at work upon the day before he was stop'd.</p>
               <p>Q. How much copper is there of the two saucepans and that bit of a coal scoop?</p>
               <p>Shelton. It makes in all about a pound and three-quarter. We took the prisoner before my lord-mayor the next day, but I did not swear to the thing; so he was remanded back to prison. On the Wednesday following I went again before my lord-mayor, and swore to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner own at any time he took the copper?</p>
               <p>Shelton. No, my lord, he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Why would you not swear then, and yet go and swear six days afterwards?</p>
               <p>Shelton. I was very tender; and when I had made close inspection, I went and swore to it.</p>

               <p>Child. Yes he did. The I ask'd him where he work'd (for I had once or twice sent my servants to watch him, to know where he work'd, but they could bring no account.) The saucepans were brought about six weeks before he was stop'd; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040018"/> came only with a bit of copper then. My wife bought the two saucepans of him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Child. I bought these two saucepans of the prisoner at the bar; I gave him 11 d. per pound for them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Shelton. Are these your saucepans ?</p>

               <p>Mrs. Child. He was stop'd on the 14th of Nov. with a small bit of a coal scoop, which be brought to sell amongst other metal. There is a pound and 3 ounces of it. He was stop'd upon this. I sent for my husband home, and we charged a constable with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Child. Where did he say he work'd?</p>
               <p>Child. He told me he served his time with a brasier at Newbury, in Berkshire; but I found he served his time in London. When I found he worked with the prosecutor, I sent for him. So it came out.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he do when he was in bed ?</p>
               <p>Broadben. He said, don't you be frightned, my dear, I am not going to hurt you; he got upon me, and she was at the foot of the bed, and pulled my legs. I kept my legs as close as I could; she pulled my legs open, and held them open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing to you?</p>

               <p>Broadben. She bid me open my legs, and I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak to him?</p>

               <p>Broadben. He put his private parts upon me at first.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do more?</p>
               <p>Broadben. Then he put his hands upon my private parts; he put his fingers into my private parts.</p>

               <p>Broadben. He made water upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did his private parts go into yours?</p>
               <p>Broadben. Very far, as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman hold your legs all the time?</p>
               <p>Broadben. Yes, Sir, she did, at the foot of the bed, and I could not get loose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance in order to hinder him?</p>
               <p>Broadben. Sir, I strove as hard I could.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he lie upon you?</p>
               <p>Broadben. I can't say how long; I thought it was very long.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other girl?</p>
               <p>Broadben. She was in the room by the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man hurt you?</p>
               <p>Broadben. He hurt me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you drank some beer and gin, was you fuddled ?</p>
               <p>Broadben. It made me a little giddy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to you when you drank it?</p>
               <p>Broadben. She asked me if I liked it; I said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the handkerchief tied round your head all the time?</p>
               <p>Broadben. It was, but not tight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out ?</p>
               <p>Broadben. I cried out sadly. She said before at undressing me, if I cried out any more, she would kill me almost; then I did not cry.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he get out of bed from you?</p>
               <p>Broadben. He did not; but when he had done I got out as soon I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you at the time?</p>
               <p>Broadben. He asked me if I liked it; I said no. He asked me if I would come again; I said if he would let me go I would. She let my legs go. When I got out of bed, I dressed myself, and asked to go home;

               <p>Q. How came you to say so?</p>
               <p>Broadben. Because Clifton said to us coming down the lane, if you ever mention this to any body I will kill you. He asked us whether any body had stopped us on the road; we said no body; he said, he'd ask her mother.</p>

Then we told our master we would tell him, but we were afraid; he said nobody will hurt you. We said we were afraid, for it was somebody in the house. Then he said, whoever they were they should not stay in the house a minute, if we would tell the truth. Then we both named Clifton, and told some of it; we told him about our being at the house with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040020"/> prisoner Clifton; after some time we told the whole; but it was by degrees.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the three girls?</p>
               <p>Hannet. No, I did not. Clifton began to undress us.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Broadben make any resistance?</p>
               <p>Hannet. She cried out; but she did not leave off undressing her; she did it by force. Then she took and put Broadben by the bedside, and took and undressed me. After she had undressed me she put Broadben into bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man in the room at the time of your first coming in?</p>
               <p>Hannet. He was undressing himself.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go away?</p>
               <p>Hannet. When we went away the candles were lighted up.</p>
               <p>Q. What o'clock was it when you went home to your master's house?</p>
               <p>Hannet. I believe it was past ten, but I can't be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you all three go home together?</p>
               <p>Hannet. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Clifton say any thing in going home?</p>
               <p>Hannet. She threatened to murder us (if we told) as we were going along.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the reason why you did not speak of it?</p>
               <p>Hannet. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who open'd the door to you?</p>
               <p>Hannet. My master did, I believe, but am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you after you got home?</p>
               <p>Hannet. He bid us come to him; and ask'd us where we had been, and what made us stay so long.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell him?</p>
               <p>Hannet. I told him a lye. I told him we came late from my mothers.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040023"/>Q. Was you not in some confusion when you came home?</p>
               <p>Hannet. I was in a little.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this affair to come to your master's knowledge?</p>
               <p>Hannet. I told him. He found his substance cut to pieces and wasted; and miss'd things. And on making enquiry amongst us [there was a great noise about things being missing] we were obliged to tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this report of your being used ill at the Three Compasses to come out?</p>
               <p>Hannet. Because we used always to be sighing and crying; and he asked us about his things which he miss'd; and I told him that Sarah Clifton had got his things. So he went before justice Cox, and I believe the justice found the rape out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of the rape being talked of before you was at justice Cox's?</p>
               <p>Hannet. I gave my master a little account of it; he examined me a good deal, and said he would forgive me if I would tell the truth; and I said I would tell him the whole truth about the things, and a little more.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by that little more?</p>
               <p>Hannet. Then I told him something about this affair.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Sarah Clifton carried before the justice for?</p>
               <p>Hannet. She was carried there upon suspicion of a robbery. My master had turned her out at one in the morning, and would not have prosecuted her; but when she was out, I told him something about the rape.</p>
               <p>Council. So then the whole came out by degrees ?</p>
               <p>Hannet. It did.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the names of the three girls that were in the room?</p>
               <p>Hannet. I can't tell their names. I can only tell their Christian names, one was Polly, the other Betty, and the other Jenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do they live?</p>
               <p>Hannet. I don't know where they live.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they dress'd?</p>
               <p>Hannet. They were dressed fine.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know their names ?</p>
               <p>Hannet. I went up to them; talk'd to them; ask'd them their names, and they told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they enquire about Broadben?</p>
               <p>Hannet. They did not much enquire about her; she was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a fore-room or a back room?</p>
               <p>Hannet. It was a fore-room.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you go up stairs ?</p>
               <p>Hannet. Clifton went up first, and we followed her.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you close to her, or farther behind ?</p>
               <p>Hannet. We were close to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you hold of her, or she of you ?</p>
               <p>Hannet. I don't know which now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober ?</p>
               <p>Hannet. I was a little giddy.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the dress of the three girls.</p>
               <p>Hannet. One was dressed in a silk gown.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her name ?</p>
               <p>Hannet. That was Polly; she was dressed best.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man a wig or his own hair?</p>
               <p>Hannet. I saw him put a cap on. When we first came out I said it was his own hair.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you say then ?</p>
               <p>Hannet. I said it was tied behind.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was the cap he put on?</p>
               <p>Hannet. It was a white cap.</p>

               <p>Broadben having said nothing about three girls being in the room, she was sent for in, and Hannet put out of court.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner, to Broadben. How many pair of stairs did you go up at the Three Compasses ?</p>
               <p>Broadben. We went up only one pair.</p>

             lived with me as a servant; and looked over the children, to manage them. We had a little disturbance at our house about some goods that were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two girls Broadben and Hannet belong to you?</p>
               <p>Washingthorp. Yes, they are apprentices. I have nine young girls in all. I found Clifton did not behave herself so well as she should; she begun to get drunk, and behaved very insolently. I gave her warning. After that, I found the girls behaved themselves naughty; instead of minding their work they would tear their work in pieces, and spoil a good deal of thread. They were lazy. When I found out the girl that did the mischief, I gave her correction. The things that were missing from day to day, the girl that cut the thread took upon herself. They told me there was a gang about the house that received the things. I enquired farther. I asked these two girls how they came to do these things; and by moving their Consciences, I began to discover it. But they would not tell me, till I had promised them the prisoner should not be any more in the house. Then they told me that she set them on to take the things away for her, because her time was almost out; and that she bid them provoke me as much as possible, that I might use them ill; and she would set up a cook's shop, and they might run away, and come and be with her, and they should have fine cloaths and live in pleasure. They told me part of this affair at my house, and made a more full discovery at justice Cox's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two girls agree in their story ?</p>
               <p>Washingthorp. They did exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you what was their indocement to cut the thread?</p>
               <p>Washingthorp. Only to plague me, and to cause me to use them ill, and then they would run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your work require young girls to do it ?</p>
               <p>Washingthorp. It does a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business ?</p>
               <p>Washingthorp. It is Dre work. I went to justice Cox, being a foreigner, and desired his assistance. He sent his clerk, and he examined the girls; and they made the same discovery to him they have mentioned here. When the clerk found the thing so bad, he would have them before the justice. They were carried there, and he examined the woman and committed her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find out the man at the bar?</p>
               <p>Washingthorp. By the description the girls gave of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the girls searched by the direction of the justice?</p>
               <p>Washingthorp. They were, by a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Washingthorp. It was several days before last sessions.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man did the two girls describe ?</p>
               <p>Washingthorp. They described a tall man pitted with the small pox, in his own hair.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Broadben. Was you abused by the man at the bar?</p>
               <p>Broadben. I was very much.</p>
               <p>Q. How abused?</p>
               <p>Broadben. In my private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very sure no man ever had laid with you before that time you mention.</p>
               <p>Broadben. I am very sure no man ever did.</p>

            . I happened to go with a friend of mine to justice Cox's; I can't charge my memory with the day; there was another person called upon to examine these two girls Broadben and Hannet. I said to the clerk when he had sent them up stairs,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040025"/> may I go up; he said yes. I went up, and the woman and I examined them; we both gave our opinion before justice Cox that the children had been pressed upon by a man. There was a great relaxation.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by being pressed upon?</p>
               <p>Sanders. I mean I apprehend a man had lain with them, especially Rachel Hannet; the other was not so much hurt as she was, but she appeared to have been lain with. I apprehend a man had forced both their bodies.</p>
               <p>Baynham's defence.</p>
               <p>A few days before I was taken up I went into the Three Compasses; the people of the house were talking of the affair of these two girls. I asked the landlord of the house who the man was; the landlord said, They will as soon swear to you as any one else if you wear your own hair. After that a man came into the house, and asked for a watchmaker with his own hair tied behind. Mrs. Harrison said there was a lawyer came about it. I went down to Brooks market, and found the man that he came to enquire for; I said don't come into the neighbourhood; he said, never you mind it for I do not. Then we came in there together; then the lawyer, named Mr. Tew, came in again and asked for Baynham; I said, my name is Baynham; he said he should be glad if I would stay, and clear myself, till he came in again, for you are (says he) of the same name, tho' I don't believe you are the same person. Then he came again, and brought with him Elizabeth Broadben, and she said I was the man. Then Rachel Hannet came, and it was half an hour before she would say it was any body; and if Broadben had not spoke first, I believe she would never have said it was me. Then I was taken away to the justice.</p>
               <p>Clifton's defence.</p>
               <p>I never was at the Three Compasses with the a girls together in my life, neither was I ever up stairs in that house.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Broadben. What sort of a woman was it that brought up the beer?</p>
               <p>Broadben. It was a fattish sort of a woman.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040026"/>Harrison. No, I do not. I never saw them in my house till Mr. Tew the attorney came with them; he brought them to me, and told, me what they had said; and said if the thing was done in my house, I must know them; he told me they said it was done by a tall man with his hair tied behind. After that the prisoner came in and said you may as well say it was me. Mr. Tew gave the girl a little bit of a tug. Yes, said she, that is the man.</p>

            . On the 6th of July last I lived with Mr. Harrison at the Three Compasses in Little-Wild-Street.</p>

            . I carried Eliz. Broadben, and the other girl, one after the other, to the Three Compasses, in Little-Wild-Street. First I carried Broadben: I told her, I should bring her to Mr. Harinson's house; and there were a great many people there, and bid her take a great deal of care, whom she pitched upon; because that man she pitched upon would be hanged.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might be there?</p>
               <p>Raminger. There were, I believe, 14 men and women. I believe there were 10 men. The child looked round, and pitched upon the prisoner Baynham immediately, and said, This is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body touch the girl, at the time, to give her Information ?</p>
               <p>Raminger. I did not see any body touch her; I took particular care of that. Afterwards I desired one of their company to go along with me, to see that I did not temper that child; so we went and fetched the other child. I told her the same I had done the other. We brought her there. She went into the room, and, I believe, she was 3 or 4 minutes, and looked about, but would not speak. We pressed her to say, whether the man was in company or not. In the mean time there came an attorney in. He went between the prisoner and the girl, I thought, to baffle the thing. We turned him on one side, to let the child have fair play. Then I asked the girl, whether the man was in company, or not. She said, Yes. I said, Which is the man? Point him out. She would not. I said, Where is the man? She said, He stands by the fire. The prisoner had got up from the table, and put himself between two, and stood by the fire. I said, There stand three or four by the fire. Is it he with the pint mug in his hand? She said, No. I said, Which is the man? Is it this? meaning the prisoner. She said, Yes, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the two girls into the house?</p>
               <p>Raminger. The attorney took the biggest, and I the least, which was Hannet. They took us up stairs, and shewed us a back room, and said, This is the room. One of them said, Here lies a mat, which I tumbled over. They said, The bed did not stand this way. We looked about, and said, The room may be altered. There lay curtains in the window; when they were taken down we did not know. At going up there is a long entry, and the turnings make it very difficult to find out which is the fore room.</p>

               <p>Q. What was you rob'd of?</p>
               <p>Upton. Of a metal watch, maker's name White, a cornelian seal set in gold, and 11 s. in money. The seal had a head on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any pursuit after the person that rob'd you?</p>
               <p>Upton. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the number of the watch?</p>
               <p>Upton. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did the man take after he had rob'd you?</p>
               <p>Upton. He went towards Acton, and we came to town.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you?</p>
               <p>Upton. A young gentleman that is now at Oxford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch since ?</p>
               <p>Upton. I saw it about the beginning of this week. It was advertised, and I went to justice Fielding's, and there I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the seal since?</p>
               <p>Upton. No, I have not. (The watch produced in court.) This is the watch which I lost at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it to be your watch ?</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040030"/>Q. How long have you had it?</p>
               <p>Upton. I have had it about 4 or 5 years.</p>
               <p>William Norden. The prisoner was apprehended last Monday was sennight. I was ordered to search him in Mr. Fielding's office: I took this watch, and two others, out of the seat of his breeches, wrap'd up in an old news paper, in the tail of his shirt. Justice Fielding asked him, how he came by them: he said, He found them in St. James's park, at the root of a tree.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you ?</p>
               <p>Norden. I am an officer in the Palace court.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to search this prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Norden. I had him in custody, he having been arrested before we took him before justice Fielding; and there were pistols found in his pocket: so he was taken before Mr. Fielding on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a thief catcher ?</p>
               <p>Norden. If you will define what a thief-catcher is, I will tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you employed to go and apprehend people charged with felony?</p>
               <p>Norden. I have apprehended a good many in my life time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you when you took the watch from the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Norden. There were several there. Here is a man in court, his name is Hull, who was by.</p>
               <p>Will. Hull. I was in Mr. Fielding's office, when Norden searched the prisoner. I saw him take out three watches, from his breeches, wrap'd up in a news-paper.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say upon that?</p>
               <p>Hull. He said he found them in a news-paper, within an old handkerchief, lying at the root of a tree, near the Mall, in St. James's park.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how he came to be apprehended?</p>
               <p>Hull. I had a writ against him, and was at the arresting him, at a coffee-house in the Strand; and going along with him, by the corner of St. Martin's-Lane, his coat knocked against me. I said to Mr. Breaden, I believe the gentleman has got pistols in his pocket. We both laid hold on the skirts of his coat, and found pistols. We took him to Peal's house, near St. James's-Church, and locked him up. I was desired to go and acquaint his father of it; for he was arrested by the desire of his father: but, when I was gone, the pistols were taken out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The reason why I had pistols in my pocket was, I was told a gentleman called me coward in a coffee-room, and I was determined to call him to an account for it. The night before I was taken, I was walking in the park very solitary, and found the watches wrap'd up in that paper, and an old rag, betwixt the walk and the mall.</p>
               <p>To his Character.</p>
               <p>William Northwood. I have known the prisoner ever since he was born.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his character ?</p>
               <p>Northwood. I never knew any thing of him, but what was very honourable and just, till this time. He has been frequent in my shop; he has always kept the best of company. I never knew he kept bad company in my days.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Northwood. I live in Gutter-Lane, Cheapside.</p>

               <p>Dickson. I did not see any that he had. I gave him my purse; then he said your watch, your watch, be quick. I gave him my watch.</p>

               <p>Dickson. I can't tell any thing of his horse (the watch, seal, and chain produced in court.) I never took so much notice of the watch as to know it again; there may be others like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the seal.</p>
               <p>Dickson. This is the seal that I lost; it has my coat of arms on it.</p>

               <p>Dickson. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you buy the watch that was taken from you of?</p>
               <p>Dickson. I bought it of Mr. Ellicote.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you always register your watches which you sell?</p>

I saw the prisoner at the bar lay hold of the deceased and give him a push; and by the force of the push he tumbled him down, as he was about a foot within the lost; he then roll'd out, and fell to the ground. The room was about seven foot from the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the push in anger, or in play?</p>
               <p>Dickson. I can't say he was much in anger, but he was much in a passion, or he had never done it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his passion?</p>
               <p>Dickson. The reason was, so far as I heard, he desired some of them might go out of the lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased one of the workmen in the lost ?</p>
               <p>Dickson. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business there ?</p>
               <p>Dickson. I suppose he came to drink a pot of beer with his friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any blows or push happen between them, before he pushed him down ?</p>
               <p>Dickson. I saw no anger, only that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to them, when he fell ?</p>
               <p>Dickson. I was within 4 or 5 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any angry expressions by Brown ?</p>
               <p>Dickson. I heard him say the other had no business in the loft.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased sober, or fuddled ?</p>
               <p>Dickson. He was fuddled, or in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that push have flung any body down that was not in liquor ?</p>
               <p>Dickson. What I said I shall say no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing he had push'd you as hard, if you was sober, would that have flung you out of the lost?</p>
               <p>Dickson. He push'd him and he fell down.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a place did he fall in?</p>
               <p>Dickson. A gravelly sort of a place. He said, Oh! Brown has hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Osgood died, or not?</p>
               <p>Dickson. I never saw him after he fell.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did Osgood come into the lost?</p>
               <p>Dickson. I can't tell to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been there an hour or two?</p>
               <p>Dickson. No, not so long.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in liquor when he came first?</p>
               <p>Dickson. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the men go in and out where he fell?</p>
               <p>Dickson. What I have said I shall say no more.</p>
               <p>Court. Consider, you must tell the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Dickson. It is what they call a door.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any ladder there?</p>
               <p>Dickson. There are steps, or else they could not go up.</p>

            . I was in the loft at the same time, drinking a pot of beer with the deceased; there were five or six of us, and we drank three full pots. Mr. Brown, who is the foreman of the ground, bid us go away out of the loft. I said, I will go as soon as the last pot is out. He walked down and came up again, and said, I see you are not gone. Mr. Tuney said, If I was foreman, I would take and tumble those scoundrels out of the place. Then Brown came up in a violent passion, and gave the deceased a push; and he fell down flat on his face on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Osgood drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Williams. He was much about half drunk. Brown came in a violent passion and took hold of me next, and said, I'll turn you out after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Williams. I was as sober as I am this moment. I went down and helped to turn the deceased on his back; he could not speak for 5 or 6 minutes; he was blooded in about 8 minutes. I asked him how he was. At last he said, I am very weak, I can't move my head, legs or hands. He was put in a chair and carried home, and died in about 24 hours after the accident happen'd. His private parts were swelled as big as my two double fists.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased a man belonging to that shop ?</p>
               <p>Williams. No, he was not; he and I both work'd at captain Huddy's.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had you there?</p>
               <p>Williams. We went to see a workmate, and to drink with him. Mr. Tuney said to Mr. Brown, I believe you have been the death of the man. Mr. Brown said, he did not care if he had killed him, why did he not get out of the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the deceased for health before this fall?</p>
               <p>Williams. He was as hearty and well as I am at present.</p>
               <p>Q. If the man had been quite sober, would that push have flung him down?</p>
               <p>Williams. I can't say.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been drinking in this loft ?</p>
               <p>Williams. I believe about an hour and a half, or two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. How many full pots of beer had you in the loft ?</p>
               <p>Williams. We had three amongst six of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner at first desire you in a very civil way to go out of the loft?</p>
               <p>Williams. He came up in a violent passion first of all; but he desired us to go out of the loft, when he was below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer was made by the deceased ?</p>
               <p>Williams. I made answer and said, As soon as the pot is out I'll go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased make any answer ?</p>

             and the deceased were wrestling together; Harrison flung him upon the hemp, and he got up and flung the other. Then Mr. Brown the foreman came and asked what that noise was. He was answered, They are playing the rogue. Then he desired them to go out; they said they would as soon as the pot was out. He said, If they did not go out directly he would come and turn them out; then he came and took hold of the deceased's skirts, to put him out, and by the scrambling he fell head over heels.</p>

            . On the 16th of September, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, several people came running to me, and desired I would go to a man that had fell from this hemp loft. I went, and found the man lying on some small bundles of hemp. I examined his head, and found no fracture on his scull. Then I observed the other parts of his body, to see if he had received any injury from the fall. I found none. The deceased complained of a pain in his neck. I opened him. He was so intolerably in liquor that he (raising himself up) said He would bruise me too, not knowing me. I advised them to get the parish chair, and send him home to bed. I gave him diluting liquors, in order to carry off the effects of his drinking. The next morning I visited him again, and found his pulse high, rather from the quantity of liquor than the appearance of any accident. There was a great extension of the abdomen and erection of the penis, which was not caused by a bruise, but the heat of the blood. I apprehend the swelling of his belly and the other symptoms that he had were the effect of liquor, and not the consequence of a fall or bruise, there being no discharge by stool or urine. I used some method to reduce the penis, took an instrument to draw off some water, and ordered him some internal medicines. The people about him, as usual in such unhappy circumstances, were more in a hurry to do what they termed justice, than to give him relief in his disorder. I found they did not provide anything that I ordered, such as water-gruel, broth, and the like; but they rather kept giving him a little wine, under the notion of comforting him. The fever continued, and I visited him again at four in the afternoon, when I found his pulse falling; and he died that night about ten or eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search him after he was dead?</p>
               <p>Spang. No, I did not; as he lay in bed, I turn'd him, to see if there was any discharge by stool, when I saw a little extravasted blood or bruise on his loins.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the fall was the occasion of his death ?</p>
               <p>Spang. I do not think it could.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason the body was not opened?</p>
               <p>Spang. I never had application made to me for such a thing; neither do I apprehend, if it had, that it would have given the jury any knowledge of the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body's being in a state of putrefaction the cause of its not being opened ?</p>
               <p>Spang. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you think he died of the bruises, or not?</p>
               <p>Spang. I do not think he did die of the bruises: that is my opinion, upon oath.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you look upon was the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Spang. I look upon it, that it was a fever from his excessive drinking.</p>

            . I keep a publick house; but I have cured many that have had white swellings, when they have been deemed incurable. I cure bruises also.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you cure more than you hurt?</p>
               <p>Wild. I do. I saw the deceased. I never went but once to him. I observed him swelled vastly. No bladder was ever blowed up more: his private parts were thicker than my arm. I said, What signifies bringing me here ? His head was very much bruised, and his neck, and so down to his loins. I said, I can give him a little ease: I can let him blood; but he is a dead man. I went home, and met one of the jurymen. He asked me where I had been: I said, I had been to bleed a dead man; for; if he is not dead, he will be dead before night, he being so internally bruised. I never saw a man so bruised in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you saw him?</p>
               <p>Wild. I saw him about 11 o'clock, on the 17th. He was, from the crown of his head, to his loins, all down his back part, on his left side especially, to bruised, that I never saw any thing in my life like it, some part of his body being as black as my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Wild. I do think, by his bruises, the fall was. I dare say his bladder was burst. I said, How did you get these bruises? It must be wilfully done. He said. The foreman, where he had worked, threw him out at the window. He talked of going to law. I said, You had better think of a future state; for you are a dead man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>About half an hour after 12 o'clock, those people were drinking below; when I came back, I found them drinking in the loft. I went away to the lower part of the ground. Coming back I heard some words: I said, This is not a drinking place; and desired them to come down. After that I went up, and took hold of the deceased's arm, and desired him to go down; he said, He</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040035"/>would go down by and by. I said, If you must drink, then go to a publick house, this is not a place to drink in; and gave him a shove. I turned round to Mr. Williams, and said, I am surprised at your coming where you have no business; you stop all my men from work. What account can I give to my master? I never touched him; I was not within 9 feet of the deceased, when he fell from the lost.</p>
               <p>There were a great many witnesses to his character; but the court thought it needless to call them.</p>

            . I work at Mrs. Read's. On Saturday the 1st of November, about 7 at night, it was quite dark, I was standing upon the threshold of the door; I heard something crack: I looked on the outside, and saw the parlour window shoved about half way up. I cried out, Thieves. Eliz. Bedford said, she saw a man get out at the window. I looked and saw him too.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man?</p>
               <p>Ray. I am sure the prisoner is the man. He ran down the street, and I followed about 20 yards; but I did not see him stop'd. I do not know how he was taken. He was brought to the door about an hour afterwards, to ask me, If he was the man. I said it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched?</p>
               <p>Ray. I do not remember he was. There was a capuchin, somelace, and a tea-pot missing. The prisoner was carried to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you know him to be the prisoner? You say it was dark.</p>
               <p>Ray. I saw him walk up and down the street several times that evening before, with another man. He was dressed in a sort of a claret colour'd coat, a red waistcoat, and white wig.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see another man with him, when he was getting out at the window?</p>
               <p>Ray. I did; he stood at the window to receive the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain this is the man?</p>
               <p>Ray. I have no doubt about it; I am quite certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window fastened down?</p>
               <p>Ray. It used to be fastened; but I do not know that it was then</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was shut down?</p>
               <p>Ray. I am sure it was; for we have things hung at the window to shew what we sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stand near the window the man got out at?</p>
               <p>Ray. I stood on the outside, on the threshold: there were two sashes; he got out at that farthest off from me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you heard something crack. What was that?</p>
               <p>Ray. That was a looking-glass in the room; the cord was cut, and the top of the glass turned downwards. They had not time to take that away.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. How far was you from the window, when you saw me, as you say, come out ?</p>
               <p>Ray. I was at the end of the window, at the door. The window goes out with a sort of a bulk from the threshold of the door; and there is about the breadth of a large shutter, which parts the two sashes.</p>
               <p>Q. How large is the room in which these two windows are?</p>
               <p>Ray. It is not very large.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a lamp at the door.</p>
               <p>Ray. No; but there is one opposite our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe the prisoner's face ?</p>
               <p>Ray. He got away so quick that I could not. I saw his cloaths as I ran after him, and as he got out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you did not see his face, pray what do you know him by ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040036"/>Ray. By his cloaths, his height, his shape, his make, and his wig.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he walk'd by the door, did you see his face?</p>
               <p>Ray. Yes, I did several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the same man, by his face, you saw that afternoon?</p>
               <p>Ray. Yes, I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask her another question.</p>
               <p>Court. You seem to hurt yourself by your questions. You had better leave it to your council.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would only ask her. At the same time she saw me come out at the window, whether there was any body with her?</p>
               <p>Ray. There was nobody with me. I saw a man standing on the outside of the window, as I said before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same man you saw with the prisoner in the evening?</p>
               <p>Ray. I think it was the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that man?</p>
               <p>Ray. He went away presently after I came to the door. He had a light coloured furtout coat on.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Read. Upon Alhallows day at night, about seven o'clock, I had done my business, and was sitting down, minding my mistress's shop. The last witness was standing at the bulk, at her mistress's door. She call'd to me and said, Pray Betty come out, for I believe there is a man in our parlour, robbing us. I told my mistress. What! she said, and ran out in a great surprise; and saw a man shuffle himself from off the seat of the window; but, it being dark, I cannot swear to him, nor to the colour of his cloaths. He jump'd from the window, and ran to the opposite side of the way, towards Cripplegate. I call'd stop thief.</p>

            . On the 1st of November, about 7 o'clock, as I was coming down Jewin-Street, I heard the cry of Stop thief. A man stood by me. I turned my head round, and saw a window open, and directly a man came running by me, as fast as he could. I ran after him, and took him at the first butcher's shop, near Cripplegate church.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man ever out of your sight till you took him.</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Hughes. There came another man to my assistance. We told him there was an outcry of thieves, and he must go back with us. He said he would not, but he would go with us into a publick house. We brought him by the church, and when he came to the butcher's shop he pull'd out his watch, and look'd at it by the light there, and said I'll make you pay for detaining me, and that he'd go back with us; but when we got to Jewin-Street end he ran down Redcross-Street, and down the Bowling-Alley, and got over same pretty high pales. I ran to the door that belongs to the yard, and told the people there was a thief backwards [the prisoner in getting over the pales lost his hat.] The people let me in; then I saw the man run up a long narrow nook in the yard. I got hold of the stump of a birch broom, but was afraid he might have something about him to do me a mischief, if I followed him there in the dark. I went on, and a man followed me. Then he got over some other pales. I heard the pales break. I look'd over where the pales were broken; there I saw him lie close under the pales; it is an old ruinated house. I said I was afraid to get over, fearing a dog. There was a link gone for; we cut the link in pieces, and lighted them up, and hunted about, but could not find him; then we gave him over; and in about a quarter of an hour after I heard he was taken, and in Barbican watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dress'd?</p>
               <p>Hughes. He was in a light wig, and a chocolate colour'd coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the other man that was with you?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I don't know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that man's face you took near the butcher's shop?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I did, and to the best of my knowledge the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first lose sight of that man ?</p>
               <p>Hughes. When he was lying under the pales in the Bowling-Alley, when I said I was afraid of a dog; then the prisoner started up, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was the prisoner taken?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I believe it was very near seven o'clock when I took the man I suppose to be him; and I heard he was in the watch-house about a quarter of an hour after. When I heard a man was taken, I went to the watch-house; there was the prisoner without his hat, and a sort of a white cut wig, such I had seen on the man before. I took him to be the same man I had taken before in the street.</p>

            . I live in Whitecross-Street. We had an alarm of a man coming over the pales into our yard. My mistress sent for me; I came. She told me to go and see if I could see any body; I went and look'd about, but saw no body. In about half an hour after a child said there is a man coming out of an empty house. The man ran as soon as he heard the child say so. I saw him. He ran up some part of Whitecross-Street, and down Beech-Lane, and into Redcross-Street; and either by knocking himself against a post, or by his foot slipping, I don't know which, he fell down; I went and took hold of him, and brought him to Mr. Read's house; and there the young woman said that was the man that she saw get out at the window. Then we carried him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the Bowling-Alley was it where you first saw him?</p>
               <p>Radery. I first saw him within twenty yards of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hat on then ?</p>
               <p>Radery. No, he had not. He had on a red shag waistcoat and a chocolate colour'd coat. He said let me look at my watch, which I did, just before he went into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you take him to the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Radery. About half an hour after seven.</p>

On the 3d of November I was informed by her mistress she was gone, and had taken her boxes away, and left the door open. Having missed things before, I went up to my room, examined my portmanteau, and missed 7 guineas which I had left tied up in a silk purse the day before. About 3 or 4 hours after that, her mistress was informed by the porter, who carried her boxes, where she was in Westminster. I went to justice Fielding and took out a warrant; then went with her master, and found her in a publick house. She cried very much, put her hand in her pocket, and gave me her purse.</p>

               <p>Waters. No, it was not, for that was left empty. She told me, there was my money. I turn'd it out, and found 6 guineas in gold, and 12 s. 6 d. with a pair of knee buckles of her mistress's, which she acknowledged. She was taken before justice Fielding, and there confessed she had taken my money.</p>

On Monday the 3d of November I got up at 7 o'clock, and rang the bell for the maid to rise. A little after that I heard her get up, and go into the parlour and open the windows. I went to sleep again, and then people came and knock'd at the door. I got up, and found the street door open. I went into the kitchen, and found the prisoner's boxes gone. I then went to the person who recommended her to me, to tell him. When I return'd, my wife told me the prosecutor had been rob'd; then I applied to find the porter who carried her boxes, who told me where he had left her; we then got a warrant, and took her up. [ The re the prosecutor had deposed before.]</p>

I missed 2 silver table spoons, last Monday was a month, from out of a glass case. I took the prisoner up, and charged her on suspicion, having no other person in the room. She used to lie with my mother. At first she denied it, but at last she owned the taking them, and said they were both in pawn in Oxford-Road, at two separate houses. Justice Fielding ordered the constable to go with her, and bring the pawnbrokers before him. We went, and took the prisoner with us; and found one spoon at Mr. Hudson's, the other at Mr. Jones's.</p>

               <p>Hannah Jeffreys. I live in White Hart yard. About 3 or 4 months before the deceased died, she frequently came to my shop, and made very great complaints of her husband's ill using of her, especially on the 15th of October last; then she came with her face very much bruised and bloody, and said, O madam, I am murdered! I asked her by whom, she said by a creature, or whose, her husband's cousin, and then shewed me her breast, which looked very much bruised. She desired I would go with her to justice Fielding's, to obtain a warrant against the person. I said that was what I did not understand, having never been on such an account. To let me see how pressing her case was, she told me her husband said to the woman, Now cousin do you go and get a warrant first, left some people should advise her to get one for you, and I will say she struck you first, and you must say so too, and we will do for her. Upon this, with great persuasions, I went with her to justice Fielding's, and from thence I went home again, and my husband was gone out. In a little time after I went to where the prisoner Jeffreys lodged, in Lamb's Conduit passage. Red Lion square, where I found the deceased, her husband, and another woman; the deceased told me her husband had broke the door to let the woman out, left the warrant should be served upon her. I asked him how he could suffer so fine and just a woman as this was to be insulted in so cruel a manner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his answer?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. He swore she deserved it. I asked him, If he really considered the consequence? Because she had told me before, that he had attempted to cut her throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with nothing but what the wife told you?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. I charged him with what she told me and another evidence. One thing was, One night, when they were going to bed, he lock'd the door, put the key in his pocket, and, with a case knife in his hand, went up to her; that she cried, and beg'd, for God's sake, that he would not murder her. He swore he would kill her: he then threw her on the bed, and beat her; then went to uncover her throat, and she shriek'd out, when her landlord came up to her assistance. I told him also of his bidding her go three nights out of the room, saying, Lord have mercy upon me! I think I see the devil before my eyes: pray go out, for fear of bad consequences. There was

               <p>Q. Did he deny it ?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. He made a sort of a laugh at it, and said, She look'd pretty with those marks upon her face. When she was very much scratch'd and bruis'd, he would say to her. You are purely painted. That same evening the deceased came to my house, and complained again of the violent hurt she received, and the great pains in her stomach, breast, back, and belly. She pulled out her breast, which looked black in several places. She then told me,

             came that forenoon, when her husband and she were at work, and began to upbraid her with something that she should have said to her prejudice. She told her, if she was come to make an uneasiness between her and her husband, she desired she would go out. Upon that Dove told her. She would not go out, except her cousin should bid her. She told her, if she could meet her on the other side of the water, she would do for her. Then the deceased took her gently by the arm, in order to lead her out. Upon that Dove struck her, knock'd her down, fell upon her with her knees, held her down by the hair of her head, tore out her left breast, and cronch'd it in her hand, and beat her in a most unmerciful<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040040"/> manner. While Dove was beating her, her husband was at work on his board, who cry'd, Well done cousin. - At her again. - Do for her. - If you murder her, I'll forgive you. When her husband thought she had done for her, he got off the board, and said, Enough, enough. Then she believed, he imagined she was dead. Then he said, Cousin, do you go and get a warrant for her first, left some person should advise her to get one for you; and I'll say, she struck you first; and you must say so too: and we will do for her. She could then hardly speak. I desired her to come and be at my house, till such time I had got her a place, which he himself petitioned I would; but she did not come, I think, till the Saturday after. Thursday, the 16th, she brought home a pair of stays her husband had been mending. She then complained again of the great hurt she had received, and shew'd me her breast again, which was green, black, blue, and all colours. I saw her several times after the 16th: she always made complaint; especially on Wednesday the 29th of the same month, on which day her husband came to me, and beg'd I would go and see her; and said, He believed she could not live, reflecting upon himself for his cruel treating her, and begging God to spare her life, that he might be better to her than he had been. I asked him, If he had had any proper help for her; he told me, No. He said he had given her some salts the day before. I beg'd he would have some proper help for her. He said, he would have an apothecary; but he was afraid it would be expensive. I went in the afternoon. He was gone out. He came home and brought some tea with him. She told me then, she was very glad to see me, and reflected upon me for not coming sooner. I told her, I was in great hopes it might be better, if please God she recovered; and said, He seemed to reflect upon himself for his conduct. Says she, Madam , did he say so to you, that he would be better? Don't believe him; for; since he came from you, he has used me very ill, and he wants me to go to night to ruffle him a shirt. She spit upon an handkerchief and said, See what a fever I am in; see if I am an hypocrite.</p>
               <p>Q. How did what she spit upon the handkerchief appear?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. It look'd thick, and was like a sort of a matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any blood, or other colours in it?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. I did not take great notice of it. I observed it to look like thick white matter. Presently came in a woman unknown to me; but I found she was a cousin of his; she began as well as she could, and said to her, I am murder'd, your cousin Dove has done this; presently after that Jeffreys came in. I beg'd of this young girl not to say any thing to him, fearing he should use his wife ill. She said she would not. I made some tea; the deceased drank it in a very ravenous manner, like a poor creature a dying. As we were sitting by the fire, the cousin being by, the deceased said, you laugh because you think you have got my life amongst you; but if you have, somebody shall get your's; if I die, I'll lay my life to that woman's charge (meaning

               <p>Q. Did you see him laugh?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. Yes, I did. I kept my eye a little upon him, and in about two minutes after I catch'd him laughing at her. I asked him how he could behave so before me, to whom he had come with his complaints, and now to sit and make game at her. He said I laugh to divert her. I said what game can you make with a dying woman; fetch an apothecary; I insist upon seeing one before I go away. He went. Just before the apothecary came in, I found by some words she express'd, she was quite light-headed. The apothecary told me he believed she was in a very bad way, and would have let her blood; she was much afraid of being let blood, having never been blooded in her life. The apothecary said he would send her something to take that night, and try what another day would do.</p>

             in what manner he had treated her; he did not much deny it then, but said he did it to fright her; the other said, if this woman should die, that fright will go very bad with you. We persuaded him to go home and behave well to her while she lived. The next morning, I think the first of November, he came more like a man delirious, than a man in his senses, with great reflections upon himself for his past conduct, wishing the ground might open and take him in - Oh! that dear good woman - The best of women - She whom he had scourged - Oh! that he might be in her place. He desired I'd go with him, which accordingly I did, and found her quite as bad as any woman could be. That fine blooming face was cold, pale, and green; I could compare it to nothing but one of the figures in Westminster Abbey. I had said to him, I will send my own physician; but my husband thought it not so convenient. When the prisoner found I would not send him, he made a great many equivocations about sending for one himself; and said he had not money; besides (says he) the apothecary says it signifies nothing, she is a dead woman. I insisting he should fetch a physician, he went and fetch'd Mr. Eakinside from Bloomsbury-Square, who came and found what a way she was in; he ask'd what was her disorder, and I related to him what she had told me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this in the presence of her husband?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. It was, and Mrs. Bates and others. I came home that day, and did not see her till Tuesday the 4th, the day before she died. Then he came to my house, and beg'd for God's sake, I would go along with him to justice Fielding, to obtain a warrant to secure

            ; I desired him not to leave his wife while she was alive, and said it would be time enough to secure her when she is dead; he said absolutely he must take her up; that the physician on the Monday morning had told him, he should not attend his wife any more, and that he should say your wife has not come to her death fairly, this is not an affliction of God Almighty; and if you are an honest man, you will take care of that woman. I said, has the physician said this to you, he said yes he has, and he has frighted me to death. I said don't take her up till she is dead; he said, madam, I can't help it; my wife has spoke something to me this morning, which is like a judgment upon me if I don't take her up.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she get a warrant against Dove, or against her husband and Dove.</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. Against Dove singly; she did think to have put him in.</p>
               <p>Council. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. Because I bid her not, thinking it was very hard meddling with her husband, because she was going to a place as soon as she could get one.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. In Lamb's Conduit passage, Red-Lion square.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. I live in White Hart yard.</p>
               <p>Council. They are a pretty way distance; are they not?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a person so bruised walk it twice a day backwards and forwards; she must be a spectacle to the people as she went along.</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. So she was, but she did come; it was with great difficulty she could speak, every word she spoke she was obliged to make a great heming to clear herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she walk it, or did she come in a coach?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. I imagine she walked it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with her?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. I think I have been acquainted with her 3 or 4 months.</p>
               <p>Council. I think you say you never saw him strike her; did you ever see any thing but love and affection?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. I never saw any thing like it; I don't keep company with fighters.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you first acquainted with her?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. She came for things that I sell in the shop, as buckram, and other things which they use in their trade.</p>
               <p>Council. Might not he look uneasy because his wife was ill?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. I did not think him a loving husband.</p>
               <p>Q. When Atkinson was at your shop, what did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. Mr. Atkinson asked him how he did, and said he looked ghastly, and very ill; upon that I repeated to Mr. Atkinson what I have now, That if she died she laid her death to the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention any thing of his attempting to cut her throat, while he was present?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. I attacked him before Mr. Atkinson for attempting to cut her throat, and forcing her out three separate nights, fearing bad consequences.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. He said, I will have done with all this tittle tattle, she shall not talk any more of me, for if she don't die I am determined to get rid of her some way.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you have not said you would do for the prisoner Jeffreys ? (a word you are mighty fond of.)</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. When she declared on the 29th at night, if she died she laid her death to that woman's charge, she said you laugh to think you have my life, but if I die somebody shall get yours.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what did you say upon that?</p>
               <p>Jeffreys. I declared before him, if she died I would take care to do her justice and him too.</p>

            . On the 16th of October at night, I came to the deceased's lodging, I knocked at the door, she knew my voice, and said, O Mrs. Bates, I am murdered! She came and open'd the door; who has been here, said I; says she my rogue of a husband's cousin (Dove) has done it, and the cause was, because I told my husband she had another husband, and he encouraged her in it. He was there, and said he did not. She said you rogue, you dog, you did, wringing her hands and crying. I said, go along with me, and lodge with me. She said, I am going to Mr. Jeffreys. I said you shall not to night, it is too far to go, lodge with me. She came out, and I stood at the stair foot, thinking she would follow me. He came and locked the door;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040044"/> she did not follow me, and I heard no more of it that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening was this?</p>
               <p>Bates. This was at almost nine at night. On the 17th I came to her room in the afternoon; she shewed me her breast, that was very much bruised, and her face was scratched. She said my body feels worse to me, I imagine they gave me a blow that will take away my life; but my breast is very full of pain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her breast?</p>
               <p>Bates. I did. It appeared very much bruised, and black in several places. She told me, Jane (her cousin Dove) gave it her. At night she came to lodge with me, and said, he bid her go out, or it would be of worse consequence; I said what can he mean by that. On the 31st he came to me, and said my wife is very ill, and he thought she would die. Sure, said I, you have not let it go so far, and not let any of her friends and acquaintance know. I went to see her, there was Mr. Chandler and Mrs. Smith in the room; when I went in, she did not know me at first, but in a little time she did. I was with her from that night till she was buried. She told me that Dove had one hand in her hair, and beat her on her left breast with the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her husband by when she told you this?</p>
               <p>Bates. He was. This was the 31st at night, and he did not deny it, though she mentioned it several times. She said also, my rogue of a husband encouraged her to beat me more.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you upon the coroner's inquest say, the first time you saw her was on the 31st.</p>
               <p>Bates. I told him I did not recollect the day, but since I have recollected it.</p>
               <p>Q. from Dove. Did I take up any weapons to hurt her?</p>

            . The deceased came to me on the 16th of October, as soon as she had received her wounds. I heard some body coming up stairs in a very great hurry, she came in, and said, see how I am murdered, look at my breast; it was very much bruised indeed. I said who has done this; she said my husband's cousin Dove took me by my hair with one hand, and with the other laid hold on my breast, and when I was down kneeled her knees upon my body, and bruised my breast in her hand; and her husband was by at the time sitting at work on his board. Said I, did he not get down to take your part. Yes, she said, when I was almost murdered, but not before; he sat and said, well done cousin, beat her, if you murder her I will forgive you. She said, she believed he did not get down at last out of love to her, but out of fear, left he should come into trouble himself. That very day she desired me to go along with her for a warrant. I said, I could not then, being busy, but will come to you in the afternoon. When I went he was sitting at work, but the prisoner Dove was gone. While I was there Mrs. Jeffreys the first evidence came in, and taxed him with driving his wife out; he told her it was good enough for her; she need not interfere with other people's affairs. Mrs. Jeffreys desired the deceased to go home with her that night, and they went out together, and I saw them no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased relate the affair before her husband that night?</p>
               <p>Louth. She said, the same before him as she had said at my house. I came there again the Sunday after, she was in a chair by the fire very ill; her husband told her she need not have fought. I saw her again on the next Sunday, she was then so bad she could hardly walk at all. She said she did not know how she should get home, her knees knocked together, her bruises at that time were very black.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her after that?</p>
               <p>Louth. I think I saw her on the Wednesday after along with Mrs. Bates, the last evidence. I saw her no more till after she was senseless. She continued all along in the same story, that she had received the bruises of her cousin Dove.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she shew you her bruises on her breast and body?</p>

               <p>Q. Was you often in company with her and her husband?</p>
               <p>Louth. Sometimes once a week, or once a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a temper had she ?</p>

I said I would be there in half an hour. I went; and she was very fearful of being bled. Then I said, Stay till to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find her?</p>
               <p>Ayling. She was in a very high fever, and delirious, as appeared by her tongue, pulse, and other symptoms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any marks of violence upon her?</p>
               <p>Ayling. No, I did not; I did not look for any. She was sitting in a chair. I advised her to go to bed. I observed she fetch'd her breath with difficulty. Her husband was there, but did not say what was the occasion of her illness. There was a gentlewoman said, her husband had used her very ill; but that was waved off.

            . I never saw the prisoner's wife but once in my life; then I met them both together in the Strand. I was at Mr. Jeffrey's shop on the 31st of October, when Mrs. Jeffreys and he were talking. He said he wanted to be shut of her. They had a good deal of talk together; but I went to a publick house, and had half a pint of purl. I asked him, if these things were true. He said, What signifies owning any thing ? It does not avail any thing. I heard Mrs. Jeffrey's tell him about locking the door, and sharpening a knife. He said, he did it to affright her.</p>
               <p>Dove's defence.</p>
               <p>The deceased came to my house to pay me a visit. She desired me to come the week after: I, being sick, did not go; but the week after that I did go. She let me in, and said, How do you do cousin, very kindly. I said, How do you do again. She said, Sit down. I did. We talked together, and fell out. She came and struck me three times and fastened her hands in my hair, and threw me out of the chair, and called me her husband's whore. I struck her again. Her husband said, Don't quarrel here. I let go her hair, and she struck me again. Then her husband bid me go home about my business. She tore my cap all to pieces, and brought a pail of water, and flung it at me; then took up a chair, and said, D - n you, I'll knock you down. Her husband said, My dear set down the chair, and don't kill her. She went out, and lock'd me in, and said, If I cannot do for you myself, I'll bring somebody that can. I said, For Christ's sake let me out, for I shall be murdered. He said, He could not, for she had lock'd me in. I said, Unlock the door, and let me out. He took an iron thing, and let me out. I went home. Whether I struck her or not, I cannot say; but what I did was to defend myself, or I should have been murdered by her.</p>
               <p>Jeffrey's defence.</p>
               <p>I was at work when this woman came in, in the manner she has represented. They began to quarrel, and fell to scratching one another. I call'd to them, and said, For God's sake don't let us have words or blows here; sit down. They did for half a minute; then they rose up again. This gentlewoman got hold of my wife's hair with one hand, and her breast with the other. I jumped from my board, and got my wife in my arms, and said to this woman, If you cannot meet without quarrelling, do not come any more. My wife got to the door, and shut it after her, and said, she would go and fetch a warrant for her. I never saw my wife till two hours after that, when she brought a warrant. For my part, I softened and parted them as soon as I could. I did not apprehend any danger at all of destroying life:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040046"/> bruises to be sure there were; my wife's nose was scratched, and the blood started out of it.</p>

She had been married three years to the prisoner; and she said to me, when she had been married half a year, that she believed he would make one of the best of husbands; but her temper was such, that she could never let him have a quiet hour. She said, she was of the temper of her family; and they are all very scandalous with their tongues.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live in Spalding?</p>
               <p>Chipingdale. I lived eleven years there; and my character, I believe, is very good there, as I never did amiss.</p>

               <p>Williamson. About a fortnight before this happened, she and her husband were at my house. I said, I heard her husband was cross to her. She said, he was not so bad to her as I had heard; for he was an industrious man, and strove to live in credit.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Workingshaw. I was nurse to the deceased in her illness. She had a violent fever and convultions. She had some bruises. I was with her from the Saturday till the Wednesday following, when she died. Her husband behaved very well to her. He never left her night or day. She was never in her senses above a quarter of an hour. After she was dead, I laid her out. She had three trifling bruises on her left breast, which, had they been all together, my thumb would have covered. She had no marks on her face. The time she was in her senses was about half an hour after four, the day she died, when I stood on one side the bed, and her husband on the other; then she said, Who is that? He said, My dear it is I Who are you, Jeffreys? Yes, said he. She said, My dear I thought you had left me - Don't for sake me. He reply'd, I will not. She threw her arms round his neck, and saluted him; and he her.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Chandler. I keep a shop in Lamb's Conduit Passage. The day after this affair happen'd I said to the deceased, madam, what is the matter with your face, it is terribly scratch'd. She said, my husband's cousin has done it, look at my breast and see how black it is. I look'd at it and saw three spots. I said, what occasion'd this quarrel? she said Dove's husband came to me, and I acquainted him she had left a husband in the country; and he went home and let her know it, and she came and used me in this manner. I said who was by? she said my husband. I said why did not you put him in the warrant?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040047"/> she said because he never touch'd me; and he will not let me serve the warrant.</p>

            . I heard the deceased was ill, I went to see her, as being an old acquaintance. When I came there she was dead; there I found three women, Mrs Bates was one of them (the others I did not know.) I asked her how the prisoner behaved to her in her illness. She said he let her want for nothing; he allow'd her a doctor and apothecary. I have heard the deceased say, that though she was of a bad temper, yet what she ask'd for he did never deny her. I remember Mrs. Jeffreys the witness said once to me, are you subpaena'd? I said yes, I had two. She said, had you a shilling with them?

               <p>Q. Where were they married?</p>
               <p>Sevane. At the Savoy chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Who married them?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I believe it was the prisoner at the bar, by what I can recollect of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him now, and tell us as well as you can?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I think it was him.</p>

               <p>Sevane. He lived in the parish of Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. And where did Miss Portier live?</p>
               <p>Sevane. She lived in the parish of St. Anns.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the Savoy chapel in the parish of Covent Garden?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I don't know what parish that is in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any questions asked about consent?</p>
               <p>Sevane. Yes, there was. The last evidence and I, the night before the marriage, had heard the mother say her daughter was at liberty to marry whom she pleased. I believe she had made some endeavours to persuade her against the marriage before that; but she said her daughter was at her liberty, and the daughter called the last evidence and I in, to hear her mother say that.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040049"/>Q. Where was the father?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the father's opinion at that time?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I never heard the father's opinion before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you heard of it since?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I have heard since that he disapproves of the marriage. The mother said to us, you may tell the parson that marries them he never will be troubled by any of our family.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Council. You say you was present at this marriage?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the minister refuse to marry them till he heard of the consent?</p>
               <p>Sevane. He did. We told him what the mother had said, and he said, he thought that consent was not sufficient, but if we had it signed by the mother, that he took to be sufficient; and upon that he married them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing said by her of having authority from her husband?</p>
               <p>Sevane. She said we might assure the parson that married them that none of her family would trouble him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you understand by that declaration that there was the consent of the father as well as the mother?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I imagined there was a kind of an understanding between the mother and father.</p>
               <p>Q. How an understanding?</p>
               <p>Sevane. That she spoke from what she had heard the father say.</p>

               <p>Death. He is named Michael.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her mother's name?</p>
               <p>Death. She is named Claremon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any banns published, or licence for this marriage you speak of?</p>
               <p>Death. There was not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sevane. Was there either, can you tell?</p>
               <p>Sevane. There was a kind of a licence, but I don't know what that was; it was something upon parchment, and the vacancies were filled up.</p>
               <p>Q. Filled up by whom?</p>
               <p>Sevane. I believe by the clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present ?</p>
               <p>Sevane. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that licence fetched from the Commons, or the archbishop of Canterbury's office ?</p>
               <p>Sevane. It was taken from out of a cupboard or off a table in the chapel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I intirely rest upon your lordship's judgment. I did not knowingly do it to offend against the laws, of my country; it is not probable I should do such a thing knowingly when I married my own son there. I never knowingly or wilfully transgressed the laws of my country; I married them by a licence, and that I thought a proper authority.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you still continue putting them down in this manner?</p>
               <p>Philips. We do, but do it more perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see in any register any alteration, where it was by a different licence?</p>
               <p>Philips. I think I have seen two instances, one by licence from the archbishop of Canterbury, and the other from the bishop of London; all the other licences are by the minister of the Savoy.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you thought you was aiding and assisting in any fact contrary to act of parliament, when you assisted in these marriages?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, I did not. I thought them good licences.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you ever knew any jurisdiction as to the bishops of London or Canterbury to be exercised in this chapel ?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, I never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever look upon yourselves to be under any visitation ?</p>

               <p>Q. In what light did you look upon it?</p>
               <p>Philips. I look'd upon it that the minister himself was ordinary, and sufficient to grant licences.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the form of your licences?</p>
               <p>Philips. The form of them is this '' That whereas '' such and such persons, aged so and so, are desirous '' to live in the holy state of matrimony, without '' publication of banns, &amp;c. therefore he consents '' that the same be solemaized in St. John Baptist's '' chapel; and signs his name

               <p>Philips. It was before it was fill'd up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of the marriage of Vernham ?</p>
               <p>Philips. I do. I remember it was very remarkable. Vernham and miss Porteir came three or four days running, and desired to be married; they were refused because she was something under age. They could not be married unless she had her friends consent.</p>
               <p>Q. Who refused it?</p>
               <p>Philips. Mr. Grierson and I did. The last day they came, they brought two gentlemen along with them (who have been sworn ) to facilitate the marriage. She said she had a father, but her father and mother had been parted several years; but she said, as for me my father does not care if I go to the devil. We said you must have the consent of them, or else you must not be married. Then Mr. Death and the other gentleman went to the mother with a paper; for miss said she would never go home till they were married; and upon this the two gentlemen returned, and produced the mother's consent, and they both testified it, and said they saw the mother sign it; and we made them sign their names and places of abode. Then we fill'd up the licence, and they assented to every part contain'd there. The one declared himself a batchelor, the other a single woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you don't think Mr. Grierson used such caution for fear of offending against an act of parliament?</p>
               <p>Philips. He was very cautious.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you beleive that to be a good licence?</p>
               <p>Philips. I did believe it to be as good a licence as any from the archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use such caution in general?</p>
               <p>Philips. He did. There is the utmost care taken not to break into the law.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole, whether Mr. Grierson did not appear as a person that took the greatest caution not to offend against this act of parliament?</p>
               <p>Philips. He acted with great caution, rather to excess.</p>
               <p>Q. How many couples have been married in the Savoy chapel since the commencement of the act?</p>
               <p>Philips. I reckon about 1400 couple</p>
               <p>Q. How many hundreds of them lived in the precinct?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040052"/>Philips. There were many came distress'd from out of the country, big with child.</p>
               <p>Q. How many families live in the precinct?</p>
               <p>Philips. Really I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell to the best of your knowledge.</p>
               <p>Philips. There may be thirty or forty families.</p>
               <p>Q. How many couples do you judge might come distressed out of the country?</p>
               <p>Philips. There might be 900 come big with child, some who could not be married any where else.</p>
               <p>C. for Crown. Was you appointed surrogate ?</p>
               <p>Philips. I was appointed clerk, not surrogate?</p>
               <p>C. for Crown. Did you take your oath to do your duty as a surrogate under the bishop?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, I did not. I did not apprehend I had any thing to do with the bishop.</p>
               <p>C. for Crown. Where might Mr. Wilkerson himself be at the time of this marriage?</p>
               <p>Philips. I believe he was not far off.</p>
               <p>C. for Crown. Did he appear publickly then?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the occasion that he did not appear?</p>
               <p>Philips. There were bills of indictment and warrants against him, and he thought proper to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. What might these bills of indictment be for?</p>
               <p>Philips. They charged him with clandestine marriages.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go away on the account of these bills?</p>
               <p>Philips. He went away some time towards the la tter end of May.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the time that he applied to this honest innocent gentleman to solemnized marriages in his stead?</p>
               <p>Philips. In May.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before the bills of indictment or after?</p>
               <p>Philips. It was after. Mr. Grierson married his own son at that chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Wilkerson keep a curate before these bills of indictment were found?</p>
               <p>Philips. He has had some.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Grierson officiate in the church in reading prayers, or preach?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, there is one Mr. Brooks does that; he neither reads prayers nor preaches.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Wilkerson a curate to solemnize marriages before?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, he always did that himself.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it possible he should think of Mr. Grierson ? how did he find him out? is he a settled minister ?</p>
               <p>Philips. I really can't tell; he used to appear in his gown as a clergyman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever marry other people before; because I think Mr. Wilkerson would look out for an expert hand ?</p>
               <p>Philips. He did not look out for him at all; as he was obliged to abscond, application was made for a person to fill up that part. People would come to be married, and we must have somebody to do it, or they would think themselves very ill used.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made this application ?</p>
               <p>Philips. He was sent for by Mr. Wilkerson's order.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to think of Mr. Grierson?</p>
               <p>Philips. Because a little before he married his own son there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the licence of the marriage of Vernham and his wife set forth that they lived?</p>
               <p>Philips. It sets forth that he lived in the parish of St. Paul, Covent Garden, and she in St. Ann's, Soho.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever take down where they come from?</p>
               <p>Philips. Always, that is put down in the minute book.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you married them let them come from what parish they would?</p>
               <p>Philips. We did, let them come from what parish they would in England and Scotland. We married one couple that came from Dumfreis, and another from Dunbar in Scotland.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever prove wills?</p>
               <p>Philips. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever grant letters of administration?</p>
               <p>Philips. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been there?</p>
               <p>Philips. Only about five years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Mr. Wilkerson's salary been stopped by the lords of the treasury?</p>
               <p>Philips. About two years before I came, as I have heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Grierson know the reason of Mr. Wilkerson's not being able to do the duty himself?</p>
               <p>Philips. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they conceal it from him?</p>
               <p>Philips. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied to him for this licence?</p>
               <p>Philips. I did myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever take an oath concerning persons under age?</p>
               <p>Philips. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you fill up the licence without an affidavit?</p>
               <p>Philips. When he is absent I fill them up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040053"/>Q. Did these two gentlemen make affidavit?</p>
               <p>Philips. No they were willing to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who takes the affidavit when Wilkerson is absent ?</p>
               <p>Philips. The minister that marries them does.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know an instance where Wilkerson or Grierson took an affidavit?</p>
               <p>Philips. There have been some; I never took any.</p>
               <p>Q. How many out of the 1400 ?</p>

               <p>Philips. I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. You were saying something of banns, were they that were married by banns people of your own precinct, or of other parishes ?</p>
               <p>Philips. They were of other parishes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know Mr. Wilkerson or Grierson proceed against any of these 900 women, that came big with child, for fornication ?</p>
               <p>Philips. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Grierson did officiate any where else before?</p>
               <p>Philips. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear he married people before he came to the Savoy?</p>
               <p>Philips. I have heard say he did marry people at May-Fair chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear himself say so?</p>
               <p>Philips. I can't recollect I ever did.</p>
               <p>The licence read to this purport.</p>

I he'd up my whip, and said, What do you mean? He said, D - n your blood your money in a minute, or else you are a dead man. I said, In a litt'e time he should have it, only give me leave to take off my glove. Then he said, Dispatch (two or three times) or you are a dead man. I pulled out my money, which was about 14 shillings, and gave it to him, thinking he would have gone off. He then said, You have a watch. I then said, I had none. He said, I'll search you. Then I pulled out my watch, and said, If you will have it, take it. It was not quite dark, even when I had reached Whetstone-turnpike. He was not above three quarters of a yard from me. I know the prisoner is the man. I since saw him and the watch at justice Fielding's.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any thing on his face?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce any instrument to you?</p>
               <p>Hughes. He produced a horse pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time of your being lobbed till you saw him again?</p>
               <p>Hughes. I was robbed on the 27th of September, and I did not see him till the 10th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. What condition was he in then?</p>
               <p>Hughes. His head was bound up, but he had the very self same face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not there appear to be a bruise on his face?</p>
               <p>Hughes. No, there did not to my knowledge?</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was he shewed to you, or did you pitch upon him?</p>
               <p>Hughes. The door was opened, and the moment I saw him I said that was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there together?</p>
               <p>Hughes. There were, I believe, 8 or 10 people in the room.</p>

            . My boy had been out of an errand on the 20th of October, about nine at night he ran in, and said there was a pistol gone off, and a horse ran along with a man; I ran out, and there lay the prisoner on a bench, bleeding at his temple, and people standing round him; I said, for God's sake let us get him to the hospital. As he lay I saw the head of a pistol under his coat, I took it out and gave it to a gentleman to hold, and looked to see if there were any more. Then we carried him to the hospital, where I took his breeches, and found two half crowns, a bullet and some loose powder.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He fell from his horse at the corner of Great Russel-Street, adjoining to Tottenham-Court road.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he going?</p>
               <p>Taylor. My boy said he was coming to London.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did the prisoner give of himself?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He was not capable of giving any account of himself that night. I went to justice Fielding's the next morning; where was justice Welch, and he went with me to the prisoner, and asked him where he had been; he said he had been at Brentford to see his master where he had worked; he was asked how he came to come down that road; he said he crossed the country for a ride. The next day there was this robbery talked of, and some country farmers came to our door, and said a man had stopped serjeant Draper's man. I had the horse he rode in my stable.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse was he ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. A black horse, upwards of fifteen hands high.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What sort of a horse did the person ride that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He rode a black gelding I believe.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Mr. Welch ordered me to bring the prisoner to him. When he was there Mr. Welch asked him what pistol that was that went off; he said somebody had pursued him to rob him. Mr. Welch asked him if he stood in his own defence; he said no, but he turn'd up a lane, and the highwayman followed and fired at him. Mr. Welch asked him if he himself had any pistols; he said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or Mr. Welch tell him you had found one upon him?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think he was in his senses ?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I can't really say; he spoke some things sensibly, but he was in a sad case.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that pistol charged which you took from him?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, it was discharged. Justice Welch and I went to his lodgings, and broke open a little box, and found a brace of balls and two gun flints. He sent us wrong at first to his lodgings, saying he lodged at a place in Westminster; and at last we were informed by his master he lodged at the Dial in Queen-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He is a journeyman baker.</p>
               <p>Natious Jourdan. To the best of my knowledge the prisoner is the man that brought a watch to me, which was advertised in Mr. Fielding's paper. ( produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lend him upon it?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175512040055"/>Jourdan. I lent him 35 shillings upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at this watch, do you know it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the very watch I was robbed of, here is the name

             on it, and it winds up very weakly.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jourdan. When was this watch brought to your house ?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. It was brought on Tuesday the 17th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever brought any thing to you before?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring it by day light?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. It was, but I can't tell the time to an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive the prisoner is the man that brought the watch?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. I don't take upon me to be positive, but I believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know him by?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. By his face; he has a remarkable face.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. I live in Bedford-street, Red-Lion-square, Holbourn.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time you saw him after the watch was brought to you?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. I saw him in New-prison about three weeks after. Mr. Fielding order'd me to go and look among a number of people, to see if I could find him.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. There were I believe 15 or 16. I saw no body else like him; so I pick'd him out at once.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there so remarkable in his face?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. A long nose and a down look; and when I heard his voice at Mr. Fielding's, I told Mr. Fielding I thought he spoke like the man; and I told him the prisoner was the same height.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a cap or a wig on when he brought the watch?</p>
               <p>Jourdan. He had a cap on. Since that at Mr. Fielding's I saw him in a wig.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is that watch your own?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No. I borrow'd it; but I was to pay so much money for it. I had that watch 4 months the last year.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The pistol I took was for my own security, having heard that several robberies had been committed on that road; having a little money about me (but tho' I had not much of that, I had a life ) I thought proper to take sufficient care of myself.</p>

            . I am nurse at the Middlesex-Hospital, in Tottenham-Court road. The prisoner was brought in there on Monday night; he was very much cut, and had lost a great deal of blood. The surgeon was sent for; and to the best of my knowledge he was not in his senses, and could not give reasonable answers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what he did not give reasonable answers to?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. If I carried him a mess of water-gruel, he did not know but it was broth.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adkins. I am a nurse in the womens ward. The prisoner's sister came to see him; after that he desired I would go for her, to come and see him. I said she had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Adkins. This was on the next morning after he was brought into the hospital. I ask'd him how he did? and in the afternoon told him his sister had been there; he said he did not know she had been there. This was after Mr. Welch had been there.</p>

            . I was taken up by my master, who is a chaser, upon suspicion of robbing him of some prints, and carried before justice Fielding, who committed me. There was at the same time one Wigmore, a stranger to me, who was committed also. We were handcuffed together. Going along Longacre, in our way to the Gatehouse, a parcel of people came behind us: one struck me cross the shoulder, another cross the loins, which brought me to the ground. I did not know the meaning of it; but soon found they wanted to rescue Wigmore. As we were fastened together they took us away through several turnings, till they brought us into the Long Fields. The prisoner was one of the rescuers. The prisoner demanded six-pence of me to file the irons off. I gave him six-pence, and he and another went to buy the files, while another man stood with us there. When they came with the files, they brought us near a lamp, at the entrance of the field; there Wilson attempted to file the hand-cuffs off from Wigmore. They were afraid of being discovered, as they were so near a lamp; so they agreed to go to a room of their acquaintance: upon which they carried us into <placeName id="t17551204-45-crimeloc240">Gray's-Inn-Lane</placeName>

Then I said, I hoped they would release me, as they had done the other. Then Wilson said, Let's see what money you have got. I told him, I had but little. He put his hand into my pocket, and took out 10 s. and three halfpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he threaten you at that time?</p>

Then Wigmore said I have got no money; I will pawn my coat. Then the prisoner put his hand into Innis's pocket, and took out some money, and said here's nine or ten shillings of it, and held it out in his hand; after that he said do you grudge it, if you do, take it again; and put it back into his hand. No, said Innis, I don't grudge it, and gave it him again.</p>

            . Mrs. Hammond lodged at my house. The prisoner was my servant. Mrs. Hammond missed the goods mention'd, and the prisoner absconded from her service. I went up and down to see if I could find her. She was found on the Tuesday, and had the gown on at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it on her?</p>
               <p>Nugent. I did. We have got most of the goods again. She came up to town to look for her husband, and was in great distress. She heard he was in town, and I believe she took the things through vanity, with intent to appear before him, and to return them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she had seen her husband ?</p>
               <p>Nugent. I don't know that she had.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods have you got again?</p>
               <p>Nugent. All but the capuchin and tea tongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what she had done with them?</p>
               <p>Nugent. She said she had pledg'd them somewhere in Tyburn-road, but could not tell the place; there were two of the handkerchiefs missing, but she said she did not take but two. She cry'd bitterly when she saw me, and beg'd my pardon. She behaved herself very well with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I did intend to bring these things, back again. I had not seen my husband till last Friday, which was the first time I saw him since I came to London. I met him accidentally in the street, the day I went away; and I went to him.</p>
