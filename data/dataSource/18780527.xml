This letter renewed the application for employment, and concluded "Should you not appoint me to a surveyor's or clerk of the work's place, I shall split on Sir Henry Hunt and others as to the Foreign Office contracts and other jobs. The Foreign Office was Mr. Kelk's job, and Mr. Hunt, the surveyor, was bribed, I can prove it."

I produce a letter of April 26th, and envelope, addressed to Mr. Noel. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Right Hon. Sir,—I have received a summons to attend at Bow Street police-court on Tuesday next as to an alleged libel on Sir Henry Hunt. I certainly fail to see any libel. I shall subpoena witnesses who can prove I am correct.

I was present at the conversation about it in my private office at Mr. Kelk's, at South Street, between Mr. John Kelk and Mr. Joseph Taylor. I saw Mr. George Kelk, the cashier, hand Mr. Taylor the cheque. Mr. Taylor was sent by Mr. Kelk to Mr. Hunt's office with it and the tender, and I saw Mr. Taylor give it to Mr. Hunt, and I had a glass of sherry with them in Mr. Hunt's office. Mr. Kelk, Mr. Taylor, and myself made out Mr. Kelk's estimate. I shall stand my ground; at the same time my letters are private to the Office of Works among yourselves.")</p>

Smith and Taylor, who succeeded Mr. Kelk, were the lowest tenderers—that was in August, 1863, and they carried out the work—as far as I was concerned, everything that was done with respect to the Foreign Office was done in the ordinary course of business—I have known Sir John Kelk for a great many years, and have been engaged by him as a surveyor very largely—in 1858 I was engaged to buy the land and to build the large station and make the great works at the Victoria Station, Pimlico; that was a work that required the outlay of some hundreds of thousands of pounds—I was engaged by him to buy the land, value it, and assist in that matter, and I was paid in the ordi<lb/>nary way by him for those services—if anybody desires to inquire into it I can give the particulars.</p>

I live at 3, Grosvenor Square—I was formerly in business as a contractor and builder in an extensive way—I had in my employ in a responsible capacity a gentleman named Taylor—he succeeded me when I retired, in partnership with Mr. Smith, who is since dead—I sent in a tender for the original Gothic design for the Foreign Office—mine was the lowest tender; it was never carried out—ultimately an arrangement was made by which the concrete foundations were put in, not by me, by Smith and Taylor—there was an undertaking to make the Victoria Station, its approaches, and the bridge, I had to buy the land, and I employed Sir Henry Hunt to make a valuation of it, and it came to 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the lands alone—in October, 1858, and January, 1859, I forwarded him two cheques for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on account of his services rendered in respect of that work—there is not the slightest foundation for saying that at any time I gave him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a bribe to induce him to get my tender accepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I believe Kelk is my right name—at the time I tendered for the proposed Gothic Foreign Office I was a master builder at Westminster—I do not think I delivered the estimate myself—I don't know who went with it—I did not have any conversation with Mr. Taylor about bribing Sir Henry Hunt with 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—nor did I say "Let Pearson go with it"—there is not the slightest shadow of founda<lb/>tion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270014"/>
               <p>for it—I did not send a cheque for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Sir Henry Hunt with my tender, on that or any other occasion—I have paid him two cheques for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as has been stated; one in 1858, and the other in 1859, on account of the Pimlico Railway—I don't think I ever gave him a cheque on account—he may have received a cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no doubt I have given him a cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't think I took it myself—I can't say whether you assisted in making out the estimate for the Foreign Office job—it would be very small assistance—I can't say who used to write out my tenders—there were a good many clerks in the office—you were in my office at the time as a clerk—I should not think you would be likely to know Mr. Hunt at that time; you may have heard his name in the office—he was employed by me as a surveyor on private business at the time he was surveyor for the Office of Works—I think he was employed by me to take out the quantities for the Grosvenor Hotel—I do not remember sending you after Mr. Taylor on the occasion of his taking the tender for the Foreign Office—I do not recollect who took the estimate to Mr. Hunt—I imagine it did not go to him at all—I imagine it went to the Office of Works—I don't know that I ever knew you tell a lie, or accept a bribe—I transferred my business to Smith and Taylor—I never paid Mr. Hunt a bribe—I did not get Mr. George Kelk, my cashier, to get my banking book from Scott's to see whether Mr. Hunt had got the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque cashed, nor did I say, on seeing it,"He cashed it the same day"—here is the banking book, which shows that no such cheque was given, cashed, or drawn—I had not two banking accounts, or two pass-books—I only had one account—I had no separate private account—I can't say whether the tenders for the Foreign Office were delivered before 12 o'clock in the day—I do not remember Taylor coming back to South Street at about 11.15, and telling me that mine was the lowest up to that time—I think Sir Henry Hunt said that the estimates were opened by Mr. Austin, the secretary—I am given to understand there were 13 tenders—I did some work at Marlborough House some years ago—I do not know that the drains were very bad in 1862—Smith and Taylor did not do that part of the work—I can't say whether Sir Henry Hunt had anything to do with it—I had nothing to do with the estimate for the Foreign Office building that was erected; I was out of business then—it was Smith and Taylor's estimate.</p>

Sir,—I have no wish to injure any person in your employ, or say anything that may be deemed done out of spite, but I consider it my duty to inform you, the foreman, the witness in whom you placed so much confidence, was the very man to come to me and ask me to purchase some size, which he said (to use his own words) could easily be managed unbeknown to you, for he should be glad to make a few shillings, as he did not get much. I have a witness to prove what I say, and I think I am entitled to ask what dependence can be placed in a man who thus makes such a suggestion behind his master's back. It cer<lb/>tainly is rather a singular way of studying an employer's interest.—Yours respectfully, Henry Carvalho.")

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Donkin—on the evening of 13th April, about 10 o'clock, I went to the deceased's house, and remained there for about an hour and a half—the deceased, my mother-in-law, Mrs. Stevens, and myself were in the room—I believe he was about to be married to my mother-in-law—the table was set for supper—the deceased was a teetotaller, but I should say he was a very passionate man—he was sober for all I know—a knock came to the door, and the prisoner came in—I had never seen him before—he and the deceased had some conversation—I could not hear what it was; it was rather quarrel<lb/>some—a daughter of the deceased came in, and directly he saw her, without a word being said, he took up a glass of ale that was on the table and threw it over her—he then took a knife up to his son; he took it away from him; I got in between them, because the father seemed very spiteful to his son—I said to the deceased, "Do be quiet," and to the prisoner, "Don't strike the old gentleman"—he began to strike his father, and I took the lamp off the table, fearing it would go over—the prisoner punched his father on the side of the head, and he fell on the fender insensible—the prisoner then took the tongs and struck his father on the side—I should say it was a blow enough to do anybody a great deal of injury—his sister said, "Come away, you have done enough"—I was frightened and left—the deceased was then on the ground, on the fender—the sister had been standing at the door, half way in the room and half way on the landing—I went out and met a policeman—I saw the deceased again on the Sunday in bed, and he seemed very ill.</p>

I saw Mr. Walker standing on the landing; he was not in the room—I can't say whether he saw what was going on; Mrs. Walker did—it commenced with the father throwing the ale in Mrs. Walker's face—I don't think the son would have struck him but for that—I did not see him put up his hands and threaten to fight his son—I did not hear the prisoner tell his father to sit down, as he did not want to have any row—I did not see the father take a brass candlestick and throw it at Mr. Walker, or take up a poker and say he would knock the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road—I saw the deceased on Good Friday—he was lying on his back in bed, complaining of a good deal of pain about his ribs—I put my hand under his back and felt a fracture—he had been spitting a little blood—I put up the fracture in the usual way—I examined him—he talked to me for some time—I did not see the fracture; it was behind—I felt it with my hand—the two ends of the bone must have separated a little during the week when he was not attended to—the difficulty of breathing was caused by the fracture—a little inflammation of the lungs had set in, which increased very much—I continued to attend him—inflammation crept on the lungs in consequence of the fracture, and he died ultimately from the inflammation of the lungs on the 27th.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—I went into the deceased's room and saw him, the prisoner, and Mrs. Donkin there—the deceased was standing sparring up to the prisoner offering to fight him—the prisoner told him to sit down, that he did not want any row at all with him—the deceased then went to the fender and took up a poker and said he would knock his son's brains out if he did not clear out, and he struck him across the hat—the prisoner wrenched the poker away from him and threw it down, and when he was doing that he fell on the fender on his right side—he did not strike him—he got up again and scuffled again with his son—I am quite sure the prisoner did not strike him with the tongs—he pushed his father away from him and he fell across the table—the prisoner then went out on the landing and his father fol<lb/>lowed him with a brass candlestick in his hand and said he would "pay him" and struck him on the forehead with it—he has got the graze now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The fire irons were in the fireplace—the prisoner had his hat on when he was struck with the poker; it did not knock the hat off, it made a dent across it—in the scuffle the prisoner threw his father down on the fender—the table was not thrown over; the knives and forks were on the floor when I went in—the deceased only told his son once to clear out; he told me also to clear out—Mary Donkin was there when the deceased was thrown on the fender; I was standing by the room door; the fireplace is at the other end of the room—the deceased was 65 years of age.</p>

I live at 84, Stanhope Street, Euston Road—I am single—I was on the landing of this house and saw the quarrel—the deceased threw a glass of ale in his daughter's face—the prisoner asked what he did it for; the father said he would serve him the same, and he punched him in the throat and took up a knife and said he would stab him—the son wrenched the knife from his father's hand, then the father took up the poker from the fender and hit the son on the top of his hat; then the son wrenched the poker from his father, and then they fell against the table—the son did not strike him—he then came out of the room, and the father followed him with a brass candlestick and hit his son in the forehead.</p>

               <p>which runs over the Great Northern lines—on Sunday afternoon 12th May, at 5.15, I was driving an engine attached to a passenger train running from Winchmore Hill to Enfield—about 400 yards out of Winchmore Hill station there is an incline on a steep embankment—as we were going down that incline I saw a number of boys; through watching them I lost sight of my road for a moment, and when my sight came back to the road I saw this large sprag or piece of wood lying across the rail; the life-guard caught it and threw it down the embank<lb/>ment—I then proceeded on to Enfield and reported the matter—about 15 minutes afterwards we returned on the up line, and on approaching the Same spot I saw the same sprig again lying across the line fixed against the sleeper in such a way that I do not think the life-guard would have removed it—I applied the steam break and the guard's continuous break, and stopped the train before we came to it, or it would have thrown the train off the line—I still saw the boys in the field, standing looking at me—I recognise Pritlove and Jordan as two of them, and Hollingsworth was swinging on the gate of the coal yard a little farther on—there were nine or ten boys—I sent the fireman to pick up the obstacle, and seeing a Great Northern servant coming along I sent him after the boys—there were a great many passengers in each train.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dairyman of 98, Portland Road Notting Hill—the prisoner had been a customer of mine for two or three years up to July, 1877—he resided at 50, Addison Road North—in July he owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for milk—I applied to him from July to March several times for payment, when I met him in the street—I went to the house and found he had gone away and left an address where letters were to be forwarded—I made inquires but could never get a fixed place of residence where I could apply for the money—when I asked him for payment he would say "I cannot spare it now, you shall have your money"—on the 26th March I saw him outside my shop, and I asked him if he could oblige me with my account, as I was very short of money, or could he give me half a sovereign—he said "No, I can't I am short, of money, but I have a cheque at home, how long will you be before you go out again?"—I answered "About two hours"—he did not come that day, but next day he came about 1 o'clock—he said "I have got a cheque of my own, I thought it would be best"—I said "I hope it is all right," and he said "Yes, you needn't fear about that, my boy," and put his hand on my shoulder; he then wrote out this cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the London and County Bank. Hammersmith branch, dated 30th March; he asked me to hold it over till then—he said "I am going to receive a large sum of money, and I am going to pay away money"—I said "I don't mind; I am not going to pay no money away till the 30th; I have 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay away then; I shan't want the money before, I hope it will be there then"—he said "Yes"—he said "I have a small balance at the bank, more than enough to meet that cheques"—I then gave him four sovereigns—he said he couldn't spare more and he would have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing—he then left—on Saturday, 30th March, he came up in a hansom cab about the middle of the day, and asked me not to pay the cheque—I grumbled and said "I have not got no more money to pay away, I thought it would be there to-day or I shouldn't have parted with my 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I have got a bill to meet this afternoon"—he said "You needn't fear, the money will be all right," and he drove away—I shortly afterwards on the same day paid the cheque away to Mr. Cook, Mr. Wright's servant, for milk I had that week—on Monday I received this post-card from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I will pay into bank to-morrow about 1 o'clock, so don't pay in till 2 o'clock, shall call as I pass to-mor<lb/>row, about 9 o'clock.") I did not see him that morning but he called about 4 in the afternoon and said "I have been disappointed of some money, will you hold the cheque over for a few days longer?"—I said "I cannot, I have paid it away to Mr. Wright, 91, Euston Road"—I wrote the address down for him, and he left, saying he would go and take it up—on the following morning I received this note.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Captain Pilkington (retired 85th), of 2, Upper Woburn Street, Euston Square—on Tuesday, 21st May, about 10.45 P.m., I was in the Euston Road with my husband, brother, and his wife, and my little child—while I was saying "Good night" to my brother's wife my husband was crossing the Euston Road, and I heard him cry out "Maggie, I am murdered"—I left my baby and rushed across the road to my husband and saw him on one knee, and Cheesewright had his hand in my husband's breast pocket, pulling out his handkerchief—Wise was standing by—I put my hand down to take Cheesewright's hand from my husband's pocket, and Wise took my thumb and finger, and bit them—Cheesewright took up my husband's hat and ran away—I did not see Burns do anything—Wise ran away as the police were coming across the road, and I missed my cloak and my pocket-handkerchief, in which was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I remained with my hus<lb/>band, and Cheesewright was brought back by a policeman about 1 1/2 minutes afterwards—we then went to the station, and shortly after Wise was brought in by a policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I am the wife of Captain Pilkington, and have been married to him about nine years—I can write—I made my mark at the police-court—my finger was stiff—I was excited and didn't want my husband to prosecute—I am sure it was 10.45 when I left my brother's house—I heard Police-constable Taylor give evidence at the police-court—I heard him say it was 12.30, instead of 10.45—I would say he was right—I had a little baby one year and seven months old, and my hus<lb/>band was blind, and we passed the time over—I saw Wise for a minute while my finger was in his mouth, and he was biting it—my hand was on my husband's shoulder—I was not so excited that I did not know him. I didn't want to prosecute, because our business was important, and it was the cause of a great loss of money to us to stop in London—I don't re<lb/>member saying "The prisoner Wise, who was by, rushed at me and bit the thumb and forefinger of my right hand"—Wise was brought in between two policeman, and I said "Here is the boy who bit my finger"</p>

While Wise was biting my finger I had full opportunity of observing his face, and I am certain he is the boy—there was a gas<lb/>lamp near—he nearly broke my finger in two—I have not got the use of it—I have not recovered my cloak, money, or handkerchief.</p>

At 12.30 A.m. on the 22nd May I was on duty in the Euston Road, and saw Captain Pilkington kneeling in the centre of the road, about 30 yards from me, surrounded by the prisoners and about seven others—the captain was in the act of getting up from the ground, and I saw Cheesewright snatch his hat from his head and run—I ran after him for about fifty yards, and I caught him with the hat in his hand—I never lost sight of him—Wise and Burns ran down Duke Street, and I directed a constable to follow them—Burns had been pushing between Captain and Mrs. Pilkington, trying to separate them—I took Cheesewright to the station—on the way he said Mrs. pilkington had knocked her husband's hat off and he picked it up and intended to give it to the captain, but I distinctly saw him take the hat off—we all went to the station together, which is about 10 minutes' walk from the spot where this occurred—in about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes Wise was brought in and identitied by Mrs. Pilkington.</p>

I sell flowers in the streets—I live at 8, Draper's Place—I saw a boy run down the court at about 12.15, and Wise went in the passage opposite for a light and the boy ran in and shut the door and blew the match out of Wise's hand, who was waiting to go up to his brother's room—I don't know anything of the boys—I heard the boy who blew out the light run down a pair of stairs as if he was going to run into the kitchen—I heard him say "The police are after us, "and Wise said, "Police after who?"—he didn't reply, but went down the stairs, and the police went down after him—I had Wise under my notice for a quarter of an hour that evening—he walked up the court with a young girl—he didn't appear to have been running—he said his mother had been "shooting the moon, "and he had been helping her, and he was not going to do any more that night, but was going to his brother's to sleep—I had not known anything of the Wises before—I am a perfect stranger to everybody in Court—I spoke to the night-policeman last night who calls my husband, and he said "If I were you and you know anything of it, I should certainly go down and speak the truth"—I have not been paid for coming here, and I have no desire but to speak the truth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am still carrying on business as an indiarubber merchant, at 79, Upper Thames Street, City—in April, 1876, I saw an advertisement from a person requiring a partner, in consequence of which I communicated with George Pomeroy Dodge, 79, Upper Thames Street—I afterwards had a conversation with him—I received this letter of 18th April, 1876—in the result a partnership deed was drawn up—before signings the deed, Dodge showed me this letter: "Bermondsey Rubber Works, 79, Upper Thames Street, June 27th, 1876. Dear Mr. Dodge,—If you pay me interest by half-yearly payments on the money in your hands I engage not to apply for principal during the next 10 years unless I should in the meantime leave your employ. I write this letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270050"/>
               <p>in order to enable you to conclude your arrangements for a partnership with George Lewis. Yours, &amp;c., L. J. Stonard."The deed was signed a few days after June 26th—the bankers were to be Smith, Payne, and Smith—Dodge said Stonard had been in his and his father's employment 20 years, and he continued in the firm as confidential clerk and book<lb/>keeper—he kept the cash-book and the ledger, a rough cash-book, and the travellers' commission book—he had to post from the journal and clean cash-book to the ledger and check the bankers' pass-book—I produce a counterpart he kept of the pass-book—upon receiving orders they were entered on one side of this book and posted to the journal—a Mr. Daniels did that—there is also a bought invoice book kept in the same way—this was kept by Stonard—upon entering the partnership Dodge gave me a balance<lb/>sheet and statement of affairs of Dodge in June, 1876—this is the letter in which it was enclosed—it is written by a clerk and signed by Dodge—the statement shows creditors 1, 610<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., then there is interest at 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, making total indebtedness 2, 936<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., good debtors 1, 186<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., lease and other assets 2, 936<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., stock in trade 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., fixtures 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., bad debts 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the balance in favour of Dodge being 1, 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received this detailed list of debtors in Oram, a clerk's, writing—in it there is 188<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company—I sat at a desk with Dodge and did the correspondence mostly—I knew nothing of the detail of the business before; I found the money—Dodge was to conduct the active part of buying, &amp;c.—on 6th July, 1876, in pursuance of the deed of partnership, I gave Dodge a cheque for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—before that I had given him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to realise a charge on the lease—that was to be taken as part of my capital—on 13th September, 1876, I paid into Smith, Payne, and Co. 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 30th September, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10th October, 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., let November, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 24th November, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 27th November, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10th January, 1877, 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 17th January, 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1st April, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in all 2, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I ordered new books, "G. P. Dodge and Co." to be printed on them—the printers left out "and Co."—one incorrect book was used by adding "and Co."in ink—two fresh books, were ordered—"and Co." was also left out of a considerable number of invoices, and others were ordered—these are some of the old ones—two are made out by Dodge and one by Oram, of goods sent to the Vauxhall Water Company—I find no trace of them in my invoice book, nor in the bought book, nor journal—I had no knowledge that such goods had been sold until December, 1877—there is no entry of it in the ledger—there is no record at all of the goods being sold, nor from whom they were purchased—I did not know this cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been discharged, until the termination of the partnership—there is no record of it in any of the books (<hi rend="italic">This cheque was made payable to G.

This is one of our old invoices—it is in Oram's</p>

Dodge or order, and endorsed G.P. Dodge—the transaction ought to have appeared in the ledger, most likely under "Sundries," and the amount of cheque in the cash-book, and the details should have been given in the journal—we supplied our travellers with books, and the enclosed orders to us, keeping the counterfoil of each order—this is a sample of such book, and this is an order from Messrs. Samuels to our traveller Oakshott—it is Oakshott's writing—it was Stonard's duty to enter it into the commission-book, and finally pay it—there is no entry of it—the account was kept by Stonard—this is a similar order, dated 16th July, 1877, of goods from Pellatt and Co., there is no entry of that—I had no knowledge of such order until I received a writ alter the ter<lb/>mination of the partnership, in November—under advice I satisfied the writ—the amount is 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is no entry of any sum of money received from Messrs.

               <p>mission on East London Waterworks Company's order is receipted in Stonard's writing—the letter acknowledging the receipt of the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque is Stonard's writing—the cheque was collected after the dissolu<lb/>tion of the partnership—by the terms of the dissolution all debts due to the firm to 9th October were assigned to me—the deed of dissolution is dated 9th October, 1877—this is it—I received this list of debts from Turquand's—I have compared it with the ledger—it is signed by Dodge and myself—I find no entry either of Lett's debt of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nor of the East London Waterworks Company's for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the list—the liabilities of the firm were to be taken by me up to 8th September—I had not found out on 9th October that all the money I paid into the firm had gone, nor did I know of the other discrepancies—in my mind that list is part of the fraud—about three days before 9th October Mr. Dodge took our legiti<lb/>mate journal and turned it over, and said, "These are all our transac<lb/>tions; you see the business is going away from us"—that was at 79, Upper Thames Street—Mr. Stonard performed his usual duties till about 6 P.m. on 13th October—Dodge and myself attended—we went to Queen Victoria Street between 9th and 13th October—I gave no permission for the order-book to be taken there—shortly subsequent to 9th October a cheque-book was missing, the one we commenced with—I mentioned it to Mr. Dodge, and a second cheque-book was commenced—I first asked Stonard whether he had had it—he said he had given it to Mr. Dodge—I went to Mr. Dodge and said Stonard said he had given it to him—Mr. Dodge was angry, and said he hadn't got it—I suggested that we should advertise, and said I was willing to offer 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward—Dodge's solicitor said he had written to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> telling them not to insert it—the cheque<lb/>book was never found—at page 603 of the journal there is an entry of 1, 184 francs 5 centimes carried out in another column to 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. against Messrs.

Before coming into this business I had been trading in China and Japan, And two years prior to entering into this partnership I was a man at large, with no occupation—I employed Mr. John Trurin, an accountant, of Ironmonger Lane, to investigate the accounts before going into the business—also examined it myself—I attended daily, except Saturdays—in five or six cases I wrote orders from the order-book, and filled up the counterfoil—the first one is dated 25th November in this book. but there is an earlier book, and probably I gave some from that—these orders wore also written by me, 21st and 22nd February, and 10th August, 1877—some orders were improperly taken out of this book</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270053"/>
               <p>I believe before August, 1877—I didn't notice they were gone—I knew of two cases in which orders were taken out to supply some spoiled earlier in the book—I often had the book—the first time I noticed the orders were out was when one was brought by a dealer in October or November, 1877—I instructed Turquand's in September, 1877—I sat at the same table as Mr. Dodge—the table is 3 feet by 2 1/2; feet—Stonard sat behind me at a desk—I opened letters and answered them—so did Dodge—we advised together as to answers, and consulted the books—I believe Dodge is a very clever man—Daniels was the clerk who entered from the counterfoil into the journal—Mr. Hunter attested the deed, which was made in duplicate—I didn't ascertain whether the debts were paid or not till November, 1876—I made inquiries—I won't swear I asked Stonard about them—I consulted the books—I have traced the Vauxhall Water Company's cheque to Stonard's account, but no further—I have not tried—I didn't know of it till after the dissolution of partner<lb/>ship—I didn't at that time—448<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was placed to Dodge's credit—the 3,715<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was placed to my account, instead of 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took it for granted it was right—if there was any discrepancy I know it now for the first time—I cannot say that I noticed that the creditors had diminished from 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 367<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had perfect faith in Dodge and Stonard at those times—I noticed that by the June 1876 balance-sheet the firm owed me 4,574<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I have not discovered any error—I noticed Dodge had nothing to his credit by the June 1877 balance-sheet till August, and then I had an accountant in—we condoned the fact when we discovered Dodge did not bring in the 188<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from the Vauxhall Water Company—Mr. Dodge said to my solicitor "I am sorry about these debts, but the Mid<lb/>summer balance-sheet will tell a different tale," and my solicitor was satisfied with the remark—I knew that amounts were being paid to Dodge's private account, instead of to Smith Payne's, the bankers of the firm—the amounts in this book were entered by my instructions—it is in Stonard's writing—if it did not go to the partnership I do not know where it went—finding the debts did not come in three or four months after I entered the partnership I inquired and found some were paid—I said to Stonard "I must have these particulars," and he gave me a list—I said after that "I will have it in the book"—some pages were left blank for entering debts collected without my knowledge prior to November, 1876—Mr. Oram dealt with the ready-money transactions—the prisoner was given into custody on 29th March—I applied for a warrant at the Mansion House in November—an injunction was obtained against Dodge to prevent his opening letters—I opened letters in his presence, and he got an order to look at the books—I gave the prisoner a copy of what we call the secret journal, the one 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. reward is offered in if lost—the instructions from one brother to the other he never applied for—the prisoner's writing is in every page of this book—this is his writing, "Query: Wm.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). On 29th December I received from the Mansion House Justice Room a warrant to search 130, Queen Victoria Street, and went there with Mr. Lewis and saw Stonard—I searched and found these memorandum books and a little book (M)—Stonard sent for his solicitor and was present—on 18th March Stonard was given into my custody—Mr. Lewis was present—I found on Stonard this book, one of five, and some letters, as well as other papers not con<lb/>nected with the charge—I told Stonard that I apprehended him on a charge of conspiracy with George Pomeroy Dodge, not in custody, to defraud Mr. Lewis, and also abetting Dodge in committing a felony—Stonard said, "It is very wrong of you, Mr. Lewis, to charge me"—I hold a warrant for Dodge which I have not been able to execute.</p>

Before any cheques went to a private account they ought to have been entered in the books of the firm and have passed through Smith Payne's bank—Dodge had no right to appropriate Samuels' cheque—if he wanted money he should have drawn upon Smith Payne, and that would have been posted to his debit in the private ledger, which is an account between the individual partners and the firm—none of these amounts appear in the private ledger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Secretary of the Statistical Department, East India Office, and live at East Sheen—on the 15th April I was dining out—a message was brought to me and I went home at 10 o'clock and found the police in possession of my house—I missed from the dining<lb/>room a marble clock and a musical box, and from my bedroom a port<lb/>manteau with clothes and other things in it which I had left open in the morning—this is a list of them—I also missed a dark grey overcoat which I think was in the bedroom—I value the whole at about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a very old rough tweed coat was, about a week afterwards, brought to me by the police—on the 7th May I went to Worship Street police-court and saw Darcy there wearing the very coat which had been hanging in my dressing-room—I believe this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have not the slightest doubt it was mine—this other coat was brought to me by the police.</p>

I have not been in Portsmouth for many years—I do not go to marine stores there and did not meet Withers there—the policeman brought the coat to my house—I am quite certain about it—I have no other coat like it—it was made for me by a tailor named Wyatt—I had not worn it for about a year before the robbery—before the Magistrate I said that I was not quite sure about the wrist buttons, but when I got home I asked my wife how the sleeves were made—when I was examined on the 10th May I said "The coat produced I believe is mine"—that was the tweed coat, and on the 15th I was quite certain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Darcy</hi>. I recognise the dark coat by the general make, the manner in which it has been worn, the way it fitted me, and the colour and the arrangements of the pockets—there are four pockets and</p>

I live with my mother, who was keeping the prose<lb/>cutor's house—I was living in a cottage, but went to see her on this day about 5.10 as I came from school, and as I passed the front gate two men came round by the pillar box—Darcy is one of them—another man had the gate half open—Darcy had gone about two yards farther on and was looking about to see if anybody was coming—there was no horse and cart there—I said to the man who was opening the gate "Nobody is at home, sir"—I believe he came out, and Darcy turned to his companion and said "Come on, we will come back again"—they walked on about four yards before me to the Plough, and I went in at Mr. Waterfield's back gate, knocked at the door, and my mother opened it—I looked at the clock as soon as I got in, and it was exactly 12 minutes past 5—I wondered what time I should have to play at cricket and came out at 18 minutes to 6—I met some schoolfellows and then went back and saw a cart in front of Mr. Waterfield's, with one man in it with the reins and whip in his hand ready for driving, and two men by the cart—one man jumped up by the steps and got into the cart, and the other jumped up behind, and they were off like lightning—Darcy is the man who got into the cart—I then went and played at cricket.</p>

I did not pick you out at Worship Street, but when I got outside I spoke to the policeman—when I saw you at Richmond you were placed with several other men and I said that you looked very much like the man—I was certain you were the man directly I saw you, and I am certain now—I was not certain of you at Worship Street—I believe you are the one who got on the steps—I have not stated that you were the one that got in at the back of the cart—I did not see your face but I saw your figure—I did not see what coloured clothes you were wearing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hawker, of East Lane, Dartford—on Saturday, 4th May, I was driving through Dartford about 10 A.m.—I saw the prisoners standing at the door of a public-house—they called me—I pulled up—Bennett asked whether there was a fair or market on—I said "No, there is only a fish market on"—he said "Because I have a horse and cart to sell"—I said "Where is it?"—he said "The horse is in the yard and the cart in the stable," and I might buy it—I went and looked at it—I said "How much for the horse, cart, and harness?"—he said "I have been asking 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it now; I would as lief change it as sell it—I said "How much shall I give you to change my horse and cart?"—he said "6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "I will give you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—at last I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got a young gentleman in the public-house to write out a receipt like this one, and he guided my hand to make an X—both prisoners were present—I asked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270074"/>
               <p>Bennett how long he had had the horse and cart—he said "A good while"—there was no name on the cart—I showed it to my brother and in consequence of what he said I told the police, afterwards I went after the men—I caught them about a mile and a half on the London Road—Bennett said "You have had the best deal"—I said "Have I?"—he said I will give you half-a-crown to <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> again"—I said "I know a gentleman who will buy it if you will come back again"—t'other one says "Let's go back"—we got a little way along and he would hare a pot of ale—they came back to the public-house at Dart<lb/>ford, where I told them to wait while I fetched the man—I fetched a policeman, who took Bennett into custody, and I brought back the other man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Dartford Constabulary—the last witness made a communication to me on the 4th May and I sent him for the two men—an hour afterwards they were brought to the station by a constable and the last witness—the horse and cart were also brought—I said "How do you account for these, are these your own property?"—Bennett said they were, and produced a receipt with "W. Bennett, New Gross Gate" on it—I asked if that was his name—he said it was, that he was a dealer—I said "There is something wrong about this transaction"—Bennett said they were his own—he afterwards said he had bought them the day before at Deptford, and he appealed to White as to how long he had known him—White said he had only seen him two or three times, but ultimately said he had known him 12 months—both had been drinking, but knew the questions put to them—I found on Bennett 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., some keys, and a chisel; on White a latch or skeleton key, a hammer, knife, rule, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he first gave an address James Street, Poplar, and ultimately in Wandsworth, which I believe is correct—I made inquiries and afterwards told them they would be charged with stealing the horse and cart—Bennett said it was done in a drunken spree—White made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sheerness Dockyard—in 1866 I was living there with my sister-in-law, Miss Janet Gray—about April, 1866, she showed me an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> newspaper, relating to an advance of money, purporting to come from Mr. Wood, of 15, Dover Place, Kent Road—it was similar to this advertisement produced: "Money to lend, in town or country, to gentlemen, farmers, tradesmen, and others, from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and upwards, upon personal security. Interest five per cent. per annum. One to seven years. No commission or charge made. Also sums on mortgage at three and a half per cent. on freehold and leasehold property, for any term not exceeding 21 years. T. Wood, Esq., Solicitor, 15, Dover Place, S. E. Established 1829."—My sister-in-law was in want of a loan of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I answered the advertisement for her—I received by post a reply, dated April 3rd, 1866, on a letter with a printed heading: "15, Dover Place, and 178, New Kent Road, London, S. E., late 7, Cook's Court, Lincoln's Inn. T. G. Wood." (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the lady wishing to barrow must make application herself and give par<lb/>ticulars of amount and term, and would have to insure her life in an office named by him</hi>.)

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270076"/>
               <p>April I received this letter, addressed to my sister (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing a form of insurance proposal for the Albion, and directing the applicant to go to Dr. Ward, of Sheerness</hi>). My sister went to the doctor, filed up the form, and re<lb/>turned it, but I do not know where to. On April 18th I received a letter signed "George Thompson."(<hi rend="italic">This was headed "Albion Life Assurance Society, "and stated that the proposal of insurance for</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was accepted, and the premium was</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) On April 19th, I received a letter signed T.G. Wood. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that if a cheque or post-office order were sent to him he would get the policy</hi>.) Upon that I got a post-office order for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sent it to Wood. I afterwards received this receipt, dated 20th April, for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., less 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. The 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the doctor's fee. I afterwards received this policy (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), dated 25th April. On 1st May I received a letter from Wood, addressed "Dear Madam."(<hi rend="italic">This asked for the policy and</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to defray the law charges incidental to the loan</hi>.) On the receipt of that letter I went with Miss Gray to 15, Dover Place—we saw Mr. Wood—we introduced ourselves to him, and spoke about the advance—we asked him if there would be any difficulty in securing the advance; he said, "None whatever," upon which we paid him the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for which he gave us this receipt (<hi rend="italic">Dated 2nd May</hi>, 1866)—the policy was left with him—I afterwards received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Dated 3rd May, forwarding draft securities for approval</hi>)—the drafts were a personal bond, an assign<lb/>ment of the policy, a statutory declaration to be made before a Magistrate, something to be signed by two sureties, and a bill of sale—I recommended my sister not to entertain it for a moment, and wrote to Wood on the subject—I afterwards received this letter, signed "T.G. Wood," dated 5th May. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that all the drafts were in accordance with the written authority, and unless they were complied with the matter could not proceed</hi>.) Several other letters were received, and I think we saw Wood a second time—we received this letter, dated May 7th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the bill of sale must he registered</hi>.) On 9th May we received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the names of securities had not been sent</hi>), and on 11th May this letter (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the securities could not be dispensed with</hi>)—Miss Gray is not here; she is ill—this is a copy of a letter written by my wife—all the letters are my dictation, and signed by Miss Gray, who is nearly blind—I wrote the fair copy of this letter; Miss Gray signed it, and I posted it. (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to Mr. Wood, returning the papers received, stating that Mr. Harris would become her security, and requesting the agent to call on Monday to conclude the business</hi>.) We afterwards received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated May</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd, signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">T.G. Wood," stating that, having seen his client again, he declined to dispense with two sureties, and therefore returned the life policy</hi>.) I then sent this letter to the same address. (<hi rend="italic">This expressed surprise at the return of the policy, and requested arrangements to be made for the agent's visit</hi>.) On 28th May I wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that Mr. A, Mayall had consented to become the second security for Miss Gray</hi>.) To that we received this answer. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated May 29th, signed</hi> "<hi rend="italic">T.G.

On 1st June I got this letter on the same letter paper (<hi rend="italic">Signed "T. G.

On 4th June I received this acknowledgment, addressed to Mr. James <hi rend="italic">Hanley</hi>—I think I saw Mr. Wood twice, but this is twelve years ago—on 6th June I received this letter from 15, Dover Place: "Yours received. Mr. Wood will, on his return from Scotland next week, attend to this matter "—on 14th June Miss Gray received this letter: "Dear Madam,—Your proposed security, Mr. Mayall, has refused to become security for you, and I have received an extraordinary letter from Mr. Horsey"—I sup<lb/>pose I had upbraided him for raising the question of sureties—this is a copy of a letter of 15th June written by my wife, but indited by me; the rough was written first, and then I made the fair copy from my wife's writing, and Miss Gray signed it—it was signed unquestionably, but I have no recollection of posting it—I put it into an envelope, and addressed it myself to Wood at 15, Dover Street—I put it in a letter-box in the lobby at my official residence, which is cleared twice a day by a letter<lb/>carrier—it is impossible for me to say that Miss Gray never posted a letter or directed the envelope herself. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the writer had expended nearly</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and called upon Wood to complete the loan. Another letter from the same to the same, was put in, stating that Mr. A. Mayall was perfectly willing to become security, and requesting an immediate reply</hi>.) I then wrote this letter without date: "I have just received a note from my friend Mr. Mayall, in which he informs me that you have thrown suspicion upon my circumstances. My official salary is equal to 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."<hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">and threatening to hand over the whole correspondence to Mr. H. Chamber<lb/>lain, solicitor, of Chancery Lane</hi>)—on 3rd July Miss Gray received this letter from Wood, stating that his client would require a bill of sale, so much demur having been occasioned—I refused to give a bill of sale—I do not think I wrote to that effect, but the matter dropped, and the policy was not renewed at the end of the year—this is the printed pro<lb/>posal; it is filled up by Mr. Horsey and signed by Miss Gray—it is my impression that the heading had the name and address written on it when it came—I read the advertisement, and believed the terms stated in it—in 1871 I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> similar to this: "Money to lend," &amp;c. (<hi rend="italic">as before</hi>), apply to R.F. Preston, Esq., 120, Southampton Row, London, W. C.—I was in want of a small loan, and an<lb/>swered it, and received by post this letter, dated 17th June. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Contended that this was not evidence, as there was no proof of Preston's signa<lb/>ture or of who he was</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that he should prove that Preston was Alfred Shaw, who had escaped. The</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">considered that, although the letter was not evidence until it was connected with the prisoners, it was admis<lb/>sible as part of the res</hi> gestae, <hi rend="italic">the Indictment being against the prisoners and others for conspiracy</hi>.) This is the letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed" Reginald F.

I had applied for the loan for three years at 5 per cent., and sent the names of references—I then received a letter signed "R.F. Preston," enclosing form of agreement and consent to borrow—I did not keep copies of them, and am speaking from memory—I wrote to Mr. Preston at the same address on 22nd June, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270078"/>
               <p>sent the documents signed, and on the 23rd I received this letter: "You will have to give your bond, and assign the policy to me, R. F. Preston.") I afterwards received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was signed "R.F. Preston, June</hi>. 26," <hi rend="italic">and enclosed an insurance proposal, with directions to apply to a medical referee</hi>.) This form of the Albion was enclosed, and my impression is that my name and address were upon it when I received it—I filled it up for 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated it "27th June, 1871," and sent it back either to the office or to Mr. Preston—I afterwards paid the premium, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at the Albion Office, Chancery Lane. (<hi rend="italic">The receipt was here put in, and a certificate that the witness's life was insured, and that a policy should be prepared</hi>.) I got that at the office—I will not be certain whether the policy was sent to me or not—I then received this letter: "18th July. Dear Sir,—What are you doing about the insurance? Yours truly, R.F. Preston"—I called at 120, Southampton Row, which is a private house, and inquired for Mr. Preston—I think there was a lower office; but a clerk handed me upstairs, where I saw William Shaw to the best of my belief—I said who I was, and that I had called about the advance—he said that there would be no difficulty; I should have to insure my life and deposit the policy with him, and the advance would be made: no other conditions were imposed—my impression was that I was addressing Mr. Preston—I do not remember whether the policy was sent to me from the office; but I afterwards received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th August, asking for a post-office order for</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s. to defray legal and inci<lb/>dental charges</hi>.) I then wrote this letter: "5th August. Will you give me a written assurance that nothing in the shape of a bill of sale is in<lb/>tended, and on the receipt of your reply I will at once remit you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for legal charges"—on 7th June I received the reply from R.F. Preston, stating that a bill of sale would not be required—I then dent a post-office order for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Preston, and received this acknowledgment, and on August 10th this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing five draft securities for perusal and approval</hi>.) The securities were precisely the same as I had received from Wood, a statutory declaration, a bill of sale, and documents to be signed by two sureties, a bond, and an assignment of the policy—I think I sent them back, and said that I would have nothing to do with them—I then received this letter of 15th August from Preston. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that his solicitor advised him not to dispense with the securities, and asked for the names of two substantial securities before proceeding further</hi>.) I had, I think, called on the previous day at 120, Southampton Row, and saw the fourth prisoner, Mr. Preston (William Shaw)—I do not remember whether I took the documents with me; but I objected to sign them, and he said that they could not be dispensed with, or something of that kind—I then got the letter just read, and on 16th August I wrote a letter, of which this is a copy. (<hi rend="italic">This expressed astonishment at Mr. Preston's letter of yes<lb/>terday, and called upon him to proceed with the loan</hi>.) On the 17th I received this answer: "Dear Sir,—My solicitor states that you must give two sureties if you desire the matter to proceed"—the heading of that letter and the address is printed, but the "Dear Sir" is not—I called two or three times, but could not see him—I then sent this letter to Mr. Preston. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had made several attempts to see him at his office, and calling upon him to refund the</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s. which had been obtained by positive misrepre<lb/>sentation, in default of which the correspondence would be placed in the hands of Mr. Bristow, the solicitor to the Admiralty</hi>.) On 9th September I received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270079"/>
               <p>this letter: "Sir,—Herewith by this post I return policy of insurance. You had better instruct your solicitor to communicate with me"—I re<lb/>ceived the policy by book post—I then communicated with Mr. Copeland, a solicitor of Sheerness, and this is a letter sent to him: "September 15. Sir,—What I have done in this matter is in strict accordance with your client's written authority, dated 22nd June"—I produce a letter of 18th October from Preston to Mr. Copeland: "I can only refer you to my last. and am quite prepared to meet any proposal you may advise your client to adopt"—I did not renew my policy; it was only effected for the loan—at the time I paid my premium and sent the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I believed the statements contained in Preston's advertisement. Some time after<lb/>wards I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the insurance office to Mr. North<lb/>cott. (<hi rend="italic">Dated August</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>, 1872, <hi rend="italic">complaining that he had been defrauded, and asking the directors of the Albion to refund the money or to award him a reasonable surrender value</hi>.) I had no knowledge that Mr. Preston, or anybody representing him, had any connection with the Albion, or how the premium was disposed of—about 1874 I saw this ad<lb/>vertisement. (<hi rend="italic">This was an advertisement</hi> (<hi rend="italic">No</hi>,4) <hi rend="italic">from Henry Howard</hi>, 11. <hi rend="italic">Euston Square</hi>.) When I read that I went to 11, Euston Square—I believe it was a private house—the name of Howard or Holland was on the door—I knocked, and I believe the door was opened by Slinker—I inquired for Mr. Howard—he desired me to wait a few minutes—he went upstairs—I was shown upstairs, and in about 10 minutes Wood came in—I inquired whether there was any difficulty in obtaining an advance of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked "Where is Mr. Howard who advertises?" he said "You can't expect to see him, he is engaged in the City, "or words to that effect—nothing more passed, I was not with him more than two or three minutes—I recognised him as the person I had seen at 15, Dover Place, he seemed confused, I thought he recognised me unmistakably—I did not want a loan—I said "Good morning," and left.</p>

I cannot recollect very well whether the name was Holland or Howard, I think it was Howard, it is about four years ago—to the best of my belief Slinker is the man I saw on that occasion—Miss Gray is my sister-in-law—she is in a feeble state of health, and nearly blind—she has been ailing for years—I wrote the letters for her, being more accustomed to official matters—the money that was to be raised on her bond was not to be used to pay off loans I had made to her; there was an account between us—she resided with me as a member of the family for some years—she had a claim against me—she acted as a sort of nursery governess—she came from America about 1860, and has been living with me since—the money was to pay me a claim I had against her—the loan was not exactly for my benefit, I was to have had part of the money—her father, mother and brothers, and a sister were dead—I did not attend before Mr. Ward, the doctor who signed the paper—I think it was a Dr. Jack, of Sheerness—the loan was to be repaid in five years—we should have jointly provided the money for the repayment—Miss Gray has a small Government annuity, and the interest in some houses at Portsmouth; neither of those were to be se<lb/>cured for the repayment of the loan—I may have had small advances before, but whatever I have had I have always repaid—I did not pay anything like 40 or 50 per cent.—the loan of 1866 my sister required for repairing houses principally—I decline to answer whether I went else-</p>

               <p>where for the money when I failed to get this loan—I don't see that it has any bearing on the question—I had no loan transactions with other persons before 1866, I may perhaps have had one—I acted for Miss Gray in this matter—if I said that the name of Wood appeared in the Law List, I suppose I had referred to the Law List to see, before commencing the correspondence, I have no recollection, it is 12 years ago—I never commenced any proceedings at law against Wood, I had expended quite enough.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">These were a personal bond for</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">an assignment of the policy, a statutory declaration, a bill of sale, and a guarantee of two sureties</hi>.) On 1st May I received a letter on the same printed heading "Be good enough to forward the drafts to me with any remarks upon them. Yours truly, T. G. Wood." I think I retained these drafts, I don't think I ever parted with them—on 10th May I received another letter, "You must send me the names of your proposed sureties, they must not be relatives"—when I threw up the negotiation I required the policy to be returned to me, and it was sent to me by him—it appears by this letter of 7th June that I did part with the draft securities, I sent them to him and he returned them to me—at the time I sent the two portions of the premium, and the money for expenses, I believed the statements contained in the letters and in the advertisement—not a word was said in reference to these five securities until after I had paid my money—I did not renew my premiums.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Carlton House, Finchley, and am a potato merchant—in February, 1870, I saw an advertisement of a Messrs. Girdle stone and Barclay to lend money on freehold property at 3 1/2; per cent, in consequence of which I called at 11, Euston Square—William Shaw opened the door to me—he asked my business—I told him that I had bought a freehold estate of 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I wished to borrow 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon mortgage at 3 1/2; per cent.—he asked me all particulars and then he asked me to sit down, gave me the newspaper to read, and went up stairs—I waited for about 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—he then invited me up stairs and introduced me to Wood—he did not introduce him by any name, but I understood that he represented Girdle stone and Barclay—he was sitting at a horse-shoe desk covered with books and plans of the estate, part of which I had bought—I made mention of the advertisement and he arranged to lend me the money at 3 1/2; percent.—some time afterwards I received a letter from Girdle stone and Barclay, in consequence of which I sent a cheque for 15 guineas—there was then some further correspondence and I called there on three or four occasions, but never could see Girdlestone or Barclay—I saw William Shaw and asked for Girdle stone and Barclay—he asked me to sit down and then asked me to go upstairs, which I did, and saw Wood—I said "Good morning, Mr. Girdlestone"—he said "Good morning"—I told him I had come to ask him for the 15 guineas back, as I thought he had obtained it fraudulently, as no inspection of the property had ever been made—he did not consent to return it—I sat talking to him some time—a knock at the front door broke off our conversation—I heard a noise and scuffle down stairs and some conversation going on, and my solicitor, Mr. Webster, was asking if a gentleman, his client, was up stairs, and he wished to go up and see him and William Shaw would not allow him—Wood asked me if I knew the gentleman down stairs—I said "Yes"—I looked over the bannisters and saw them scuffling below in the passage, and William Shaw asked "Is this gentleman to come up"—Wood said "Allow him to come up," and he came up and asked for the 15 guineas back, and he asked Wood if he was Mr. Girdlestone—he said "Oh no, I am not Mr. Girdlestone"—I said "Are you Mr. Barclay"—Shaw came up with Mr. Webster, and was in the room at this time—Mr. Webster said they were a park of thieves and scoundrels—I did not get my money back, or any loan—Mr. Webster is dead—they never surveyed the property—it is in Yorkshire—my cheque for 15 guineas was cashed in Oxford Street and was passed through my bank—it was produced before the Magistrate, but cannot now be found.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 39, Camden Square, Ramsgate—in 1871 I was living at Eaton Lodge, Ramsgate—I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> newspaper of a Mr. Preston, of 120, Southampton Row, London, offering to lend money at five per cent, on personal security—in consequence of that I applied for a loan of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received an answer but have mislaid the documents and cannot find them—the correspond<lb/>ence was with Mr. Preston, and an arrangement was made that I should insure my life in the Albion for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received this printed form of proposal—the written part is all my writing—I filled it up except the name and address at the top—the doctor I paid the fee to passed me for the Albion—the name of the doctor is not my writing, it is the doctor's—it is dated the 14th November, 1871—I sent the amount of the premium, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">S</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., by post-office order to the Albion Office, deducting the doctor's fee—I received a receipt in due course from the Albion, which I sent to Mr. Preston—I afterwards received a letter from Mr. Preston asking for four or five guineas for legal expenses—I sent that amount by post-office order and got an acknowledgment for it—I afterwards received three or four documents and a bill of sale, a statutory declaration to be made before two Magistrates at Ramsgate, an assignment of the policy, and a draft for securities—I came up to London with these documents in January, 1872, and went to 120, Southampton Row—I think there was a small brass plate there with R. F. Preston on it, but it is a long time since—there was a kind of milliner's shop at the side and an old lady inside—William Shaw opened the door to me—I said "Is Mr. Preston at home?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Did you receive my letter?" I had previously written to say I was coming—I said "I am Mr. Ray, from Ramsgate, I want to see Mr. Preston"—he said "Mr. Preston is up<lb/>stairs, will you walk up?"—he preceded me and I followed him—he introduced me into a room over the shop and introduced me to Mr. Alfred Shaw, who I then took to be R. F. Preston—I saw the same man at Bow Street, it is the one who escaped—I said "Good morning, Mr. Preston," and he acknowledged himself as such—he then introduced me to William Shaw as his clerk—I asked Mr. Preston if he had received my letters—he said "Yes"—I told him that I had been disappointed, I expected the money—I said "I decline to go before two Magistrates at Ramsgate because I am so well known there"—I could have gone to the bank and borrowed the money—he said "We will dispense with that"—I told him that I was going to Canterbury on Wednesday—I am drill<lb/>master of the school there and have been 22 years in the Army—he said he had an agent there, and that he would dispense with the household securities, and I might go to his agent and there would be no publicity about it, and he would send me the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without any deduction, through</p>

               <p>his agent at Canterbury, and he would give me private notice before I started to go there—I asked the name of his agent—he declined to give it—he said he would give me notice by the first post on Wednesday morning—I then returned to Ramsgate—I did not receive any communi<lb/>cation from him—I wrote—he replied to the effect that he required two bond holders as security, residing in Ramsgate, or about there—of course I declined that and I wrote to Mr. Preston to try and get my money back and threatened him with legal proceedings—I got no answer and I came up to London again and went to 120, Southampton Row several times—William Shaw opened the door to me—I inquired fur Mr. Preston—he told me he was not at home—sometimes he said he was at Brighton or some other place—he made all sorts of excuses—I dare say I called a dozen times or perhaps more—the last time William Shaw said "Mr. Preston has declined to send the cheque or grant you the loan unless you give the securities," which I had previously declined to accept—I thought it was a swindle—I never got the loan—I wanted the money to build a gymnasium—I would have given the bill of sale in the first instance, having gone so far, and I did not object to signing my own bond, but I did decline to go before two local Magistrates—I received the policy—I haven't got it—I know who has—I did not renew it—I believed the statement I saw in the advertisement and the representations in the letters—I thought there was a Mr. Preston carrying on business at this place and was under the impression that it was a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> transaction, <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD JOHN MURRAY</hi>. I am now living at 17, All Saints Street, Hull—I am a grocer—in March, 1873, I was living at Sunderland; in that month I saw an advertisement in a local paper similar to this (No. 4): "Money to be lent in town or country, &amp;c., apply to Henry Howard, 11, Euston Square"—in consequence of that advertisement I applied for a ban of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by letter to that address, and in reply I received this letter, dated on a printed heading 3rd March, 11, Euston Square, London. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the loan could be entertained by insuring the life in an office to be named for</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">signed "H. Howard</hi>.")

Howard": "Dear Sir, The 3 guineas is to pay the incidental and legal expenses"—on the 3rd April I received this: "Dear Sir, The</p>

You will have to assign and give a bond"—on the 5th April I received this: "Dear Sir,—I enclose draft bond for your perusal"—a bond came with that—on the 24th April I received by book post these five draft securities, similar to this already spoken of—I perused them and kept them for a time—on the 29th April I received a letter from Howard: "Dear Sir,—Be kind enough to return drafts with any comments"—I did not return them, and on the let May I received this: "Dear Sir,—I shall be pleased to be put in communication with your solicitor, as you appear not to be a business man"—at the time I paid my money for the premium and the legal expenses I believed the statements contained in the adver<lb/>tisement and the letters—I did not obtain any loan or the return of my three guineas—I did not renew my policy in the Albion—about the same time that I was corresponding with Howard I saw an advertisement in the local paper of R.F. Preston, of 120, Southampton Row, in conse<lb/>quence of which I applied to him for an advance of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for three years—he required a reference, and I was to insure for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in an office to be selected by him; I received a form of proposal, which I filled up and returned to the Albion—I received these letters of March 8th, 14th, 19th, 21st, and May 1st—by that time, having had experience of Howard, the thing went off, because I did not believe he would give me the loan.</p>

I am a nurseryman at Monmouth—in December, 1874, I saw an advertisement in <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's Weekly News</hi> like this (No. 2)—<hi rend="italic">This was headed "Money ready for immediate investment upon any description of real or personal security, &amp;c. Apply to Wm. Seymour Esq., Financier</hi>, 9, <hi rend="italic">Great Russell Street, London</hi>"—I asked for a loan of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received an answer which I have unfortunately destroyed—it stated that he was able to advance the money by my insuring my life in an office he should name—I replied to that and received an answer—I was to be examined by a doctor he named in Monmouth—I received this proposal form—the writing at the top is Mr. Wilson's, the doctor who examined me—the heading with my name and address was written there when I received it—I forwarded the proposal to Mr. Seymour and then came to London on 28th December, 1874, and went to Great Russell Street—the door was opened by Alfred Shaw—I told him I had come to London upon a special purpose to obtain this loan—he said "It is all very satisfactory, I have received a good account of you from Wilson, of Monmouth"—I was to have the money as soon as I effected the policy with the Albion—the money was to be paid in to the Gloucestershire Bank in 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—Alfred Shaw said I was to see Mr. Northcott and tell him I came from him, from Mr. Seymour—I went to the Albion Office on 29th December—I saw Northcott and paid him this cheque for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the premium upon my insurance—I got no receipt—I told Northcott that I came from Seymour to see him to effect my life policy in the Albion—he said "It is all right if you come from him"—he said he could not give me the policy then, he wanted three directors to sign it before it would be legal—the policy was to be sent to me, but I stayed in London several days before I could get it—I did get it in London—before returning home I called again in Great Russell Street and again saw Alfred Shaw—he asked if I had effected the policy—I said I had paid the money but had not got the policy—he then asked for</p>

               <p>by business in the country, and he was authorised to take any instructions from me—previous to this, in answer to my first application, he had written to say that if I insured my life in an office to be named by him (Howard) I could have the money—he did not name the office then, he did on this Thursday, the Albion, in Chancery Lane—I believe before I left he gave me this form of proposal to fill up—the mauve writing on it is mine—the writing at the top is not mine—I can't say whether it was there when he gave me the proposal—it was not filled up by meor anybody else while it was in my possession—I kept it under look and key till I returned it—I believe it was already filled in—I brought the proposal to town with me about 30th December, and took it to 11, Euston Square, where I again saw Wood—Slinker opened the door to me—I asked for Mr. Howard, he said be was at home—I was shown into the office and waited there, and was offered the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> to read—I was then shown upstairs—I supposed I was about to see Mr. Howard, but I found Wood, I think he followed me up<lb/>stairs—I again expressed my surprise at not seeing Mr. Howard—Wood said that he was authorised to take any instructions I gave him, and that he could manage the matter, it was the same as if I was going through the matter with Howard—I said I had called to-day to have a clear understanding as to what security would be required, that I wanted the money to go towards purchasing a small living; as the one I was holding for a relative I was about to give up in his favour—he said "No further security will be required," most distinctly—he gave me a book of tables of the Albion—I said "Won't you allow me to insure in the Clergy Mutual instead?"—he said "Mr. Howard only does business in the Albion"—before leaving he gave me the address of the Albion, and said "Go to the Albion and see the Secretary"—alter leaving him I went there, and asked for Mr. Northcott; I did not see him, I was told he was engaged all day—I was examined by Dr. Hooper, and finally sent a cheque for 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for the first year's premium, by post to the Albion, somewhere about 10th or 12th January, after deducting a guinea for the medical fee—I addressed the letter to Mr. Northcott, Secretary and Manager of the Albion, and I received from him this receipt, which I sent by post to Howard—I then received from Howard this letter of 25th January: "By book post you will receive draft securities as prepared by my solicitor for perusal and approval, which please return at your convenience with any comments thereon"—these five documents came with that letter, a bill of sale, a statutory declaration, a bond, two securi<lb/>ties, and an assignment of the policy—up to the time I sent the receipt for my premium I had heard nothing about the necessity of signing such documents—I came to town that same afternoon, and wrote making an appointment for the next morning—I then called at Euston Square and saw Slinker—I asked for Mr. Howard, he said he was at home, as usual, and I had an interview with Wood again—I told him I had come to make my comments in person—he opened the bundle which I had brought with me, and said certain things were mere forms—I hardly recol<lb/>lect which paper he alluded to, he alluded to one of them; he made an erasure, and threw one paper on one side and said "Oh, this is mere matter of form"—I said "They appear to me not matter of form, but realities which I do not understand"—I said I would consider the matter, and took away the documents—next day I wrote saying I would have nothing to do with it, and returned the documents—I afterwards put</p>

                  </hi>. I am a land surveyor, and live at Cheltenham—my relations with Howard and Holland were by correspondence, except my visit to London afterwards—I have in my hand the original letters I received and copies of those I wrote, from 15th January to 4th September—I saw an advertisement, I think in the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> on 15th January, I applied on behalf of a firm of mining engineers, land surveyors, and valuers, of which I was a member, for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 18 months on note of hand—I got an answer next day that my application would be entertained and that I should have to insure my life in an office to be selected by Howard for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and deposit tho policy as collateral security—I replied</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805270093"/>
               <p>that my brothers and I were willing to insure for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I afterwards raised the application to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on an insurance on my own life—my brother's proposal was dropped, the office would not accept his life—on 19th January I asked for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—in answer to that I was told that the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. must be paid in one sum—after farther correspondence I sent a poet-office order for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, on 9th March for the first year's premium, deducting the doctor's fee—on 16th I received from Howard a tatter asking for 4 guineas for legal charges—I sent at first a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and afterwards 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 6th April I received by book-post five draft securities—I sent them back by return of post—I don't remember whe<lb/>ther any attorney's name was written on them—on 9th April I wrote and said "I must exclude that part of the declaration about never having been bankrupt, for about 10 years ago I had to claim protection in the Bristol Bankruptcy Court, and I thought the declaration could be as well attested by a Commissioner—on the 10th Howard wrote "You have omitted to send the names of proposed sureties"—on the 13th I wrote, threatening to put the matter in the hands of my solicitor if there was any more delay, and I received an answer on the 15th that Mr. Howard would be pleased to be put in communication with my solicitor—on 4th May I wrote in very strong terms and said the matter must go before the Magis<lb/>trates, unless the money I had paid was refunded—on the 7th he wrote, that as I had put the matter in a solicitor's hands he declined further communication as it was not usual to correspond with both attorney and client at the same time—I wrote again on 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> June demanding my money back and the cancelling of the policy—he ultimately returned the 4 guineas to my solicitor on 4th May, and here is my solicitor's receipt for it—I got back a portion of the premium—the early part of my corre<lb/>spondence with Mr. Northcott relates entirely to the effecting of the policy on my life; it was at first accepted conditionally and then absolutely—on 12th June I wrote to Northcott: "Before I commence proceedings against Mr. Henry Howard, of 11, Euston Square, I think it is only proper to inform you that he induced me to insure my life in your office. As such has not been carried out I leave you to judge how the publicity of the affair will affect your office. My transactions with him will be public in a short time. I have no wish to injure the Company, but I cannot avert the course of law"—I received an answer from Northcott on the 13th, "The Mr. Howard you name is not connected with this society. I am therefore at a loss to see how this society can be in any way affected by any proceedings you may take against him. Perhaps you will be kind enough to enlighten me on these points"—on 15th June I wrote, explaining the matter, saying if he was willing to cancel the policy and hand me back the first year's premium, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the proceedings might be stopped—in that letter I enclosed Howard's first letter—on 20th June I wrote again "As you have not replied to my letter of the 15th please return Mr. Howard's letter, and inform me what amount of money you paid Mr. Howard on my life policy by way of commission or otherwise, so that I may know the exact sum he received from me on the transaction"—to that I received an answer of 22nd June, staging, that the society had nothing whatever to do with the loan matter referred to and that if I wished to dispose of the policy he would be happy to ask the directors to consider the case as a special one—he added Mr. Howard did not receive anything from this</p>

               <p>society as commission on your assurance"—on 23rd June I wrote asking again for the return of Howard's letter and the amount of the premium, and got this reply of 25th June, stating "I have already told you Howard is not connected with this society..... I am inclined to think the directors will not object to make an allowance for the surrender of the policy"—on 5th July I wrote again for Howard's letter and gave a full account of the transactions between myself and Howard—on 7th July I got back Howard's letter in an envelope without any remark—on 15th July Northcott wrote "Do you wish me to submit your case to the directors or not?"—I proposed to insert a history of the case in the Lon<lb/>don and county papers—on the 15th July he wrote, "You had better be careful how you bring this society's name in connection with the matter you deprecate as a swindle. Do you wish me to submit the matter is the directors or not?"—on 16th July I wrote again, asking for the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to be refunded—on 17th he said he would submit my case to the directors, and ultimately on 31<hi rend="italic">st</hi> August 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was repaid me, for which I gave a receipt on the policy which I got back on the 2nd—I was in London in February, 1876, and called at 11, Euston Square-the name over the door was Wm. Holland, C. E.—I had noticed little while before a change of name in the advertisements from Howard to Holland—Slinker opened the door—I asked to see Mr. Holland—he said that be was not in, and asked what I wanted—I said I wanted to see Mr. Holland on private business—he said that I had better write to him or something of that kind, as he was down in the county somewhere sur<lb/>veying—I walked straight from there to the Albion Office, Chancery Lane, and asked for Mr. Northcott—I did not see him then but called next day and saw him for the first time—I did not give him my name—I said that I had been to Mr. Holland, 11, Euston Square, about a loan, and asked him if he knew the party, and if they were trustworthy and so on—he said that they had done some business with Mr. Holland which was satisfactory—I cannot remember the exact words—I said What has become of Mr. Howard?"—he said "He is dead, and Holland has taken his business"—he also said that he had had a great many transactions with Howard, and that they were perfectly satis<lb/>factory, and that they were money-lenders, I think.</p>

I was to be the borrower, and no other person was to be in it but my brother; he carries on the business in Gloucester, and I live at Cheltenham—he and I are a firm of mining en<lb/>gineers—we have been about 11 years in business—I thought that persons lending money on personal security would require to have the fullest details of the position of the persons borrowing, and I thought they were stupids to lend money without security—I thought the advertisement was stupid—I mean that it is very stupid to lend money upon a life policy alone, and when the draft securities came I could see that it was a swindle—I did not expect that they would lend the money without a full inves<lb/>tigation of our circumstances—I said "I have no objection to make a statutory declaration, but you must exclude that part about being bank<lb/>rupt"—I was not surprised that full inquiries were to be made about my financial condition, and never attempted to keep anything from them—we were not pressed for money, there were no judgments against us, we wanted the money to use in our business—I gave them information and let them know we were in a highly satisfactory position—I had not at</p>

I am a land surveyor—I do not lend money—I filled up a portion of this proposal, the portion in dark-coloured ink—I am strictly temperate, and I think I was in good health at the time—I had been spitting blood—I do not know whether that was within two or three days, but it was from jumping—I think I must have spit blood after that—I know that the Lord Chief Justice called my attention to it on the trial; many a man spits blood—I put myself forward as a healthy man, Dr. Evans passed me as such—I shall answer no personal?question, have you anything against my character—I admit that I was spitting blood, I did not mention it on my proposal because I thought it was a temporary, passing matter—I had been spitting blood half a day; not the whole halt-day—I bad been jumping fences and. strained myself, but had not injured myself to that extent that I could not call myself a healthy man—I was insured in another office at that time—I knew that the premium would depend very much upon the state of my health—I believed that the Albion office was a genuine one—if the spitting of blood had occurred to me when I filled up the proposal it if most probable I should have said so—I did not consider it necessary that the directors should be acquainted with the fact that I had been spitting blood—I had not consulted a medical adviser about it, I had con<lb/>suited no doctor for 10 years—I was examined on the trial of Mr. Jex Blake for the Plaintiff by, I think, Mr Ashman, the junior Counsel—I mentioned the conversation I had with Northcott—I swear that, and Lord Coleridge made mention of it—I most decidedly say that I men<lb/>tioned the name of Holland to Northcott.</p>

               <p>to the 3 guineas I said they could either deduct it, or else when the money was handed over to me I would return the 3 guineas to them—he said be would speak to Mr. Holland about it—the deeds I referred to were the transfer from the Church of England and the other: they were mentioned at nearly every visit—I understood that I should have to assign the two policies—that was mentioned by Slinker at my very first visit—as I was leaving on this last occasion William Shaw came in at the door; I think he opened the door himself—Slinker said, "Here is Mr. Holland," and he mentioned my name, "This is Mr. Clay"—William Shaw went up stairs—I waited down stairs for a few minutes and was then desired to walk up to the first-door room, where I saw William Shaw—there was a large table in the centre of the room, with catalogues of machinery and of property for sale—I said I could not be expected to pay the 3 guineas before I got the loan, that I showed my good faith by taking out the policy in the Insurance Office, and I thought that was quite sufficient to let him know that I intended to act straightforwardly to my bargain—he said he would consult hid solicitor, and see if it could be managed to let me pay it after—I then left—next day I got this letter, signed Wm. Holland: "Dear Sir,—As I never make any deductions, but hand over the amount of loan in full, you must remit the amount required to defray expenses, on receipt of which I will at once arrange for you to receive the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—on the 15th I called at the office in Euston Square—I saw Slinker and said I would pay him the 3 guineas under the distinct understanding that nothing more was required of me than the transfer of the policies—be said the loan would be carried out under the arrangement already made—I then paid the 3 guineas to Slinker in cash, and he went to the table and wrote, but it was too far off for me to see what he wrote—after writing at the table he handed me this receipt: "Received 15th December, 1876, of Mr. Thomas Clay, the sum of 3 guineas to defray the legal charges connected with the above advance. Wm. Holland"—that was all that passed on that occasion—I afterwards received this letter of 17th December by book-post, with these 5 documents (<hi rend="italic">as before</hi>)—there was no name at the bottom—on receiving those I went again to Euston Square with my wife on 18th December, taking the five documents with me—Slinker opened the door to me, as before—I asked for Mr. Holland—he said he was in and would see me in a few minutes if we would walk up stairs—we went up and sat down, and in about five minutes William Shaw came in—I introduced him to my wife as Mr. Holland—I put the drafts on the table and said they were quite contrary to everything that had been arranged before—I said that I did not object to the bill of sale so much, but I objected to the statutory declaration being in public before Magis<lb/>trates—he said that he could get over that by having it before a Commis<lb/>sioner—I objected to the sureties; I said it was impossible for me to get sureties, that they were more difficult to get than money, that many friends would advance me a small sum of money, but they would not become surety for me—he said that he would see the solicitors and try to see if they would recommend him to do away with the sureties—my wife then asked him when he was going to carry out his promise of advancing the loan—William Shaw replied: "I never do business with ladies"—she thereupon turned round to me and said "Just ask this man when he is going to carry out his promise"—he then got up, put</p>

Holland": "I have seen my solicitor, who states be cannot recommend me to dispense with any of the securities drawn by him; I must therefore request you to enter into the same accordingly and forward the names of two sureties as required by the draft guarantee"—I then wrote for the return of my money, and then got this letter of 23rd December from Holland: "What I have done in this matter is in strict accordance with your written autho<lb/>rity of 23rd November last. I am quite ready to complete, upon your complying with the required sureties"—I never got the loan or got back the 3 guineas—I did not renew my policy—I only insured in the Albion for the purpose of this loan—I received the policy direct from the office—I think I have it at home—at the time I paid the premium and the 3 guineas I believed the statements in the advertisement and the letters, that Holland was a surveyor, carrying on business at this place in the way stated—I bad no idea at all of any connection between Holland and the insurance office—I refused to pay the premium till they assured me at the office that no commission was paid on the premium—I saw two clerks there; they told me Mr. Northcott was out—I told them who I was in communication with, and they said no commission was paid—they looked in a book and said they had no agents, and that no commission would be paid on my policy.</p>

The Albion and others, and called his attention to the names appearing on it, William Shaw and Northcott—I asked him if he knew any of the de<lb/>fendants—he said I do not know them, I do not know anything about them—he said that his name was not Thomas Gard Wood, but Thomas Wood.</p>

E.; late 7, Cook's Court, Lincoln's Inn"—I found a great many sheets of old paper, also a large quantity of printed circulars like those produced—there were several hundreds of these—they are chiefly instructions to newspapers to insert Holland's advertisements—I also found a great quantity of bills from newspapers in all parts of the country—I also found <hi rend="italic">Mitchell's Newspaper Press Directory</hi>, which gives a list of all the provincial papers—there were also a number of lists of country newspapers, in writing—I also found those dockets of bills for advertisements inserted, containing on the out<lb/>side a sort of summary of each case—in some, copies of the correspond<lb/>ence were enclosed, others were merely a blank outside sheet—I also found some plans of some property—I have made out a list of these papers—there are 437, principally for the years 1876, 1877, and the beginning of 1878—they relate to 437 transactions—there are a few of 1875—the total amount of loans applied for is 222, 950<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the amount of legal expenses, 3,070<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a few of the dockets relate to the cases that have been investigated—this seizure took place after the trial of the action—Mr. Viney's was one of them—there are a number of judgments and County Court summonses against Howard and Holland—the last one is returnable on 2nd April—I do not recollect the date of the earliest—I also found this red book with this memorandum, "11, Euston</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was signed Wm.

Attached to this was an Order of Discharge of Baron Pollock in the matter of William Shaw, a prisoner in Holloway Prison at the suit of Heslop</hi>)—I also found at 11, Euston Square, this letter, dated 22nd March, from Blagden to Mrs. Wood—I went that same evening to No. 10, Riversdale Road, Highbury New Part, where I knew William Shaw lived—I have seen him leave there in the morning—I there found this letter in an envelope addressed to William Shaw, at that address, and signed "T. W."—I arrested Thompson on 23rd March—I met him in Chancery Lane—I told him the charge—he said "Who is the com<lb/>plainant?"—I said "Jex Blake," and told him that others were in custody—he said "Is Bennett in custody?"—I said "No"—I found several documents upon him, which I produce—he was living at 54, Lupus Street, Pimlico—this is one document I found on him, a copy of the Articles of Association of the Albion, and some transfers of shares; also some returns which the Insurance Office have to make to the Board of Trade for 1872 and 1873—after George Shaw was arrested on 10th May I went to No. 18, Grange Road, Bermondsey, kept by a Miss Harvey, where he was living—I searched a bedroom on the top floor which she pointed out as the room of Samuel Bilton, and I found there this blotting paper—I examined it carefully—it has been shown to Mr. Chabot—it has the signature "W. Thompson" in various places—Miss Harvey gave me this piece of paper with the name of Samuel Bilton written on it—on the blotting paper there was also the address of Mrs. Ellison, 111, Ball's Pond Road, Islington—I went there next morning and she gave me this letter—the envelope had previously been given to Sergeant Downing—it appears to be the envelope that was blotted on this blotting paper—the letter is addressed to her and signed "J. Williams"—at 111, Ball's Pond Road I found this blotting paper in a portmanteau in the room that was pointed out to me as J. Williams's room—I also got at that address some old cheque books and some letters to George Shaw—I got this letter and envelope from Mr. Robinson, the solicitor—it is dated July 11th, 1872, from 11, Euston Square, signed "H. Howard," and is addressed to the Rev. J. Bostock—I have been engaged in this case for some considerable time, and have endeavoured to find Seymour, Hawkins, Preston, Howard and Holland, but have never been able to find such persons at any of those addresses—I have had the assistance of officers from Scotland Yard—I saw William Shaw write this—some of the documents I found at Ball's Pond Road were in this bag.</p>

I am a clerk at the Union Bank of London, Chancery Lane branch—in October, 1871, I took a position as junior clerk in the Albion Life Insurance Society, and remained there nearly four years, until August, 1875—soon after I went there a man named Williams used so call—I saw him at Bow Street under the name of Alfred Shaw—he called two or three times a month, sometimes a little oftener and some-times not so often—he sometimes brought proposals for insurances—there was an agency account in the name of Williams, and I believe he was paid 40 or 50 per cent, commission—his commissions were entered to his account—sometimes he saw Mr. Northcott and sometimes he just came in and left his proposal—Northcott occasionally left messages or notes for him—Northcott occupied a separate room, and Williams used to see him there—commissions were always paid to Williams by cheque—I have seen a number of receipts for commissions signed by him but I did not have anything to do with keeping the books, therefore they did not come under my notice in a regular way, but after the receipts have been signed I have seen them—the prisoner Wood used also to call once a week and sometimes wait for a considerable time—I never knew him by the name of Gard, nor had we an agent of that name to my knowledge—there was no one named Rogers there while I was there, but there was an account in the name of Rogers—I never saw a Mr. Ager—I do not remember an agent named Brown—I do not remember Wood bringing proposals for insurance, not so frequently as to strike me—proposals used to be brought into the office from him and they were carried to the account of Rogers—I do not think I saw Mr. Seymour or Hawkins—I have heard Preston alluded to in letters to the society, but never saw him, Girdleston, Barclay, Howard, or Holland—I have heard of Mr. Howard—I am not quite sure whether Wood brought proposals or not, but there were proposals from him, and when they came they were carried to Rogers' account—I think I have heard both Preston's and Howard's names mentioned by persons in the office, and I directed such persons to Mr. Northcott, the manager, in his room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am articled clerk to Mr. Smart, the official liqui<lb/>dator to the Albion Insurance Society—on 25th February this year I began to examine the books—Northcott came there daily, and stayed from 12 o'clock until 2 or 3 in the afternoon—he was there on 8th March with Shott and Nicholls, who were clerks of the company; they were in the inner office with Northcott, which was not their usual place; they gene<lb/>rally sat in the outside office—they were all three together an hour and a half or two hours—Northcott went away at a little alter 4 o'clock that afternoon, and Shott and Nicholls left two or three minutes after him—Nicholls came out of the inner room, and took back a receipt stamp each time; after they left I went with Mr. Frase, a fellow-clerk, into the inner room, and notified that part of a blotting pad had been torn away, and on turning to the fireplace to see if they had thrown it there I noticed the ashes of some burnt paper on the hearth, and several small pieces of paper at the back of the stove—the flap of the register had been thrown back, and it had been thrown up the chimney; that was not blotting paper—I noticed on one of the pieces up the register the words "11, Euston Square"—Mr. Fraser collected all the pieces of paper and took them to Mr. Smart's office in Cheapside, and pasted them together—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Fraser has filled in one conjectural word. (<hi rend="italic">The paper was handed to the Jury</hi>.) Shett and Nicholls came to the office next morning—Mr. Northcott came about 12 o'clock, and Shott and Nicholls were discharged by Mr. Martin, the liquidator.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. There was no fire, and I do not think it possible that the draught could have carried the pieces of paper where I found them.</p>

If you are burning a piece of paper and let it go, the draught very often takes it up the chimney, and then you expect to find the edges charred—I had been into the room earlier in the morning, and am almost certain that the blotting pad was whole then or else I should have noticed it—there was no burnt paper in the fireplace then—nobody went into the room after they left before I went in.</p>

Mr. Heath's policy was introduced by Thomas Gard—the entry is among others, "Thomas Gard, L.W. Heath, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that is the amount of the premium—50 per cent, was paid to him on the whole of those premiums—the total amount of premiums introduced by him that month was 297<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., by Thomas Gard, the 50 per cent, commission being 297<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I find in letter-book 15 a letter, dated November 21, 1870, addressed to Griffiths by Northcott on August 15, 1849: "Dear Sir,—You have not sent me full particulars in Mr. Nicolady's case as promised; when writing again give me the names and addresses of the parties you refer to as acting as agents for this society"</p>

               <p>—here is also a letter from Griffiths of December 7: "The agents were Girdlestone and Barclay.

The gentlemen named in yours of the 29th ultimo are not con<lb/>nected with this society, neither authorised to make use of the society's name in any way, therefore I do not see how you can ask us to surrender the policy. The rule is five years. If you think we should consider Mr. Nicolady's a special case I will lay it before the Board."—The letter of the 29th there referred to is this: "The parties are Messrs. Girlestone and Barclay, 11, Euston Square, who advertise in country papers more particularly."—I have found the letter of Mr. Griffiths, of 7th December, 1870 (<hi rend="italic">This called attention to the case of Mr. Nicolady, and stated that unless the money was refunded, proceedings would be taken against the directors, whose addresses were requested</hi>)—I find the letter-book, at page 950, a reply to that, signed by Mr. Northcott: "Before furnishing the information required I must asked you for what purpose you ask for a summons against the gentlemen you refer to; so far as I know, there is nothing in Mr. Nicolady's case but what could be dealt with by the directors if properly represented to them"—there is also a letter of 16th December, from Mr. Griffiths, asking for the addresses of the directors, auditors, and Mr. Northcott's own address, in order to take out summonses—at page 953 there is this reply of December 19th: "Sir—I am in receipt of yours of the 17th, and bet go state that this society has nothing whatever to do with the loan matter you refer to. I will bring the matter before our directors at their meeting, and communicate their decision to you. I think it would have been as well if your application had been made without any intimidation; your threat will out influence that directors of the Board in this case." In the 20th there is a letter from Mr. Griffiths to be placed before the Board, and the page 965 this reply from Mr. Northcott, of 22nd December, 1870: "I brought the matter before the Board yesterday, and am instructed to say that the usual rule of the society as to the surrender of policies can<lb/>not be departed from, the gentlemen named in your letter are not in any way connected with the society, and we cannot be answerable for their mis-statements. As an act of charity the directors would be willing to allow Mr. Nicolady 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a gratuity"—I find this minute on 21st December, "Mr. Nicolady's application for a surrender value of his policy was refused on account of the policy not having been long enough in existence to entitle him to a surrender value, accord<lb/>ing to the rules of the society. Present Messrs Arrowsmith (in the chair), Bennett, Thompson, and Pinkerton."—The minutes were after<lb/>wards read and confirmed on 4th January—on 3rd November, 1871, I find a letter relating to the case of Mr. Barnes, at page 425 of the letter-book No. 17: "Sir—I am not acquainted with the gentlemen named in yours of the 30th ultimo. Yours J.T. Northcott, Manger and Sec<lb/>retary."—That was in reply to letter from Mr. Barnes inquiring, "Do you know a Mr. H.

At page 471 of the letter-book there is a letter of 11th November, stating that Howard was not connected with the society—in the letter-book of 1875 I find this letter of August 7th, to Mr. Rogers: "Complaints have been made to me by some of the policy-holders introduced by you of the manner in which they have been treated by Mr. Howard of Euston Square, I of course know nothing of Mr. Howard's mode of transacting business beyond what I have heard from these policy-holders, but they have made such extraordinary statements that I feel I must decline to take any assurance business from you in future except such as is not connected with applications for loans.

               <p>"Home Agency, T. Gard," and in the next page 18 "Thomas Gard's commission account"—there is nothing about home agency as to Rogers or Williams, Brown or Ager, only the names; it is only in the case of Gard—all the cheques are signed by two or more of the directors and countersigned by Northcott—the bank would not honour them without—the majority of them are drawn to a number, not all, and the name to whom the cheque is posted in the ledger is in all cases on the counterfoil—I have no reason to doubt that the entries in the agenda-book are copied into the minute-book as having come before the directors, but my atten<lb/>tion has not been called to that sufficiently to say—there are two letters of complaint written, one to Rogers and one to Williams, stating that they must not send any more policies—I find a letter addressed to a Mr. R. Hunt, on March 11th, 1876, asking his reason for insuring, also one to Mr Trew, of March 31st; also one to Mr. Honeywood, of April 13th, 1876; also one to J. S. Taylor, of 22nd June, 1876—I think I have seen replies to such letters—there are very few entries in the agenda-book or the minute-book, of legal matters brought before the Board—there are four minute-books—I have examined them, but not very carefully—there certainly are entries of legal matters brought before the Board—on 16th August, 1877, there are these minutes: "Mr. Mark Shepherd, the solicitor, attended at the request of the Board to advise them in respect of proposals from a Mr. Brown," the result of which was that Brown's proposals should be rejected—the directors then present were Mr. Arrowsmith (in the chair), Messrs. Bennett, Pinkerton, and Thompson—on 6th June, 1877, there is an entry of the application by Mr. J. Thomas for a return of his premium acceded to by the Board, the directors then present being Messrs. Arrow<lb/>smith, Pinkerton, and Thompson—the average of payments on account of claims is 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I believe it was the invariable practice of the office to reinsure in, all cases over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the Articles of Association pro<lb/>vide that—among other offices they reinsured in the Liverpool and London—I believe in such cases the liability of the Albion ceases beyond that; for instance, in Mr. Jex Blake's case the claim on the Albion would have been 1, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the other office—they actually did re<lb/>insure in that case and in Mr. Schroff's—Mr. Northcott began with a salary of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year I think began at the latter end of 1868 or the beginning of 1869—I only know from the books that Mr. Pilkington was secretary up to the time Northcott became manager—Gard's account was open in Pilkington's time, not all the others; Rogers does not come in for some time afterwards—I do not remember seeing any letter from Dr. Hooper among the papers—I think there was considerably more than two-thirds of the sums in reference to these premiums outstanding when I came into the office—the petition to wind up was presented on 18th December, 1877; it was the petition of a Mr. Lane; I do not know him; I have only seen him once since—I was appointed provisionally on 15th February, 1878, and official liquidator on 1st March—up to the time I went in, as far as I know, Northcott had full access to the offices of the company, and to the books, papers, and everything—I had nothing to do with Mr. Thompson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Birkbeck Bank, Southamptou Buildings, Chancery Lane—I produce some cheques of William Shaw, who is our customer—he is the prisoner with the beard—he opened his account with this memorandum, "William Shaw, architect and surveyor, 2, Sandringham Terrace, Tottenham"—that is in his writing, and these cheques are his writing also, both the body and signatures.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Continued</hi>). I have examined the writing in these cheques, and also on this memorandum signed William Shaw—hat enables me to form an opinion of his writing—I have carefully gone through all the documents on this list—I have to make one correction—this 26 ought to be 22—I have looked at the letters signed R. F. Preston to Harris, 21st May, 16th June, 18th July, 12th July, 12th, 16th, and 17th August, and 9th, 15th, and 18th September, 1871, and in my opinion they are in the writing of the same person who signed this document, William Shaw—the letters of R. F. Preston, of 21st April, 1st May, and a portion of a letter dated 19th March, 1873; also a letter signed J.P. Hudson, and the wrapper enclosing draft securities referring to Mr. Viney, found at 11, Euston Square, are a large portion of them in the same writings—if I remember rightly there is more of William Shaw's writing than anybody else's—here are two lists of country newspapers, one in William Shaw's writing and another in George Shaw's writing—this authority of William shaw to Thomas haw found at Thomas Shaw's lodgings, is also George Shaw's writing—I have also examined a number of commission receipts, shown me by Mr. Smart, and signed T. Rogers, G. Williams, and William Brown—some of them are in William Shaw's writing, but many are not—this copy of a letter to Blagden is in William Shaw's writing, but it is not signed—here are some commission receipts in Woodman's case, signed T. Rogers, and some in Clay's case, and R.E. Thomas's case, signed William Brown, and two signed W. Brown in Shroff's case, and one signed William Brown in Hamilton's case; are all William Shaws writing—this affidavit, signed Wm. Shaw, is William Shaw's writing (<hi rend="italic">This was in the cause of Hislop</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Holland, sworn</hi> 27 <hi rend="italic">November</hi>, 1877)—I have examined the writing of this letter and envelope produced, also the blotting paper which has been produced by the police, and the writing "Samuel Bilton"—I had formed an opinion about it before I was told of it, and I have subsequently learned that it was proved to be George Shaw's writing—I have carefully examined the blotting paper, and there is the blotting of this very letter to Mrs. Ellison upon it, and the address, "111, Ball's Pond Road"—I also find on the blotting paper the impression of some names clearly in George Shaw's writing—I am quite sure he has used this blotting paper to blot his writing—here is the name of William on one sheet, which is marked "A"on both sides, another sheet is marked B2, and on the sheet marked C1 is "truly Seymour,"and on A2 there are several figures—I should require a looking-glass to find it all out—por<lb/>tions of these draft securities in Drew's case are in George Shaw's writing—these letters from Howard to Murray of 8th March, and 3rd, 5th. and 10th April, 1873, are in George Shaw's writing, and so is the heading to the proposal of 13th March, 1873—these letters of Howard to John Shaw and Sons, dated 28th July, this draft bond, the heading to this proposal, this letter of Howard to Brown, this proposal in Knight's case, dated 22nd September, 1874, this letter from Seymour to Lubin, and from Sey<lb/>mour to Sunday, dated 9th April, and these letters from W. Holland to</p>

               <p>Shroff are all in George Shaw's writing—here is some more blotting paper—I think there is some of Thomas's writing on it, but very little, only some figures, nothing particular—I do not feel any difficulty about the various writings.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). Five cases were mentioned on the first day I was examined, Holmes, Benner, Heath, Nicolady, and Barnes of Manchester—I have looked into them, and find that Holmes was introduced by Gard, and the commission paid to Gard was 50 per cent.—Benner was introduced by Gard in November, 1866, and L. W. Heath in October, 1866, and 50 per cent, commission paid to Gard—Nicolady and T. Barnes of Manchester were introduced by Rogers, and 50 per cent. commission paid to him—I have had all the papers looked out in Callaghan's case—he was introduced by Brown in March, 1876—I have examined them, and find that this list is substantially correct, and so are the details of the different years. (<hi rend="italic">This was headed</hi> "Specimen of death claims paid upon policies")—there are a considerable number of them from 1872 to 1877, amounting altogether to 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the policies generally were not renewed, or if they were, it was not for more that a year—Mr. Phelps, of the firm of Phelps, Bennett, and Woodward, became a holder of five shares in February, 1865; but in July, 1867, he took ten more—he is only a holder of ten now—his liability is unlimited—Phelps, Bennett, and Co. were solicitors to the association when the shares were taken; they continued so, I think, up to 1876—their office is 14, Red Lion Square.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE HAWKINS</hi>.<hi rend="italic">In my opinion Mr. Gorst is entitled to a general Reply. The right of Reply is in my judgment vested in the Attorney-General by reason of his representing the Crown in all cases which are really prosecuted at the suit of the Crown, by which I mean, not ordinary prosecutions which are not prosecuted at the suit of the Crown, although the Queen's name appears nomi<lb/>nally as the prosecutor, but prosecutions on behalf of the country at the instigation and direction of the law officers of the Crown, and which may for this purpose be termed State prosecutions. Wherever a ease is really prosecuted in that sense, I think the Crown has the prerogative right of Reply, and if the Attorney-General, whose duty it is to conduct such a prosecution appears in person to conduct it, he has that prerogative right, not because of a mere personal privi<lb/>lege attached to himself, but because he is the representative of the Crown, exercising the prerogative of the Crown. For this reason it is that the Solicitors</hi>-<hi rend="italic">General, in the absence of the Attorney-General, and representing him, has always been allowed the same right, and not because of a personal privilege attached to his office, and for the same reason I am of opinion that any Queen's Counsel or ordinary barrister appearing as the representative of the Attorney-General in such prosecutions as I have referred to, is entitled, on behalf of the Crown, to the same privilege of Reply</hi>.</p>
