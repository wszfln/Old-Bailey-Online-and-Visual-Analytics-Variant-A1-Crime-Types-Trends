                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker and jeweller, of 5, Barbican—on Saturday afternoon, 15th December, the prisoner came into my shop—I did not know him before—he wanted to look at some signet rings; he said he wanted three of a sort—I showed him a tray—he said there were none there to suit him—I showed him four more by themselves—he selected one from them—he then said he thought there were some more in the window that he could select from—I took out four more for him, and there was another he thought would suit him—he then got me to look out another from the window, and while my back was turned to get the ring, he abstracted one of the others—I did not see him do it, but when I came back from the window, I looked at the rings that had been placed before him, and one was missing—I immediately asked him for it—he said he knew nothing at all about it, that he was a respectable man, and I was quite mistaken—I said I knew I was not mistaken, I was as positive that he had got one as possible, for there was one missing, and unless I knew more of him than I did, I Should give him into custody for stealing it, which I did; but during the interim when I went to the door to look for a policeman, he tried to throw me down and get away, but I held him tight till a policeman came—there was a lady in the shop at the time, who had come in before the prisoner—she was waiting for a watch, I was altering the regulator for her, but I left her to serve him—after the prisoner was taken away, I searched the shop and in a corner I found these two brass rings, imitation wedding-rings, and these pieces of paper all bitten and torn up—I put them together, and it is, a bill of some goods to the amount of 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the missing ring was not found</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101070004"/>
               <p>—I think he swallowed it, for he had a box of oil capsules in his pocket; or else in the struggle to get away, he must have thrown it away—I am quite satisfied that there was a ring missing—the value of it was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner spoke English quite well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that I threw you down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I am lame—a finger would not knock me down; I had hold of the door<lb/>post, and I held tight hold of you—the woman who was in the shop had not the same opportunity of stealing the ring as you had—she came in before you, and waited after you were gone—I knew her well; she is a respectable person in the neighbourhood—she was not as near the rings as you were she could have reached them if she had liked—the woman was not standing nearer to the rings than you were—I was on the right, then the woman, and then you—the rings were nearer to you, especially the last lot that I took out of the window—I did not take the ring up in my hands and put it in the window, or anywhere else.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The deposition was then read at follow</hi>:—<hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR BENNEYY</hi> says: I am a builder, and reside at Hackney. On Wednesday, the 3d instant, at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing at my yard gate when I saw the prisoner Wilson coming towards me; he came up to me and spoke about the weather, then upon business—he said, "Very unpleasant business has brought me here to-day; a man whom I've had in my employ, and my father twenty years before, has recommended me to a gentleman in this neighbourhood of the name of Drake, who has a pony for sale; perhaps you know him, he is a Quaker, and they are very particular folks to deal with—I came down yesterday, and saw the pony, and it's just such a one as I want; they have been driving it in a basket chaise, with a lady, and I want it for the same purpose; I have agreed to give ten guineas for the pony." He again repeated that the gentleman's name was Drake, and that he lived in Hack<lb/>ney. I told him that I did not know Mr. Drake, when he, the prisoner, said, "I gave my man, this morning, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and a sovereign, to go for the pony, pay for it, and bring it to me home, but, to my surprise, he came back with the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and sovereign, but without the pony." He then went on to say that the gentleman would not let him have the pony, and then added, "I have come down to know the reason, and, to my vexation, found that my man had offered the gentleman ten pounds instead of the ten guineas, and Mr. Drake was so exasperated that he would not let him have the pony at all." The prisoner Wilson then said that he had seen Mr. Drake's groom, who had promised "to follow me here.'1 On saying this, he, Wilson, turned round, and exclaimed, "O, here he is!" and the other prisoner, Rumsey, came up, and Wilson said to him, "I have been telling this gentleman how your muster has served me with respect to the pony." (I took Rumsey to be Mr. Drake's groom.) Ramsey's reply to Wilson was, "No, roaster won't sell it you at any price; I could sell it, but not to you," addressing Wilson. Wilson then turned to me, and asked me how he should get out of it. I said, "Well, you give me the money, and I will give it to the groom," meaning Rumsey; "and he can go and tell his master that I have bought it, and then he can give the pony up to you." Rumsey then said, "No, you are not to have it; that won't do, I'm not to take his money." Wilson then said, "As the groom seems so particular, is there anywhere we can go and sit down?" I said, "Oh, yes!" and led the way into my own house—we seated ourselves, and Wilson took out his pocket-book, and laid it down on the table, then opened it, so that I could see a lot of notes, and he took out one note which appeared to me to be a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank note; he then took out a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank note, and said, "This is the note I gave my man this morning;" he then replaced the other note, folded his pocket-book, and put it into his pocket. The other prisoner was not then with us; he was waiting at the gate. Wilson gave me the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and one sovereign; that was in my house. I told him that the sovereign made it 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more than was to be given for the pony, upon which he said, "O, never mind, those men always expect something." We then went to the gate where the groom (Rumsey) was standing; I tendered him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the sovereign; he objected to taking the note, saying that his master would not have the money from Wilson, and that his master would know it was his, and that he.(Rumsey) would lose</p>

               <p>his situation. He then gave me the note back, and Wilson asked me to change it. I took the note in ray hand, and went to a butcher close by to get it changed. Rumsey went with me; he waited outside while I went in. I told the butcher what I wanted, and he came out with me, and directly collared Rumsey; I turned and saw Wilson running away. I kept possession of the 101. note; it is now produced; I wrote my initials on it; it has since been stamped "forged," as it now appears. Rumsey was given into custody, and Wilson was afterwards taken by a police-constable. Wilson offered me a sovereign to let him go, but I told him I would not if he gave me a hundred. The pocket-book produced is the same in which I saw what appeared to be bank notes at my house. Rumsey was then dressed nearly as he is now."</p>

I am in partnership with Mr. Barelay, as chemists, at 55, Fore-street—the prisoner was occasionally employed by us as a bottle-washer, seldom exceeding two days at a time—he was last employed on Thursday and Friday, 6th and 7th December—he was introduced to us by a man of the name of Childers, who was then in our service, but whom we have since discharged—this potash is the same sort as we have in our stock—it is iodine of potassium—the bottle in which it is, is the same sort of bottle that we have—here is one from the warehouse—they are called pottle-quarts—we purchase this potassium from Atkinson and Co.—this label is the same as ours—we last took stock on 30th June—I was present, assisting, at the time—we then had eleven of these bottles in stock, and they were full—after this matter was brought to our notice we took stock again, and went through our books—we find that we are losers of this article to a considerable extent—we found six full bottles and four empty ones, and one missing—I have examined the books with a view to find out whether any bottle has been sold, and I am able to say positively that no bottle of this size has gone out, so that one of the eleven bottles is unaccounted for—that would not contain all the potassium that we have</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the office of the Submarine Telegraph Company, in Threadneedle-street, and live in Chatham-place, Locks'-fields—about half-past 9 on the night of 21st December, I had three, cases of turkeys in the room of the telegraph office—I left them for a few minutes</p>

               <p>to get' a cab—when I came back I found one of the cases open—I put my hand in the case; I was told it was open—I found something deficient—I ran into the back room where I found the prisoner with a parcel under his arm, which I believed to be the turkey, rolled up in paper and tied up—I said, "How dare you to open the case?"—he said he had not touched it—he went into the back room, which we term the wheel room, and laid down the parcel that he had under his arm—I begged of him to give me up the turkeys, and told him I would give him in charge if he did not—he said he had not touched them, but he went and laid the parcel down on the shelf while I was speaking to him—one other turkey was afterwards produced—two turkeys were produced before the magistrate—they had been in the cases—there were no other turkeys there—each of the turkeys found was tied up in a duster—these dusters belong to the prisoner—I know that because they were dusters used in the office, and he was employed as a cleaner there.</p>

On 13th December, about half-past 2 in the afternoon I was on duty in Cannon-street, and saw Daniels standing there—I watched him, and then saw Bollen, then carman, go and speak to him; they conversed together two or three minutes—Bollen then returned to his van, which was standing at the prosecutor's door in Nicholas-lane—he then drew the van into the street, where he met Walklin and Bollen, and Walklin went into the Boar's Head public-house, Cannon-street—they came out—Bollen got on the front of his van and drove away—I lost sight of Walklin—I followed the van through Islington, Holloway, up to a coffee-shop in Camden-town, where Bollen got out and was joined by Daniels—I looked over the blind and saw Daniels—they came out together and Daniels and the boy Brooks, who was with him, got into the van and drove away—two got in, and one was in front—I followed the van to the corner of Mornington-road, Camden-town, where Daniels got down, and a bag which he had previously had on his arm, was handed to him by Bollen while the boy was sent into a shop to deliver some goods—I followed Daniels to Camden-road station—he was about to enter the station yard, and turned round and observed me behind him—we had a long conversation respecting what he had got in the bag—we got into a cab together, and while on our way to the City I suggested that we should go to the station and he could give an explanation to the inspector how he came by it—I took him in custody—I had been watching the prosecutor's premises nearly two months—on Wednesday, 5th December, I was watching and saw Daniels and Bollen together come out of the Boar's Head about 1 o'clock in the day—Walklin came from the warehouse and passed within a few yards of them—Daniels then left Bollen and followed Walklin over London-bridge, about ten yards behind him, and joined him after turning the corner of York-street—they then talked together for about a quarter of an hour—I had also seen them together on several occasions, and had seen them drinking together in the Boar's Head public-house—it was in consequence of that that I communi<lb/>cated with the firm—next morning, the 14th, I took Bollen in custody, and about half an hour afterwards I took Walklin—I told him that he was charged with stealing from his employers 16 lbs. of pepper and 7 lbs. of almonds—he said, "Let me get my coat, and I will go with you"—he gave a false address at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Petty, Wood, and Co. wholesale grocers, in Nicholas-lane, and retail, in King William-street—Bollen was our carman, and had been so about eight years—Walklin had been our porter about ten years—he was in the wholesale department, Nicholas-lane, and had the charge of making up parcels, assisted by West—he went to the stock for the contents of the parcels—he did not require any<lb/>body to deliver them—the warehouseman, White, each day enters in a book the articles required for him to put up; if there are half-a-dozen for one man, the name and address of that man is put opposite to them—it was his duty to make up the parcels as they are entered in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); the book being signed at the time the parcels are made up, the parcels are then called over by a warehouseman, he checks them from the bills of parcels and they are put into the van—he does not call them over from the book, but from the delivery notes—the parcels are in the department when Mr. White calls them over—they are called over immediately before they are put into the van—Walklin is present when they are called over—he takes part in it—they are called over by marks—there is a description on each parcel for them to deliver them by—it is a direction which the carman understands, but it is not the man's name—these are the goods (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we had similar goods in our warehouse—Walklin had no right to send out this parcel that day without any direction—this book is in the writing of several persons—it is simply copied from our day-book—Walklin had no right to make up this parcel in addition to the entries in the day-book—he was not directed to send any goods to Daniels that day.</p>

               <p>13th November, and there was no parcel that was not endorsed—I do not know this parcel—there was no parcel to spare beyond those which tallied with the invoices—Walklin had no right to make up any extra parcel after he had called them over—if he had been directed to make up any parcel by any person in the establishment, I should have been told of it—I found a parcel for Robson, of Camden-town, of 141bs. of pepper, and 71bs. of Jordan almonds, and called it over among the others—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) are the covers of that parcel—these hieroglyphics on it are in Walklin's writing—it is: "14 white pepper R.C.T".—that means, "Robson, Camden Town"—this wrapper taken from Daniels, has on it "14 white pepper," in Walklin's writing, but has no initials—the parcel of almonds, is marked "7 of Jordan C."—C. is the quality; there is nothing to indicate the address—that also is in Walklin's writing—he had no authority to send those out that day.</p>

Jordan C.; Robson, Camden-town," and received an answer from Walklin in the other room—I could not see whether he answered from the parcels or from the book, or from his memory—there were fifty or sixty parcels on that day—I did not know when I had called over all, that there were any left—West assists Walklin to pack up the parcels; they are made up openly in the warehouse—I have sometimes checked them with West when Walklin was not there at all, and I believe the boy West sometimes packed up parcels when Walklin was not there—I do not recollect articles being brought back by the man, saying that two parcels had been made up for one customer—I was engaged in the business on the day before this, but do not recollect that I was engaged in packing up parcels when Walklin was not there.</p>

I am a light porter in the employ of Wood and Co.—it was my duty to help Walklin to make up his parcels—he has the book by him to make them up by—on Thursday, 13th December, he was making up parcels by it, at the time of my being sent out—when I came back he said, "Empty that bag of pepper into No. 1, white bin;" which I did, and then he told me to put 14 lbs. into it—all the parcels that had been called over had been put into the van at that time—I took the bag to the bin, filled it took it to the scale and weighed it, and he took it out of the scale and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101070017"/>
               <p>did it up—he then told me to do up 7 lbs. of Jordan almonds, C.—I weighed them and did them up and then he marked them—these are the parcels—he marked what there was in the bag, and then said, turning over his books, "Oh, never mind the initials, Bollen must find out who they are for"—and then he told me to take them to the van where the other parcels were—the calling over was finished: they had been in the van a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and the van was ready to start—I took them to the boy in the van—Bollen was not there.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you very busy just then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he did not look at his book just before he gave me the order—this book was on the counter—he took it in this way, and said, "Oh, never mind the initials, let Bollen find out who they are for"—he had not written the initials on the parcels, but he had written what there was in the bag—it was after that that he turned over the book—what he said was, "Bollen must find out who they are for by his notes"—the van bad been loaded and had drawn up the lane, and I took them down the lane—I was there part of the time when Mr. White was calling over the goods—I did not see Mr. Solly—I was not always sure that it was Mr. White who called them over, but I enquired, and afterwards it came to my memory that it was Mr. White—I was not sure of it before the Magistrate—I sometimes check the parcels myself, in the pressure of business—I never heard of too many parcels being sent out in mistake, but there have been mistakes—Mr. White was in the room when Walking told me to take the parcels out to the van—Mr. White said, "I hope the van has not gone, if you have not got all the parcels in it"—he was getting this very parcel ready at that time—I have sometimes checked parcels when Walk<lb/>lin has not been there—it is sometimes done by book and sometimes from memory, but then the parcels are there, though not the rough notes—I have always seen Walklin hard at his work from 7 in the morning—we are some<lb/>times there as late as 12 at night, just before Christmas.</p>

I have pleaded guilty to this charge—on 13th December these two parcels were in my cart—I do not remember taking them—I gave them to Daniels—I did not see them brought to the cart, I was across at the warehouse watering the horses—I do not know who brought them in—I went down Nicholas-lane and Cannon-street, and Walklin beckoned me down off the box into the Boar's Head—he asked me where I should meet Daniels—at that time I could not tell him where I would meet him, or at what time, but I said I should stop at Camden-town to tea, and would meet him there—he did not tell me anything further—he told me there were two parcels in the van—he paid, "You have got two parcels, one of Jordan's, and two of pepper, the same as for Robson; but you will be sure to know them, for I have marked them in full—you are to give them to Daniels f" I met Daniels at the coffee-house where I stopped to tea, and I then gave them to him—I served three or four customers, and I gave them to him at a shop in the Mornington-road—there was no arrangement with me about paying—I was only to deliver them to him—I have seen</p>

               <p>Daniels there before—he has frequently bought things at our warehouses—old fruit, and paper, and several things, and I have seen him about when he has not bought things—I have seen him frequently with Walklin, and with other people in the place too—I have received money from Walklin at times—I did not see Walklin that day after I got back from the van—I did not see him again at all before I was taken in custody—money has passed between him and me; I cannot call to mind the date, but about two or three weeks before 13th September: on several occasions; I cannot tell the exact amount—I think in one instance 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and on another occasion I think 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have seen Daniels upon one of those occasions—I think the money from Walklin was given me for goods of this description; something similar to this. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I am foreman to Mr. Dervey, a boot maker, of 39, Poultry—I know Daniels and Walklin, I have seen them together—my attention was called to them by Smart the officer—on 5th December last, I went into the Boar's Head public-house, Cannon-street, at Smart's request—I had a glass of ale, and while I was waiting there, Daniels came in—he looked the side of the window as if he were waiting for some one—Bollen came in and they had a very deep conversation for some three or four minutes—I went out and told Smart what I had seen—he asked me to go back again—I did so, and they were still talking—I went out—Daniels went out just before me, and he was joined by the porter—Daniels went over the bridge, and I and Smart went together and watched them over the bridge—Walklin was before Daniels, and when Walklin had gone round the corner he stopped for a moment and was joined by Daniels, and they stopped and talked together for some time, at a grocer's shop at the corner of York-street, over the bridge—the next day, the 6th, I went up to see whether I could see Smart at the same place where I went the day before—he was not there, but I saw Daniels—I watched him some minutes—he went into the Boar's Head public-house, and was there joined by Walklin, and they had a pint of ale together—they stayed there about six or eight minutes—I was there all the while—I left them there and went to look for Smart—I saw them come out together—they went over the bridge together.</p>

I carry on business as a wholesale cheesemonger in Miles-lane, Upper Thames—street, in partnership with Arthur Brock<lb/>sopp—I have seen the prisoner at my place of business about three times altogether—on the first occasion my partner sold him some goods; I was in the warehouse—we told him we would sell them for cash—that was about two months before this transaction—we were paid by a cheque from his father—the cheque was paid and then we sent the goods—we got the money first—I remember his coming a week or two after, with a second order for goods—I was present then—nothing was said to him about credit—the goods were brought back, in consequence of no money being paid—on the afternoon of Wednesday, 2d January, he came and selected articles to the value of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which form the subject of the present indictment—I distinctly told him I should not sell them unless he paid cash for them—he said, "Very well, when you send the goods I will pay the money"—I sent the goods by Rowland, the carman, with an invoice, and I gave him in<lb/>structions—he came back again about two hours after, without the money or the goods.</p>

I am the wife of Samuel Brazier, a baker, of Milton-street—the prisoner lives a few doors from me—on Thursday evening, 27th December, the prisoner's daughter came to our house between 6 and 7 o'clock—she made some communication to me, and a wagon came afterwards to our door, and the carman took from the wagon three sacks of flour—he put them in a bake-house at the back of the shop—I did not see anyone with the carman—after that, the same evening, my husband asked me some<lb/>thing about those sacks, and after that, one man took away two of the sacks; and another man took away the third—I do not know of my own knowledge where they were taken to—I did not see them taken anywhere—I saw, when the man brought the wagon, that there were other sacks of flour besides these three—the carman took them from the back of the wagon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness—I remember coming in last Thursday week, 27th December, in the evening, and finding three sacks of flour—I asked my wife some question about them—in cones<lb/>quence of what she said to me I went to Mr. Styles', and found him at his shop—I said to him, "Who authorized you to send flour to my place?"—he said, "Oh! you have no need to flurry yourself about it"—he began relating something about a man being stuck in the snow, and could not get his wagon along up the street; I did not pay much attention to that; all I said was, "You must take it off my premises"—I told him I had no room,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101070028"/>
               <p>and if I had, I should not keep it on my premises—I said that if he did not do so, I should not go home, I should go to Moor-lane station-house, unless he came with me, or sent some one to fetch it away—he made no remark upon that, he went out to look for a man—I saw him coming up the street with a man, and his daughter came with the man—the man went into the bake-house with the prisoner's daughter, and took one sack of flour, then he came for the other, and took that also—he went down to Mr. Styles' house—I stood at the street door, and saw him go down with the sack on his back in the middle of the road—I got M'Caffrey, another man, to take away the third sack—he lives directly opposite me—I went, with him, to the prisoner's house—I observed the sacks that were taken from ray premises—they were the same as I generally have—there was a mark on them, "City of London"—I am quite sure that mark was on both sides of each of the three sacks—when I went into the prisoner's shop, I said to him, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to put flour in my premises while I was in bed,' because he had sent up to see me—he said, "Oh, go on, go on!"—that was all he said—I walked away—I had no connexion with the man—I had never bought any flour or anything else of him.</p>

Bingham, of Chapel-street, Cripplegate, and live in Leonard-street, Finsbury—on Thursday, 27th December, I was in the Axe public-house, Milton-street, between 6 and 7 in the evening—the prisoner came there to me—he called me out and asked me to go up the street and fetch down two sacks of flour—I went with his daughter up the street, to Mr. Brazier's—I took a sack of floor from there to the prisoner's shop, and put it in the back room—I went up and fetched another and got part of the way with it and tumbled down and hurt my ancle, and could not go any more—I do not know what kind of sack it was; it had a mark on it,; I did not observe what the mark was—the prisoner gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the job—I did not take the second sack the whole of the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employment of Thomas and Charles Kingsford, millers, of Deptford—I remember on 27th December our wagon bringing some flour up to London—it left between 7 and 8 in the evening—it had forty sacks of flour when it left home—it was in charge of the carman—he was instructed to leave fifteen sacks at two bakers', and twenty-five sacks he was to take to the City of London Union, at Bow—he never returned—the wagon was brought home by a strange man about 3 o'clock on Friday morning—the carman has not returned since—we examined the wagon the next day, and found in it eighteen sacks of flour and one empty sack; three out of the eighteen sacks had been opened, and about half a bushel of flour taken out of each—the eighteen were intended for the City of London Union, with "City of London" marked on the sacks—the empty one was for the City of London Union—all the sacks in which the flour for the Union was, were marked "City of London," and the property of the City of London—the sacks were marked from top to bottom in long letters, "City of London"—they were marked on both sides, I believe, to the best of my knowledge—I have seen the sacks several times and I think they were marked on both sides—I am sure that mark was on all the twenty-five.</p>

I was sent for to the Queen's Head on 22d December—I found both of the prisoners there—the man was on the left of the woman, a little behind her—she had her back to him—he was facing her back, and I saw her put her left hand behind her with something in it, and I saw the man's arm go behind her, but could not see his hand—I saw his arm move, and saw something dark in the woman's hand—the landlord shouted out, "She is putting something behind her," and Lesson shouted out, "I have got it," or something like that, and held up a glove—I took the woman to the station—the man came there in about a quarter of an hour—I heard him say the woman was his wife—this is the glove with the sixteen shillings and a counterfeit half-crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found ten of the shillings wrapped up in separate pieces of paper, and six more wrapped up in another long piece of paper separately—the half-crown was wrapped up in a paper by itself—this is the bad shilling that was given to me by Lesson (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—after the male prisoner said that the woman was his wife, the inspector ordered him to be detained, and directed me to lock him up—while I was locking him up he denied all knowledge of the woman, and said he had not been at the Queen's Head—I said he was the man I did see there—I searched him and found a florin, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, all good money—2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on the woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Brinnerton, near Chesterfield—I was in the service of the bankrupts, Poole and Bryan—they carried on business as manufacturers of boots and shoes at Northampton, their warehouse was in Bull Head-lane, Northampton—on 13th August last, the workmen left their service—they were told by Poole not to come till 18th, when they were to come for their money—he told them that on the Saturday night, but it was on the Monday morning, the 13th, when the work people were stopped working—they worked till just before dinner, then they gave over, and did not return after dinner—they did not return till the 18th, when they came for their money—when they went away on the Monday morning, the warehouse was closed for the workmen, excepting Poole, Chapman, myself, Woodford, and Ventris—Ventris was not there on 13th—I and Woodford remained in the ser<lb/>vice of the bankrupts—on that day, the 13th, I received orders from Mr. Poole (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">considered it would be impossible to entertain that question until the close of the case for the pro<lb/>tecution.</hi>) On 13th Poole ordered Woodford and I to go into the shoe-room of the factory at Northampton, and help him to pack a lot of trunks with boots—they were Wellington boots, and spring-sides, and half Wellingtons as well—we packed ten trunks—Poole then ordered us to load them in the van and to take them to Mr. Pearce's house in Castilian-street, Northampton—Woodford and I took them there and left them—afterwards on the same day I had orders from Poole to go to Earls Barton, that is about seven miles from Northampton—he ordered me to fetch away all the work that the agent, Mr. Stone, had got ready—I went with a van, and took a large hamper, packed a large hamper—I received a large hamper of goods from Mr. Stone at Earls Barton, containing Wellington boots, half Wellingtons and Bluchers, I think—Poole ordered me to take the hamper to Thomas Chapman's at Kingsthorpe when I got it from Stone—I took the hamper to Chapman's, and left it there—Kingsthorpe is near Northampton—Chapman was there when I left the hamper, and he had it put in his coach-house—it was about 8 o'clock in the evening when I got there—I saw Poole at Northampton when I returned with the horse and van—I told him I had taken the hamper to Thomas Chapman' s, and he then told me that he wanted me to go to Lon<lb/>don the next morning—that would be the 14th August—I went to London—no one went with me—I saw Poole in London; when I got into New Oxford-street I saw him with a gentleman—I returned to Northampton on 15th, between 5 and 6 in the evening—when I got back I went to Mr. Poole's house in George' s-street—I saw Poole, Chapman, and Ventris there—Poole gave me the keys of the factory—Chapman was present, but Ventris was in the parlour—Chapman gave me orders to go to the factory and to pack a lot of trunks, as many as I thought would fill the van—Poole and Chapman were together when I got those directions—Mr. Poole gave me orders to take Woodford with me to assist me—we packed between seven and eight trunks, I can' t say exactly—we packed them at</p>

               <p>the factory with Wellington boots, and Bluchers, and half Wellingtons, and spring sides—Woodford and Poole and Chapman assisted me—after we had packed them, Poole ordered us to load them in the van, and Chapman gave us orders to take them to his house at Kingsthorpe—we took them there—Chapman told us we were not to go on the Kingsthorpe-road, that we were to go on the Kettering-road—Woodford and Poole were present when he told me that—the Kingsthorpe-road is the direct road—I should say it is about three miles to go round by the Kettering-road, and about a mile or a little over by the Kingsthorpe-road.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been living at Leicester lately; but I formerly lived at Northampton—I was in the employ of Messrs. Poole and Bryan, as carpenter—I believe I left on 20th August last—I recollect 13th August last—Mr. Poole gave me some orders on that day—he discharged all the men except me and Beard; and he ordered us to go into the shoe-room to pack a quantity of trunks with boots and shoes—we packed them—we had orders to take them to Mr. Pearce's house, in Castilian-street, Northampton—we took them and left them there—I recollect 15th August—I had orders to go up to Mr. Poole's house on that day—as I was going up I met Beard, and he said he had orders to tell me to go and assist him in packing more trunks with boots and shoes—we packed them—as we were packing them Poole and Chapman came down, and Chapman ordered us to take them to his house at Kingsthorpe—Poole was present when Chapman said that—we took them to Kingsthorpe, but we went a round about way there; not on the regular road—we went up the Wellingborough-road—that is not the Kettering-road—there are two roads, the Wellingborough-road and the Ketter<lb/>ing-road—we took the goods to Chapman's and left them there; he received them of us—we returned to Northampton that night, and, on our return, we saw Mr. Poole, and told him where we had taken the goods, and he ordered us to be at the factory the next morning—we went there the next morning—I saw Ventris, Poole, and Chapman there, all three together in the office—we received orders from Ventris to burn some papers in the furnace—after we had burnt the papers Poole gave us orders to go in the shoe-room, where we were to assist in packing some more trunks with boots and shoes—we packed a great quantity of trunks—we were all the day about it—in the evening we went to the factory, after we had packed</p>

I live at Kingsthorpe, Northampton, and am a shoe<lb/>maker—I know Chapman: his premises adjoin mine—I remember his making an application to me on the subject of a barn—that was on a Sunday afternoon, the 18th or 19th August, I believe, or somewhere there, abouts—I allowed him to have the barn—he told me he wanted it to put a horse in for a few days—I recollect some goods being put in the barn the same evening—instead of a horse he put some boxes and a hamper—I went into my garden, which is usual with me before I go to bed, and I saw two or three men in the garden—I said, "Halloa!" and Mr. Chapman said, "Hush, hush!"—we had a little conversation about it, and he said that he had taken a quantity of goods of Mr. Poole for a large debt that was owing to him—I made little or no reply to that—the goods remained there for several days; not until the messenger of the Court of Bankruptcy seized them, they were afterwards removed—the barn was in a very dilapidated state, and it rained in in forty places—it was not fit for anything to be in, alive or dead—the goods were taken into a room in my house, which I call a lumber room, with a better roof to it, and they remained there, in the same condition, till they were seized—there was no removal that I know of.</p>

Quilter and Ball: I am only telling you what took place—I do not know that anybody else was present; I think not—I did not mention it for three or four weeks—I have not mentioned it before any court of justice—I cannot say what gave rise to the conversation—I do not recollect any conversation before that—it took place in Mr. Poole's room, in his house—there was nothing particular before it that I noticed—I was not given into custody on this charge, or threatened—not the slightest charge has been made against me for removing these goods from Oxford-street, at the time when I was present and giving directions—I do not remember any complaint of any kind—I did not think to mention this to anybody, though I knew it was an improper suggestion—I understood Mr. Ventris had got possession and had got the keys in his possession, and that it was to be locked up until they sent down their man to take the stock—I did not think the suggestion would be acted upon by my partner—I thought it an im<lb/>proper suggestion—I did not mention it to Mr. Newton, because I did not think it would be acted upon, and I did not see Quilter and Ball—I went up to London on the 13th—I knew the goods were removed for a legitimate purpose, to be sold at the latter end of the week for wages—I did not go up to London because the money was procured in another way—I did not go up to get a bill of sale—I went up with my partner to London on the 13th to go to Gray, and to Byas and Co.—he stayed in London till the 15th—the money was raised in Northampton; I had nothing to do with the trans<lb/>action—it was raised by my partner in Northampton instead of the goods being sold—my business in going to London was connected with the business of the firm—one object was to go to our merchants to endeavour to get them to make a fresh agreement which they had not agreed to, to endeavour to carry on the business, and if they would not do that, to go to an accountant</p>

               <p>and have the thing brought to a close—I did not go to Quilter and Ball's—my partner did—he took down Ventris from that establishment—among other places in London, I went to Tozer's—he keeps a boot and shoe shop at 40, Gracechurch-street—a large quantity of boots and shoes were sent to tar's from Oxford-street, while I remained in town—I consented to that—there were six or seven baskets of different sizes—I was present when they arrived at Tozer's—I am not aware that they have actually been made part of the present charge against my partner—I was present at the police-court and was examined as to these goods.</p>

               <p>back from Kingsthorpe, that he told me he had sold goods to the amounts of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Cooke—it was four or five weeks before that that he told me he would sell the goods—he did not tell me he was in negociation to sell—I knew Mr. Chapman—I did not know that he was Mr. Cooke's agent—I do not remember that he told me that he had been negociating with Mr. Cooke, and expected to get an answer from his agent, Mr. Chapman, as to whether he would pay the amount that he required for a portion of the stock—I know that Mr. Cooke has brought an action against the assignees in respect of this very property.</p>

Quilter and Ball's office, and ask Mr. Ventris for some books—I was to tell Ventris that the goods had been seized that were at Kingsthorpe, but they should make it all right, they had got a man coming up from Walsall to claim them—I was to ask for a day-book and a small book—Poole also gave me a piece of paper with something written on it—I went to London—I got into London about a quarter-past 3 in the afternoon—I went direct to Quilter and Ball's, and saw Ventris—I called him outside on to the doorstep, against the street, gave him the piece of paper, and told him I had come for some books—I told him that the goods had been seized at Kingsthorpe, and that a Mr. Chapman was then gone down to Walsall to fetch Mr. Cooke up, as he did not come by the tele<lb/>graphic message—Ventris said it was a bad job'—he gave me some books, which I put in to a bag that I bought next door, and then came straight away to Euston-square-station and went to Northampton and to Mr. Dawson's office—I got there about a quarter-past 7, or a quarter to 8 at night—I gave the books to Mr. Poole, who was still there—Mr. Dawson and Mr. Poole's father were present when I gave them to him—no one else—I did not see anything particular done with the books that night—I went to Mr. Dawson's office again the next morning by an appointment of the previous night—when I got there I found Mr. Cooke, Mr. Chapman, and Mr. Dawson there—I do not think there was anybody else there that morning—I did not see the books there then—I never saw them again there—I saw them once when I was in London again—I do not think I saw them afterwards, when any<lb/>thing was done.</p>

Poole and Co. as foreman, up to 18th August last—I know Mr. Fisher, traveller for Mr. Cooke, of Walsall—I have seen him very frequently at Poole and Co's ware-house at Northampton, soliciting orders"—I did not say, "I recollect seeing Mr. Cooke himself there on 9th July last, as near as I can remember;" nor, "He was in conversation with Mr. Poole, and I understood, and was afterwards informed, that he had on that day purchased a large quantity of miscellaneous skins;" I did not say this to Mr. Dawson, "on 11th July, I was desired by Mr. Poole to assist in the packing of the stock so purchased.</p>

Parker, of Northampton, for twenty-four years, or near upon that altogether—I left the service through spite of a party—they made some charges against me, but it was through the insinuations of parties in their employ, and through those insinuations I was tried for embezzlement, and convicted—I got six months, and as soon as I was let out, Mr. Parker sent for me, and gave me a rise of wages of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—that was in June, 1854—I was secretary to a burial society—that must have been in some<lb/>thing like 1850—it was at Northampton—I left Northampton in 1851, and went to North America—I did not owe the society anything—I am quite sure of that—the burial society did not say I owed them anything—one society said so, and I paid them—that was the association of "clickers," a term used in our trade—that was not spite—I paid them back, and paid them with interest, after I came back from America.</p>

This property clearly was not so, because it was then in the possession of Ventris; it also implies an active concealment, that is, some act done; and if no such act is proved, it amounts only to a non-discovery.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I think so; unless my present, opinion can be changed by Serjeant Ballantine's argument. The point for you to contend against is this, whether the acts done out of the jurisdiction and before the adjudication, are not evidence of an employment of Ventris to do the act of concealment, which he did after the adjudication and within the jurisdiction.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I think not. I submit that in order to commit any offence here at all, a man must be clothed with bankruptcy.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I think that comes round to the same proposition. Three things must undoubtedly be made out: it must be shewn, in order to fix any of the parties, that the bankrupt is himself guilty of the offence; unless he is guilty, the other two prisoners cannot be assistants to the felony; it must also be shown that he, as well as the other two, is guilty of an offence within this jurisdiction, and then, in order to that, it is necessary to show what I have already stated.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>up to me and told me that I was watched, and that I must give the watchers a good chase, and I went a little faster—we went by Dychurch-lane and took the van to Mr. Poole's house, and not to Mr. Pearce's—Mr. Poole was there and Ventris too—we got there at a little after 11—the goods were put in the stable, and I went home—on the 19th I saw Poole at his house, and he ordered me and Woodford to go down to Chapman's house, but not before night—we went at 6 o'clock on Sunday night and saw Thomas Chapman, who took us into the kitchen of his house, where we re<lb/>mained till 11 o'clock, when Chapman came to us and told us that he had taken a barn of one of his neighbours, and he wanted us to shift all the goods out of the coach-house into the barn—we removed twenty-six or twenty-seven trunks and a hamper or two, and left them in the barn—we finished about 2 o'clock next morning and then returned to Northampton, to Poole's house—Woodford was with me when I got back—the gate was left undone and the back door like wise—we went in and found Mr. Billing<lb/>ham asleep on the sofa, he is a broker of Northampton—we awoke him—he gave us some orders, after which we loaded the van of the trunks that we took there on Saturday night in the stable, Woodford, Billingham, and myself, and took them to Hartwell, which is a few miles out of Northampton—I never was there before—Billingham went with me, and when we got there we put the van under a carrier's shed—I do not know his name, but I saw him afterwards—we went into his house and had breakfast with him, and the goods-were unloaded out of our van into his cart—I returned to Northampton with the van, and Billing-ham came with me—the carrier's cart started from Hartwell after me and it went to Billingham's house at Northampton—when we got to North<lb/>ampton, I saw the carrier's cart standing in the Bed lion-yard, opposite Billingham's house—I did not see whether the goods were in it then—(<hi rend="italic">Jeffs was here called in</hi>)—that is the carrier—it was between 10 and 11 on Monday morning when we got back to the Red Lion, near Billingham's house—I saw Poole afterwards at his house, and told him that we had taken the goods to Hartwell, and that they had returned to Northampton—I accompanied the messenger to Billingham's house in October, when some goods were seized—I think it was the 29th—I saw some trunks there in one of his bed-rooms, covered over with cloth—they were similar to what I took to Hartwell on the night of the 20th, and I believe they were the same make—they were then empty—we found a lot of leather and Wellington-tops at Billingham's—the leather was in one of the top rooms—I did not see any skins fetched, but I saw them—the twenty trunks that we took to Chapman's house on the 16th might measure two feet nine inches, two feet six inches, and two feet three inches—they are made especially for packing goods—I do not know what wood they were—they were covered over and had tin plates at the corners—the twenty trunks I took that night were covered with canvas like this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have never packed shoes—I put all the tarpaulin on the trunks after the goods were packed—Foster is the person who usually packed them.</p>

               <p>that time, but I have since heard that it is Weston—the barn is about fifty or sixty yards from Chapman's coach-house—we took from the coach-house to the barn, I should think, twenty-six trunks, besides a large hamper of goods—we put them in the barn.</p>

I did so, with Thomas Beard the carter, and they were in due form conveyed away in the van by Beard, as I understood, to Mr. Chapman's of Kingsthorpe, for Mr. Cooke; there were in all three van loads, and they left all in the same day; the last load left, I should think, as near as I remember, about half-past 5 or 6 o'clock, p.m.").</p>

I am one of the bankrupts, and live at Northampton—this day-book and ledger were kept in our establishment—this account in the day-book, headed to Cooke, is in Poole's writing—I know nothing of the transaction—I first heard of it, after the docket was struck, when the goods came back from Kingsthorpe—I then heard of it from Poole—here is an account in the ledger relating to a payment to Captain Poole—I know nothing of that—it is in Poole's handwriting—we suspended payments on 14th August.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor residing at Northampton—I know a person named Cooke, of Walsall—I know the prisoner—I know a man named Beard, in the employ of Poole—on 20th August, Mr. Thomas Chap<lb/>man came to my office and told me he was the agent of Mr. Cooke, of Walsall, that a large quantity of leather and other things had been seized by the messenger of the Court of Bankruptcy, which belonged to Mr. Cooke—Mr. Chapman was a perfect stranger to me then, as was also Mr. Poole and Mr. Cooke—I asked where Mr. Cooke was, and he said that he was at Walsall—I said the best thing would be for Mr. Cooke to come to me him<lb/>self; and in about an hour or so, Mr. Poole came to me, and told me who he was, and that he came respecting the goods that had been seized at kingsthorpe, belonging to Mr. Cooke, at Walsall—I said, "Well, do not they belong to the creditors"—he said that they had been sold to Mr. Cooke many weeks before the bankruptcy, and that it was a disgraceful proceeding on the part of the assignees: I then told him that I had seen Mr. Chapman—Mr. Cooke came to me, and told me that a messenger was in possession of his house, and he was in great trouble—I never saw William Ball there on that day, 30th August, or the following day—I cannot recollect that he ever was there with Mr. Poole and Mr. Chapman—the first time I saw Mr. Bail was some days after 3rd September—I am quite sure I did not see him to my knowledge on 30th August—the first time I saw him on this business, was some days after the 3rd September—he came by himself to my office—he stayed about ten minutes—I remember his coming again (<hi rend="italic">Looking at the paper</hi>)—this is the occasion I allude to—that was, I should think, a day or two after 3rd September—no one was present but myself and William Ball—the upper portion of this paper is in my writing—he told me that he came to state what he knew about the goods purchased by Mr. Cooke, of Walsall—I immediately took up this paper, these examinations being on it, and said, "Now, Mr. Ball, just tell me what you have to say," and alter I had done so, he read it over, and put his name to it.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101070083"/>
               <p>Ball could not have been present without his knowledge—I suppose my son is 15 years old—he was not at borne—he had not been at home in the morning—it escaped my recollection: I remember now that he was not at home, because I was alone at dinner—I did not cook my own dinner; the same servant cooked it—she had the same opportunity of seeing Captain Poole, and I believe she knew him—I suppose she would have known perfectly well if Ball had been there—she brought in coffee and cigars—there were no pipes—Captain Poole smoked—the servant did not come up to replenish the glasses—I do not know whether she let my visitors out at night, I did not hear her do it—I shook hands with the gentleman from the Peninsula, and the friend of my old schoolfellow, and I believe my servant let them out—I saw my client next morning—I had never seen him before—he was not a schoolfellow, or connected with a schoolfellow—when I saw Cooke he em<lb/>ployed me—Captain Poole was present, and Mr. Poole, and, I think, Chapman—I produced one or two papers—there was a sort of an invoice with a receipt—Poole was living at Northampton, he represented to me that he had made a sale of goods, which were seized by the messenger, and which really belonged to Cooke—it did not occur to me to say that such a thing would be entered in some book or other—Chapman was the man who made the first communication, and Poole' afterwards—I did not ask him whether he had any entry in his books—I asked him nothing about his books at any time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did you mean to go to trial without ascertaining whether there were any entries in Poole's books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, I did not ask any question about the books, and I did not think it necessary then—I have been an attorney 20 years, and I mean to say that, as an attorney of 20 years' standing, I commenced an action without any inquiry into the books—I heard afterwards that the books were in—the hands of the Bankruptcy Court—I made no inquiry about the books as a foundation to go to trial upon, and swear I had not seen them—certainly not—on my solemn oath these entries were not made in my office, and with my ink—Cooke produced some papers—I have no recollection of this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but this other is the document he produced to me; this one with the receipt to it—it purports to be a receipted invoice, signed by Poole &amp; Co.—Poole was present at the time—I did not inquire whether he had any entry of the transaction in his books—I asked Poole if it was so, and he said, yes, it was—I asked him what he did with the money, and he said he had given it to his father.</p>

Poole's after 13th August—I was on the premises—I was there on 15th—I kept the keys of the warehouse, and had charge of the entire stock—I did not see Beard and Woodford there on 15th—I and my brother clerk were the only persons there the whole day—I did not see Beard or Woodford packing any goods that day, or taking any from the warehouse—no goods were packed or moved that day to my knowledge—Mr. Poole had a horse and two vans—I cannot say when I last saw Beard mate use of them—the horse was sent down to the cow meadows, or to the race course, I do</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the employ of Mr. Cooke of Walsall—I keep his books—I produce the book in which the trade accounts are entered—I received this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and entered it up in the bought book—I believe it was on 12th July that I received it—I have the bought book with me (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—after entering it there I entered it in the cash book as well, as paid—I have the cash-book with me—after that I filed it—my initials are on the bottom of it; that enables me to speak to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let me look at your book 1 <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, It is the bottom entry on the second page—it is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let us see the entry in the cash-book (<hi rend="italic">it was handed in</hi>). Your entries in this cash-book do not seem to me to be in order of date exactly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; you will find, if you look through oar cash-book, that is frequently the case—our travellers were out, and received monies on certain dates and we did not make the entries consecutively—we make several entries together—the transaction of Poole and Bryan are all my writing—I should not say they were written with the same ink, and at the same time, a day or two after—I am certain that the entry about Poole and Bryan was written at the time I say, on or about 9th July—I can speak with confidence to that—it was written the day he gave me the document, the receipt—I am not aware that there is anything in the book to show that particularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That entry of Poole and Bryan is at the very bottom of the page, and turning over, there is no page or two afterwards filled up; are you quite certain that you wrote that entry while the two following pages were blank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I am quite sure of it (<hi rend="italic">the book was handed to the Jury</hi>)—I have the ledger here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I am certain that I made the entry of Poole and Bryan in the bought book on 12th or 13th July, I am not certain which—it is very probable that there may be a previous entry, dated 30th July—We frequently let our invoices run, goods do not come in for a fortnight or three weeks, and we do not enter them up until we get the goods—I do not know how this entry came to be made after one of 30th July, unless I had got the invoices to refer to—the probability is that those are entries of 30th June—the top of the page is headed "July," but you will find many things of that sort, if you look through the book—for instance, here is 30th and here is the 21st (<hi rend="italic">referring to the book</hi>)—these must refer to June invoices—I have not got them here to refer to—if they had not come into my hands previous to the 30th, probably I should not enter them till that date—I have no doubt these are invoices of 30th June, instead of July, and that they did not come into my hands until the latter part or middle of July—these figures refer to the folios in the ledger—here is the entry in the ledger—it is 30th July here—this would not be posted from the invoice, but from the bought book—I should take the same date that was there, therefore the mistake, if it was one, would run through the books—this "21" means July 21st—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101070092"/>
               <p>of course these would all run the same here, on account of being posted up in July—these figures are a reference to the number of the invoice—we have not brought the invoices here—this reference does not help me to fix the date—there is no reference to the cash-book in any of the previous entries on this page.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BEST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you explain what is the custom in your office in respect of invoices? What do you do with them when you receive them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are put in a clip similar to a letter-clip—they are put there as they come in—sometimes they remain in the clip a fortnight or three weeks before they are posted up—we do not sort them at all before posting—we enter them in the book just in the order in which they are in the clip, so that the 30th would be at the top, and the 1st at the. bottom—this invoice of the 12th I entered in the cash-book at the time, not in this book—I placed it among the invoices till it was posted, and then filed it; having the receipt it would not go among the regular invoices.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furniture broker and general dealer and live in the Horse-market, Northampton—I had some dealings with Poole and Bryan in May and June last; this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) contains the account of the goods I received from Poole and Co. up to the 20th June—I remember Mr. Shepcutt coming to my house and making a seizure of goods there—those goods were a portion of the same goods that are contained in this invoice, something like half, or hardly half of them, I should think, according to my calculation—I had them all together when I made the pur<lb/>chase of Poole—the goods that Shepcutt seized were the same goods I purchased of Poole—Shepcutt took away about half; a portion I had sold; those he seized were a portion of the purchase—I never went with Beard on 20th August last, to Hartwell, to Jeff's, the carrier.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, formerly in the employ of Poole and Bryan—on 18th August between 6 and 7 in the evening, I should say, I went to the factory at Northampton, and packed a quantity of boots and shoes of different descriptions—Beard went with me—Poole and Chapman came in while we were packing them—Chapman gave us some orders, after receiving which, we took the trunks we had packed to Kingsthorpe and put them in Chapman's coach-house there—there were either six or seven, I cannot exactly state the number—we afterwards returned to Northampton, and went to Poole's house—we saw Poole, who gave us some orders—I am not aware that we saw anybody else—I went to the factory between 9 and 10 next morning—I saw Poole, Chapman, and Ventris there, and Beard came in afterwards—we had orders from Poole and Chapman, in Ventris's presence, to go into the shoe room and assist in packing some trunks with boots and shoes—we did so—I should say we packed twenty trunks—we were engaged all day in packing them—Ventris was present all the time: he brought a quantity of shoes to pack a trunk, which he said were for himself—that was all he assisted in—after those goods were packed we received orders from Poole and Chapman, in Ventris's presence, to load them in the van and the light spring cart, and take them to Chapman's house, where we had taken the others the evening before—we took them to Chapman's house at Kingsthorpe, at midnight, and left them in the coach-house—after that we returned to Northampton—we saw both Poole and Ventris that night—Ventris gave me orders to be there early next morning, and take the cart and horse to Kingsthorpe, and take the trunk which we had left the evening before, and which was covered with canvas to Bramp<lb/>ton Station, and send it to London, which I did—it was directed to Islington—I gave it to the station-master—I was at the factory all day on Saturday, 18th—we had orders to take some bales of leather to the warehouse—I can<lb/>not exactly say who gave us those orders, but Poole, Ventris, and Mr. Pearce were present—we weighed the butts, and took them to Pearce's warehouse, in Dychurch-lane, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day—there were two loads of them—after we had taken them to Pearce's, the work people were paid, and after they were paid, we packed five or six more trunks with the goods which were brought in—that was between 6 and 7 in the evening—by we, I mean me and Beard; we were engaged the whole week—after the goods were packed, we had orders to take them to Pearce's warehouse, in Dy-church-lane—we loaded them in the van, and left the premises with the van at half-past 9 or 10 o'clock, I cannot state the time exactly, and as we were going across the market square, Ventris came to us and told us we were watched, and to give the parties a chase—Beard drove on with the van, and I remained behind and went back to Poole's house—I saw the goods there, and assisted in unloading them—we put them into the stable, at Poole's private residence—Poole and Ventris were there besides myself and Beard,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101070097"/>
               <p>and I believe Captain Poole was there at the time—Ventris saw us unload the goods—on Sunday, 19th, we received orders from Poole, and Beard and I feat over to Chapman's, at Kingsthorpe—we got there, it may have been, at half-past 6 in the evening—we went to Chapman's house and saw him—we remained in his kitchen till 11 or 12 o'clock—while we were there we removed the whole of the goods which we had taken in the week, to a neighbour's barn—we commenced about midnight—after we had done that we returned to Northampton, and arrived there about half-past 2, on the morning of the 20th—we went to Poole-'s house, went in, and saw a man named Billingham asleep on the sofa—he gave us some orders, and we loaded the van with the goods which we had taken there on the Saturday evening before—alter the goods were loaded I saw Beard and Billingham drive out of the yard with them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You know Beard well, do you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I made a communication to Mr. Newton, subsequent to these events—I can<lb/>not say the date—I have never kept memorandums of dates—as near as I can recollect this must have been the latter end of September or the beginning of October—I cannot tell you that it was the 10th or the 18th as I do other dates, I did not take any notice of the date—I have seen Beard's book several times—I believe 15th August was the first time I ever saw it—he may have shown it to me—I saw it in his hand in Poole's office—I believe he told me that he should take a memorandum of the dates, but whether I saw him write one down, I cannot say—I do not know that I have had his book in my hand—I did not see the contents of it in Poole's office—he had not told me before I was in Poole's office that he had taken down dates in that book—he told me he should take a memorandum of the dates, that is the most that I know about the book—I told nobody but Mr. Newton any<lb/>thing in reference to my conduct in removing the bankrupts' goods—I made; no communication to anybody about the transaction—between August and September—I fancied that we were not doing right, but if we had not been employed other parties might have been—I do not say that I knew we were doing wrong, I only fancied so—allow me to explain—I was in Mr. Poole's employ—he said he did not wish to discharge me for another week—that he should require me for another week, and I remained in his service a week longer than any other man—I cannot say that I removed these goods fancying that it was wrong, because if I did not do it some one else would—I was born and bred in Northampton—I knew a man named Peck—I was. away a short time from Northampton—it is two years ago since I left—I never remained away from Northampton, because Peck brought a charge against me of stealing some clothes of his—I know there was a man named Peck, and he was a peck—he lost no clothes that I am aware of.</p>

               <p>side boots, half a dozen waxed calf skins, and the ready closed uppers—there were other things which I rejected—the value of the whole was about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the goods were stamped "P. and Co."—I made an offer which Ventris refused—on Saturday, 20th October, he called on me in the morning stating that he had a party who had offered 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods I had looked out, and if I liked to give him 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I was a carman in the employ of Poole and Bryan—on the evening of 18th August I received directions from Poole, in consequence of which we loaded a lot of trunks with boots of different kinds, the work that was taken in that day, and a lot of solving leather—Woodford and I did it, and Poole helped us—we packed from six to seven trunks—we also packed some roan leather, some laces, and some leather, in bags—the roan leather is red leather which is used to make boots with—it was in whole skins, rolled up—Poole then gave us orders to take them to Mr. Pea roe's warehouse—we loaded and started with the goods between 10 and 11 o'clock at night—Woodford was with me—on the road, Ventris came to us, and told us something—after that, I went as fast as I could get my horse to go at a walking pace—I took the goods to Mr. Poole's house, and put them the stable there—Woodford assisted me—we left them there that night—on the following day, Sunday, the 19th, Woodford and I went to Chapman's house at Kingsthorpe—we returned from Kingsthorpe to Northampton on the Monday-morning, a little after 2 o'clock—we went to Poole's house, and found the side gate left undone for us, and the back door also—we went in, and found Billingham there—he told us that he was going to take the goods in the stable, into his care—he told me that all he wanted me to do was to drive, as he could not drive himself—we loaded the goods in the stable into the van—those were the goods I had left there on the Saturday night, the 18th—Woodford and Billingham assisted me—Billingham then told us he wanted to go to Hartwell—we took the goods there—that is six or seven miles from Northampton, the way he directed me to drive—Bil<lb/>lingham went with me, not Woodford—we went to the house of Jeffs, the carrier, at Hartwell, and saw him there—we unloaded the van into Jeffs' cart, took out the trunks, and put them into his cart—Jeffs, Billingham, and I did that—we then started for Northampton—I started first with my van, and Bil<lb/>lingham with me, and the carrier started afterwards—I saw Jeffs' cart start from Hartwell—I next saw the cart at Northampton, standing in the Red Lion-yard—I cannot say whether the goods were then in it—I saw them in it when I started from Hartwell—I saw some of those goods afterwards—I accompanied Mr. Shepcutt, the messenger, to Billingham's house, when some goods were seized there—I saw about six boxes in the bedroom at his house—I think this was about 29th October—they were similar boxes to those which had been removed from Poole's warehouse on the night of the 18th, and which were afterwards taken to Hartwell—I also saw some Wellington tops, some spring side tops, and some soleing leather found at Billingham's house—that was all buried among a lot of flock in a garret belonging to his house, and we found a piece of leather, marked "P. and Co.," which was handed to the messenger—Mr. Shepcutt shewed me some red skins that day, similar to the skins which we had packed on the night of 18th August, and which went to Poole's house.</p>

I was in the employ of Poole and Bryan—I went to the factory on 18th August last—we were there all day—we left for about an hour in the evening, to get some refreshment—in consequence of orders we received we packed the goods that the work-people brought in in the afternoon, besides other goods that were in the warehouse—there was a quantity of roan skins, I believe, and several bags of <hi rend="italic">kip offal</hi>—I and Bed loaded the goods into the van, and had orders to take them to Mr. Pearce's—that might have been about 10 o'clock, or a little sooner or later—we started with them, and as we were going across the market-square, Ventri's came to us—he spoke to us, and after that Beard drove on the van, and I remained behind—I afterwards went to Mr. Poole's house, and there saw the same goods that, had been packed in the van at the warehouse—they were put in the stable—we went to Kingsthorpe on the night of the 19th—on our return we went to Mr. Poole's—that must have been about 2 or half-past on Monday morning—I saw Billingham there—Beard was with me—Billing<lb/>ham said that he was going to take either charge or care of the goods, I could not say which of the two words it was, and that he was going to take them to Hartwell, and afterwards he was to send them back to his house at Northampton—we loaded the van with the goods, and Beard and Billingham drove out of Poole's yard with the van—that was all I saw of the van.</p>

In August last I was a carrier from Northampton to Hart<lb/>well I remember Beard and Billingham coming to my house early one Monday morning from 5 to 6 o'clock—it was some time in August, I believe they bad a van with them and some trunks in it—those trunks were re<lb/>moved from the van and put into the cart—I helped to remove them into, he cart, and Beard also—Billingham was there—after they were pot into he cart, I took them to Northampton—they both of them told me to take hem there—I believe Billingham himself spoke to me about it—I left them n the Red Lion-yard, under the gateway in my cart—when I went back to the cart, the goods were not there—I am not certain whether that is quite opposite Billingham's house or not, it is nearly opposite—Billingham paid for taking the goods from Hartwell to Northampton—I never saw the goods again.</p>

I was in the bankrupts' service as carman—on 13th August I received directions from Poole, but not in Chapman's presence—I know Stone, he is an agent for Poole, he takes work out and brings work in—I fetched a large hamper of goods from Stone's, on 13th August, by Mr. Poole's directions—Woodford was present, but nobody else—I took it to Chapman's house at Kingsthorpe—Chapman lived at Kingsthorpe then—Woodford was not with me—Chapman had it put in the coach-house, he desired me to assist him in putting it there—I have not seen that hamper since—on 15th August I received the keys of the shoe factory, at Northampton, from Poole, and Chapman then gave me orders to go to the factory and pack a lot of trunks, as many as I thought would fill the van—I am not usually the packer—I packed from six to seven trunks with boots and shoes of different kinds, and Chapman directed Woodford and me to take them to his house; when we got them there we put them into the coach-house, in the same place as we had put the hamper—on the 16th we received directions from Poole, in the presence of Chapman and Ventris, to go into the shoe-room and assist him in packing a lot more trunks—we packed, as near as I can say, about twenty—Poole then ordered us, in Chapman's presence, to load them in the spring-cart and in the van—I drove the van, Woodford drove the cart, and we took them to Chapman's house, at Kingsthorpe, and put them in the coach-house where we had put the others—it was about 10 o'clock when we started from the factory on the 15th, and 12 o'clock on the 16th—on Sunday night, the 19th, we had orders from Poole to go to Chapman's house, we went there and Chapman took us into his kitchen and kept us there till 11 o'clock at night—he told us he had taken a barn of one of his neighbours, to put a horse in, and that he wanted us to shift the goods out of the coach-house into the barn—all the goods were in the boxes and the hamper—Woodford carried them to me at the wall, and I carried them from the wall into the barn—Chapman's little boy, fifteen or sixteen years old, I cannot say exactly, walked before me to guide me and direct me to the place—when we had done that, Chapman gave us orders to go to Poole's house, and we did so.</p>

The point arose incidentally in Reg. v.

I told the Jury that concealment before adjudication would not do, but that if they thought the parties before adjudication, and in contemplation of it, took steps and employed agents for the purpose of concealment afterwards, and that in furtherance of that intention the goods were afterwards so concealed, that would do; and there is a ruling of Mr. Justice Littledale's to that effect in Reg. v.

Ventris, when he concealed those goods after the bankruptcy, was accessary to the offence committed by the bankrupt; the bankrupt was committing an offence possibly out of this jurisdiction and Ventris within it as an accessary, and the principal cannot follow the accessary. I also rely upon the objection already urged that there is no averment in the indictment that Ventris knew an act of bankruptcy had been committed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Must not the statute have contemplated goods got out of the way with the intention of concealing and embezzling them afterwards?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I take it that the act done by Ventris within the jurisdiction would be quite sufficient as against Poole, if Poole was an accessary before the fact to the felony committed by "Ventris, but the point as it comes to my mind in the result is this: as the statutable offence exists in the bankrupt, and in the bankrupt only, and the others are only indictable as accessaries, can the bankrupt or Chapman be accessaries before the fact to a felony committed by the hand of a person out of the jurisdiction.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

JUSTICE BLACKBURN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I am not clear about that, but if such a subtle answer as that is necessary, it certainly would be a point to reserve. The point I wish to draw your attention to is this, can Poole and Chapman down at Northampton be treated as accessaries before the fact to the concealment in Middlesex, when in fact Ventris who did the act is only brought in as a sort of principal in the second degree to Poole; if for any reason Poole is not guilty, must not the other two be not guilty also?</hi>

                  </hi>, I am a colonel in the Royal Marines, at Woolwich—on 4th Dec. I was in residence at the Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich—I went to bed that night about half past 12 o'clock—the house was all safe, and closed in the usual way, but, I apprehend, the bolt of the window was not properly shut, owing to some rust—that was a French window in the dining-room—about half-past 1 o'clock I was disturbed by hearing a noise below—I immediately rose, and, procuring a light, I pro<lb/>ceeded below to examine the house—I passed through the large dining-room into a small dining-room, and there found the place in confusion—the window was open—I closed it immediately, and went up stairs—there were no marks, of violence on the window—I have not the slightest doubt that it was shut when I went to bed, and fastened by the usual hasp handle; but the bolt above I do not think was fastened—I saw no one—at the first examination of the room I did not miss anything particular—afterwards I missed the dining-room clock, a tea-caddy, a pair of pistols from another room, and various small articles—I subsequently examined a chair which was lying down, and on it I found the print of a man's feet—I knew immediately from the peculiar pattern that those prints could only belong to the regimental boots of my corps—I did not find any footsteps outside—there were marks of blood on the railing by which the man, whoever he was, must have entered, and also on the drugget covering the carpet, and on the white hol<lb/>land blind—there was no glass broken—I have since seen, in the custody of the police, one pistol that I missed, and also the clock, tea-caddy, and certain small articles, and a portion of a gilt flower vase—they were all safe when I went to bed the night before—the house is not the public barrack; it is my official residence, it belongs to the nation—it is separated from the bar<lb/>racks, but is within the barrack boundary—it is in the parish of St. Mary, Woolwich—I know the prisoner Butler—I had not known Smith till I saw him before the Magistrate—I had seen Butler before, officially.</p>

I was on duty at Woolwich on the morning of 5th December—I heard of the burglary at the commandant's—I went with Sergeant Howard to the commandant's house, and from there to High-street, where I saw Butler in company with Smith, a civilian, and a military private—that which Howard has stated is correct—that was what passed—I had seen the prisoners together at half-past 12 that night, in the High-street—I saw them go into a coffee-house—afterwards, when I saw them, I said, "Where have you been since I saw you last night?"—Butler made no reply, but immediately turned round and tried to make his escape—I took him into custody, and took him to the station—Smith made his escape then, and I did not find him till the 12th—I took the boot from Butler's foot, and took it to Colonel Strancham's house—in my judgment that boot made the mark; there was the regimental pattern, and where the nails are worn out in the boot, there were the marks missing on the chair—in my judgment it was a mark made by that particular regimental boot—I found the time-piece at the back of the house, 75, High-street, concealed—I did not find anything upon either prisoner—Butler had marks of blood on his fingers, and there were also marks of blood on the time-piece—I asked him what he had to say about the charge—he said he had the pistol from the marine, but he threw it away in Wellington-street—there was the same print outside the window, as on the chair—there appeared to be the prints of two personal—one foot<lb/>mark was shorter than the other—the short one appeared to have walked all round the house—I feel satisfied there were the footmarks of two persons.</p>
