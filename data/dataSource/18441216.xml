"—he said, "I don't know"—I felt the top of it, and said, "It is top-boots, is it not? "—he said, "I don't know; it is leather"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "Bought it "—I said, "What are you going to do with it?"—he said, "My brother<lb/>in-law will have it as soon as I get home"—I asked where he bought it—he said, "That is my business"—I said, "My business is to take you to the station-house"—he said, Oh, he would go to the station-house; and when we got there he said his fellow-servant gave it to him to mind till the morning, that his fellow-servant had got a long way to go, and he was to meet him in the morning in Norfolk-street—he was taken before a Magistrate, and remanded for a week, and three or four days after I found the owner.</p>

I refused, knowing him so well—he did not say that his brother was at home at the time I said I saw him, nor did I reply that I had sworn it was him once, and I would stick to it, or continue to do so—I said nothing of the kind—I said I knew what party I had got, for I had seen them together before, and I knew him well—I told him I had got the right party in custody, I knew him so well—he said I had not—Millerman was the policeman to whom I gave the information about the boys—I di­ rected him to find them—he had told me before that they were out toge­ ther—as soon as I had gone to the station, and put the bedstead there,</p>

ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner employed in the bank in Sep<lb/>tember last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was—his duty was such as to give him access to all the ledgers in the Transfer-office; and were he to go to any particular ledger, no question would be asked him, conceiving it was his duty to do so—he was employed in the Power of Attorney office—he would know the whole course of business, and could furnish himself with whatever par<lb/>ticulars he wanted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he at any time apply to you for leave of absence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—I am not certain whether it was on Saturday, the 31st of Aug., or Mon<lb/>day, the 2nd of Sept.—the probability is that it was on Monday, the 2nd of Sept.—he asked leave from the 3rd of Sept. to the 5th, which he had given him—he did not return at the end of his leave.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long you have been in the employment of the bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Forty-three years—the Three per Cent. Consol office is a separate room to the Power of Attorney office, in which the prisoner's business was performed—it is not in a separate part of the building, it is contiguous—it may he said to be a separate office, though intimately connected with the Transfer-office—he had a duty to perform in the Consol-officein going to put limitations on Power of Attorney, and for various other inquiries that he clerks in the office may call on him for.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that these offices are separate build<lb/>ings, or only separate rooms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Merely separate rooms—there is a door separating the Transfer-office from the Power of Attorney office, just as you go from a front to a back parlour—you merely walk from one room into the other—he hade access to the Consol books in every way whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> His duty was with reference to powers of attorney gene<lb/>rally for every species of stock, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—in order to enable him to perform his duty with reference to the preparations of proper power of attorney, he would have access to the books, showing the different state of accounts, as well as the Consols—he would go into the Consol-office, take up the ledger, and open it, and no question would be asked, the clerks considering it part and parcel of his duty—if he was instructed to prepare a power of attorney for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for A. B., part of a sum of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would have authority to examine the books, in order to see if A. B. was entitled to such a sum.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Consol-office in the Bank, on the 3rd of Sept. I received from Mr. Sutton, a clerk in the same office, two tickets—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—these are them—I received them from him for the purpose of effecting a transfer—they are usually deposited in a box, and we take them out as we are going on entering—these came into my possession from Mr. Sutton—he was somewhere about the Transfer<lb/>office passing over tickets—I saw the prisoner in the Transfer-office at that time—I am uncertain whether I received the tickets from the hand of Mr. Sutton, or whether I may have taken them from the box, but they came direct from him—I received them in the Transfer-office—I am employed in the Transfer-office—the prisoner was not in the office at that time—he made his appearance a few minutes afterwards—I happened to have the number of tickets in my hand when he came up—there were several other clerks assisting there, and he came up and inquired who entered stock for the name of Oxenford—I replied that I did—I had these tickets then in my hand—he then asked me if I would oblige him by entering them directly, as Mr. Oxenford was waiting—I therefore proceeded to enter them in the Transfer-book—whilst he was waiting I asked him if he knew Mr. Oxenford, having known the name many years ago, before I was in the Bank—he replied that he did—he was an old friend of his—I said, "He must be getting an old man now"—he said he was—when I had completed it I said, "Where is Mr. Oxenford?"—he said he was outside minding the horse—that he (meaning himself) had got an early off that day, and they were going down to Gravesend together—I supposed by that that he had done his business for the day, and had leave to go away early—he then went out to fetch Mr. Oxenford, and shortly returned with a gentleman, and asked me for the book—he then asked, "What gentleman will see it?"—it is the custom that one clerk should witness the transfer, and that another person, in attendance with the party transferring, should witness his identity—it must be some person known to the Bank—the prisoner took the book and took it to Mr. Ingall, another clerk, who was close by, sitting in the same office—at the same time I heard him say to the person who had come into the office, "Come along, <hi rend="italic">Willey</hi>," or some such expression as that, "it is all ready"—I saw him and the other person come up together—I did not myself witness the act of the transfer of this stock—I did not see the signature—I after wards accompanied John Forrester, the officer, to the United States—we left London on the 18th of Sept.—we ultimately went to Boston, and found Elder in Federal-street, No. 51 (we had been to a variety of other places first)—it was on a Thursday, about the end of Oct.—he was passing by the name of Ellis—I recognised him as the man who had come into the Bank with the prisoner, after his going out to fetch Oxenford, who he said was minding the horse—I told Forrester that he was the man—Forrester took him by the coat and said, "Your name is Joseph Elder, and you are lately from London"—he was afterwards committed to prison, and I heard afterwards that he had destroyed himself—I went with Forrester to Nahant where the prisoner escaped from, but did not go up to Brewster's Island.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Consol-office. I was in the Consol Transfer-office on Tuesday, the 3rd of Sept., and remember seeing the prisoner there—when I first saw him he was a few feet from me, on the public side of the counter—there was a person with him—I knew the prisoner well, but not the other person—the prisoner called my attention by saying, "Perhaps, Mr. Ingall, you will see this?* (meaning, that I would perhaps witness the transfers)—he bad the transfer receipts in his hand—the book was on the counter—I took the receipts from him—I have no recollection of answering him—the person he had brought with him then signed these transfers "William Oxenford"—my place at the counter was about six or seven feet from where Mr. Bord stood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the book transferred from Mr. Bord to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> So far as I recollect, the prisoner merely brought the book a little nearer to me, but did not come immediately opposite to me—he brought the book from Mr. Bord, and I think he brought it forward, and placed it in the position in which it was signed by Elder—the prisoner, in the meantime, or immedi­ ately after, read to me the amount transferred, from this book, and the names into which the amount was going, and I checked him on the stock receipt or tickets which I had in my hand at the time—these are the tickets that I had in my hand at the time—my signatures are to them—the amount transferred is, (<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>,) "6305<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to George Shum Storey, John Petty Musprat, William Cotton, and Matthew Whiting"—I found that cor­ responded with one of the receipts I had in my hand—nothing had passed between me and the prisoner, before this, as to who the person was that he brought—after the person had signed the transfer, the prisoner wrote in "William Oxenford," and his own name at the back, as the witness to the identity of William Oxenford, the person making the transfer—this is it—"Witness to the identity of W. Oxenford, W. Burgess, Bank"—the words "Witness to the identity" are in print; the name "W. Oxenford" was written in ink by the prisoner, and then he signed his own-name, describ­ ing himself as of the Bank—when he had signed his name, the book was turned round by the prisoner to me, to examine the transfer, to see that it had the signature of William Oxenford, that he was properly identified, and that the witness to the identity was named there—I signed it as the attesting witness—I then handed the prisoner the receipts, of which this is one, and he walked away—I had previously signed my name to it—I do not recollect whether the receipt was signed before it was placed in my hand, nor do I recollect seeing Elder sign it—it was signed as it now ap­ pears when it was in my hand, with the exception of my own signature—I put my signature to it at the time the prisoner read the amount from the transfer-book, and I checked it on the receipt—that receipt was handed by me to the prisoner—it had been signed by Elder, in the name of Oxen<lb/>ford,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184412160030"/>
               <p>before it was put into my hand—I do not recollect seeing it signed by Elder—Elder went out with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand you to say that you do not remem<lb/>ber seeing this receipt signed by anybody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—I have wit<lb/>nessed the signature of the party—it is constantly the case that receipts are brought and not signed in our presence—it is frequently the practice for brokers to come with persons who are about to transfer, with the receipts already signed at their office—they acknowledge it as their receipts, of course—this was passed over to me, and I assumed it to be right, and put my name to it as the witness—I was not noticing this transaction from the time the application was made to Mr. Bord—Mr. Bord was about six or seven feet from me—he was not the very next person attending to business; there was one between us at the counter at the time, Mr. Tom<lb/>kins—these books lie on the counter in the office, and are pushed along from one to the other as they are required—the book would be presented towards the public side of the counter for the transfer to be executed—I have a very considerable number of these transactions in the course of a day, at times—I do not generally keep hold of a corner of the book while the party is signing, and then draw it back to its right position opposite myself—I have very rarely held the book while a party is signing it—as soon as it is signed, I quite as often draw it back as the party pushes it back—I certainly do not watch the party, to see, more than is necessary for the transaction of the particular business—the book is either draws back by ourselves, or returned by the broker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At this distance of time I suppose you cannot say in which way this particular transaction was done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as my recollection serves me, Burgess turned the book round—I think I can be positive of it—to the best of my recollection he did so—I will swear positively that he did so—there was nothing remarkable in this transaction to call my attention to it—I cannot tell how many transfers took place in our office that day, because I am not engaged in the whole of them—I cannot tell how many I was engaged in—I should imagine there must have been a good many after this on that day, because it was a heavy day with us—it is impos­ sible to say whether the transfers appear in the book in the order in which they were-made in the office, except with regard to these two—I do not find one just before or after it in which I have been the attesting witness—whatever 1 attend to I put my name to—I do not see any other in this book that day which I put my name to—I see no other in this book except these two transfers of William Oxenford—there appears to have been six other transfers that day—it does not appear by these entries that I witnessed any except those of Oxenford—there are other books in which I probably witnessed on that day—without looking at the books I cannot say whether I did or not, but the probability is that I did—I do not positively remember—to the best of my belief I should say I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you remember, in any one instance that occurred that day, whether the party coming pushed the book to you, or you drew it back, with the single exception of this transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot, nor on the day before, nor the day after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you explain, then, what there was peculiar about this transac­ tion to enable you to swear with any degree of positiveness as to how the book was treated on the occasion of this particular transfer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The thing came to light in a few days after; and I endeavoured, as well as I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184412160031"/>
               <p>possibly could, to bring to my mind all the circumstances that had taken place—I was examined before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this the first time you have stated that fact of the prisoner's pushing the book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect whether I was asked the ques­ tion before—I cannot positively recollect whether this is the first time I have stated that the book was handed or pushed to me by the prisoner—I think it is.</p>

I know the prisoner, by his entering my tickets in the Three and a Half Reduced—I know nothing more of him than as a Bank clerk—he called on me when I was standing in the Bank, at the latter part of Aug., and said that he had a friend who wanted to raise 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had 8200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., stock—I do not think a word passed beyond that—I had no further conversation with him at that time—he left me immediately—on Tuesday, the 3rd of Sept., I saw him in the street, at the foot of the Bank steps—he brought me a ticket, filled up in the regular way, for the purpose of the sale of 8200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock—it was a ticket of this sort, the ordinary transfer ticket that is used at the Bank—I did not notice what name it was in—I noticed the amount in figures—I immediately passed it to Clement Smith, who is a stock-jobber, and we agreed as to the purchase, at, I think, at 98 7-8ths, the price of the day—I calculated the amount that would be in money—it was 8107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards received from Mr. Smith, in the course of the day, two receipts—this is one of them—it was not then signed—I gave them to the prisoner, to go into the Consol-office, to make the transfer—I believe at the time I gave him the receipts I was standing at the bottom of the Bank steps, in Bartholomew-lane—there was a crowd of persons about there—I do not know that any party was in his company—he took the receipts from me—when he came back from the Transfer-office he brought me the same two receipts—I was then standing on the Bank steps—they were then regularly signed and witnessed by the clerk—I believe at that time he had a friend with him, but I never spoke to him—I saw a person with him—nothing passed—the prisoner gave me the receipts, and I passed them to Henry Smith, the son of Clement Smith, to go and fetch me the money—the prisoner told me he would wait at the Auction-mart Coffee­ house for the money—I afterwards received this check (looking at it) for 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; from Clement Smith, also a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash—I took them to the Auction-mart Coffee-room—I there found the prisoner sitting down with the same man that was with him when he brought me the receipts—I put the money on the table before them—his friend took up the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check, and the prisoner took the cash and the Bank notes—he never told me who the other person was—I had no con<lb/>versation with him whatever.</p>

Consols—I was to give 8107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it—the transfer ticket was made, and the thing done all regularly—the name of William Oxenford was on the ticket, as the party making the transfer, and he was described as of the custom-house—I had not the money at that moment, and applied to Mr. Mortimer—I had one ticket given to me in the first instance by Mr. Tokeley for 8200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Mortimer afterwards gave me one sum of 6305<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the balance was to go in his own name, and my clerk, by my instructions, wrote these tickets—I made it into two sums, one of 6305<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to George Shum Storey, John Petty Muspratt, William Cotton, and Matthew Whiting, all of the Pelican-office, Lombard-Street, and the balance 1894<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in Mr. Mortimer's Own name—I do not Know what became of the original transfer ticket for the 8200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had no occasion to keep it, and it must have been destroyed—I cannot say that I did destroy it—I have looked for it—it has given me a deal of trouble—it is not a document that I am in the habit of keeping—I know the pri<lb/>soner—I went to the power of Attorney-office to inquire if he was there on Tuesday morning, the 3rd of sept., after Mr. Tokeley had spoken to me about the business—I should think it was about a quarter to elevan o'clock—I heard he was not there, and was not likely to be there—this is the check by which the purchase of the stock was made—gave it to Mr. Tokeley, and afterwards gave him a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash, the balance of the money.</p>
               <p>Charles Chatham Lawrence. I am one of the cashiers at the banking-house of Sir John Lubbock and Co. On Tuesday, the 3rd of Sept. last, about twenty minutes before two o'clock, this check for 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was brought to me by two persons; the prisoner was one, the other was a person of about forty-five or fifty years of age—the prisoner had a carpet<lb/>bag, on which he was leaning on the counter—it appeared to me to be empty—we always ask the name of parties presenting checks—I did so on this occasion, and the name of "Oxenford" was given—it was the pri<lb/>soner's companion who presented the check to me, and who gave that name—I asked how he would like it, and he replied, "Part or all in gold "—I said, "If you want part or all in gold, you had better have large notes, and get the whole of it at the Bank of England"—I eventually gave them eight notes of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I put them into the hands of the person who accompanied the prisoner, in his presence—these eight cancelled notes are the notes I paid on that occasion—(these were Nos. 22201, to No. 22208, all dated 13th May, 1844)—the prisoner's companion counted over the notes in his presence, and before he left the counter, I saw him write something in the corner of the notes, in the prisoner's presence—I did not see what he wrote—to the best of my recollection, it was his companion who counted the notes and wrote in the corner of them—(looking at a carpet-bag produced)—the bag on which I saw the prisoner leaning was such a one as this; that was the prevailing colour and pattern of the bag—I do not speak to its identity, but it was that sort of colour and pattern—the prisoner's companion was a man I should judge about my own height, about 5ft. 9in.; but being on the other side of the counter, I could not exactly judge of his height; he had a ruddy complexion, and was a well-looking man—I did not observe particularly whether he was stout or thin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the superintendents of the issue de<lb/>partment of the Bank. On the 3rd of Sept. last, about two o'clock in the afternoon, a man presented eight 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes at my counter for cash—it is necessary, according to the practice of the Bank, to have the name and address of the party presenting notes for payment—when these notes were handed to me, there was some writing in the comer which I could not decipher, and I asked the party presenting them his name—he said, "Oxenford"—I observed that there was only "Brixton" put as the ad<lb/>dress—in consequence of that I put a question to him, gave him the pen, and requested him to write—he wrote "Vassal-road" on them—after be<lb/>ing inspected by the inspectors, they were handed to Mr. Ager, one of the tellers—I gave him the order for the gold, and Mr. Ager got it—I saw Dean, the porter, bring 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the office, in bags of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I did not see the bags given to the party, as my duty took me to another part of the office—I afterwards saw the man emptying the gold from our 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bags into two canvas bags, which he put into a large carpet-bag that he had in his hand—it was such a bag as the one produced, about that sixe and description—I cannot say that I saw him attempt to lift it—I after wards saw Aston and Dean, two Bank porters, each with a bag on his shoulders, go out of the hall—they were the two canvas bags that the man had brought with him—I did not see him put the two canvas bags into the carpet-bag—I saw him with the two canvas bags—I have heard Mr. Lawrence's description of the party who presented the notes to me—it is quite correct—he was a stout ruddy man, about forty-five yean of age—I can speak to the first of these notes (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) being one that I cashed on that occasion—I saw him put "Vassal-road" on it.</p>

On the 3rd of Sept., between one and two o'clock, I received directions from Higman to get some gold—it was near two o'clock—I accordingly got 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—I assisted Dean, the porter—it was in separate bags of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I brought them from the Treasury, and desired Dean to give the person I believe to be Elder, eight of the bags—I saw eight bags put on the counter, and saw a person there who, I believe, had presented the notes—that person took them away—he had a carpet-bag, and two canvas bags—the canvas bags were on the counter—the carpet-bag answered the description of the one produced—he put them into the canvas-bags, and then into the carpet-bag, but both the canvas bags were taken out and carried away by two porters—I delivered the gold in the Issue Department, which is in the hall—there is a passage through the hall—on crossing the hall you get to the out-teller's office—between the hall and the out-teller's office there is a passage which is darker than the rest of the Bank—the drawing produced (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is a correct plan of that part—I should think that a person standing where this blue mark is, could see me place the gold on the counter—this pink mark is where 1 was standing—a person standing at the blue spot could see me pay the money, and if he was familiar with the Bank, he could leave the building without passing through the hall.</p>

I keep the General Townsend, in Oxford-street; it it also called the George Townsend—Joseph Elder lodged at my house for three years, till Sept. last—the prisoner was in the habit of visiting him—towards the last two or three months previous to Sept., his visits be­ came rather more frequent—he sometimes came to Elder before he was up in the morning, and went into his bed-room—I remember Elder coming in on the 3rd of Sept., about three o'clock in the afternoon, and taking leave of me—he shook hands with me, said he was obliged to me for all favors, that he was going out of town, and he might be gone a fortnight or six weeks—about two hours after that, I was in the passage of my house, and saw Elder there—it was about five o'clock—he was in front of the bar—that was the last time I saw him.</p>

On Tuesday afternoon, the 3rd of Sept., the prisoner came to the house in a four-wheeled phaeton, drawn by one horse—a soldier came with him, and Elder came a few minutes after—they had a carpet-bag with them—the prisoner and the soldier carried the carpet-bag between them—it was very heavy indeed—they carried it with difficulty—the prisoner asked me for a private room—I said, "There is the bar-parlour you can walk into." which they did-the prisoner ordered refreshment, and while I was getting it ready in the bar, I heard a noise in the bar-parlour—it waslike jingling of gold—I looked through the curtain which divided the bar from the parlour, and saw gold in the carpet-bag, which was open—there were two canvas bags in it—the prisoner was handling the gold—one bag had burst, and some gold got loose into the carpet-bag—I believe the prisoner put some of the gold into his pocket—I saw him do so—I asked the pri­ soner where he was going with that gold—he said he was going to the Edinburgh bank, and said, "I have two soldiers to guard me"—I asked him to let me lift the bag for a reason of my own—I tried, but could not, on account of its weight—while Elder was there, the prisoner asked me where my brother or his mistress were—I said they were both out—he asked me if there was not a portmanteau of his here—I said I believed there was, but he could not have it, as it was locked up in their bed-room—Elder said, "If money will get it we must have it"—I called the pot­ boy to the bar, and Elder sent him for a locksmith—the servant went up stairs with him—he picked the lock, and brought the portmanteau down—I gave the prisoner the bill for it, and he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he said that was all right—Burgess put both the canvas bags, with their con­ tents, into the carpet-bag—about seven o'clock Elder went for a cab, and brought it to the door—the prisoner was still sitting in the bar-parlour—Elder came to the bar, and pressed on him to go, or he would go without him, he could not wait any longer, his time was expired—I got down everything that was owing, and they paid my bill, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they had</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop, and live in Suttoo-gardens, Chalk-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Islington On Monday, the 9th of Dee., my wife was up last in the house—I fastened the cellar, bar parlour, and other doors, when I went to bed, which was about free minutes past twelve o'clock—my wife and I retired into our bed-room together, but she returned into the bar parlour for some wearing apparel which she had left behind her—the house is all on the ground-floor—the cellar door was fastened by an inside bolt—there is only that one opening to the cellar—about half-past twelve o'clock we heard some kind of a noise, such as a waiter having fallen from a window—there was a waiter standing inside a window close to the cellar door—the two bottom squares of glass in that window had been broken, and, as a substitute for them, two wooden squares were nailed up—a little after seven in the morning my wife got up, went into the bar parlour, came back, and gave me an alarm—I got up, and found the place had been robbed—the cellar door was partly open, the bar parlour door was partly open, likewise a door leading to the passage—I found the wooden squares removed from the places where they bad been the night before when I went to bed—I do not know what had become of them—I have not seen them since—it is not a window that opens, but a fixture—a portion of the brick-work of the wall of the cellar had been broken away before this, quite sufficient for a person of the pri­ soner's size to get through—it had been done by the brewers at the time they bad put the barrels into the place—they had shaken the wall, or rather broken it away—that is the side-wall leading into the garden—the person might have got in by that hole without breaking anything—I found about three or four bricks rather shaken, in addition to the former place—I</p>

               <p>am quite positive I had shut and bolted the cellar door overnight—I mined a jacket, waistcoat, shoes, and a watch-stand, all from the bar par­ lour—four drawers had been ransacked, two boxes opened, and things pulled out of a basket—the drawers contained linen principally, which my wife can give an account of—I have known the prisoner, by him frequenting my place for about five months—he has not come for the pur­ pose of drinking, but merely coming in and sitting down—the first time I knew him was when he had a little job in plastering—he is a plasterer—he was there on the Monday the whole of the day—when I fancied he has been out of work I have been in the habit of giving him something to eat, seeing him silting by himself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist, and live in Hand—court, Bedford-row. On Sunday evening, the 24th of Nov., about eight o'clock, I was sitting in my parlour, which is over my shop, and heard the bell of my shop door strike—it is an alarm-bell, so that I may ascertain when any one enters the shop—I went down and found the prisoner Noon in the shop—he asked for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of peppermint lozenges—he after—wards changed it for liquorice—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, which I placed in the till with other copper, and closed it—I did not lock it—it is a drawer—at that time I had a roll case of tooth-instruments in the till, and one or two other cases—there are three partitions to the till, and the tooth instru—ments were in the back partition—I am sure they were in the till when I put the penny in—after Noon had paid me the penny for the liquorice, he left the shop, and shut the door—he remained in the shop till I had shut the till—I have another door to the shop, but it opens at the back part, behind the counter—that is the door I had come in by from the upper room—it leads on to the head of the kitchen stairs—there is a way out of that passage into the street by a private door—there is one street-door which opens into a small square lobby about four feet and a half square, on one side of which is the shop door, in the centre is the door opening into the house, and the opposite side is occupied by the front shop—there is only one street door—the customers come in through this little lobby—the same street door would take me up into my upper room—the pri—soner's appearance created a suspicion in my mind, and when he had gone out I walked to the shop door to examine whether the alarm-bell was cor—rect—I pushed my hand against the door, and saw that it was perfectly closed—I then went to my upper room again—I had a friend there—we were rather merry, and speaking loud—I found after sitting for about two mi—nutes, that I had not closed my room door—I immediately rose, walked short across the room, and shut it, and I suspect that gave the parties is the shop the alarm—within five or eight minutes after that I heard my shop-boy come into the lobby—he has heavy boots, and makes a great noise coming in—he would come in through the shop door, and not hear—ing the shop-bell ring, I suspected there was something wrong—I came down, and at the foot of the stairs I put my foot into a hat—I do not know whose it was—it was not my boy's—he was in the passage when I came down—I went into the shop—there was no one there—I saw the till standing as wide open as it could be pulled—I looked into the back par—tition, and missed the case of tooth instruments—the others were left—I missed nothing more at that time—on the following Tuesday I missed a</p>

               <p>hat and great coat which I had seen on the Sunday morning—the great coat was hanging over the back of one of the shop chairs, and the hat' was on the top of a glass-case in the shop—it was a hat and coat that I very seldom used—I had not seen them after Noon came—I have never seen them since—I saw the case of instruments on the Tuesday morning fol—lowing, at Featherstone-street station—I had notice to attend there, and the policeman showed them to me—these now produced are them—this is the case which I had in the till.</p>

               <p>there, and remained outside till they came out, which was at five minutes past one in the morning—I knew the whole of them before—I seized the two prisoners by the collar, and took them into custody—I observed Sut—ters put his hand behind him to his coat pocket, and saw him throw some—thing away—I watched the articles that flew from his hand, and observed this skeleton key and a knife, with something just about the size and colour of this case of instruments—the handle of the knife being white, I was enabled to see where it fell, but the case of instruments I could not—I did not wait to look any further, for there being such a number of thieves about there, I was fearful of a rescue—I picked up the knife and key, the case I did not—at the time I picked up the knife and key I had hold of the two prisoners—I was afterwards obliged to let go of Noon—I still held Slitters—he again put his hand behind him—I instantly seized his wrist—he opened his hand, and something fell to the ground—I picked it up, and found it to be this bag, containing five pick—lock-keys, one skeleton-key, and one latch-key—he made a determined resistance, and his hat fell off—I took him to Featherstone-street station—I afterwards proceeded to a street in the Vinegar-ground, a locality where thieves and prostitutes live, and on a wall in the rear of some pre—mises I observed Noon—that was about three or four minutes'walk from where I had found them—he again made his escape from me—I saw him in custody at the station about nine the same morning—I went with Davis to the place where I had seen Sutters throw away the things, and pointed out the spot to him.</p>

I went with Thompson to look for Cherry and Kemp, on Sunday morning, the 1st of Dec.—I took Cherry into custody in Petticoat-lane about half-past eleven—I told him he need not say anything unless he liked, but I was going to take him into custody, on a charge of breaking into Mr. Lamb's house, in Somer<lb/>ford-street—he said he did not have the selling of the things, that they were taken to Mrs. Kemp's house; that they got in by removing two of the tiles off the coal-shed, then they removed some portion of the brick<lb/>work from the side of the door-post, and Kemp put his arm through, and unbolted the door; that after they had taken the things, they took and buried them under the railway-arch at the back of Mr. Sutton's fac<lb/>tory; and about a quarter-past seven, they gave a boy named Blaney a penny, to carry them as far as the Bethnal-green-road, where he would carry them no further, and that they then took them to Kemp's house<lb/>after I had charged him at the station-house, on putting him into the cell, he turned round and said, "I do not see why Kemp should not be taken as well as me; for I had only 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money the things were sold for"—he then told me I could find Kemp at the Blue Ball public-house, in Long-alley, Moorfields—between ten and eleven o'clock the same night I went and found Kemp in bed—I told him he need not say anything unless he liked, for Cherry had said enough already—he said, that if Cherry had turned <hi rend="italic">snitch</hi>, he did not mean to do it—I expect that means <hi rend="italic">informer</hi>
                  <lb/>after I brought him down stairs, his mother, the prisoner Charlotte Kemp kissed him, and said, "Mind you don't do it," twice—I took him to the station-house in Arbour-square—on the following day, Monday, the 2nd, Cherry came to the cell-door at Lambeth-station, and said, that the shawl which Mrs. Kemp had on the day previous, and that morning, was one of the shawls that were stolen from Mr. Lamb's—(Mrs. Kemp was not by at that time; she was up at the Castle public-house)—he also said, that if it had not been for Mrs. Kemp and his mother, he should not have been in this trouble, and he meant to tell the whole truth about it—I then went up to the Castle public-house, where Mrs. Kemp, Durell, and two more were—Durell had then left the Castle—I called Mrs. Kemp out, and asked her what she had done with the shawl that she had on that morning—she said she had given it to her husband to pledge, and that he was gone down to the police-court to see whether the boy had had his hearing or not—she then went down with me to the Court, where Durell (who she is living with and calls her husband) was—I asked him where the shawl was that she had given him—he said at first that he had no shawl—he then said he had pledged it—I asked him where the ticket was, or where it was that he had pledged it—Mrs. Kemp then said, "Give it to him, for it is the only thing they have against me"—he then pulled off his hat, and this shawl fell from it—I then placed Charlotte Kemp with the rest—she said she had pledged the shawl, and taken it out again, but she had done it inno<lb/>cently—on the following Tuesday I found a pair of trowsers at the wit<lb/>ness Dobbs', in Horseshoe-alley—Mr. Lamb was with me at the time, and owned them—I desired Dobbs not to say anything, or to give the trowsers up till he saw me again—on the following Thursday I took durell out of the Blue Ball public-house, and took him into custody—he asked me</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Goswell-street, and am a coachmaker; the prisoner was a labourer in my service for nearly two years. On Satur<lb/>day, the 30th of Nov., I had four axletrees, and boxes complete, in my loft, tied together in sets—I went away that day, and left the prisoner there—I returned on Monday morning, the 2nd of Dec., between nine and ten o'clock—I went to my loft, and missed the axletrees and boxes—I asked the prisoner whether he had moved them, as he had the cleaning of the loft—he said "No," he had not seen them—in consequence of some<lb/>thing I heard I gave him into custody—I had left nobody but him on my premises, and found nobody but him there when I came back.</p>

On the 2nd of Dec., about six o'clock in the morning, I heard a knock at my street-door—I looked out of the window—I could not see who it was, but I heard a voice, which I thought was the prisoner's—I have known him about ten years—he asked if I was coming down, and said he wanted me—I said, "Presently," and I went to bed again—about seven, the witness Bellingham came and called me—I got a light, and went down stairs—I</p>

               <p>found four axletrees in my passage—I asked Bellingham to remove them under the gateway—the prisoner came and asked me if I would take care of them for him—he said there would be a person call for them—I told him I would not have them remain on my premises, and I advised him to take them back to where he brought them from, because I thought they would be missed, and I would not have them on my premises—he said they had been lying by a long time, and would not be missed—I said I would put them into the street if he did not take them away—he came in again in a minute, and asked me if I would lend him a truck to take them—I said, "No"—he then asked Bellingham if he would take them in his cart—he refused—the prisoner went out, and returned immediately, and said they would go immediately—I know no more of them, for I went to work, and never saw them afterwards—I was away about five minutes, and when I came back they were gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Somerset-place, Bermondsey—about a quarter before seven o'clock on Monday morning, the 2nd of Dec., I went with my cart to Mr. Lawrence's—I saw the prisoner standing at his door—I asked him if Lawrence was up—he said, "No"—I called Law<lb/>rence, and he got a light and came down—the prisoner was not there then—the four axletrees were in the passage—I helped Lawrence to remove them under the gateway—the prisoner came back in about five minutes, and went and spoke to Lawrence—I did not bear what they said—the prisoner then came to me, and asked me if I would take the axletrees to Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell—I said I would have nothing to do with them—he came back afterwards with another young man—the prisoner took two of the axletrees, and the other man took two, and they went away with them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you known the prisoner before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—I knew Lawrence by having the dung from him about twice a-week—the man who came with the prisoner was a young man, with a blue frock-coat and a white apron—he had a black beaver hat on—I did not notice whether anything was on it, as it was no business of mine—I do not know where these things were sold, nor yet which way they went—I am carman to a market-gardener—my master allows me a certain price for the dung I buy—I paid half-a-crown for it that Monday morning, and went straight home to my master's place in Bermondsey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private watchman in the Old Jewry. Be<lb/>tween five and six at night, on the 9th of Dec., I saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's warehouse, and he brought out a roll of something white with him—I saw him put it into the dust-hole, behind the warehouse door—I then saw his wife come out of the warehouse, and go down into the cellar to the warehouseman—the prisoner came over and spoke to me, and said it was a cold night—he then walked back to the dust-hole, and took out this parcel, which is like the one he brought out of the warehouse, and it was taken from the place where he put that—he put it into some bags which his wife had to make—he was going to put it on his shoulder, and to carry it away; I stopped him, and called the warehouseman—this linen rolled out of the bags.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. George Watt, a linen factor, at No. 8, Old Jewry—we employed the prisoner's wife to make guano bags—I know this piece of linen is Mr. Watt's property—we have had it in the warehouse six months—it is the only piece of the sort we had—I know it by the mark on it.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you find it on me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; I saw it roll out of the parcel which you was carrying at the time—I am not aware whether the bags were tied up or not—I believe they were tied afterwards—I believe you tied them, if they were tied—we give threepence a dozen for making the bags—a good hand can make ten dozen in a day by working ten or twelve hours.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this the same sort of material that bags are made from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they are made of coarse wrapper, very different to this—the prisoner's wife made the bags at home—he generally came to bring them for his wife—he came for them, I delivered them to him, but this came from a different warehouse—he had to pass across the yard to fetch this—I believe I sent his wife up to the counting-house to get the goods entered while he was packing up—she came and told me I was wanted, and I went back into the cellar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went with my wife with a gross of bags, and she was forced to work not only Saturday night, but all day on Sunday; on Monday we carried them home, and he said, "There are only five dozen more ready for you; you had better go and speak to the clerk;" my wife went up, and came and said he was wanted; he went, and in the mean<lb/>time I laid the bags on the dust-hole; I then went and found this bundle in the dark, (there was no light in the warehouse, only in the counting-house,) and not knowing any difference, to make up the gross which we usually receive, I put this on the dust-hole, and the place being too narrow it fell in; the witness stated that I put it in the dust-hole, which made it look more criminal; then again he stated that it was his wife saw me and told him, and he watched me; the other witness states the bags were tied up; I had left them tied up, and when the watchman spoke to me I turned round and was going back to the counting-house.</p>

I saw the prisoner there—I did not see him come in—he was there when I came home at half-past twelve o'clock—a man, named Stubbs, was with him—I believe they had had one glass, and they were then standing conversing, and quoting poetry, and different things in front of the bar—they asked me to shake hands with them, which I refused—at nearly three o'clock my master went up stairs, and I was left alone in the bar—the prisoner and the other man were repeatedly leaving the bar, and going towards the end of the passage—I then heard the pri<lb/>soner say to Stubbs, "She is not there"—Stubbs said, "Yes she is"—the prisoner said, "No she is not"—then Stubbs said, "Go, go," and the prisoner left the bar, and came round to the bar-door, as I thought—I had bolted the door, as I did not choose to be annoyed by them—they ap<lb/>peared to be tipsy—I did not see any one, but I heard some one running down stairs, and he stumbled—I ran out and saw the door open, which gave a light—I saw the prisoner come out of the green door, and going out of the street door with a coat on his arm—I am quite certain it was the prisoner who went out—I could not see that he had two coats—he had one coat—he had no coat on his arm when he was standing at the bar, nor had the other man—I immediately ran to the street door as quick as I could, but the prisoner was gone—I came back and made some inquiry of Stubbs—I had seen Mr. Castle's coats safe at half-past twelve o'clock, when I came home—I did not miss them, but Mr. Castle told me they were gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think you said "a coat?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I would swear I saw one—there was one great coat and one body coat missing—I could not say what was the colour of them—I believe they were both olive green—they were both my master's coats—I have seen him wear them many times—I had not no<lb/>ticed them particularly—I am certain the close-bodied coat was not a light<lb/>coloured one—I am almost certain it had not brass buttons—the prisoner and Stubbs began to talk to me as soon as I came in—they were quoting poetry when I came in—they wanted to shake hands with me several times when I went into the bar to serve a customer—I was in and out the whole time nearly—they were drinking gin and water, and I considered their conduct rather annoying—I did not complain to my master—he saw some of it—they offered to shake hands with him—he did not order them out; there was nothing to order them out for.</p>

I am the wife of John Budson; we live at No. 22, Great Windmill-street—the prisoner lodged in the same house—on Wednesday, the 27th of Nov. she came into my room, and brought in three yards of black velvet, and one yard of green—she put it between a box and a chest of drawers, and told me to lock it up, and not to say anything about it—I told her she had better take it away, but she went out of the room and left it—I suspected it was stolen, because they were searching the house at the same time—I called in a person from the next room, and looked at what she had left—I then took it down stairs to Mr. Belcham, the shoemaker, who keeps the shop and the house—the parties who had been searching the house were then gone—I did not take it down while they were searching the house, as I did not know what to do in the confusion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. Stover, who is a shoe-maker, and lives in Whitechapel-road. About half-past four o'clock on the 3rd of Dec. I was out on an errand, and saw the prisoners together nearly opposite the prosecutor's—I had seen them about the road in company for about three weeks or a month, and I knew them to be acquainted—I heard M'Phin say, "Let us cross the road "—they crossed, and passed the prosecutor's shop—I watched them, and Castle walked by the shop two or three times—a lady came to the door—Castle watched her in, and then he took a pair of boots off the hook by the door-post—the other two prisoners were a few doors past the shop, and their heads were turned from it—they were near enough to have seen the shop—Castle gave the boots to M'Phin, and he and Boggis crossed the road, and began to throw stones at one another—they then went down St. Mary's-street, and ran off together—Castle ran on, and a policeman caught him—I saw Mr. Yates come out, calling, "Stop thief!"—I gave information of what I saw, and the next morning I saw Boggis pass my master's shop, which is opposite White-chapel church—I knew him again, and gave him into custody—I saw. M'Phin. again on Wednesday evening, and gave him into custody—I have not the slightest doubt that the prisoners are the boys I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Phin</hi>. When he saw Castle give me the boots why did he not tell Mr. Yates where I was, and why did he not give me into custody; while I was picking up stones? he had time to give me in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not see a policeman—my eyes were on Castle while the other two were in the road—they made off as soon as Mr. Yates came up—Castle had gone down the road.</p>

I am a clerk in the Inland-office at the Post-office, On Friday, the 13th of Dec., I received from Mr. Sculthorpe a letter di<lb/>rected to Mr. Smerdon, Chapel-street, Islington—it was sealed, and appeared to me by the feel to contain money—I locked it up in my desk, and the next morning, at twenty-five minutes past six o'clock, I placed it in one of the boxes with other letters, in front of a row, to be sent to the London District-office—the boxes are divided into four or five departments, and they are conveyed through a tunnel—I gave this box to one of the regular men to be conveyed to the tunnel—I cannot say which.</p>

I saw the prisoner on duty at the office on the 14th of Dec., about seven o'clock in the morning—I afterwards saw a parcel of copper taken out of his pocket, and two shillings with it—Mr. Sculthorpe had shown me some money—I saw him mark it all—I cannot say that I saw these two shillings taken from the prisoner, but a moment, did not elapse before Mr. Scul<lb/>thorpe said, "That is my money"—the money I then saw was some of the money Mr. Sculthorpe had marked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first see marked money shown by Mr. Sculthorpe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—five or six months ago—I have not seen a great deal of marked money—I think there were two sovereigns he showed me—I do not think there was any silver—I cannot say when I first saw any silver marked—I have a memorandum here of my writing—this is dated on the 29th of Aug., and it was about that period he changed a half-sovereign with me for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was about that period, I saw silver marked—I suppose I saw 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. marked—I do not remember seeing silver marked more than once.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you saw the money we are how talking about? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Last Wednesday evening about eight o'clock—it was put into letters—I saw Mr. Sculthorpe fold the letters up, but I did not see him put the money into this letter—I never saw this letter—some of the clerks have their breakfast in the Post-office—somebody is allowed the privilege of furnish<lb/>ing it to them in the kitchen, that instead of going out they may have it there—in case of money being found it is the duty of the clerk or the finder to bring it to the president—that happens continually—I remember the prisoner bringing me a letter with a small coin in it, and he brought me a smaller coin, which he picked. up—I cannot say whether it was a sixpence or a fourpenny-piece, but it was entered in the diary which is kept—he brought me a letter with half-a-crown in it on one occasion.</p>

At twenty minutes past ten o'clock on the morning of the 14th of Dec., I searched the prisoner—he was the second person I searched—I found on him these two shillings, 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a sixpence in silver, and in this purse two half-crowns, one shilling, and two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces—after I had given him a caution, and told him what he said might be used as evidence against him, I asked him how he accounted for these two shillings—he said that he changed a sovereign the day previous, a few minutes before two o'clock, as he was coming on duty, of Mr. Stevens, at the Goldsmith's Arms, at the back of the Post<lb/>office, and these two shillings must have been part of the change—he said he had half-a-sovereign, and the rest in silver—I told him in searching a drawer in his house I had found a purse, containing a sovereign and a half-sovereign and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—he said, "Yes, the half-sovereign was the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I own to pledging these tools, but not with any intention of robbing Mr. Collingridge of them; I had work about, which would have got them out, and which is now left unfinished; I told Mr. Col<lb/>lingridge repeatedly that I had pledged them, and it made me very uneasy; I could not bear to see him, or go to the shop; I was out along with a young man, who told me they were going to play a game of skittles for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I, like a stupid, said, "I have got some money coming to me in a day or two; I don't think Mr. Collingridge will mind; I will pledge these, and get them out to-morrow morning, or next day, if you will let me have the money;" I lost every farthing; it was a trap laid for me; I took the things to the engine-turner's, and they kept them longer than I expected; Mr. Collingridge came into the shop, and asked me where the tools were; I said it was all right; he went directly to the pawnbrokers,</p>

               <p>and found the tools there; that was a fortnight after I had left Mr. Col<lb/>lingridge; he only employed me for about a week; the other work was all on my own account; I promised to get them out when the work was done; this engine-tool belonged to Mr. Darby, who I lived with fouryears; Mr. Collingridge was certainly very kind to me, and took me in when I was in distress; I know it was very bad of me to do what I have done, but I had no intention of robbing him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Royal Marines at Woolwich. In the evening of the 5th of Dec. I was at the Bee Hive beer-shop—I there met the prisoner—I called for a pot of ale, and took out a sixpence, and paid for it—I put my purse again into my pocket—I took a glass of ale, and drank it—the prisoner said, "Give me a glass"—I said, "Yes, take it," which she did, and went out, saying she would soon come back, which she did, and drank again—I saw her put her hand over the third glass I had poured out to drink—whether she put anything into it I do not know, but I drank it, and soon after I became quite insensible, and when I came to myself I had lost my purse, containing the ring and money—I then went to a lodging-house—I was going to pay for the bed, and the prisoner said, "Your bed is paid for"—I went up stairs, and then I missed my purse—I said, "You have got my purse"—she denied it—I said, "I shall give you in charge"—I was going out—she called me back, and said, "If you will not give me in charge I will give you the purse"—she gave it me, with 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—I missed the ring and the money stated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was at the Bee Hive; he was sitting with two Artillery men; we drank the pot of ale, and then went to the Coach and Horses, and he paid for two quarterns of gin; I left him there talking; I had a half-crown; I went, and gave it to a young woman to take care of; I went back to him; we went to the Bee Hive, and he called for a pot of fourpenny ale; he laid his head in my lap, and went to sleep till half-past eleven o'clock; I called him up, and said it was time to go home; I said, "You know I have got your purse;" we went home, and went up stairs; he then said, "<hi rend="italic">Poll</hi>, I know I had 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my purse;" I said, "You can<lb/>not expect to have that now, having spent money;" he counted the money, and there was 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it; he said, "There is 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short, and where is the ring?" I said, "I have seen no ring;" he said, "If you don't give it me I will give you in charge;" I said, "I would give it you, but I know nothing of the ring;" the policeman took me down to the cage, and in going he said, "Have you any money?" I said, "I had half-a-crown, and I gave it to Sarah Williams to take care of;" I asked my landlord to lend me half-a-crown; the prosecutor gave me the purse to take care of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 62 years of age—my proper christian name I be<lb/>lieve to be (having seen the baptismal certificate many years ago) Samuel John, but I never used it—I have not got that certificate in my possession—I do not know where it is—I have tried to find it—it is upwards of forty years since I saw it—to the best of my recollection I described myself as Samuel when I gave instructions for the former indictment—I have never used the name of Samuel on any occasion in the course of my life—I have never been addressed by that name by my relations—I do not know who my godfathers were—my memory is not sufficiently retentive for that—I do not know where I was christened—it was in London—the certificate I saw was in my mother's possession—she has been dead many years—I was never called any other name than John by my father or mother—I cannot recollect on what occasion it was that I saw the certificate in my mother's possession—I only recollect her showing it to me, and saying it was my certificate—I do not recollect the precise words—I only recollect the circumstance of seeing it—she never addressed me by the name of Samuel—I had no brother—if I had an estate left me in the name of Samuel John I should certainly try to get it—I have a family Bible at home, but my name is not entered there—there are no entries of births in it—there is no one here that knows my name, or anything at all about it.</p>

A little after three o'clock on the morning of the 13th of Nov., I was aroused by the sound of my dog barking—I got up and found the staircase win<lb/>dow open—I went to the front window and sprung my rattle—two police<lb/>men came in a few minutes, and I let them in at the front door—I went into the servant's room, which adjoins the kitchen, and found four panes of glass broken in the window, and the window-frame also—there was an aperture sufficiently large for a man to get through—on going to bed the night before, the staircase window was closed as usual—I did not examine it—it was decidedly shut down, and no part open—some flower-pots which had stood inside the window, were removed on to the path of the garden, as if they had been handed down to some companions—it was necessary to remove them to effect an entrance into the window, as they occupied the whole space—if they had been knocked down, it would have caused a noise—I missed no property, nor was anything removed but the flower<lb/>pots.</p>

My attention was not particularly called to the staircase window on going to bed on the 12th of Nov., but I had looked at it in the morning, and it was shut then—it is never opened—I did not perceive that any one had opened it in the course of the day—that window has only been opened once since I have been there, and that was to clean it, there is so much draught—I was aroused on the morning of the 13th of Nov., by the dog barking—the dog was generally kept in the parlour of a night, and sometimes had a bed made for him outside my master's bedroom door—my room is level with the kitchen, but partitioned off from it—I saw a shadow of some person coming into my room—it was a shadow of something, but I could not say what at first—I thought my eyes might have deceived me, but when he came a second time, I rushed out of bed, and cried out—I did not hear the sound of any feet—he had a light of some sort the second time he came in—I saw it was a man then—he went to the window, and as I was running up stairs to my mistress, I heard the window smash—I had got on to the second flight of stairs then—there is a shutter to my window, but I do not use it in order that I may have the light early—I found a</p>

On Friday evening, the 29th of Nov, I was at my own door on Clapham-common—a man me and delivered me this letter—I gave it to my husband—I cannot swear to the person as it was between the lights, but I believe the prisoner is the person, by his stature, and by his walking down the lane when he turned from me—he said he brought it from the Plough Inn, which is about two hundred yards from our house—on the 5th of December I saw the prisoner with my husband about a hundred yards from our house—he was standing beside my husband—I went close to where they were talking, and said to my husband, "You have not got the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to give them"—I gave my husband the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then I went away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you aware that on the first examination the question was put to you whether you could identify the man that gave the letter, and your answer was you could not swear to him? A That I said, but it is my firm belief you are the man—I did not swear on the Tuesday that you were the person—to the best of my belief you are.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable V</hi> 9.) I had a communication from Mr. Burt, and took the prisoner—he did not say anything to me before the examination, only after the Magistrate had cautioned him—I believe what he said was taken down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When the Magistrate was about committing me, with an<lb/>other prisoner, he asked, "Did the prisoner say anything about the letter?" there, was not one officer would say "Yes;" but this officer, previous to that, had made out the prosecutor's and the witnesses' expenses, which he took to the Magistrate, who shook his head, and said he considered 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-day was too much; the officer then went out; when he returned, and heard the Magistrate say, "Is any person here who heard the prisoner own the letters?" he said "I did," and then he was bound over.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Magistrate decline binding you over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that was before anything was said about the letters—he did not think it was necessary, and afterwards he did—another constable said he heard it, and then the Magistrate said, "I called some one else," and he bound me over.</p>

So, if you think proper to do so, send the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to-morrow by post, or Delivery Company, but not yourself, or no one else; afterwards I don't mind seeing you myself; then I will tell you the reason I did it about my brother-in-law.

If you don't believe me, say no more about it; if you think I am deceiving you, * * If you act right, by God you will find me right * * so as you shall have the barrow and chaise. But send it to me addressed to Mr. Long, to be left at Mr. Morgan's, No. 4, Commercial-place, Finsbury-square, London, till called for. I shall not call myself for it, but I will send for it. If I find you right, you shall have the letter on Sunday evening; and if you wish to see me then, I will be at the tap-room at Plough public-house, Clapham, Sunday night.

                  </hi>. I am a broker, and live at No. 1, Portland-row, Walworth. I bought this barrow of the prisoner for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe it was on the 16th or 17th of Oct.—I am no relation of his—he asked if I would buy it, and told me he wanted 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that the reason of his disposing of it was, he was going into the country, and that he bought it about twelve months previously.</p>
