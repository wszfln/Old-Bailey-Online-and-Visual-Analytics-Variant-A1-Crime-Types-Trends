               <p>was at the St. Katherine docks, that he had spent the whole of his money, and was at a loss to know how to return to Lowmore, in York<lb/>shire, where he resided—I told him that I had so often been imposed upon, that I felt bound to be cautious; that I felt some delicacy in doubting his Word, as he had the appearance and conversation of a gentleman—he then stated that he was Dr. Phoenix Arnott Wilson, and he resided at Carr-lane, Lowmore—I wrote it down at the time—I asked him if he knew any of the parties residing there—he said he knew the Rev. Mr. Forsett, the clergyman, and Mr. Wickham, the member for Bradford—that if Mr. Wickham had been in town he should not have had occasion to apply to me—I knew both those gentlemen, and knew that Mr. Wickham was not in town—I have very large iron works at Lowmore—he spoke of those, and of the appearance of the tremendous fires burning at night, and the large cinder heaps; and he spoke of a Miss Dawson as a very benevolent lady residing there, who I knew very well—I asked him what he would require to take him to the works—he said a sovereign—he said, "I cannot walk into a pawnbroker's shop, being a gentleman, to leave my watch; but if you will allow me to leave it in your possession, I shall feel a pleasure in doing so"—I said I could not listen to that for a moment—I said, "A sovereign cannot take you down to Lowmore"—he said, "Yes, it can, in a third-class carriage"—I then said, "Believing your tale to be true, I should not think of your being content with a sovereign; I shall give you two: if I do the thing at all, I will do it liberally"—he bowed and thanked me, and said he was a man of honour and a Christian, and he would return it me by post-office order next day—I have never received the money—I parted with the two sovereigns believing the tale to be true—I made in<lb/>quiries, and found it to be false—I then gave information to the detective police.</p>

I am assistant to Mrs. Baker, who keeps the Lamb and Flag, Crutched-friars—it is near Cooper's-row—I have known the prisoner some time working in the neighbourhood—on the afternoon of the 24th of April, the day before we went before the Magistrate, he came to my house—it must have been either at 12 o'clock or 4, or after 4, but to the best of my belief I think it was before I had my tea—in my depositions I beg to be excused, as I met with an accident three years ago on board a ship—the prisoner brought a bag and left it in my charge—I always thought him to be a very respectable young man, and took charge of it—he called again at a little before 9 o'clock in the evening and it was brought down-stairs by my mother—I thought it had been given to him before, and said, "What, have not you had it away yet?"—he was sober—I cannot say whether I had had my dinner when the bag was brought, but it was either dinner time or tea time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Though he was sober when he brought it, did he drink before he took it away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he had a pint of porter, and half a quartern of gin and some cold water in front of the bar, and changed a sovereign, and had 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change; that was when he came for it—I did not notice whether he was under the influence of liquor—I have known him between eight and nine years—he brought it quite openly, just as you might leave an overcoat, and asked me for a bit of string to tie it up, he said "Here is a bag I want you to take care of."</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">junior.</hi> I am managing clerk to Charles James Major, of Billiter-street, a commission agent—the prisoner was his porter up to 20th April, when I saw him leave at 11 in the morning, by my orders, to go to Messrs. Detmar and Fowler, of Mincing-lane, and receive 495 samples of indigo, which he was instructed by me to pack in five cases, which were to be nailed up and properly cased with <hi rend="italic">gunny</hi> bags, and shipped for South<lb/>ampton—I instructed him to go with the truck, not wishing to entrust one man only—next morning after he was taken I stopped the five cases, in consequence of information I received, and twenty-two samples were missing—I have looked at these samples, they are part of the samples which should have been packed in these cases—I was out when the prisoner returned to the office, but I think he returned between 4 and 5; I returned about half-past</p>

I inquired if the chests were full, he said, "No, one was not full, there was about an inch space at the top"—I asked him if they were cased, which is to prevent the indigo from passing out, and suggested that the bases should be cut down, but he said that it would not be necessary—I have seen the samples brought by the officer, if those samples had been placed in the chest they would have filled it—this list, given me by the prisoner, contains not only those in the case, but those that were missing, the seventeen missing are ticked off.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are the five included? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not the numbers; he has put down 495 samples, but there are only 490—he was to take five samples from my office to Jones and Candler's, to pack them with the rest; I do not know whether he has done so, but I know he did not go into the office after he left it—the numbers of all those obtained from the packers are mentioned in the paper—the five missing are the five samples that came from my office—the prisoner bore a very excellent character, I would have entrusted him with any amount of goods—he has been about seven years in the employment, and I had the highest opinion of him—I did not see him go from the office—I think I left before him, but I saw him take them from the office—he showed them to me, but I did not follow him downstairs; he said "Here are the five samples, I am going to take them to pack."</p>

               <p>of me—I was dismissed for something which was not complained of by the Postmaster—I do not know that there are persons connected with the Post-office here—I know Mr. Hopkinson; he is connected with the Post-office at Huntingdon—I have seen him here—that was the only reason stated for my dismissal—I adhere to that decidedly—numbers of complaints have been made before, but not to me—none of them were became I happened to leave a bag behind which was too heavy; it was on account of the irregularity, the letters not being directed properly—at the time I gave this money to Mr. Morton there had recently been a death in my family—I was not at that time in very reduced circumstances—I was summoned in the County Court, in September, 1856, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., by James Baynham, a grocer, of Uxbridge—I did not pay the money by small instalments; I paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into court, and had no more to pay—that was on 16th January, 1856—between that and September, I do not believe I was sued in the same County Court—I know Mr. Redraff—he saw me in the County Court seven years ago—I believe it was against Mr. Cote—there was a verdict given against me—I know a Mr. Bradshaw—the learned Judge did not tell me to stand down, as he did not believe a word I said, though I had been on my oath; nothing of the kind—Mr. Gardner, a solicitor of Uxbridge, conducted the case, and I had little to say in the matter—I have known Mr. Morton for some time—I have had dealings with him for these last fourteen years—he was not in the district where I delivered letters—I did not know his writing; I had never seen him write—I did not know the prisoner's writing at the time I gave him the money to pay the bill—I knew him in 1855, but never saw him write to my knowledge—I believe this "Received the above, Henry Morton," to be the prisoner's writing—I know his writing; he has written things for me—I have got his writing here—in the course of my delivery of letters it was my duty to pass Mr. Morton's house every day and night, and since that time—the prisoner lived four miles away, but he went to Uxbridge every week for his grocery—I gave him the money against his own residence, in the high road; he was on his own premises, and I was on the footpath—I had not been into his house because I was in a hurry—it was in the open road—I saw no persons present—I got the bill back about the second or third day, and took it to my aunt's about a month afterwards—I cannot say but what I repeatedly met Mr. Morton—I did not say a word to him about the payment of the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. till I went to inquire of him—I had owed him money previously, and had paid him as speedily before—I have a document here which I can show—I owed him money in 1847; that was the last bill, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and that was paid ten days after it was contracted; that was the last transaction I had with him: no, I have found another, of January 9th, 1856, and on January 11th, for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—the dealing was with his servants—I did not say one word to them about this bill being paid by me—this was on 21st March—in January, I was summoned before the Magistrate for shooting somebody's pigeons, and I have been told that the defendant was summoned as a witness against me, but he did not see the transaction—a fortnight before I went to Mr. Morton about this bill I may have had a conversation with Mr. Hopkinson, of the Post-office, about the pigeon being shot, for it was in everybody's mouth—I had not denied that I shot the pigeon; I denied that anybody had seen me do it—I afterwards paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I did not say to Mr. Hopkinson that I understood that Brown had been subpoenaed as a witness against me, and that I would get up a case against him, and be even with him; nothing of the kind—I did not add to</p>

               <p>that, that I had him on the brink of a precipice, and if he did not mind I would throw him over; I never uttered such words—I did not say that I had a charge against him, and would be even with him, for I had no such intention in my head—I decidedly deny having said anything as to doing Brown an injury, or that I would get up a case against him—I went to the Magistrate on 22d March, the next day after calling on Mr. Morton—the case was heard before the Magistrate three times—I showed this bill to Mr. Morton—I received the bill back from my aunt on 19th March, and I went on the 21st—the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid to me in 1857, with other money which I had lent him—I had been in the habit of lending him money from week to week—I owed Mr. Morton a bill in 1848, which I did not pay till 1853—that was not my bill, though it was made out to me; not the whole of it—a por<lb/>tion of it was mine, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was my brother-in-law's, which I objected to pay—the conversation I had with the defendant, which created my sus<lb/>picions, was in his own house—no one was present; it was at night, and we were sitting up together—I have mentioned before that he said he had signed a document for his father-in-law, for which he might have been transported, had it been found out—I understood him his father-in-law—I do not think I mentioned it before the Magistrate—I have not said that he had done an act for his best friend which would render him liable to punish<lb/>ment—what he said was, that if he could get through the difficulty, he would never do the like again.</p>

I am a painter, and live at 4, Park-place, Haggerstone—on 12th April, near upon 3 o'clock in the morning, I was with Charles Mitchell, standing talking to the prisoner at the corner of Swan-yard, Slater-street—I was in liquor, but not so very much; I knew what took I place—while we were talking, Arundel came by on the opposite side of the street—he said something to me; I can't say what the words were—I crossed the road, and asked what he meant by it—a scuffle immediately ensued between us, and we fell, I undermost—I got up, and was standing in the middle of the road, and my friend too—I did not see the prisoner come across the road, but I saw him lay hold of Arundel by the left hand, and strike him two or three times over the head with his truncheon—Arundel was then standing where we had the scuffle—he never said a word—the blows were struck heavily—his head bled a good deal—the blows took effect upon the head and the eye—I cannot tell whether Arundel was sober—we all went down to the station together, and he charged me with the first assault—after Arundel was struck, I ran away about the distance of fifteen yards—the prisoner struck at me with his staff, after he had struck Arundel—my friend came after me, and said, "By God, I think he has hurt the man; let us come back"—we did so, and the second policeman came up within a yard before we got there—at the time I was given into custody, "Arundel said, "This is not the man that struck me in this way; <hi rend="italic">H</hi> 46 is the man that has done it"—I do not know what was said at the station, I was so confused—I afterwards attended before the Magistrate—after the summons was taken out, the prisoner came to my place on the Wednesday or Thursday, another constable came with him—I should know him again; I believe I have seen him here to-day—the prisoner said to me, "We must all stick together; and if you are fined I will pay half the expenses"—he gave me his address on the morning after the occurrence, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he followed me after I left the station with ray friend, and said, "I want your address;" I gave it him; he wrote it down himself, and he gave me his own address; to meet him on the Tuesday after.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Camden's-head-gardens, Bethnal-green-road—on the night this occurred I was standing in my father's shop, nearly directly opposite No. 3, and I heard the cries of "Murder" about a quarter-past 12 o'clock—I ran out to see what was the matter, and saw two or three persons collected round the door of No. 3—I crossed over, and saw three men in the passage, and a woman—the prisoner was down in the corner, and two of the witnesses were striking at him, or over him—I pulled the woman out of the passage away from one of the witnesses—I took the prosecutor by the arm, and pulled him away, and he ran down the steps—I did not know that any one was stabbed until I came outside, for I heard no complaint in the passage of any one being stabbed, neither did I see any knife; afterwards I saw two of them bleeding—I saw one of those two in the passage striking at the prisoner—I did not observe that he was bleeding then; it was five minutes afterwards that I saw it, when the men ran out of the passage—I remained in the passage with the prisoner—I did not know at that time that any one was stabbed—I said to him, "You had better shut the door, and have no more bother"—he shut the door, and I came outside, and then I saw the men that had been stabbed, and not before—when I first went up, I suppose there were six or seven people there.</p>

I live at 2 1/2, Boundary-street—on the night in question I saw a party of men come up; there might have been a half-a-dozen or ten—they came up to Mr. Feurdery's door—I saw Fourdery sitting on the step of the door—I did not know the prisoner; it was dark—Fourdery was talking to somebody; I could not tell who it was—I saw the party come up, and one of them said, "<hi rend="italic">Bill,</hi> this is the b—r that hit me;" the other said, "Is it? the Lord thunder me blind, then, we will kill him;" and they rushed into the passage—I could not see into the passage; it was so dark—I shut my shutters and came to the door, and I saw one come tumbling down the steps—he got up and came on again—a few minutes afterwards they came out, and one said, "I am stabbed;" and another one said, "So am I"—I did not see any knife—I do not know the prisoner at all—I do not know which of the persons it was that used this language; there were so many of them—I could not swear to any of them.</p>

I went with him to a grating, and a female picked up a half-crown, and gave it to Mr. Mason—this is it—it is bent—after that I took the prisoner to Mr. Barclay's ware-house—I received another half-crown from Mr. Tarry—this is it marked 2, the one picked up from the grating is marked No. 1—I received this coun<lb/>terfeit florin, marked No. 3, from Mr. Clegg when the prisoner was present—Mr. Clegg said, "This is the florin I received from this man"—I did not hear the prisoner make any observation—he was close to me—I searched him, and found on him a good half-crown, a sixpence, threepence in copper, and some stamps—I asked him his name and address, and he refused to give them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 32, Silver-street, Golden-square, and am a messenger at Verrey's, in Regent-street—the prisoner is my wife; we have been married eight years—we have lived a very uncomfortable life for the last three years—on Sun day-week last, about half-past 1 at night, I came home and found Mr. Byrne at the street door—he let me in, and I went up-stairs</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090038"/>
               <p>—I was liquor at the time—on my opening the door, I saw my wife on the bed in the room—there was no light in the room—there is a gas-lamp outside which reflects into the room—when I entered, my wife said, "You wretch! you have come home at a pretty time, past four o'clock in the morning—I said, "No, Mary, it is not so late as that; it is very little after one"—she then struck me on the side of the head, and I fell on the bed—I was close to the bed—I then rose again, and received another blow in the face—I placed ray hand to my face, and found blood streaming down, and called out for help—Mr. Byrne came up with a candle in his hand—I said, "For God's sake! Mr. Byrne, take me off to the hospital; my wife had stabbed me in the head"—she was behind me when I said this—the blow on the side of the head was struck with the hand, I think—I do not know what the other was struck with; the blood flowed out directly Afterwards—it seemed to me a very sharp blow at the moment—I was taken to Charing-Cross Hospital—this knife is one similar to those we use at home.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">BYRNE</hi>. I live at 32, Silver-street, and am a boot-closer—the prisoner and her husband lived in the same house—about half-past one on Sunday, 1st May, the prosecutor came home; he had been drinking—he went upstairs, and about two minutes after I heard a noise as though there was a struggle in the room—I opened my door, and listened—I heard Mr. Poacher call out, "Help!" "Police! I am stabbed!"—I went up with a light—I saw him standing by his room door in a stooping posture, with his hand to the head, and bleeding profusely from the face—he said, "Mr. Byrne, for God's sake! take me to the hospital, I am bleeding to death; my wife has stabbed me three times in the head"—his wife was close by; she did not say a word—I called the police to the door, and she was given into custody—near the place where she was, I found this knife, on the floor of the room where she was standing—she afterwards said at the station, "Mr. Byrne, what you say is true, but to-morrow will show how I have been used."</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Thomas Bryer, a draper, No. 44, King William-street. On 4th April, the prisoner and another woman came and asked to look at some shawls—they went in the shawl-room, selected one large square shawl and paid a deposit of a shilling on it—they then left the shop and came again the next day, on Tuesday, 5th April—the prisoner told me she had lost the bill which we had given her and she wished to change the shawl which they had bought for a long one—I took them into the shawl-room and left them there—they came down in about five minutes afterwards—they followed Mr. Clark out of the room, and after staying some little time they left—Mr. Clark made a communication to me and I followed them—I came up to them and I said, "I want you to go back to the shop with me there is a mistake about the shawl"—they seemed confused, and I said, "Which of you has got the shawl?" the younger woman who was with the prisoner went away, and the prisoner said, "She has got the shawl." I went after the younger woman and brought her back to where the prisoner was standing—I told them they must go back to the shop—they wished me to let them go—we walked on till we came to the corner of Eastcheap, and as I was looking to find an officer the younger woman went into a public-house and I lost her—the prisoner still remained and I took her back to our warehouse—when the prisoner and the other woman and I were all standing together, I saw these shawls under a cart which was there—I seized the shawls and then the younger woman escaped—I should think either of the women could</p>

I am a merchant—I reside at Ampton-place, Gray's Inn-road—at the end of October, 1856, I had a house at Notting-hill—in 1857, that house was robbed and I lost plate to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., amongst which were six or seven spoons that I set some value by—after that some of the property was found in possession of the prisoner's brother, and he was taken before a magistrate—I was present—it was through me that he was convicted—the prisoner came to me about three months since—he asked to see me, and said he had come on a very important mission, that he was working with the police and he knew about the robbery com<lb/>mitted at my house at Notting-hill, and if I would only stick by him he would succeed in recovering the whole of the property—I asked, him if he was sincere, and said, I hoped he was not deceiving me—he said, no; it was the truth; and he wanted to make an appointment for me to meet him that night, but I could not do so—an appointment was made for an<lb/>other night, and I made a communication to the police—we went to the Porcupine public-house in Newport-market—I was in disguise—we found the prisoner was not there, and they directed us to a house in St. Martin's-lane where we found him—I did not get anything on that occasion, and I lost sight of the prisoner—I saw him again on 14th March, we met him in</p>

My husband keeps a fruiterer's shop in Earl-street, Hoxton—on 1st April the prisoner came and asked for four oranges; they were a penny each—he said he would give a halfpenny each—I said, "No; that is less than they cost"—he said, "I will give twopence for the three"—I said, "You have four"—he gave me a half-crown, and said, "I will have them"—I gave him two Queen's shillings and twopence—he said, "You have taken a penny apiece"—I said, "Yes; you agreed to that"—he said, "I shall not have them; give me my half-crown back"—he put down the four oranges, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—one of the shillings was one which I had given him, and one was a bad one—I am sure of that, as I gave him two Queen's shillings, and he gave me back a George the Third, and left the shop directly—I bit it, and gave it to my husband, who went after the prisoner, but could not see him—I saw my little girl put it in a box by itself—it remained there till the 13th, when I gave it to a constable—on the 13th my little girl brought me a good florin—I went into the shop and saw the prisoner there—I knew him again directly—there were four lemons on the counter; the price of them was fourpence—I gave him a Queen's shilling, which my little girl made a mark on, and a fourpenny-piece and fourpence—he turned to go out, and then turned back and said, "You have taken a penny apiece"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Your little girl agreed with me for a halfpenny"—she said, "No, Sir; you told me to take fourpence from the two-shilling piece"—he said, "Then I shall not have them"—I gave him his two-shilling piece, and he gave me a George the Third shilling, instead of my new one, and eightpence—he left the shop, and ran when he got outside—I called my husband, who went after him and brought him back—I said, "You are the man that passed a bad shilling on me to-day, as you did a fortnight ago"—he said, "No; you are wrong"—I said, "You are the man that came in for four lemons just now"—he said, "Yes"—he had snatched the bad shilling from my husband in Gloucester-street; and when he came back he said, "This is the same one you gave me; search me;" giving me a good shilling—I said, "That is not the one you snatched from my husband; you have changed it"—it was a Victoria shilling, and rather new—my husband said, "I think you have it in your mouth"—a policeman came, and said, "Put out your tongue"—my hus<lb/>band then said, "You have swallowed it"—he pressed his handkerchief to his throat, and said, "No, I have not; and I have nothing in my mouth."</p>

               <p>the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I earned after I saw Bramwell; it could be but very little of it—When I was examined before, I said that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the sum that some few jobs amounted to that I then remembered—my regular employment ceased on 19th October; that was with Mr. Miller, of Upper George-street, Bryanston-square, and I had been with him not quite nine weeks, as a journeyman-baker—he discharged me—before that I was with Mr. Glover, of Kensington—that was a fortnight before I went to Mr. Miller—I was seven weeks with Mr. Glover; he did not discharge me, I left because the situation did not suit me—I was not found with some bread in my hat; I never was—I gave Mr. Miller a week-and-a-half's notice; that was how I left—I would not work twenty hours out of twenty-four, that was all—that was the reason entirely—before that I had a situation in Vauxhall-walk, with Mr. Horlock—I went there on Easter-Sunday, and left a week before Whitsuntide; that was six-weeks—I left on 15th May, and went to Mr. Glover's on 20th June—I was not out of a situation all that time, I went into the country for a fortnight, not to work—I gave Mr. Horlock warning to leave—as to the number of hours, the situation was everything I wished, but he was a very great black-guard—he used some strong language to me—he did not say that I had any bread of his, nor money either—I was never a baker in Pimlico, that I am aware of—I know that I never stole broad to put in my hat—Pimlico is a part that I am very little acquainted with—I don't exactly know where it is—I had a situation in Westminster, with Mr. Urry, I think, in Bowling-street—that was a week or two before I went to Mr. Horlock's—I was only with him a week and two nights—I left him because I could not get on—I could not please myself or him—I left him on the Tuesday, and I think on the following Sunday I went to Mr. Eames, in High-street, Bloomsbury—I was only there three nights—I only went in for a job; I left on the Wednes<lb/>day—then I made some buns for Mr. Gray, at the corner of Whitcomb-street and James-street, that was only a job; I think it was Good-Friday that same week—I do not know Eccleston-square, or Warwick-square, Pimlico—I mean to say that I have never been charged with having my master's bread, and no four horses will bring any employer here that will speak against me, that is more—I have once before been to a bank with a forged bill or cheque; I do not know whether it was a bill or a cheque; a Mr. Brown employed me then—he was a countryman of mine; he wrote to me from Oxford—he did not impose upon me, he only gave me the trouble to go to the Strand—I did not know it was forged when I went with it—my directions were to get a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, cut it in halves and send it to him one half at a time; therefore I should not have got a great deal of profit—the cheque was sent up to me—I did not communicate with the police then—I did not commu<lb/>nicate with them at all; I took it to the gentleman that it was forged upon, they gave it me back at the bank, and gave me the gentleman's address—I took it to him, and then immediately wrote to my friend at Oxford, to tell him it was a forgery—it was to Coutts' bank I went—I first saw Foster in Red-Lion-street, on 22d March, and went with him to the public-house in the court that loads into Red-Lion-square, the first passage nearest Holborn; I do not remember who keeps that house—it is a very large one, I believe it was formerly Mr. E. T. Smith's house—it was a very busy time, both the barman and the landlord were very busy; it was supper-time, and it was in the jug department—I saw the landlord; I am not sure whether it was he or the barman that waited upon us; it was one or the other I believe—there was an elderly gentleman and a stout lady there—I had two pennyworth of gin and water—I had it standing at the bar—we were there about half an</p>

               <p>the person who had entrapped him in presenting a forged cheque, or any thing of the kind—the conversation about his putting on a bold face and appearing at this case that was remanded, occurred after I had spoken of presenting the cheque or bill—I mentioned it in the public tap-room, not in any private conversation with Bramwell—it was at the end of three weeks that he made the proposal to me—he told me at once that he wanted me to present a cheque <hi rend="italic">on the cross</hi>—I thought it was not very straightforward—I knew the meaning of the words "on the cross;" he must be a very ignorant man that does not know that; I am not quite so ignorant as that—he said that everything should be done to show my innocence; it was all said at once; I don't say that he kept on <hi rend="italic">spirting</hi> it out straight on—when he asked me if I would present a cheque <hi rend="italic">on the cross,</hi> he explained it, and I said I would give him Ian answer to-morrow—I might have said something as he went on—I might have answered him various questions; I don't remember, I allowed him to have it all his own way—I have stated as nearly as possible what he said—very probably I do not remember all he said—he suggested the advertising for a baker—he said the amount of the cheque would be a good one, and I was to have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the conversation about the advertisement occurred at Hammond's—I don't know why he got me to copy it, and left the original in my possession—I did not ask him to write an advertisement for me for a porter's place—he said he should do it; I did not ask him—he did not ask why I wanted a porter's place—I might have told him I was tired of night work, because I really am—I never wished him to Write air advertisement for me—I deny it on my oath—I took very good care not to lose the adver<lb/>tisement that he wrote; he turned out of the door, leaving this on the counter, and I picked it up, and put it in my pocket, I thought it would be useful—I gave him the one I wrote—I never could see any object in having it copied—there was some conversation respecting whether it should be in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Advertiser,</hi> he never spoke of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—I was not well acquainted with the Orange Tree—T knew the landlord's brother when he was in a different line of business—I do not know that I was ever in the Orange Tree before that time, I might have been; I don't remember I had never been there with Bramwell previous to Wednesday, the 23d—Foster made the appointment at that house—I don't think I made it with Bramwell—I don't recollect seeing Bramwell after the appointment was made by Foster, until I met him there—I have never borrowed money from Bramwell; I have no recollection of ever borrowing a farthing of him—I will swear I have not—I will swear positively that he did not go to my lodging on the Sunday evening to get back five shillings that he had lent me—he never lent me five shillings while we were playing at skittles—I have played at skittles; not a great deal, not for money; perhaps I have played at domi<lb/>noes for a penny or twopence—I never won money from Bramwell at dominoes; I think I gave him up best—I mean he was a better player than I—I never played him at skittles—I am really married—my wife is a laun<lb/>dress—she washes for Nos. 2 and 3, Euston-square, which are lodging-houses, and a few journeyman bakers—she washes at 10, Grafton-place—she has the use of the wash-house.</p>

I assist in the management of the University hotel, Grafton-street—I remember on Wednesday, 23d March, a person coming to our coffee-room between 11 and 12 o'clock—I had never seen that person before, to my knowledge—he had a black wrapper round his face, a pair of steel spectacles, and a hat on—this piece of black serge produced is such a thing as he had round his face—it went round his face, and was covered at the top by his hat—he had the spectacles on when he came in—I don't think he took them off—he called for some brandy and water—he had the appearance of an invalid—he stooped a little, and he held his hand over one of his eyes—I did not show him into the coffee-room, he rang the bell and I went in to him, and he asked me for a glass of brandy and water—I got it him—I asked him if I should mix it for him—he requested me to do so—he then asked me to get him the paper—he said his name was Curtis, that he expected a gentleman to call, and I was to send him to him in the coffee-room—nobody else was in the coffee-room at this time—the witness Watkins came and asked for him, and I sent him into the coffee-room—he was there a very short time—the man in the spectacles remained a very short time after Watkins had left—he went out very quickly after Watkins—he paid me for his brandy and water—I believe the prisoner Wagner is the person—I next saw him at Vine-street, on the following Saturday, and I recognized him by his walk and stature, and his face, what I could see of it—by his stature, I mean his size—when I first saw him in Vine-street station he was walking a little stooping—he was in a large room there—he did not continue to walk stooping, he kept himself upright—he changed his posture the moment I went in—I did not speak to him, nor did anybody in my hearing—on my entering the room I recognised him to be the man—he could see me—when I first saw him he held himself a little in a stooping position, the same as when he went out of the coffee-room, and when I went in he held himself upright—there was no window or any place through which I could see him before I went into the room—I do not know who the other parties were that were in the room—I saw Wagner as soon as I went in—I had not seen him before I went into the room—he was in a stooping position, and when I went in he stood upright—I did not see him before he saw me—he saw me at the same moment that I saw him—when he was in our coffee-room I noticed what I could see of his face—all his face was covered by the black cloth, except his nose and mouth—he had dark glasses on his eyes—I mean dark-framed ones—they were like these (<hi rend="italic">looking at a pair produced by Webb</hi>)—looking at him now, I believe him to be the person.</p>

Q.</hi> Is there any waiter at the hotel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; one—the waiter did not see him on that day; he was out—no one saw him but me—I can't say exactly how long he was there; about an hour, perhaps, or half-an-hour—I was fetched to the station by Joy, the detective—this piece of black is something like what the man wore—it is the same colour—I did not feel it; I merely looked at it—all I can say is, that it is the same sort of thing—Joy came to the hotel for me—he questioned me about having seen a man there of the name of Curtis—I told him there had been a man there of that name—I think he told me that he had got that man in custody—he did not tell me where he was going to take me; he said he wanted me for a few minutes—I knew he was taking me to see the man—I don't think he showed me this piece of black; it was Joy or Webb, I don't know which, that showed it me—he asked me if that was any thing like the wrapper that Curtis had on—I think he told me he had found it at the man's lodging—he showed me the spectacles—I don't think he told me where he had found them—he asked me if those were the spectacles the man was wearing—having told me this, and that he had got the man in custody, he said I must come and see him—I did not go to the station with my mind made up that the man that was there was the man that had been to the University hotel, not till I saw him—I did not think anything about it till I saw him—I had not made up my mind that he was the man until I saw him—I had not a very strong impression that it was the same man; I don't know that I thought anything about it—there were several persons in the same room where he was shown to me—I don't remember how many; three or four—the policeman did not point him out to me; he asked me if I could see the man that I saw in the coffee-room—the other man were not sitting near him; most of them were standing—I don't know whether they were policemen; some of them were dressed as policemen, I believe—I should say there were three or four dressed in plain clothes, but I did not know what they were; they stood about—I do not remember any of the policemen saying anything to me about this man—he was standing when I went in; he stood in a stoop<lb/>ing position, and when he turned round to walk he stood more upright—I don't remember whether he had his hands in his pocket; his head was bent forward, not much; the shoulders were bent a little—I did sot speak to him, or hear him speak—all I say about him is, that I believe him to be the man.</p>

I know nothing about it"—I told him he must consider himself in custody, and I then commenced searching the room—there was a hat on a chest of drawers—I have seen him wear a different hat altogether from that—he put that one on when I brought him away; there was only that one—I also found this piece of stuff—I took hold of it, and looked at it, and said, "What is this for?"—he said, "That is what I wear round my head because I am troubled with the rheumatics"—he was then taken away in custody—the lodging is about three minutes' walk from the University hotel—I saw Webb find some spectacles in the same room—on the 28th I went to 4, Red Lion-square, accompanied by Watkins and Sergeant Webb—Webb went in first—I saw the prisoner Humphreys down stairs—he went upstairs with us, and in a room there, between the bed and the mattress, I found a good many things that have no immediate reference to this case—I also went into an inner room, and there I found a great many things that I took possession of—I saw a die taken from Humphreys.</p>

               <p>forgery, I believe you to be the most proper persons to write to, as I wish to make very useful propositions for the benefit of bankers. The accounts in the newspapers every week sufficiently show, that by all care the bank<lb/>ers lose large sums, which, in the course of a year, must necessarily amount to something considerable. Being confident that I am introduce to the bankers, without additional labour or expense, a simple contrivance to reduce forgery on them at least 90 per cent., I beg to ask you, gentlemen, if you will be good enough to communicate with the bankers, and to make them my offer. Further, I beg to say that as I am (to say the least of it) a marked man, whom the police would never allow to earn in London, or even Eng<lb/>land, an honest living—although I and in no fear whatever to be mixed up with any forgery, as I have never forged—never sent anybody with a forgery—never presented any forgery for payment—never changed the produce of a forgery, &amp;c., since my liberation in 1856. I wish to leave England with my family forever, provided I can get a handsome remune<lb/>ration for my secret. Besides, as no doubt you wish to get at the fountain head; that is to say, you wish to know who manufacture nearly all forgeries on bankers within the last fifteen years, I am willing to give such informa<lb/>tion, and assist you in every possible way to lay hold of a whole gang, whose intentions are to commit a good many more forgeries, and who are able to do so, &amp;c.; but only on certain conditions. The conditions are:—Firstly.—My name must not transpire in any way whatever, as such would spoil my services in toto. Secondly.—Myself, as well as my brother-in-law (Mr. Bateman), must receive a guarantee in writing not to be mixed up or prosecuted for anything that may transpire by such information; and <hi rend="italic">Thirdly.</hi>—I want 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (a small percentage on the sums yearly lost) for my secret and full information. If my offer and conditions should be considered by you worthy of acceptance, an answer directed to me under the above mentioned direction and marked "private," would, in the course of the week, be forwarded to me, when, without any delay, I shall arrange everything to your satisfaction through my solicitor.—I am, Gentlemen, your most obedient and most humble servant, W. Wagner." It was six weeks after receiving that letter that I saw Wagner, after he was in custody—I received that letter in February; I did not answer it; I took no notice of it whatever—when he was in custody I received a message requesting me to go to the Vine-street station—I went there, and went into the large room that has been spoken of, where he was walking about—he addressed me by name, and asked me if it was not better worth my while to avail myself of his services than to prosecute him—I said that under the circumstances, which were known to both of us, it was quite impossible that I could listen to any such request—he said that I had formed a prejudice against him; that he could assure me he had nothing to do with any forgeries whatever—I said it was very well for him to say so, but how could he give me the information he had promised if he were not connected with them in some way—he said he might very well know about it; but whatever he had done, he had done nothing that the law could lay hold of—I said, "It is no use your talking to me in that way; why did you run away when Chandler was taken into custody?—you left York-buildings on that morning, and have never been back since"—he said, "I did not wish my name to be mixed up with Chandler; he was only my clerk"—I said I did not think if my clerk had committed a forgery, that I should run away unless I was mixed up with it—he said he thought it better to go away—he then asked me again if I would avail myself of his services instead of prose<lb/>cuting</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">objected; first, because those forgeries were the subjects of other indictments; and, secondly, because this was a case in which, from the very nature of it, it was not necessary to bring forward such evidence in order to show guilty knowledge, the only ground upon which it could be receivable; if the evidence already given was believed, it was impossible for the jury to doubt the guilty knowledge of the parties implicated, and the evidence about to be offered, in reality, was intended to be used to establish the identity of Wagner; a purpose for which it was not legitimately admissable.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am now in custody in Newgate—I pleaded guilty at the last session to several charges of forgery—I know the prisoner Wagner—I became acquainted with him about May or June, 1857—I was very poorly off at that time—I was introduced to him for the purpose of discounting a bill—he was represented to me as a person who discounted; that was my first introduction to him—I explained to him what I wanted,—he took the particulars, and that interview ended without anything being done—I did not get the bill discounted; I saw him soon after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Shortly after that, in the summer of 1857, was there any other trans<lb/>action in which you and Wagner were both engaged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first trans<lb/>action with Wagner was some forgery in the city; I think on the Union Bank, in Princes'-street—I do not think that was Mr. Aitkins' cheque—I recollect this cheque perfectly well (<hi rend="italic">looking at one for</hi> 375<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated 11th Sept.</hi> 1858)—I got that from Wagner: I did not get it cashed—there were several forged before that—I recollect Mr. Aitkins' cheque perfectly well; it was given to me by Wagner—an arrangement was made that some man should be sent for the money—Humphreys was to find a man to go with the cheque; that was arranged between Wagner, myself and Humphreys; and to protect that man from any difficulty, he was to advertise for a situation, and it was arranged that I should answer the advertisement, and meet him at some hotel—I do not know that man—I should know him again—there was a man whom I met, it was on the day following this arrangement; he put in an advertisement, and I met him the following day in St. Martin's-court, in the neighbourhood of Leicester-square, at the Crown coffee-house, I think it was—I gave that man the cheque and started him into the city—Bateman and Wagner followed, watching my movements with this man—I went into the city to meet Humphreys in Monument-yard—I did meet him, and Wagner and Bateman came presently and told Humphreys that the man had re<lb/>ceived the money—Humphreys then went to the place appointed, where he had previously arranged to meet that man, and received a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I know it by the name at the back, in my handwriting—this note was taken into the Bank of England by myself first, for the purpose of getting it changed, but I saw some one there that I knew, and I did not get it changed, I returned it to Wagner; he gave it to Bateman, and Bate<lb/>man went into the Bank of England and got it changed—by Wagner's direc<lb/>tion I afterwards went to Spielman's, the moneychanger's, in Lombard-street, with part of the proceeds of that note in notes, and I received foreign money for them, part gold and part notes; part of that foreign money was a 1000 franc note—I gave the whole of the money to Wagner, and he gave the notes to Bateman, who went to Smart's, in Leicester-square, and received a cheque for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a copy of this cheque was taken by Bate-man; myself and Wagner were present at the time—it was taken by Wagner's direction and the consent of all parties, in fact; it was taken by the arrange<lb/>ment of us all, I mean Wagner, myself, and Bateman—Bateman made the copy—before this Wagner had said, he knew Smart to be a man of property, but he did not know exactly where he banked—the copy was taken on tracing-paper—shortly afterwards a blank form of cheque was taken by Humphreys on Drummond's, it was a printed form; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at that time no stamp was impressed upon it; we had ascertained that stamps were in general use at this time—we made no particular inquiries about Messrs. Drummonds using stamped forms of cheques, it was generally known at that time—Smart's cheque had the stamp on, and we knew it was generally the case—when this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090071"/>
               <p>cheque was prepared ready for filling up, a stamp was made for the purpose—I mean a die to make a stamp for the purpose of using the cheque—that was agreed amongst ourselves,—the stamp was afterwards impressed on this cheque by that die—the body of the cheque was filled up by Bateman, as it now is, leaving out the date until it was agreed to be used—the word January was pat to it, but not the day of the month—it was filled up in the presence of Wagner and myself, by Bateman—Bateman said, in Wagner's presence, that he knew a man of the name of Jones who would find a man to go for the money—after two or three interviews with Jones, he proposed a man of the name of Bramwell, who would fetch the money—Jones came down; I saw him at York-buildings, Wagner's house; I and Bateman and Wagner were present—Jones said that Bramwell was taking care of an empty house, somewhere in the neighbourhood of Soho, and that the house was to be let upon the terms that whoever took it was to pay 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, and to protect Bramwell from any difficulty—it was proposed that a letter should be written to him as if from some one who had seen the house and liked it, and would take it—I saw the letter written by Bateman; this is it; it was sent by post (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>),—"January 19th, 1859. To Mr. Bramwell Sir, I saw your wife this day about the house, but cannot call to-morrow as intended. I shall not fail to see you on Friday morning; I hardly see what 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit is required for. Yours, G. Wilson."—It was afterwards proposed that another letter should be Written—Jones proposed it—it was written in Wagner and Bateman's presence, at York-buildings—that letter was making it appear that the cheque was in. closed in it,—both these letters were put into the post; I posted one; they were not put in at the same time—I can hardly say how soon after the first the second was posted—I don't recollect;—this is it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>), "January 20th, 1859. To Mr. Bramwell. Dear sir, I beg to inclose you a cheque for 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which you will oblige by getting cashed, deducting your 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the house, and I will call early in the morning for the remainder. Yours, G. Wilson,"—That letter purports to contain the cheque, but it did not in fact contain it—the cheque was given to Jones, the date was first put on it, the 20th January, that is the same date as the second letter that was written; that was done at York-buildings—Jones was to give the cheque to Bramwell to send him with it for the money, and it was arranged that, on the road from Bramwell's house to Drummond's, he should come through Trafalgar-square, past the Nelson column, in order that Wagner and Bateman might see Bramwell and watch his movements at Drummond's—next morning, 21st, I went to York-buildings (I was daily there), Wagner and Bateman were out when I got there; they came in to the best of my recollection about 12 o'clock—Jones came back first to York-buildings; he made some communication to me—when Wagner and Bateman came in they entered into conversation, and Jones told them that Bramwell had not received the money, that he was given into custody, or rather that an officer had gone with Bramwell to the house—a good deal of conversation took place between Jones, Bateman, Wagner, and myself; and Wagner would not believe but what the man had the money—he said he believed that Jones and Bramwell were putting their heads together to rob him of the money—he said that in the presence of Jones, Bateman, and myself; and he at last proposed that he and Bateman should go and look over the house in Soho that Bramwell was taking care of, to see if there really was an officer there or not; and they went from York-buildings for the purpose of going to Bramwell's house—they were absent nearly two hours—when they returned Bateman was smoking a cigar—he said that he had been</p>

               <p>over the house and there really was a man there who they presumed to be an officer; that he was smoking a pipe; and Bateman laughed and said, "Well, let him bean officer or not I have lighted my cigar from his pipe"—a female, named Fairbairn, was living in York-buildings at that time—I remember some time ago a forged order being prepared to get a pass book of Mr. Feetum's—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the order; it was prepared by a man of the name of Kerp—it is upon the Union-bank, Argyll-place—I cannot say whether Kerp brought it to York-buildings—I saw him give it to Wagner—Wagner gave it to me, and wished me to send some boy for the book—I sent a boy; he and I went up into the neighbourhood of the bank; Wagner followed the boy to see whether he really got the book or not—he stood outside the bank; I stopped at an appointed place which Wagner and I had arranged, I think it was in King's-street opposite the bank, looking down into Beak-street at the back of Regent-street—Wagner came to me there in a short time, and told me that a clerk had come out of the bank with the boy—I had stopped at my appointed place; I had employed the boy, and I was to receive the book from the boy, but upon this Wagner and I walked away, and nothing further took place—Kerp lived in John-street, Fitzroy-square, at the house of a Mrs. Skelton—that was not the only occasion upon which Kerp's services were used—his services were used repeatedly by Wagner; Wagner employed him—Mr. Aitkin's cheque was prepared by Kerp, it was the one actually used—Mr. Aitkin's signature was obtained in this way, two letters were brought to Wagner by Humphreys, written by Mr. Aitkin with reference to some hounds, and in that way we got the signature—I remember a cheque being prepared of a person named Chambers—Kerp prepared the original one in that case; it was a check for 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Drummond's—the one that Kerp pre<lb/>pared was not the one that was actually used, for Wagner had had some quarrel with Kerp about something or other, and he wished to defraud him of his share of the cheque, and he proposed that Bateman and I should try if we could take a copy of the forged cheque which Kerp had prepared—Bateman and I accordingly made several copies, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them, and it was upon this that the money was obtained; this was written by me—Wagner considered it the best; it was an exact copy—the words, lf No effects," were written upon Kerp's cheque, and it was given back to him—Wagner had several interviews with Kerp about it, at his house, I believe; but I was not present—Wagner told me that he had returned the cheque—he was constantly at Kerp's lodging, ever since I have known him—I knew that Kerp had a place of concealment for articles of this character; it was the bottom of a slop-pail; it was an ordinary slop-pail, but the bottom of it unscrewed; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was kept in actual use as a slop-pail in Kerp's lodging; I have seen Wagner open it at Kerp's lodging—there was also a rolling-pin, which was used as a place of concealment, at Wagner's house; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>),—it unscrews—the cheques were wound round it—it was kept in actual use at Wagner's house (<hi rend="italic">the witness here unscrewed both the articles</hi>)—last summer some wire blinds were put up at the house, 10, York-buildings, Adelphi, and upon them was "Bateman &amp; Co., Law, Parliamentary, and General Stationers;" and at the bottom, the word, "Agents, etc."—a little law-stationery business was carried on there, and also as money agents, dis<lb/>counting bills—I was there constantly since October last, and also Bateman and Wagner—I only went there in October, 1858; I continued to be in attendance there until I was taken into custody on the 1st February last.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—early on the morning of 4th April the prosecutor was brought there, and I superintended the dressing of his wound—it was a lacerated wound of the scalp—it could not have been inflicted by the edge of a chopper, it was too jagged, but the back of a chopper might produce it—a fire-shovel might produce it.</p>

I live at 6, John-street, Curtain-road, and am under cellar<lb/>man to Mr. Jones—I was not employed as under cellarman till after Mr. Jones had the business—on 21st December I helped my brother Joseph to bottle and pack some brandy and gin—it was directed to Mr. Austin, Can<lb/>terbury—Lambe was there when I took it away to the cloak room, London-bridge station, about 9 o'clock in the morning—I do not know whether that was before Mr. Jones came—I took no porter's book to the station—it was usual when I delivered goods to have them entered in the porter's book, and to get the signature in it of the person to whom they are delivered as the receipt for them—I did not take it on this occasion, because as some stations they will not sign for anything, and nothing was said about it—on Monday, 3d January, I remember Seares going with a truck, with some brandy and sherry, to Ely-place—at this time Mr. Jones's van was going up Holborn, past Ely-place—the van came up just as he set off, but it was not put into the van—I assisted in bottling the sherry and brandy on the previous Saturday.</p>

James and Curtis—he said that if they said anything to me about the hamper and bottles, I was to bring them back; but, if they said nothing, I was to come away without them and say nothing about it—I told Mr. Selwood, in Mr. Lambe's presence, that the load was too heavy, the truck not being sound, and Mr. Selwood said that the goods should be tied on—I did not notice the van at the door when I started—I afterwards delivered the brandy and sherry to James and Curtis, and the note with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there not a negotiation between you and Mr. Lambe, in the presence of Mr. Tucker, to the effect that if you would advance a certain sum of money, sufficient to pay the composition, that Mr. Lambe should retain his interest in the vaults, until such time as an agreement could be come to between you, by deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I bought it out—under the first arrangement I was to produce a small sum; and while I was ascertaining what I was to have for my money, it was sold over my head-the basis of the first arrangement certainly was that he should retain his interest in the vaults; but it went off—a meeting of creditors was held that very day, after which I had an interview with Mr. Tucker, who said that he accepted my offer of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—it was a letter which said that he accepted my offer—Mr. Humphreys has that letter.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, for 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you were to have first 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. clear, and then make him a present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You forget the mortgage—some days did not elapse before I could find the money—I was going through the valuation to see how much I was going to have for my money—Mr. Tucker did not apply to me for the money to pay the first instalment to the creditors; the money was ready—I was going through the valuation—no doubt I was asked to pay, and I did not, for the best of all reasons—Mr. Tucker did not tell me that, as I had not found the money, and as Mr. Lambe's creditors were pressing, he should be obliged to conclude the arrangement with a gentle<lb/>man named Chambers—that was communicated to me by letter, by Mr. Tucker; on which I complained to Mr. Tucker of an arrangement being made with Mr. Chambers, and requested him to see if that arrangement could not be cancelled, and I get an interest in the business—that was by words—Mr. Tucker did not see me a few days afterwards, and say that it had been arranged, and Mr. Chambers would give up his claim and let me in, in consideration of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being paid him; I heard of it after I had bought the place—Mr. Lambe called on me, and told me that Mr. Chambers had kindly done so, in consideration of Mr. Lambe's large family, in order that he might have a better agreement with me—I told Mr. Tucker I would buy it, but would have nothing to do with the first agreement, that was, the division of profits—the whole of the money, 1,650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was to be found in two months.</p>
               <p>

               <p>memorandum my solicitor advised, I would give—it was a memorandum to carry out the arrangement between me and Mr. Lambe—it was not my suggestion to Mr. Tucker, that the agreement should not be entered into till 1st January, because it would be more convenient to take stock at the end of the year—that was to ascertain my profit and loss—between 18th November and the beginning of the year I had several interviews with Mr. Tucker, Mr. Lambe, and my own solicitor, it may have been two or three; when drafts of deeds were discussed—I objected to a portion of it and Mr. Lambe to a portion of it—as far as the profits I should have made him a present of a quarter—I should have adhered to my original idea of making him a present—I mean to tell these twelve gentlemen that that deed was being proposed to enable me to make him a present in the shape of salary; anything to avoid a partnership—this was in December, and I first knew of a robbery, by him, on 31st January—I mentioned it at Mr. Tucker's office for the first time, and he asked that he might have a week given to him—I found that Mr. Lambe was robbing me and that he had sent goods to Ely-place—I saw him after I had made that statement to Mr. Tucker—I told him what I thought of him, and that he had robbed others, and told him to be off—I did not mince words—I received a letter a week or ten days after that from Messrs. Wickens and Burton in reference to this very charge which I had made against Mr. Lambe—between that time and the week or ten days afterwards, when I mentioned it to Wickens and Burton, I took steps to prosecute him—I asked him to explain himself, and finding he never kept his appointments, I went to Wickens and Burton, his new solicitors, who he had just brushed up—I do not know now that they had been his solicitors for years, not till this moment; not for years; I knew that they had been for the last month—Mr. Tucker I always knew as his solicitor, but afterwards I went to Mr. Wickens—after I had made that state<lb/>ment to Mr. Tucker, Lambe came to the vaults day after day until I forbid him—I was too anxious for his family, to give him in custody, not for him—it is not for his family's sake that I have brought him here to-day—I sent an officer for him to his residence—on the 14th inst. I received a copy of a writ in an action commenced against me for slander—I had then threatened to give him in custody—I received it the day after I gave him in custody—my solicitor received it afterwards—my solicitor may have had notice of it the day before I gave Lambe in custody, but I did not know it, on my oath; nor had I heard a word about it from any person—I had received a letter intimating that I should be proceeded against—I had received an intimation that morning that I should be prosecuted for slander; and I gave him in custody on the evening of that day—he had no right to have private customers of his own—he had none, or he ought to have had none, while I was with him at the Exchange vaults between 1850 and 1859—he was trading indirectly, which I complained about—he had private customers of his own without my sanction—I believe you have Selwood here to day, I saw him here—the prisoner may have had customers of his own for two months, but not during the whole time—I did not know that the had sold since to James and Curtis—I know it now—I did not know that they were customers of his before I joined him—I never saw them till I traced the stolen property to their possession—I cannot tell you whose property the wine at the Docks is, but I understand it belongs to a Mr. Deacon—I do not understand that it belongs to Lambe—there was not an understanding between me and him that whatever wines he might require for his own private customers he should have at cost price from me—he called at the sale and I was quite willing that any lots which his</p>

               <p>auctioneer might sell he should have at a trifle beyond the cost price—there was not an arrangement between us as regards his dealings with his own private customers—after my complaining to his solicitor, Mr. Tucker, he said it was very irregular and wrong, and Mr. Lambe had a sale to clear himself of any little parcels he had of one lot or another—I was quite willing to deliver any lots at a slight margin on the shipping prices; any which the auctioneer might sell at a public sale—Mr. Such was the auctioneer—I had an interview with him and told him I would part with no lots—Mr. Such is one of his bail—I arranged with Lambe that he should have a certain quantity of wine out of the stock to be sold by Mr. Such, the auctioneer; Lambe to bear all the risk, conditionally that Mr. Such saw me paid—I took the precaution to name to Mr. Such that he should see me paid, and if there was any loss consequent on the sale, I was to have nothing to do with it—in the event of its being a profit<lb/>able transaction, Lambe was not to have one portion of the profits and I the other portion; there was a fixed price of it of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. beyond the shipping price which Lambe was to pay—my profit was the margin of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was in December, 1858, and January, 1859—those wines were sherries, brandies, and champagnes—the wine which Mr. Lambe took from me on that occa<lb/>sion amounted to 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., errors excepted—that is the amount they are invoiced at, but there are false entries—this paper is in my clerk's writing—he had wines under that arrangement to the amount of about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Such paid the money to Mr. Lambe in my presence, and Mr. Lambe handed it back to me—I complained that he did not bring enough, and he said that he would send a cheque next day by post—Mr. Such did not tell me that he did not know me in the transaction and would not know me, and that his dealings were with Mr. Lambe only—I sent my invoice to Mr. Lambe—Mr. Such did not upon that come and tell me he would have no dealings except with Mr. Lambe—he handed the money to Mr. Lambe, and as a point of etiquette I allowed it to pass—Lambe did not put it in his pocket—it was not a cheque, it was gold and notes—I complained that it was not enough and he sent me a cheque next day payable to me, which I passed through my bankers—on my oath that cheque was payable to me—it was sent to me by post, and I sent it through my bankers—I rather think Counsel have it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced, and payable to Mr. Lambe</hi>)—it came to me by post.</p>

               <p>complained of the word salary being entered, as applied to the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he was receiving; not to me, but I heard at the vaults at the time he was com<lb/>plaining to the accountant about it—I was not an instant there—he struck his pen through the word—the conversation was with my book-keeper, not with me nor in my presence, I simply came in at the time he was scolding him for putting it there—I did not say that I would take care that it should never occur again—I did not say such a foolish thing as that; I made no answer at all—I had no wish to degrade him, or make him less in the estimation of the other servants—he took his 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. weekly, not always—it was not sometimes settled in an account—he and I used to take wines and spirits from the stores for our own consumption, and have it entered in a book at cost price—it was entered at the full price and afterwards merely charged at cost, and an allowance made—all articles were booked at the full price.</p>

Deloitte and Greenwood, the eminent accountants who detected Redpath and Robson, to make me out a set of books to check irregularities—the prisoner was away for two months from 11th November to 11th January; it was not after 11th January that he was away for two months—it was not during February and March that he was absent; I swear that without any hesitation—he was not away for three months after January, 1858, not at any period of the year after January—he was away in November and December with my sanction—I knew the dangerous position he was in, and I permitted his absence, but I paid him his 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bookkeeper in the prosecutor's service—I remember Selwood being dismissed; shortly after that I discovered in the Government permit book something about brandy, sent to a person named Austin; the prisoner was not there, but I afterwards called his attention to the entry in the trade books—he first spoke about it—he said to me, that I had not charged his private account with any brandy—I said, "What brandy?"—he said, "the brandy that went to Mr. Austin"—I said that there was no brandy in the books—I had not found a trace of the brand sent to Mr. Austin in the government permit book before this; this was about a week after the conversation—Mr. Jones and I went through the permit book, and found an entry of some brandy to Mr. Austin—I did not know all about it at that time—the conversation that I am speaking of with Lambe was previous to that; I am sure that at the time I went through the books I knew nothing about that brandy; that might be three or four days or a week before Lambe spoke to me—I believe that my going through the book with Mr. Jones, and coming upon an entry of Austin's brandy, was after I had the conversation with Lambe which I have just mentioned—I believe I told Mr. Jones that Mr. Lambe had spoken to me about it, I won't be sure—I do not remember being directed to enter it by Lambe—when I say there was no entry in the books, I mean the order book and the delivery book—I discovered that there was no entry in them—when we found the entry in the permit book, we looked in the delivery book to see if there was any entry, and there was none at all; they were all posted up; and, had it been entered, it must have come into the ledger—I said in that conversa<lb/>tion that there was no entry in the books; I looked through them twice—when Mr. Lambe spoke to me about the matter, I believe I asked him whe<lb/>ther he had sent any bill to Mr. Austin—the solicitor has taken my evidence down in writing—when the prisoner asked me whether I had sent any bill to Mr. Austin, I said, "No;" it was Lambe that asked me, and he said, "Don't do it"—I do not think he said anything then about Mr. Jones—he did say, "Has Mr. Jones told you to send it;" and I said, "The bill is to go"—he told me that in the event of Mr. Jones telling me to send the bill, that I was not to do it—I gave my evidence to this gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Humphreys</hi>) I remember making up the accounts at Christmas—Selwood was dismissed before Lambe was taken in custody, perhaps three weeks before; I should think it was about the middle of January—this is Mr. Lambe's writing (<hi rend="italic">Looking at some printed bill-heads, filed up in writing, headed, "Bought of John Jones"; and signed, "Received A.

               <p>brandy for Mr. Austin"—I had before that known nothing of Mr. Austin—I think it was after Lambe asked me this that I and Mr. Jones looked over the government permit book and found the entry; that brandy to Mr. Austin was not charged afterwards in a private account to Mr. Lambe—I did not hear Mr. Lambe remonstrate about this being in the delivery cash-book until after Selwood left; he said it was impossible to avoid mistakes without a daily cash-book, but I suggested it first; that was after Selwood's dismissal—he asked me whether I had sent an account to Mr. Austin, and told me not to do it—he did not say that it was a private transaction between himself and Mr. Austin; he gave no reason—he did not tell me that he had sent an account—there were printed receipts to be signed, "For Mr. Jones"—Lambe did not always refuse to sign them, that I am aware of—here is a dozen of pale sherry, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., signed for by Mr. Lambe, which shows that he received the money—any other clerk would not have signed his name there; he would have signed it on a printed receipt—I do not know Mr. Such; I do not remember seeing him (<hi rend="italic">Looking at him</hi>)—I am the person to whom the mistake occurred about the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being entered to him as salary—Mr. Jones never spoke to him about it—Mr. Lambe struck out the word "Salary," and I believe that was the only time it was entered—Mr. Jones walked in and heard part of it—I never heard Mr. Lambe com<lb/>plain that Mr. Jones mixed up his own private banking accounts with the accounts of the business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a picture-frame dealer carrying on business in Essex-street—the prisoner Stanley Selway had been in my service as errand-boy for three weeks, and was under notice to quit the following Saturday—on Tuesday, 19th April, about half-past 9 o'clock, Mrs. Dear had gone out—I have been paralyzed for three years, and cannot move without assistance—my servant had placed me in the shop near the counter—Stanley was in the shop gazing out of the window, and to occupy him I gave him some bank board to cut—he would not do it the way I wanted, and I told him that if he did not, he would cut his fingers, or break the boards—at that time I heard a whistle, and Stanley turned round to the window and laughed—it was a sort of signal which boys give to each other—Stanley broke the board in half—I told him to get the portfolio—I then told him to go in and poke the fire, as I must go and lie down—he came back and said that there was a good fire—while I was looking over the engravings, I saw William Selway who I knew by sight, pass the window; and immediately after that I heard another whistle, and Stanley turned round to the window and laughed as usual—I had to call his attention to the prints, as he was putting them in cross ways—he then intimated that he was going over to the urinal—he went out and stayed about seven minutes—about ten minutes after he went out I heard a third whistle—I remained in the shop till he came back—I the servant Ann Tanner came to see about the fire, and I directed her to take me into the parlour and lay me down—she gave me my medicine and left me sitting on the end of the sofa—I did not lie down—while I was sitting on the sofa I beard somebody coming into the shop, but could not</p>

               <p>see them; and to my surprise, the two boys, Stanley and Wynne, stood at the end of the sofa, without any invitation to come in—I was rather taken back at the sight of Wynne, bat made no remark—I did not wish to wound his feelings, but did not like his appearance—he was pale and cada<lb/>verous, and not respectably attired—Stanley said, "Here is a boy come after the place."—I asked Wynne what he had been doing—he said that he had been in the book trade—I told him that that would be no benefit to me if he did not understand engravings, and asked him how long he had left his situation—I directed Stanley to go from me twice, as I did not wish him to hear our conversation—Wynne made one step towards me as if to listen to what I was saying, and at that moment Stanley passed behind him, forced open the cupboard, took the cash-box, and turned round—at that moment I stooped forward and saw Wynne's hand with something black in it—I cannot say whether it was this (<hi rend="italic">a short crowbar</hi>); and I received a blow on the head, and cried, "Murder!"—a second blow was given, but his hand and wrist only struck me, and I heard something fall out of the back of his hand—I shouted "Murder!" again, and he put his hand across my mouth—the servant girl opened the door, and I found my<lb/>self about six yards from the sofa, lying on the floor of the shop—this is the cash-box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw the money in it counted afterwards, and there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was nearly 12 o'clock when the blow was struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, of Wych-street—I saw Stanley running, and Skidmore pursuing him—I went to see what was the matter, and after he was secured, I saw Samuel attempting to take something from under Stanley's coat—I seized him by the collar, and threw him out of the way—he recovered himself, came up to me in a sparring position, and said, "I will punch your b—y nose; what have you to do with it?"—I said, "If there is a policeman handy, you will find what I have to do with it; what have you to do with it?" he said, "My brother" or something to that effect, and then I let him go—I followed the crowd to the prosecutor's house—there was a great number of people in the lobby or entrance to the shop; it was full of boys—I said, "Get away, boys; you have no business here"—Samuel was then forcing his way through the crowd—I seized him by the collar, and said, "Here, if you are his brother, you know something about it"—I tapped at the door, they opened it, and I shoved him in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Saint Anne's-place, Limehouse, in the parish of Saint Anne's—early on the morning of 13th April, or after mid<lb/>night, I went over my house and locked it up—I particularly marked some shutters in the front window looking into the street—I went to bed, and about 4 o'clock I was called up—I looked at the same shutters, and observed that they must have been drawn open—the screw had been drawn—the bolt from the bottom was gone—the two hand-screws were drawn very much, and by forcing those bolts any one could have got in—I did not miss anything till the policeman awoke me, when he showed me this workbox, and asked me if it was mine—it contained a pair of ear-rings—this apron is mine—I had seen them safe at 12 o'clock at night, when I went to bed—I had to move the box to fasten the shutters.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you put the light out before you went to bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the window bad no fastening—I fastened the shutters—I did not sleep in that room—I never heard the policeman say that he was going to look for his mate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could the window have been opened from the outside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but it would take a great deal of trouble, because the sash-cords were broken—the shutters could easily have been forced from the outside—the sash-lines were broken previous to this, so as to make it difficult to raise the window—I was sleeping up stairs, and I heard no noise whatever until the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman, K</hi> 4). About 1 o'clock, on the morn<lb/>ing of 13th April, I was in the Commercial-road, near Saint Anne's-street, Limehouse—I met the prisoner there.—he asked me to direct him to a coffee shop—I did so—that was about a hundred yards or more from the pro<lb/>secutor's house—I saw the prisoner after this several times walking to and fro in the Commercial-road, near Saint Anne's-street—just before 4 I saw him turn into Saint Anne's-street—I saw that the prosecutor's shutters were open—I heard a noise as of a window being shut, and I saw the prisoner coming towards me—I was standing at the top of the street—I said to him "What have you got under your coat?" he said, "Nothing"—I then took hold of his coat, turned it back, and I found there this work-box—it was locked—I took him down Saint Anne's-street; and, when I got to the house, I said, "How did you become possessed of this box?" he said, "That is where I got it," pointing to where the shutters were open—I then rapped at the door—after a few minutes the prosecutor came down—I examined the shutters, and found the middle bolt drawn, and two screws drawn at each side—it appeared to me that whoever got hold of the shutters must have pulled them from underneath, at the bottom.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Is not this a house of ill-fame? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is—I gave the box to the prosecutor's wife, while I went to fetch my mate—I do not think I, was away more than two or three minutes—I took the box, part of the way to the station-house, and the prosecutor's wife carried it the other part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I am a seafaring man—I had a drop of liquor, and separated from my shipmates—I was looking for a coffee-house, and passed this house—the shutters were open, and the window—I saw the box, took it up, and stayed by the house—the policeman took me, knocked the people up, went away to find his mate, and then took me into custody—I have been eleven years in and out of the port of London.</p>

                  </hi>. I now come out of the gaol of New-gate—I pleaded guilty at the last session to indictments for forgery—I first became acquainted with Wagner in May or, June, 1857—I was then in poor circumstances—I wanted to borrow some money—my first introduc<lb/>tion to Wagner was for the purpose of discounting a bill—I know a man named Kerp—No. 10, York-buildings, Adelphi, was taken as an office—Wagner took the house—Bateman joined him about July or August last year—the name of "Bateman and Co." was on a plate on the door, and "Bateman and Co., Law, Parliamentary, and General Stationers" in the win<lb/>dows of the front room, with the word Agents" at the bottom—Bateman married Wagner's wife's sister—Kerp lived at Mrs. Skelton's, in John-street, Fitzroy-square—I hare repeatedly been there with Wagner—I don't recollect Bateman ever going with me or Wagner—I have not seen him there—I have been with Wagner for the purpose of getting certain docu<lb/>ments from Kerp, and on one occasion for the purpose of taking certain papers out of a slop-pail, which had a false bottom that unscrewed, and where papers were kept for the purposes of forgery—an arrangement was also made for concealing papers, at York-buildings, in the rolling-pin—I know this 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that was the proceeds of the forgery of Mr. Aitkin's cheque for 375<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Wagner gave that note to me to take to the Bank of England for the purpose of getting changed—I went into the bank, and came out without changing it, and gave it to Wagner—he then gave it to Bateman, who went in and procured the change—he got some gold and a certain number of notes, which Wagner gave to me, and I changed them at Spielman's—I got there a 1,000 franc note—I gave it to Wagner, and he gave it to Bateman, who went with it to Smart's—I re<lb/>member his coming back from Smart's and saying he had a cheque from Mr. Smart for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Bateman took a copy of this cheque on tracing paper, and then he took the real cheque to Drummonds' and procured the money for it—Wagner procured from Humphreys a blank form of cheque on Drummonds—it had no stamp on it; and a conversation took place between Wagner, myself, and Bateman, as to how the stamp was to be accomplished; and Humphreys was to be applied to for the pur<lb/>pose of making a die—I believe Humphreys promised to do it speedily—Home delay took place, and Wagner, not liking it to remain any longer, it was arranged that Bateman and myself should try if we could make a die—Bateman commenced by purchasing some plaster of Paris, and it was at last accomplished—the plaster one was afterwards broken up, and one was made in metal, and with that we impressed the stamp upon the blank cheque that was brought by Humphreys—that blank cheque was then filled</p>

               <p>up by Bateman, in my presence, for the sum of 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Bateman said that Jones, a friend of his, knew a man of the name of Bramwell who would present the cheque—he said that Bramwell was taking care of an empty house in the neighbourhood of Soho—Jones went to consult Bramwell, and came back and told Wagner, Bateman, and myself the nature of the correspondence he had had with him—it appeared that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be left as a deposit by whoever took the house; and if somebody would come to the house and pretend to pay the money, and protect him, by writing letters to that effect, he would present the cheque—that was the arrangement made in the presence of Bateman, myself, and Wagner—these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were written by Bateman—I posted one of them I believe—it was arranged that the cheque should be presented on 21st January—it is dated the 20th—Jones went to Bramwell to ascertain whether the two letters had arrived safely, and came and reported that they had, and in the evening of the 20th the cheque was given to Jones for the purpose of giving to Bramwell—it was not inclosed in the letter—(<hi rend="italic">The two letters were here ready as in the former case</hi>)—On the following morning I went to York-buildings—Wagner and Bateman were both out—they came in about 12 o'clock, I think—Jones had been in just before—Jones told me in Wagner and Bateman's presence that there had been some mistake at the banker's, the money had not been paid; and that a clerk had gone with Bramwell up to his house—Wagner, Bateman, and I consulted, and Wagner came to the conclusion that it was a falsehood of Jones's, that the money had been received, and that Jones and Bramwell had got it, and had cheated them—Wagner suggested that Bateman and himself should go to the house, and they left for the purpose of seeing whether there was an officer there or not—they returned in about two hours, and Bateman then told me that he had been over the house, and he had seen a man he pre<lb/>sumed to be an officer, who was smoking a pipe; and he laughed, and said, "Well, officer or not, I have lighted my cigar from his pipe"—he was smoking at the time—I know a female named Fairbairn—I don't recollect whether she went out that morning with Bateman—Wagner and Bateman left together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bateman. Q.</hi> You perfectly understand the nature of an oath? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I presume I do—I have sworn that I acted as clerk at your place—I had a commission upon every business that was done there; that was the under<lb/>standing that Wagner made with me, before you came from Holyhead, that you should start a law-stationery business; and upon my having a commis<lb/>sion upon all business done there, I was to act as clerk, and carry on my own business as well as a money agent and commission agent—from October I was there regularly daily, from morning till evening—the business carried on was principally money agency; discounting bills was the principal, except a little law stationery that you did—it was a general money agency; discounting bills, and raising money on different loans—I did all the money agency business in general; you also attended to it, certainly; the law sta<lb/>tionery part was your own business, but there was very little of that carried on—your time was employed in legitimate business—you did the out-door work; I did the in-door—there was enough legitimate business for us both at times—I don't think I received a great deal as my share of the legitimate business; a good deal of time was occupied in attempts to carry out busi<lb/>ness that was not done—I don't think my commission, from the time I joined in October, amounted to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the outside; decidedly not more—have on a pair of plaid trousers which I had of you; and I bought a coat</p>

               <p>of you which I have not paid you for; I had those clothes because they were two small for you, and they happened to fit me; I bought the coat of you only a few days before I was taken, or you would have been paid for it, no doubt—I believe I had quite as good a suit of my own; of course I had it to look respectable in—the first time I saw you was a very few weeks after Mrs. Wagner's death, which was last May—I saw you in York-build<lb/>ings in the early part of June—you were repeatedly up from Holyhead—I was not first introduced to you concerning a loan which Mr. Gilbert was negociating for—I introduced such a matter to you; I believe I answered an advertisement—I don't think that was the first occasion upon which we had a conversation—I had a conversation with Wagner and you together as to what you were about to do presently, in York-buildings soon after it was arranged that you and I were to commence operations together, I did what I have been in the habit of doing, answered advertisements in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> of persons asking for money—Mr. Gilbert advertised for a loan, in some initial; I gave you the letter, and you carried it on I believe, for him—I believe that was our first transaction—you and Wagner gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—I don't know what you realised; you told me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What has been your occupation for the last five or six years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since I left Bury-street, St. James's, I have carried on, as you are aware, a money-agency business solely—this is the first time the police have had me in custody; I swear that positively—I have been engaged in transactions in hops with a gentleman in the Borough, named Jones; that is within the last two years—I have known Mr. Jones five or six years—that was partly money-agency business—that was not the Mr. Jones I have been speaking of—I swear that I took part in the manufacture of a die, or stamp, in York-buildings; it was with you in the front kitchen; you and Wagner were down there with your coats off, and your shirt sleeves turned up, manufac<lb/>turing this die; you had left me in the front office; and after you had been there about three hours, I went to see what you were about, and you were in the act of holding a ladle on the fire, with melted metal in it—you had made two or three impressions, and were in the act of making another; you had not succeeded in getting an even surface, and I suggested some improve<lb/>ment; you acted on my suggestion, and an even surface was obtained, and I remained and assisted in carrying it out—I merely suggested an improve<lb/>ment upon the plan that you and Wagner were carrying out—I could not identify the 1000 franc note of which I have spoken; I did not see you change it, or see Mr. Smart pay you a cheque—I believe I can imitate handwriting very well, as I have proved—I never tried to imitate yours; I dare say I could—I believe I could copy anybody's handwriting—I swear that I have never attempted to imitate yours in any cheque—I dare say I could make copies like the two letters that I say are in your handwriting, if I were to try—I have written answers to advertisements connected with forgery, in my own handwriting; not in a disguised hand—I have written letters in connexion with forgeries that I have had to do with with Wagner; in answering those I do not know that I have particularly tried to disguise my writing; I had no particular reason for so doing; I might or I might not—I don't consider it a forgery to answer advertisements; it was relating to forgery, with yourself and Wagner—you perfectly well know the nature of the transaction—when it was decided upon committing any forgery, and an advertisement was put in, I was the person to answer the advertise<lb/>ments, and to write them—I have written letters in connexion with forgeries with yourself and Wagner; I never had anything to do with forgery until</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090132"/>
               <p>I knew Wagner—I have decidedly written letters in connexion with your forgeries; forgeries that I have been connected with with you and Wagner—perhaps I have attempted to disguise my hand; I don't know that I have, particularly—I have committed no forgeries, except that one of Mr. Chambers,—you know, as well as I do, that I have been connected with forgeries—since 1857 I have written letters of the description I have named; I should say there have been from fifteen to twenty forgeries committed, and possibly I have written as many letters, in connexion with forgeries that I have been connected with with you and Wagner; all of which have taken place since 1857—I wrote to a Dr. Jones, of Albany-street, Regent's-park—you know the object of my writing; I wrote for the purpose of ascertaining whether he would become surety for Mr. Croker; I had no other object at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever obtain any signatures from persons by writing to them, for the purpose of committing forgeries upon them afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe there have been several suggestions of that sort—I had the correspondence in York-buildings; consequently I wrote all the letters, with the sanction of yourself and Wagner—I have written letters for the purpose of getting the signatures of gentlemen, with the intention of committing a forgery upon them afterwards—I am forty-eight years of age; you told me you were twenty-six—I say I have written several letters of that description, with the know<lb/>ledge and consent of yourself and Wagner—I forged a cheque of Mr. Chambers for 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I wrote it myself—I never forged any other document besides a cheque—not a bill of exchange, or anything of that kind—I have knowingly sent a person to a bankers with a forged cheque; you know I have done so; I have done so in the business at York-buildings, certainly; all the business in which I have been engaged connected with forgeries has been with your<lb/>self and Wagner—possibly I may have sent half a dozen persons to the bankers with forged cheques; when I say I, I include you—sometimes the money was obtained, sometimes not—the proceeds of the forgeries that were successful came through your fingers or Wagner's; they came into my hands in the shape of bank notes—sometimes I have changed those notes into gold; I think you are better able than I to judge how often—possibly I have done it three or four times; I should think I have been to the Bank of England three or four times to do it, and I have been with you to the money changers in the city—perhaps to four or five money changers, or possibly to half-a-dozen—you can put it down, in round numbers, a dozen times, if you like; we have been both together in changing those notes—I did not write my own name of Chandler upon them—those notes were given to me in York-buildings by you and Wagner, and in your presence and his I have sat down at the table in the back-room, and opened the Law List carelessly, and the first name I have hit upon I have put on the back of the notes in your presence—I have written many names on the backs of notes; you are aware of that—I had done so frequently with Wagner, before I became acquainted with you, while you were at Holyhead—I once took apartments in Beaumont-street, High-street, in the early part of 1858, I think; I hardly know in what month—I cannot recollect in what name—it was Wagner's suggestion that I should take apartments there, for the purpose of sending a man from that house with a forged cheque—the forgery was committed then by Kerp—from 1857, there have been con<lb/>stantly things of that sort done, before I knew you—I took the apartments for the purpose of carrying out a forgery that had been committed—I did not frequent Doctor's Commons whilst living there—the arrangement with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090133"/>
               <p>Wagner in taking those apartments was, that Wagner was to send a ticket-porter to me, at that house in Beaumont-street, with a letter, in which there should he a forged cheque, and I was to send the ticket-porter with the forged cheque to the bankers—I did send it—I did not pretend that I had received it from Dr. Lushington—I believe the man that gave the letter to the ticket-porter in Doctor's Commons told him that it was from Dr. Lush<lb/>ington; and the man came to me as if he had brought the letter from Dr. Lushington—Wagner told me he had arranged it in that manner; that the porter was to fancy he brought it from Dr. Lushington, and he would the more readily go with the cheque—we were not successful in that forgery—I don't thing you knew me then; I don't think you were in London at the time—you had nothing to do with that—that forgery was upon the branch Bank of England, in Saville-row—I believe I have been concerned with Wagner in two other forgeries on the same bank—I think one was a cheque for 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I won't swear positively that those were the amounts, but somewhere about that—you had nothing to do with those—I never lived in Manchester-street, or the neighbourhood of Man<lb/>chester-square—I never took apartments there—I put the name of "White-head, Manchester-street, Manchester-square" on the back of a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which had been obtained through one of Wagner's forgeries that has not been mentioned which I was connected with—I think the amount of that forgery was 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe it was within the last twelve months—it was not since I have known you—I know a jeweller of the name of Hawley; at least, I don't know him personally, I know there is such a man—I never com<lb/>mitted a forgery upon him; I was connected with it—that was the one for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to which I have alluded—I know Mr. Lewin, of Southampton-street—I never forged upon him—I gave Wagner some information with regard to Mr. Lewin; and Wagner, without my knowledge, committed a forgery, and sent it to the bank—I knew nothing at all about it until it was all over—I know that Wagner committed it, simply by his coming to my house at Battersea, and telling me that the thing had been done; that the money had been obtained, but that the man, in going to the Bank of England, had foolishly lost the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I supplied the information upon that forgery—of course it was understood between Wagner and myself that I was to have part of everything I had to do with—I don't recollect the date of that, I dare say Mr. Mullens knows—it is within the last two years; before I knew you—I had an uncle of the name of Whitehead—I was in his employ for eleven years—I left him in 1840—he had property nearly all over London—he had some low houses in a court at Westminster, that you have heard me speak about—I collected all his rents at the time I was with him—a man swindled him out of the rent of those houses, and out of the houses themselves, and pulled them down, and sold the materials—it is twenty years ago—my uncle built the houses up again—I was not concerned in that transaction in any shape—my uncle used to bank with Cocks and Biddulph—he banked there these forty years—I did not, while in his employ, forge, or attempt to forge, upon him—there was one attempt; some man committed a forgery upon him for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and got the money—that was before I went to my uncle; in fact, it must have been when I was a boy, not fifteen—since I left him, I have been concerned, with you, in attempt<lb/>ing to forge upon him—you recollect the amount better than I do—the cheque was written in your office—I believe it was for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cheque was taken out of your book for the purpose—I have never heard that my uncle has bought up one or more forged Bank of England notes, that it was stated I</p>

               <p>Conduit street, and it was to have been done—Wagner and I had a quarrel about it—Wagner fancied that he was entitled to more than he ought to have had, and he went to this friend of mine in Conduit-street, and pre<lb/>vented the bill being done; and the bill was then given back to Captain Cockburn, by my friend in Conduit-street, by my consent—I never kept or dishonestly appropriated the proceeds of a bill of exchange—I have kept my commission upon all bills that I have had to do with—I never kept the whole amount—I never stole a watch while I was in the House of Detention, in the name of William Chambers—I was called down in mistake for a George Chambers who was there for stealing a watch—I mentioned that fact to Miss Fairbairn, and, I suppose, she conveyed the information to Wagner, which enables you to ask me the question—I know a man named Morton—I never stole a watch from Mrs. Morton while Morton was in custody—I swear that—I never obtained goods by false pretences, and never was concerned in doing so with Van Gelder, Wagner, or anybody—I have a wife and seven children—I never communicated to my wife the fact that I had been committing forgeries; she never knew anything at all about it; most distinctly not—I know that Funnell, the officer, has stated, that when I was apprehended I said to my wife, "These men are taking me into cus<lb/>tody for forgery," and that my wife then said, "I thought you had left off forgery;" instead of which, what she said was, "Surely you are not in cus<lb/>tody for forgery"—Funnell has made a mistake, I don't suppose he meant it—one of my children is a little lame; he is 16—he is apprenticed to a wood-engraver—he has hardly had time to be clever yet; he has only been a few months at it—he is clever for the time he has been at it—I swear most distinctly that I never employed that son in the attempt to engrave or sink a die or stamp; but allow me to explain; you drew on a piece of wood a penny stamp, and hearing that my son was an engraver you said, "I think you might get your son to engrave this," and at the request of Wagner and yourself I consented to ask him to do it, but upon reflection I did not ask him—I put the thing in my pocket, and put it behind the fire—it is a great consideration with me to be restored to my wife and family—I have given my evidence both in the hope to receive a mitigation of my sentence, and from a motive of justice, and for the reason I explained yes<lb/>terday, that I understood from Miss Fairbairn, at least, from a conversation I had with her, I felt convinced that Wagner was going to turn evidence against me, if he could, and I made up my mind to turn evidence against him—I am not aware of one penny having been given to any member of my family by any person connected with this prosecution; neither do I believe a penny has been given—I have not stated to my fellow prisoners in the gaol that I expected to get twelve months, and afterwards to be set up in business—Mr. Humphreys appeared for me at my examination at the police-court—I instructed him to tell the magistrate that I had a satisfac<lb/>tory answer to make to every charge that might be brought against me—since my apprehension I have never sent messages to you demanding money—I have haft messages from you, at the House of Detention, brought by Miss Fairbairn—I saw you when you came back from Drummond's, and you said you had got the money for the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque; I saw you start from York-buildings with the cheque, and I remained there till you came back—I did not see you enter Drummond's bank, nor did I see you go to Mr. Smart's.</p>

In a noble house like this, not envied is a fool's condition; for, when he gets cured of disease, he dies of inanition". "Lunatic doctors of lunacy—the lawyer's slaves"—What is a comet? the answer is in Psalm 115, verse 16, 'The working man's stumbling block'"—and a great many other things, which I believe to be his writing—I can't say whether he had a Bible there.</p>

Arachtingi and Co.—I am the V. and my cousin was the F.—he is out of it now, but I carry on the same firm—the Co. are several who are interested; they are abroad; they are a great many foreigners, and I do not know them—I have no partner now—Glyn's became my bankers in June or July last; the money the prisoner is charged with stealing ought to have been paid into Glyn's—I believe Glyn's were under large advances at that time, about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not go to them to ascertain whether the money had been paid in; they sent to me because I drew two checks, and they told me the money was not provided for them—I staled that I had sent 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the prisoner—they did not insist on my seeing their attorney, but I have employed him; I went by their desire to Mr. Mullens—this is where the prisoner debited himself with the salary, where the crosses are—it is down as Woolff's salary—I always knew the prisoner in the name of Woolff, Joseph Adolphus Woolff Zalmanowicz—at the merchant's house in Liverpool, he went by the name of Woolff—I knew when he came to London that his name was Zalmanowicz; this "Woolff" represents him—I had a clerk before the pri<lb/>soner, but I dismissed him; the prisoner used to draw bills on me, not as Zalmanowicz; he served me in the name of Woolff, and drew on me in the name of Zalmanowicz; he represents himself in these drafts to be living at Constantinople, and I accepted these drafts purporting to come from Con<lb/>stantinople, but drawn by my servant in my own office—I circulated them through Glyn's and other bankers; there was nothing false—I have been in business six months—I have not discounted in London on bills of this cha<lb/>racter to the amount of nearly 400,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor had my name on them—I have discounted at Glyn's altogether about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on these bills, drawn on me by my servant, accepted by me, and purporting to come from Con<lb/>stantinople; in addition to that, I had the bills printed with "Constantinople" in printed letters—they were printed in London, manufactured in London, and purporting to come from Constantinople—I consider that perfectly, legal.</p>

               <p>behind—in addition to this business, he represented himself still to be in Constantinople, drawing on other houses—of course, these bills have been paid; they have been taken up; both have been paid—they are in the hands of Overend and Gurney; but they are not my acceptances; they are only endorsed by me—they are drawn on Reggio, by the prisoner, in the name of Zalmanowicz, and purporting to come from Constantinople; they were endorsed by me, knowing perfectly well that it was all a falsehood; that the prisoner did not live at Constantinople, and that he was my own servant at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week—they are perfectly good bills—I do not know whether they are mercantile or not—I did not order him to draw on John Auriol Lever, to the amount of 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from first to last, with a fictitious name and address—I have given him no directions to draw on Lever; I know, perhaps, that he has done it—I have not received a commission of one per cent on it; he has received it himself, not me—I knew that he was receiving a commission in some cases—I knew that he was receiving the commission on bills which he drew on different houses, and in some I did not—I received no commission, only in my business, not in his—I had no commission whatever—a large amount of bills of this description were not done for me with Lascaridi and Co.; none whatever that I endorsed, drawn by the prisoner—I might have had 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of different people—I have never, in drawing, represented myself to be of Hull—I have not passed bills from Hull drawn by the prisoner—I never had a man named Geran, engaged in this way, in my employment; he is in Smyrna—I mean to say, that there were not the same kind of transac<lb/>tions with me and Geran as with the prisoner—I did not pension Geran off—I promised the prisoner that he should go to Constantinople, and be started in a firm there—he was not constantly applying to me to go to Constanti<lb/>nople; he was to go as soon as I could—he came into my employment by calling upon me—I did not mention Geran to him—it was arranged that bills should be drawn, signed sometimes by Woolff and sometimes by Zal<lb/>manowicz, as soon as I had made up my mind to send him to Constanti<lb/>nople—I cannot tell you the exact date when I and he first came to this agreement; it was not directly he came into my employment; it may have been three or four months after—I did not tell him that Geran had done the same thing—I proposed it—as I was sending him to Constantinople as my agent, I requested him to draw some bills, which he did—I cannot tell you the exact amount, but perhaps 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never told him what I should do with the bills drawn on bill-heads from Constantinople—I used them, of course, and I suppose he did know what I did with them—I made no arrangement whatever with him—I requested him to draw them—the consideration for it was, that he was to go out to Constantinople as my agent, for which he would get 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—in the meanwhile he was to subsist on 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a suit of clothes now and then—there were cases in which the prisoner drew on other houses, which I endorsed and got dis<lb/>counted, and upon which I got a commission—it was not so with Lascaridi and Co.—I know nothing about a system of exchanging bills with them—I know nothing of Jackson and Co.—I know Baker, Adam, and Co.; John, James, and Charles Gentill—I do not know Stephens and Sons—I have done business with most of those, with bills drawn by the prisoner—I have not in all cases obtained a commission; I have in one or two, perhaps—when he first came, the arrangement was that I should send him to Hull—I had a great quantity of calls, and I said whichever suited me better, Hull or Newcastle—he was not Woolff and Co. of Hull—there were no drafts from Hull that I discounted or endorsed—I may have seen some</p>

               <p>bills of Woolff and Co. of Hull, I had nothing to do with them—I do not know Woolff and Co., I only know Woolff—I know of one instance only in which the prisoner was represented as Woolff of Hull, and then I had nothing to do with the matter—I kept him afterwards, and did not part with him—I know a great many Theodori and Co.'s, of Constantinople; there is no correspondent of mine of that name.</p>

Mr. Edgil; I have no doubt that was deducted from his allowance—the prisoner was also debited in that settlement which he had received from a Mr. Grosvenor, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; which he had received from Mr. Chittenden, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; from a Mr. Black, for a bottle of sherry, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; for another bottle of sherry, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making altogether 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have no entry of these in a book, merely on a slip of paper; it was by his statement 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about them that this debiting took place—he admitted them afterwards; he never denied them—I remember the name of Mr. Edmunds, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I remember Mr. Lambe and I having a dispute as to whether I had received that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I remember that that; settlement was subsequently disposed of; that I should supply the deficiency, and I should pay half, and he pay half—Mr. Lambe complained of the want of the rough daily cash-book, and said if that had been kept according to his advice, that these mistakes would not occur; we have frequently had discussions about mistakes discovered, and rectified by me as well as by him—on 14th January, 1859, there was 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which had not been drawn; on that occasion he desired me to debit him with a sovereign that had been handed to him on account of the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not deducted, it was left open; it was not settled then—I gave him a check for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not know at that time that these sums had been received by Lambe—I did not hear it from Robinson before the 14th, or before the bills came in; he did not call my attention to it before the 20th January—Robin<lb/>son finished making out the accounts about 15th January—it was de<lb/>cidedly after the 25th December—I was looking over the accounts while Robinson was making them out—I posted every one of them; my attention was called to all these, Hamper, Smith, and Yarrow; it was not at that time that Selwood made a communication to me—I do not remember when it was that Robinson told me that Mr. Lambe had made him acquainted with the facts—I will swear I do not remember—he did not say, when he made this communication, "Mr. Lambe told me of this weeks ago"—he said that Mr. Lambe had told him he had received the money, and told him to put his initials to it—I do not remember when this was—I have seen this memorandum since; it was in the book-keeper's possession—I cannot say when this was shewn to me—it was late in January or early in February—we commenced taking stock on 20th December; the stock was left unpaid for the express purpose of allowing Robinson to make out the accounts—he first showed me this document at the end of January, when all the accounts</p>

               <p>had been sent in—I did not strike the accounts out—this it a summary of the bills; this is the paper that was made use of in the month of January—notwithstanding Robinson's telling me that the money had been received by Lambe, I told him to send in the accounts—I was not certain as to dates—I myself put my initials to Yarrow, Smith, and Hamper's accounts, for a special reason, after I had seen Mr. Lambe's initials to the amounts—I sent the bills to them, although Lambe had received the money—I have the day-book here—it has been produced—this, "Mr. Sydney Smith, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." is in Mr. Lambe's writing—that is an indication that he received that from Mr. S. Smith—I should say that meant Mr. Sydney Smith—that indicates that the money has been paid—I have a book which I call my private diary—I have entries in it in respect to Smith, Hamper, and Yarrow, in my writing—the entries were made on 18th January—at the time I made the settlement with Mr. Lambe, in the month of January, I had this book open—this entry about the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not there at the time—this is my own private memorandum book—the money that I say he received was two fives and two ones, which makes 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not know from Selwood that he had made up the accounts which were given him by Mr. Lambe—Selwood did not tell me that these three amounts had been paid to Mr. Lambe—I have not settled accounts with Selwood of money which Lambe has received—when I have been settling accounts, I have not said Mr. Lambe has received so much—I heard Selwood say, in Lambe's presence, that he had been an old servant—that was about the 5th or 6th of January—I thought at first, that Selwood was in fault about the money, but I found that although he had sent the receipt, Lambe had had the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Sarah Tighe; a pawnbroker, of Deptford Broadway—about 1 o'clock on 25th March, Joseph Lee came and offered to pledge an Albert chain; he asked 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it; I asked him if it was gold; he said that it was, and that he bought it in Oxford-street, and gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and could if necessary produce the invoice—I tested it, and told him it was brass; he made no reply—I sent out for a policeman, but before he arrived the inspector brought Oscar into the shop, who said, "Oh, it is my brother, we are dealers, you can do nothing with us; they are 9</p>

I am a lodger at 27, Green-walk, Holland-street, Black-friars-road—on the Saturday night that this fire happened, I came home a little before 12—it was at the beginning of April, I don't recollect the day of the month—I live in the first floor back room with my wife—a person named Ansell lives in the front room—Ansell's wife was at home when I came home—he came in shortly afterwards—we had supper together, and then went to our respective rooms to bed—there were two other lodgers on the ground floor; a man named Town and his wife—at the time I came in they had been asleep two hours—after I had been in bed some time, I heard somebody open the street-door, and go through the passage, and then heard the sound of a match, and I said to my wife, "There is somebody downstairs"—they then appeared to go out again, and close the door—about two minutes after the door closed I jumped out of bed, looked out of my window, and saw a light—I alarmed Ansell and his wife, and the others, by calling out "Fire!"—I then ran upstairs for my wife to come down, and then I went downstairs into the back kitchen, and saw a pile of things a-light close to a screen that goes in front of the fire to keep the draught away—they were away from the fire—the screen was alongside of them—there was no fire in the grate—the screen was on fire, and the clothes were in a blaze—Ansell took the kettle off the hob and put the fire out—Mrs. Waldron was in the front parlour while we were putting the fire out—she sleeps in the front parlour—I did not see anything of the prisoner till my wife let her in, and she came into the back kitchen—when she came in she asked where her husband Frank was—Mrs. Waldron was not out of her room, I think at that time—the prisoner spoke to her at the door—the door of Mrs. Waldron's room opens close to the street-door—she opened her door, and said to the prisoner, "You know where he is"—the prisoner then said, "What is the matter?" my wife said, "You know what is the matter; you have carried out your threats at last"—the prisoner appealed to Mrs. Town directly, and said, "You know I am innocent"—my wife ran out for a, policeman, and when he came he asked the prisoner whether she had got any way to get into the place—she said, "No"—he asked what she had got in her pocket—she said, "Nothing, only a box of matches"—she was pull<lb/>ing</p>

               <p>from our window—I got up, and the alarm was given—we went downstairs, and Mr. and Mrs. Ansell also—my husband went down first—he said the kitchen was in flames, and made the alarm, and told me to come down—I put my boots on, and went down as I was—as I got downstairs there was a rap at the street-door—my husband was in the kitchen at that time—I went to the door and let in the prisoner—she said, "Good God! What is the matter?"—I said, "You know what is the matter," and walked through the passage to the kitchen—she spoke to her mother-in-law, and followed to the door—she asked her mother-in-law if Frank was there—she replied, "He is not here; you know where he is, he is along with you"—the prisoner then said she knew where her husband was; that he had been jumping over a post and fallen and hurt himself, and was taken to the hospital—when I let the prisoner in I saw that she had on a dark dress, a lilac apron, and a drab bonnet; she had no shawl or other covering—I had not been into the kitchen before I opened the door for her—I could not see the blaze without going into the kitchen—I had not seen whether there was a fire in the kitchen or not—I had not seen the blaze from my room—when I went into the kitchen the fire was extinguished—Mr. Ansell was there, not Mrs. Ansell—the prisoner followed me into the kitchen—I fetched the policeman—I did not hear what passed between the prisoner and the policeman—the first time I ever saw the prisoner was a fortnight before the fire in the kitchen, and I then heard a quarrel between her and Mrs. Waldron—she was in the house about three hours; her husband was not in the house at the time—she called the old woman very bad names and said she ought to be dead.</p>

               <p>was standing on the stairs—the stairs are about four feet from the kitchen door; she went there after opening the street-door—I am quite positive that the prisoner had no shawl on when she came in—I can't say the exact number of fires there have been in the house in the last twelve months, but I should say seven or eight—I did not see the prisoner at any of them, except the last—the one that was in my room happened by my child getting his toys from under the bed with a match, and setting fire to the valens round the bed—that is seven or eight months ago; I was not in the house at that time—I was in the house when the fire occurred in Denn's room; I was in the front room; nobody was in Denn's room—the door was shut—I went down to open the door for my boy, and as I came up, I saw the reflec<lb/>tion of the fire underneath the door, and shouted for water—both the Denn's were in my room, and had not been out of it for an hour—there have been several fires, which nobody could account for—I can't say that the prisoner was not in the house; I don't know anything at all about that.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has she been in the habit of coming to the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, frequently—I have heard her quarrelling with Mrs. Waldron on several occasions, I suppose as far back as eight or nine months—I have seen her at the house as many as three times in a fortnight; I have seen her there from one night to another, quarrelling and smashing windows, and using bad language—I have heard her on several occasions say, "So help me God! I will burn the b—house, and the old b—in it"—the last time I heard her say so was about four months ago—I believe all the fires I have spoken of, except the one in my room, have been since I heard her use that express<lb/>sion—there was quarrelling between the prisoner and the old lady on the Saturday fortnight previous to the last fire, and the old lady sat down crying almost all the time; the prisoner called her all the foul names she could, and all the w—s she could lay her tongue to; she said she was a w—with Mr. Butler, an old gentleman who lives in the alms-houses opposite, who was in the kitchen at the time.</p>

DOYLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you in the habit of being very much at home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; only of an evening—I return from my work about six, or a little after—these quarrels have been in the evening—other lodgers have heard this bad language; Mrs. Ansell has heard it, and Mrs. Denn, and all the people that have been called here to-day—I don't think Mrs. Denn lived there at the time the windows were broken; the last time was, I think, about 4 months ago—I have been speaking of 7 or 8 months ago—it ended about 4 months ago to my leaving, but I suppose it has gone on since—I never had occasion to have a bad opinion of the prisoner—I never spoke a word to her till she came there—Mrs. Denn and my wife heard the quarrel on the Saturday fortnight before the last fire—it was on the Monday previous, that I had the little <hi rend="italic">tiff</hi> with the old lady about the noise; those were the only words I ever had—there was a canary bird suffocated in Mrs. Denn's room—I told her she was to blame if she did not make a claim on the In<lb/>surance Company for it—I did not tell her to claim 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I told Mrs. Wal<lb/>dron to claim for what she had lost, because she said people blamed her for setting the place on fire—I told her to claim for both Denn's things and her own, for the fire in the front parlour was the same night at 11 o'clock after Denn's fire—Mrs. Waldron was not in bed when that fire broke out—she was in the kitchen—nobody saw the prisoner in the house then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—on the Saturday night, about 12 o'clock, I was in the kitchen—there was no light or fire there then; no candle or any fire in the grate—there was no bundle of clothes; there</p>

               <p>were some clothes hanging on the line across the kitchen; 2 muslin curtains, and a towel—I had been in the kitchen about 11 o'clock, and then there was a muslin curtain a-light; that was what brought me into the kitchen—I was up stairs in my own room, and I smelt fire and went down to the kitchen and found the muslin curtain at the window on fire—I assisted in putting it out—I am quite certain it was safely put out—Mrs. Waldron had set the candle on the table under the window, and by that means I suppose the curtain might have become alight—at that time the 2 muslin curtains were hanging on the line at the other end of the kitchen—the curtain was quite put out, and water poured all round the window frame—Mrs. Waldron sat in the kitchen about half an hour, quenching the fire out before she went to bed—I did not see her do it; I left her in the kitchen—at 12 o'clock I had occasion to go into the yard, and I looked in the kitchen to see that all was safe as there had been so many fires in the house, and everything was safe then—I went to bed about half past 12—I was disturbed by Denn—my husband went down in his shirt, and assisted in extinguishing the fire—I stopped to get some of my clothes on—I remained up stairs until after the prisoner came in—I have heard the prisoner and Mrs. Waldron quarrelling several times—she has said she would burn the b—house down, and the old b—in it—I have heard her say so several times.</p>

I am the landlady of the house, 29, Green Walk—the prisoner is my daughter-in-law—she has been constantly in the habit of visiting me—I had not seen her for a fortnight before this happened—I have sometimes had quarrels with her; little, slight quarrels—I never had any great quarrels; there was never any quarrel on my side—on the Sun<lb/>day morning I went to bed a little before 12, and soon after I was in bed, as nigh as I could tell about 5 minutes, I heard Mr. Ansell come in—I did</p>

               <p>not hear Mr. Denn come in—I fell asleep after Ansell came in, and after sleeping about half-an-hour or a little more, I heard the word "Fire!"—I can't say which lodger it was from—I got up, and as I came out of my room I saw the prisoner, she said, "What is the matter"—I did not see her come into the house—I did not know she was in the house until she spoke to me—she said, "Where is Frank"—I said I did not know—she said, "He has jumped over a post and broken his nose, and gone to the hospital"—I walked into the kitchen—she came behind me—Ansell and Denn had put the fire out—the prisoner asked me to lend her a shawl—I took her own shawl out of my chair, and said, "Here is your own"—she made no answer—she took it out of my hand—the last time I had been in the kitchen was about a quarter to 12—there was no fire then in the grate, and had not been for some hours—there was no candle burning there when I left it—I had placed a large towel I had been using over the back of the chair, and over that was a line upon which hung two curtains, that was all there was in the kitchen—the chair was close to the dresser opposite the window—there had been a small curtain on fire about 11 o'clock that evening—I put the candle as I thought at a distance from it, but whether in opening the back-door the wind blew the candle or not I don't know, but I believe it was caused in that way—I put it out—I did not leave the candle near any of the things after that.</p>

I live in Phoenix-street, Spitalfields, and am traveller to Mr. Edward Harris, an ale merchant—he is the sole consignee of Mr. Morgan, of Norwich—he is in the habit of selling the ale to customers in different parts of town—Butfoy was his carman—it was his business to carry out the beer and ale, and to collect empty barrels and bring them home—</p>

               <p>Cripps was an occasional man, and he assisted Butfoy to carry out the ale, and to collect the casks—in consequence of information, I went on 19th April to Small's premises, in Short-street, Locke's-fields, Walworth—he carries on the business of a cooper—I went into the yard, and saw Small—I also saw two of our barrels, and three belonging to other brewers—our barrels were branded, "Morgan, Norwich"—the brands had been cut out, but I examined them, and saw the traces of the letters quite sufficiently—they had contained ale which had been brewed in March—I said to Small, "Are these barrels for sale?" he said "Yes"—I said, "What is the price?" he said, "12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. apiece"—I asked if they were all he had—he replied, "Yes"—I asked if he could supply me with a hundred—he inquired in what time I should want them—I said, "Could you let me have a hundred in a week or a fortnight?"—he said no, he could not let me have them in that time, but, if I would guarantee to take a hundred, he would get that number in five or six weeks, and deliver them—I said, "What would the price be, sup<lb/>posing I bought a hundred of them"—he said, "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-piece for that number"—he was very anxious to know who recommended me, and my address—of course I did not satisfy him, but I said I should see him in two or three days—I afterwards saw some other casks, and identified them as Mr. Harris's—I afterwards went to Mr. Dredge's, and saw some barrels there—on the next day after I had been to Small's, I gave instructions to Butfoy to go to three places, and receive empty barrels from each place—when he and Cripps returned, they brought with them three empty barrels and two empty kilderkins—they brought this note, which was given to the cellarman—it is Butfoy's writing, and it has been altered from five to three, and three empty barrels were returned from Mr. Austin—there were none delivered from Mr. Hall—this is the delivery note from Mr. Hall—it shows one to be returned, and that was not returned.</p>

On Wednesday, 20th April, I went with a constable to Small's house—I waited till half-past 1 o'clock on the Thursday morning—Small then came home—I met him and asked him if he had had any barrels brought in lately—he said that he had not within the last two or three weeks, and that all that was in the place belonged to him—I asked him whether it was his place—he said "Yes"—I asked him if he had any brought there on the previous evening, the Wednesday—he said, "Who are you?"—I told him we belonged to the police, and he must consider himself in custody for receiving barrels on the Wednesday and on the previous Saturday, well knowing them to have been stolen—he said those that he had received on the Saturday were brought to him by a man recommended by a Mr. Munnery, in Bath-street, Kingsland-road, and that he had given him seven or eight shillings apiece for them—I asked if they were still in the yard—he said no, they were not; he had taken them away yesterday morning in a cart, to a man named Dredge, who resided near King's-cross, but he could not tell me the street—I took him to the station, and came back and searched the premises—I there found three barrels, branded Morgan, Norwich; one branded R. Thornton; and a kil<lb/>derkin</p>

               <p>with Truman and Co. on it, all which I removed to the station—I then took Small into the station yard, and told him these were the barrels I got from his premises, and I asked him if he remembered anything about them—he pointed to the four barrels, and said he bought them last night, but he had not paid the whole of the money for them—he had paid fourteen shillings on account—he did not say from whom—I went back to his house, and took away three account books and some papers—I searched him, and found some money on him—about half-past 9 o'clock the same morning I went again to the yard; sent a lad to Cripps, who came back with the lad, and was taken in custody—I went on the Saturday to John-street, Pentonville, to Mr. Dredger—I found near thirty barrels; five of them had the brands cut.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cooper, of John-street, Pentonville—I have a store there—on 20th April I bought four casks of Small—there were no brands on them—they were cut out—they were delivered on the 20th—I saw them in Small's cart—I did not see them at his premises—I had bought some on two or three occasions before that—I paid 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the four; that was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—I had bought four on the 15tn at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the brands had been cut out of them also—I had bought three barrels and two kilderkins for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 11th April—the barrels were 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and the kilderkins 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—and on 2d April I had bought sundry old casks and barrels—the names were Cut out of all these—I had been to Small's premises on several occasions—I have not observed any barrels with the name of Morgan oh them—I Was present when the police took away five barrels from my place—they had come from Small's.</p>

On 13th April I went to the shop of Mr. Doughty—Downing came in and had this basket of bristles with him—I asked him if he chose to give me an explanation of how he became possessed of them—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "You must know"—he then said they were given to him by a man who was round at a beer-shop in Swan-street, Borough—I said, "What is his name?"—he said, "I think it is Davey"—I asked him to describe Davey, and another officer went and came back with Davey—I then asked Davey how he became possessed of them?—he said he bought them of a man he knew nothing of—I said, "You must know something of him; show me a bill and receipt of them"—he said he had none—I said, "You must know the man you bought them of"—he said, "I think his name is <hi rend="italic">Bob Faggy"</hi>—I asked where I could see this <hi rend="italic">Bob Faggy</hi>—he said he did not know—I took him to the station—I should have stated, that at the time Downing came to the shop there was a horse and cart outside the door, with the name of Wood on it—I asked Downing if that was the cart he brought the bristles in—he said it was not—I took both the prisoners in the cart, and drove to the station—when there, Davey said, in answer to a question put y the inspector, that he had lent <hi rend="italic">Bob Faggy</hi> a sovereign on them, and he had had the bristles in his possession six weeks, and his wife had packed them up in the morning—I went and searched his house, No. 5, Winchester-street—it is a chandler's shop—I found 68 lbs. of bristles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer—on 29th March, about 11 in the morning, I was drinking in the Sugar Loaf public-house, Dockhead, Ber<lb/>mondsey—a man named Why brow was there—there was no quarrel, but they pulled me out to fight—we fought one or two rounds, and I said "I don't want to fight any more"—we left off and shook hands, and were good friends; but the prisoner, who stood by my side, put her hand to her hair, jobbed something into my eye, and the sight was gone—I had said nothing to her—I put my hand up, and the sight of my eye fell into my hand—a hair pin was found at my feet—I have been at the Opthalmic Hospital six weeks—the sight of the eye is quite gone—I do not suffer any pain now, but I cannot do any work.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When you came into the Sugar Loaf, did you not interfere with the young man, and say, "Come outside, and have a round or two?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was pulling my friend away from Whybrow, and he came up to me and said, "What have you to do with it, you b—worm"—Whybrow and I fell; he was not under me—we fell sideways—he was bleeding from the nose—I did not say when I got up, "Something has got in my eye"—I was shaking hands and talking five minutes after the fight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Pearce, and live at 5, Dock-head, Bermondsey. On 29th March, I was passing the Sugar Loaf, and saw the prosecutor and Whybrow fighting—the prosecutor's face was bleeding—he said, "I don't want to fight any more"—they left off for several minutes, and shook hands—I saw the prisoner there—I saw her take a hair-pin from her hair, and push it into the prosecutor's eye—she drove it in forcibly—I heard him call out, "Oh, my God! you have blinded me; the sight of my eye is gone"—he thought it was a knife—I picked up a hair-pin, and said, "No, this is what it was"—the prisoner stood there for a little while, and I fetched the prosecutor's young woman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not fetch her when the fight began? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not till after his sight was gone; after I had picked up the hair-pin, I threw the hair-pin down again—I did not notice any blood upon it.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody, on 8th May—I read the warrant to her, and fetched the prosecutor, he said, "I charge you with assaulting me, and also I have lost the sight of my eye;" she said, there was a fight between Whybrow, and the prose<lb/>cutor and she did nothing—I have not got the hair-pin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am visiting surgeon at the South London Opthal<lb/>mic hospital—I saw the prosecutor there three or four days after the acci<lb/>dent—I found a small punctured wound in the cornea, into which the iris protruded, and the lens was opaque; he had, in fact, cataract produced by the fracture; the sight is quite gone; there is a chance of recovery, through an operation for cataract—he is still a patient, but all the inflammation has sub<lb/>sided—it was such a wound as might be produced by the thrust of a hair-pin: it would have been dangerous had it penetrated further; cases of death have occurred from wounds to the eye; a very severe blow might cause the eye to burst; the brain is more easily reached through the eye than through the skull; but it would be a difficult thing to produce death by a hair-pin.</p>
