               <p>Mr. Pickering. I am a broker, and live next door to St. Giles's church. The prisoner brought one of these Turkey stones and the plough to me about seven last Thursday morning: he said they were his own. I asked him where he worked; he said in the Ruins in St. Giles's. I went with him to see if any body there would say they were his; but he could not find any body that knew him: then I supposed he had stole them. I gave the constable charge of him, and he was taken to the Round-house;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060003"/> then a little boy came and said the prisoner had left a saw and oil-stone at a public-house for liquor. The constable went and brought them. (The tools produced in court, and deposed to by their respective owners, who with the constable deposed to the prisoner's confession before Justice Welch of his stealing them out of the building.)</p>

They said they broke open a house, and had got some, and if I would go, I should have some as far as it went. I was going with them, when one of them picked a gentleman's pocket, and he laid hold of me; upon which I confessed to him this fact.</p>

On the 22d of November, at night, before I went to bed, the doors and windows were made fast, and the bells put up to the windows. I went to bed about a quarter after ten. My lady was out of town, so there was only a woman, that my lady hires by the week, in the house, when she is out, and myself. After the watch went half an hour after five, I heard a noise; imagining the woman was up, making fires all about the house to air the rooms, as my lady was expected home that morning. I heard the bells ring, and I thought I heard a poker fall. After that I heard a very great noise of a fall, which shook the bed I lay upon; which I found afterwards to be an iron chest which they had brought out from a water closet in the parlour, which could not be removed there by one man. When I got up in the morning, which was about a quarter before seven, as I was coming down, the woman was rather before me (this noise continued till almost seven). I said to her, Pray, have you been up stairs to make the fires? She said no. Then I said the house is robbed. We found the street door open. I ran down to see how they got in. I found they had opened all the doors below stairs. I found the back door open, the bells all taken off, and thrown into the area (the kitchen is below-stairs ). When I was in the housekeeper's room, that opens into the area, I saw how they got in. There is a press, which had been broke open, and a great deal of linen strewed about the floor; the window-shutter was broke which looks into the street, rather<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060004"/> under the area: it was an inside shutter: the screws were taken out where it was fastened down, the sash up, and a quarry near the place seemed to be cut out with a diamond. The screws I found in the coal-hole. There is no outside shutter, but there is a bar goes down across the inside shutter, and it is fastened with a thing that turns round. I believe they must pull their clothes off to put their hand in to turn that thing. There were a great deal of table linen and fine sheets taken away. I mist my own silver buckles, two tea-spoons, one table-spoon, and my hat. My buckles I had left in my shoes, at the bottom of the stairs, when I went to bed. I then went up stairs, having heard a noise there; where I missed a table-clock, and some tea which they had taken out of a tea-chest. They had bent up the lid of the iron chest, and finding it contained only writings, they opened it no further. As soon as I had cleaned myself, I went to the watchmaker, and got the clock described; then I went to Sir

We had repeated informations concerning these things of Lady Middleton's, and we had a suspicion of the prisoner: hearing where he lived, we acquainted Sir John with it: he lived in a court in St. Martin's Lane that comes out into Bedfordbury. I believe he is a jeweller. Sir John ordered Wright and I to watch both ends of the court last Thursday was sevennight, the day after Lady Middleton's house was robbed. Wright was there about twelve, and I about one. When I came, he told me there were four people went by him, and went into that court, all people of ill fame, and they had taken two in custody, but the other two were gone. We waited till six in the morning, he at one end, and I at the other. We set two people at the door where Cave lived, to watch that no body came out. There was an old man like a porter going out to work; I said to Mr. Wright, We had better go now, and if there is any thing, we shall find it. We went up and knocked at the door. The prisoner came and opened it. We went in, and in searching a box, I found these thirteen napkins, and other things, in a room where the prisoner and his wife were in bed. We took him in custody: searching his wife's pocket, I found a watch. We sent them to Bridewell. I found also a dark lantern, a tinder-box, and some matches. He said he bought the napkins of a Jew when before Sir John.</p>

               <p>There are Jews frequent the passage where I live; there they bargain one with another: one of them brought me some cornelians to work up for him. I saw him offering these napkins and other things to sell. I asked him what he would have for the napkins; he said a dozen shillings. I bought them of him for ten shillings. I gave him a guinea, and he gave me eleven shillings out of it. I bought them to make clouts for my wife. I live in Dawson's Alley.</p>

My family was all out at the time. I went out about ten minutes before six, and returned about nine. We did not fasten the outward door, there being lodgers in the garret, and also in the kitchen; but we fastened the shop door that opens into the entry. When we returned, we found the staple was forced out, and that the bolt had been forced.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060005"/> The door was cracked across, and burst open. We missed the till, lock and key, and some half-pence out of the shop. (I keep a chandler's shop.) Out of the next room to the shop I lost three silver tea-spoons, a pair of wooden tea-tongs, and a petticoat of my wife's; and in another room beyond that, we lost all our clothes that we pulled off, two pillows, two pillow-cases, a work-basket with new work in it, and a small deal box with a great many things of my wife's in it; also a large pier glass. The two doors to the back room we left open: they were on the ground floor, and no other way to them but through the shop. I have put nothing in the indictment but what was found again. When the prisoner was taken up, I went to his lodgings, and there I found my two pillows and pillow-cases on his bed, the work-basket, and some more trifling things of my wife's.

There was a pane of glass that had some cracks in it, which I found was taken out. The shop was not shut up. There was a candle on the counter. I suppose they put in their hands, or other instrument, in order to draw these things out. My shop was left without any body in it. I had called my apprentice to me backwards, for it might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. These things lay in the window, upon a shelf, under where the pane of glass was in part taken out. Some of them stood upright. I sent my boy out of the dye-house from me on an errand, and as he went out at the door, a neighbour's apprentice said to him, Sam, I am watching two men that I saw put their hands into your window. The boy immediately came back and called me into the shop, saying, Sir, there is a piece of glass out of one of the panes, and here are some things missing. I soon missed three of the things, and found the pieces of glass out. I immediately went up to Sir

(He puts the silk to the waistcoat, and it exactly fitted to the cut of the upper part of the waistcoat; so that he was very able to swear the front pieces of the waistcoat were cut off the same piece of silk, they being indented, as it were, to each other.)

            . I lost two shirts, the property of a young man that I wash for, on Friday the 20th of October. They were brought to me by a gentleman that stopped the prisoner with them. (Produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Dr. Cherrington. On Friday the 20th of October, as I was coming down Paradise-Row, in Chelsea, to go to my own house, the prisoner came by me in a rushing manner, and had like to have thrown down my little boy that I had in my hand. I turned to him, and said, You brute, why do you push the child? He went forwards a dog's trot. He seemed to be an active young man, and had a bundle under his coat, on his left breast, supported by his right hand. Soon after this I heard the cry of - Stop thief! that is the man. He was but a little past me. Then I called out - Stop thief! that is the man. Immediately Mr. Atkinson stopt him. He begged of Mr. Atkinson to let him go. Upon which Mr. Atkinson said, That is the bundle that is dropped. I saw it on the ground before I came up, but it was rather in motion on the ground. I did not see the prisoner drop it. I took it up, and carried it with him towards the water-side. In going along, I met the daughter of Mrs. Greenwood: she said they were stole from her mother. Soon after that I met the mother, who said it was her linen. We went to the headborough's house, and there I delivered the linen into his hands. The prisoner was taken to the cage. The prisoner wanted to make his escape, and begged of me to let him go. I said, I am very sorry for you as a man, but, as a publick offender, you must be punished. (The shirts produced, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Atkinson confirm'd the above account.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

I saw the handkerchief was very visible. He not being quick enough, the prisoner stepped forward and took it, and was turning back. I said to the gentleman, You have lost your handkerchief. He felt, and said he had. I took hold of the prisoner, and said, Where is the gentleman's handkerchief? He said, he had none. I took it from between his waistcoat and shirt. I got him out of the mob and took him to the Compter. But I lost the gentleman that owns the handkerchief in the crowd. The Alderman thought proper to commit the prisoner and bound me over to prosecute. (A red and white handkerchief produced in court.) This is it. I saw the prisoner take it out of the gentleman's pocket. The prisoner told me he was a plaisterer.</p>

            . I had a warrant to apprehend the prisoner and another. I took the prisoner as he was coming out of the warehouse with this china-ware upon him, some in his coat pockets. Going along, I thought he had something in his breeches. I searched him before the Alderman in Guildhall, and found the rest in his breeches. I took him coming out of the company's warehouse in Seething-lane. One of the King's officers that is now here, said to me, Smith was gone, and would have prevented my taking him. I told him I would report him; the prisoner was got out of the warehouse, but not got into the street. (The china-ware produced in court, it was blue and white.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Rudock. There is abundance of china-ware of all sorts in that warehouse. I cannot speak with certainty that there were such as these.</p>

               <p>I brought that china from on board the ship called the Sea-horse at Deptford, about six that morning, and came up to Iron-gate by water, because I would not lose my call.

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Rose-street, Long-Acre. I went with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060009"/> prisoner on board a ship. I think it is called the Sea-horse. She lay at Deptford. We went on board as near as I can recollect between six and seven in the morning. He bought some china. I did not think it worth my white to buy any. I did not think it worth my notice. I saw nothing that I liked. He bought as much as came to fourteen or fifteen shillings. This was the 10th of last month.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of china were they?</p>
               <p>Bunning. There were some cups and some basons, odds and ends he called them; to the best of my remembrance they were blue and white. After that he went one way and I another. I waited for a boat to carry me on shore on the other si de the water; he went up the river in order to get to his work to save his call.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when he made the bargain?</p>
               <p>Bunning. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of each?</p>
               <p>Bunning. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ring them?</p>
               <p>Bunning. That I cannot say. I saw him examine some of them, he put them into two or three pockets, they were packed in some India paper; he took a boat and went up; he lives in Falcon-court on the other side the water. I called upon him that morning about five or a quarter after, there, and we walked together part of the way, and the remainder part when we came near the place we took boat and went on board.</p>
               <p>Q. to Rudock. What time do you call over your men at the warehouses?</p>
               <p>Rudock. We call about eight in the morning this time of the year.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bunning. How long was you on board?</p>
               <p>Bunning. I believe I might be on board about half an hour or better.</p>

I had been out, but came home about tea, and found my house fast as usual. I got up in the morning about seven, or rather better. My child, who is about thirteen years old, was with me. She said she believed our house was robbed. We found a gun, a pistol, and a naked sword, lying on the table, in the fore-parlour; overnight the sword was hanging against the wall. I missed 130 ounces of chippings of silver from out of a mahogany bureau, which was broke open in the fore-parlour, and a pistol, which hung with the sword. I lost a pepper-box, four common spoons, a large soup-ladle, a mother-of-pearl snuff-box, set in silver, a box with mourning-rings and some ear-rings, and a morocco pocket-book. I found the window-shutter was wrenched open. It being a dirty evening, I observed a good many marks of feet on the window, on the inside, and on the ground and carpet. There were two chisels found near my house by the watchman; by the marks on the window, it seemed as if wrenched open by them. It was a sash window. I gave notice of it to Sir

             came to my shop with a gold pendant, and wanted 4 s. 6 d. on it. I suspecting he stole it, desired him to leave it, and call again, saying my wife was out, and that I had no change. When he came again I stopped him, and insisted on his telling me where he got it; he said he had it of one Jones, a pendant-maker, at the upper end of Wood's Close. He said he was a maker in the wholesale way, and sometimes he could not complete an order on a Saturday night, and then he sent a pendant to make a little money till his order was compleat. I was determined to go and know whether there was such a person, but at last he confessed he had a brother at Mr. Upjohn's, and that he had them of him. I had taken some of him before, which made me suspect, him. I had taken four gold and two silver pendants, and fifty-four watch dial plates of him at different times, between the 2d of October and the 7th of November, which he pledged in the name of

I was a good deal alarmed, having lost one hundred and fifty pounds some nights before. I came down, I found the inside shutters were not open. I had made them secure over night, and hung bells upon them. The same man came to me again, and said, a watchman's staff had been left there. I sent my servant to the beadle to know who was watch there for that night. My servant was ordered ot ask me if I had lost any thing; the watchman having brought a window-blind in his hand to the watch-house, who said, he bought it. I thought it very odd for a watchman to buy a blind at that time of the night. I went to the constable<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060012"/> with the beadle and my servant to ask after the watchman, who was gone home to bed. (It was the prisoner.) We knocked at his room door several times. He would not make any answer. I came down after that. I was informed he was at home. We went up again. There was the prisoner and my blind laying in the room. We found also a dark lanthorn, and several tools set to break open houses with. This was about ten in the morning.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Lowe. On that Sunday morning, being alarmed by a man that the window was broke, master went down, and found the window-blind was taken away. While the carpenter was mending the shutter in the morning about seven, I observed the prisoner went backwards and forwards and stood and looked at him. The man that told master of the house being broke, said, he had got a watchman's staff, and brought it to master. When we went to the beadle, he asked if we had not lost a blind. We said, Yes. Then he said, the man that is now at the bar brought in a blind into the watch-house, and said, he bought it. I told my master of it. We went and got a constable, and went to his room; not making him hear, they were going away. I put my head to the door and heard him snore; then the constable broke the door open. The prisoner appeared to be asleep. We spoke to him two or three times before he got up. The blind stood against a chest in his room; there was nobody in the room but himself. I saw the chisels lying in a cupboard, which had marks upon them as if they had been used in bricks; there was a dark lanthorn with a piece of candle in it in a drawer.</p>

            . I am a beadle belonging to St. Luke's parish. I sit up every night in the watch-house. I have seven watchmen under my care; and when I have a vacancy I put one in that man's room. I had a vacancy that night, and I put the prisoner in. He came in late in the morning. I asked him why he staid so late. He pulled off his coat and hat, and sat down his lanthorn. I said, Where is your staff? Said he, I know nothing of it. Then I saw a mahogany blind. I said how came you by that? Master, said he, I found it. Said I, then it is proper it should be left in the watch-house. Said he, I'll tell you how I came by it, I bought it and paid for it honestly; then he took it home. Between eight and nine in the morning, Mr. Lowe's servant came to my house to know what watchman went Old-street beat. Said I, is any thing the matter? The servant said, Yes, my master's house is broke. I said, Has he lost any thing? He said, a mahogany window blind. I said, My watchman has got it. He said, his master desired to speak with me. When I came there, there was the constable; then we went to the prisoner's apartment (he was the watchman that went Old-street beat that night. I had employed him when a vacancy has been) we could make nobody hear. When we found somebody was in bed, we forced the door open; there was he in bed, and the blind in the room. We saw several other things, watchmen's staves, lanthorns, and caps, that had been stolen, which had been used by my own watchmen some time before. We got him up, and carried him to New-prison; it being Sunday, the next day we carried him before the Justice. We found also in his room a dark lanthorn, a tinder-box, and a great many tools, a great deal of worsted yarn, mohair, and other things, that a lady had been robbed of a fortnight before.</p>

About the hour of one in the morning, on the 18th of November, I was awaked by the barking of a large dog that I keep, and heard a crying out among my geese which I had to kill as I had occasion for my own use, and which were in a lumber room in my dwelling-house. There were six of them. I got out of bed, put my waistcoat on, and came into the gallery, when I saw my outward door stood wide open, and my windows and door open into the gallery. The geese were in a room next to the room under my room where I lay. (It is an inn-yard.) It was the bottom door, that leads to the stairs, that I saw open, which leads to some workshops that I have. (I am a file-cutter and grinder.) I have the whole inn and yard upon lease, and I reserve these apartments to myself. Great part of it I lett to a hackneyman, and keep stabling for my own horses. This lumber room is under the roof of my dwelling-house, and a part of it. As soon as I came into the gallery, I heard voices, and thought I knew one, which called my bitch by her name. I heard them catch a goose, and heard her flutter very much. They killed her. Then I cried out - Stop thieves! having nobody to assist me. The moon shone very bright. There came out a man with a great deal of composure, and asked me what was the matter. He saw me in the gallery. I made use of an oath, and said he was a thief. They were stealing my geese; but I knew one of them. He called me a thief, and said, if I did not go in, he would shoot me; but before the words were well out of his mouth, I heard something snap. I saw his hands together. I made use of another oath, and bid him shoot away. I drew back, but did not go in. Then I saw two more men come out of the same door. There is a little ride that shaded that, so I could not see them; but I heard them go down the yard. It was a very cold night, and being almost naked, I went to bed again. I had only two little boys in the house: I called to them to get a candle, and to go and look among the geese, for I thought some of them were killed. The boy went, and came and said there were three missing. When I got up, which was between seven and eight, I missed only two. I went to Justice Welch, and got a warrant against the evidence,

               <p>Q. Was that outward door fast at your going to bed?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. I locked it myself. In the morning I observed no marks of violence upon the door, but found it unlocked on the inside. On the Sunday week after, I had intelligence he was at a chandler's shop. I went to take him; but he ran when he saw me. I having boots and a great coat on, he outran me. I called - Stop thief! and he was stopped at the corner of Lincoln's Inn-Fields. I brought him home, and desired the people to keep him till I got a constable; but when I returned, I found they had permitted him to go up into his room. I was told, if I would go to him, he would tell me every thing about it. I went up, and he told me. He is here to be examined, and will give the account himself. I never found my geese again. Then I got a warrant on his information against the prisoner. I cannot say I ever saw him till I saw him at Mr. Welch's office. I heard him examined there. He confessed that he, the evidence, and one Houghton, met at the One Tun, at the corner of Field-Lane, went down the Fleet-Market, and so into Fleet-Street. I think he said he either primed a pistol or loaded it, and then they were determined to come and rob me of these geese. He acknowledged how the fact was done. He said, the evidence got over the coach-houses, then into the gallery, and so came down, and let himself and Houghton in; and that Simms called my bull-bitch by her name, and clapped her. The justice asked him if he heard Houghton and I have words; he said he was backwards, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060014"/> did not hear it. He said they carried the geese to Blackboy-Alley, to a house there.</p>

            . I had known the prisoner about seven weeks, when he and Houghton persuaded me several times to go and rob my master. He, I and Houghton were together that night, at the One Tun, at the corner of Field-Lane. We went from thence down Fleet-Market, into Fleet-Street, intending to stop somebody. When we came into Fleet-Street, the prisoner pulled a pistol out of his pocket, and put some gunpowder into the pan. We then went through Clare-Market, and so came to my master's about one in the morning. Then I got over my master's gallery rails into the gallery: Houghton lifted me up. I went down and unlocked the bottom door; the key was in it; and then the bull-bitch began to bark. I called her by her name, and kept her quiet. The prisoner and Houghton then came in. I catched two of the geese, gave them to Houghton, and he killed them. They made such a noise, they disturbed master, and he came out. Houghton went out to the door, and had some words with master: he bade master go in, or he would absolutely shoot him. Then we all went out of the yard into Holborn, and staid there about ten minutes. The outward door of the inn yard was open. We all of us returned into the inn yard again. The two geese lay behind the door; I took them up, and gave Houghton one, and

            . On the 26th of November I was sent for to Mr. Welch's, where were warrants against Randall and Houghton, and I was desired to see if I could apprehend them. I took the evidence with me, and apprehended Randall in Field-Lane. I took him before Justice Welch. When he came there, he confessed every thing. He and the evidence did not differ in the least in the account they gave of going from the One Tun to Fleet-Market, from thence into Fleet-Street, and in assisting to lift the evidence over to let them in, killing the geese, one taking one, the other the other, to Blackboy-Alley, to one Mrs. Hall's. He made a free and voluntary confession, with only being asked what he had to say for himself. He confessed immediately.</p>

Houghton and he had made an agreement to go before, and desired me to go; at last I agreed. We went up Fleet-Street. I do not know whether he had a pistol or not. I stood at the lower part, and Houghton lifted the evidence up; he then opened the door, and went in. I never was in the room. We went from thence into Holborn, and staid about ten minutes; then we came again, and the evidence then fetched the two geese out, when Houghton took them, put them into his apron, and took them to Mrs. Hall's, in Blackboy-Alley.</p>

Ashington lifted Drury up to the window, who put his hand through the window and shoved a wooden bolt back, and by that means opened the door; he took up three iron bolts and threw them out at the door, and then came back for three more; a man was coming by who shut the door. After which he went to throw those three out, and I catched hold of him. Ashington threw three bolts under a piece of wood and ran away.</p>

The watchman in that street hearing me call, he met us. The prisoner fell down, and I fell upon him. The watchman laid hold of him on one side, and I the other. We got him up, and on conducting him back to the end of Argyll-street, turning round into the street, he pulled out something from his pocket and threw it away, and dropped something on the stones which jingled, then he drew out a clasp-knife, (producing a sharp-pointed clasp-knife about ten or eleven inches long) and opened it; this is it. I saw him make a stab at me. I clasped my hand against my side, and received the point in my arm. I cried out, Watchman, knock him down, I am stabbed. The prisoner kept playing away at me, stabbing at me with his knife. I received one cut in my right finger, and a cut across my coat at my left hip, and several cuts in my hat. In one cut the knife went through my hat and cut a slant cut on the left side my head, which made the blood run to my ear. I received a small scratch with the end of the knife on my forehead on my right temple. (he showed the marks of the cuts in his flesh and on his cloaths) I called to him several times to drop his knife. He said, he would not. The watchman hit him several blows, and at last knocked him down; he still said he would not drop his knife. Then we got him up, and he said he would go wherever we pleased. We carried him to Mrs. Winford's house, and sent to Mr. Spinnage's. The clerk came down and searched the prisoner. He found a bag upon him and a bunch of matches. After that he was carried to the watch house.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the house you came out of to Mrs. Winford's house?</p>
               <p>Gascoyne. There are but about four or five feet between our doors. Her house was locked up for a season while she went out of town. There was no body in the house when we took the prisoner; he had no shoes on. We went into Mrs. Winford's house. We could see by marks of their making water against the wainscot,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060016"/> and their nastiness, that there had been three of them in the house.</p>

Before he got the prisoner up, I was up at him. The prisoner began stabbing, and he stabbed me through my watch-coat in two places. (he shewed the cuts) We carried him back to the house.

            . I am a watchman in Carnaby-Street. Upon hearing the cry of, Stop thief, I directly made that way, when I met the prisoner, and was going to strike at him; but he immediately dropped down; and the other running so fast after him, he tumbled upon him, and in carrying him back, he pulled out some things, and dropped them down. I imagine it was these two keys (producing two small stocklock keys) which were found in the same spot afterwards. He after that pulled out a clasp-knife, opened it, and fell to stabbing away as fast as he could. Mr. Gascoyne cried out he was stabbed. They were so close together, I could not knock him down, without hurting one of the others. He turned his hand back, with intent to stick the knife into my throat; then I knocked him down immediately. We secured him, and took him to Mrs. Winford's house, where we further secured him.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Marlborough street, and as I was coming up the street I heard the call of, Stop thief. Before I got to the place the prisoner was taken, and they were carrying him back to Mrs. Winford's house. I thought there were enough to take care of him. I stopped at the end of Marlborough street. He made a scuffle to get away, but I came up and laid hold of the back of the collar of his coat. Mr. Gascoyne said he was cut all to pieces. We took him to the house, and from thence to the watch-house, and coming up to Marlborough-street again, I found a pair of shoes upon a bench belonging to a cheesemonger; there were buckles in them.</p>

            . The keys of Mrs. Winford's house were left at Mr. Higden's house by her. There came an order from her to send some furniture from that house down to her. I went into the house for it; when I came out I locked the door, and put my hand to it, and know it was fast. This was some few days before the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Higden. When Mrs. Winford went out she left the key of her door with me; and, by virtue of a letter which she sent the 12th of September, wherein she desired I would let this last witness go and fetch the things she ordered: she went, and brought the key again in about two hours after; and it has never been out of my custody since.</p>

               <p>I am a poor man, and deal in old cloaths; I did work in gardens. I happened to get up to Hyde-Park-Corner, and got in liquor, and then was making the best of my way home. What these gentlemen here swear to, I know no more of than the child unborn. They took my shoes off; I asked for them when I was in the watch-house; they brought me a pair of shoes, not mine: mine had a pair of silver buckles in them; they would have persuaded me they were mine. They searched me, and took a bag from me and a bunch of matches; which latter I had from a woman who was selling a paper of something in regard to Wilkes, but, instead of that, sold the matches, and gave the paper in, and I gave her a halfpenny. How I came to put the matches in my pocket I know not. When I came to ask for my shoes they used me worse and worse.</p>

I stopped her, and sent for the apprentice, who came and said it was not mine. Then she said she would punish me for stopping her. We took her to the justice's; then it came out who the shirt belonged to. The prosecutor owned it.</p>

            . On the 6th of December, the day the two convicts were executed, after the execution I was going about business I had to do in Spitalfields: after I had done my business I came to the officer of the guards. The high constable was telling him, that the mob were demolishing Mr. Chauvet's house, and begged of him to advance with his troops; they said they had sent for a magistrate and one was coming. I said, I will go and see what situation the house is in, and I will send you word of it. When I came into the yard, which was about five minutes after one o'clock, there were a number of people before the house; I suppose to the number of four or five thousand; they were in the street as thick as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060018"/> they could stand together. Mr. Chauvet and all his people had forsaken the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is his house?</p>
               <p>Captain Taylor. It is in <placeName id="t17691206-23-crimeloc142">Crispin-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17691206-23-crimeloc142" type="placeName" value="Crispin-street"/>
                  <interp inst="t17691206-23-crimeloc142" type="type" value="crimeLocation"/>
                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17691206-23-off139 t17691206-23-crimeloc142"/>. I was told by a gentleman the people were got into the house. I said, Why don't you fire upon them, and drive them out? He said, Mr. Chauvet did not chuse to fire at them. I said, give me something, I will. They brought me a brace of pistols. There is a door on the right-hand side; I knocked against it, nobody answered. I said, if they did not open it, I would fire upon them that were in the house. I pressed my foot against the door, whether my foot or they opened it, I cannot tell; it flew open as far as it could, for by the people throwing down a harpsichord, the door could not fly back quite wide; but it was so far open that I could advance in. The people seeing me with pistols in my hands, ran out; some tumbled head over heels out at the window. I could have shot, but, upon looking on my pistols, the powder was gone, and the balls came out into my hand; then I turned and asked for powder and ball.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were in the room when you went in?</p>
               <p>Captain Taylor. I believe there were six or eight. I got powder and ball and advanced to the windows, and asked the people if they were not ashamed of their behaviour, and told them the consequence of it. I thought once I had got them into a good humour. There were at that time seven or eight fellows, one of which was the prisoner, who came over towards me, and asked me if I was Chauvet, and said, D - n you, if I thought you was, I'd hang you up directly. I was charging a pistol at the time. I advanced and said, I thank you for the hint, for if you advance one inch farther, I'll blow your brains out. I then shewed them my other pistol; they began to throw stones at me. I could have shot the prisoner several times, but I did not chuse it, for fear of killing women or children. They were hallooing out, Pull the house down - Hang him. I said, what signifies pulling the house down, you had better go home. They said, the Sheriffs hanged the men up like dogs, they would not let them have time to say their prayers. Said I, if you stay till the soldiers come, you will not have time to say Lord have mercy upon me. If they are at you in a direct line, they may kill twenty with a shot. Thus I talked to them five or six minutes. There was a fellow in blue extremely active. He took good aim at my head. The stone hit me on my shoulder. I ran up and should have shot him, I believe, but he squatted down and ran up among the people. I called him cowardly scoundrel. I called for a broad sword. They had none. They brought me a small sword. I said, that fellow shall be dead or alive in five minutes. I came upon the back of the prisoner: he was standing over-right Mr. Chauvet's house. I catched hold of him, and said, I'll have you dead or alive, and if any go to rescue him, I'll shoot them; and pointed my sword to him. I took him away. The fellow said, I should be glad to ask you a question; I said you may propose them before the magistrate. The first thing he said was, he knew all the cutters. I said, You will hang yourself. He said, his wife worked for Mr. Chauvet. I said, There he stands, if you have any thing to say against him, upon my honour, I will be as much your friend as his, if you make it appear he has wronged you. Did you ever hear your wife say he ever stopped any money, or lowered the wages? No sir, said he, he was a good man. Said I, How could you be so bad a man to Mr. Chauvet?</p>
               <p>Q. Describe what was done to the house?</p>
               <p>Captain Taylor. The window shutters on the left hand side, and the wainscot on the inside, all from top to bottom, and the door that was locked and barred, were broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them breaking them?</p>
               <p>Captain Taylor. No: they all ran out head over heels; and there stood till I had loaded my pistols; they had broke all the sash frames in the lower part of the house before I came. The shutters were hanging down. They were in but one room to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wainscot pulled down?</p>
               <p>Captain Taylor. No: it was not, it was split in two or three places; they had tried to break into the back parlour. I saw the man in blue throw a brickbat in, which hit the wainscot.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any bricks of the house pulled out?</p>
               <p>Captain Taylor. I do not know that there were. The stone steps going up to the landing place, were broke.</p>
               <p>Court. Are there any evidence that can go farther?</p>
               <p>Council. We cannot prove there was any part of the house pulled down.</p>

            . I am a watchman; and buy old clothes, and old rags, and such things. I met the prisoner with this coat, in Cheapside, last Saturday morning about nine o'clock. He asked me if I would buy it. I went with him down Pater-noster-row, and in a little court that goes from thence to St. Paul's-church-yard, there I bought it, and paid him the money, fourteen shillings; but told him I would not part with him till he sent for a surety. We were in a public-house; he wanted to break thro' the window; I held him, and the man of the house assisted me. I brought him before my lord-mayor; my lord ordered the coat to be advertised, and Mr. Cannicot came and described it before he saw it; and I went with him to Mr. Wrights.

On the 18th of last Month, in the evening, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw an arm put in round the post, at the door. It took out a dish with four pounds of butter in it, I persued; the evening being dark, I lost sight of the man. I called, Stop Thief! he dropped the dish and butter in the road, and by the fall of it, I knew which course he went; I went past the dish; the prisoner was stopped at the end of Tower street. I cannot swear he is the man, only by his being running. We brought him back to the shop; going out again at the door I picked up two handkerchiefs, and carried them in; then I went to the dish; there lay three more; then I went and got a constable and search'd him, and found four more upon him, and there was another brought which he was seen to drop when he was taken, which, together, make ten. He had on a kind of blue jacket, and I thought arm, which was put in at the door, appeared to the be blue; but it was in and out very quick.</p>

               <p>Hill. Not twenty yards, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mr. Shepherd's house?</p>
               <p>Hill. I believe it is about a hundred yards distant from the place I took the prisoner; he was running so swift, that when I catched hold of him, it brought me almost round. My brother was with me, and he directly took hold of him. We brought him back to Mr. Shepherd's house. When the constable came, he had four handkerchiefs in his right hand. There was one picked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060020"/> up in Tower-street. A man there said he saw him drop it.</p>

I saw something lying white; he picked up a pair of stays, I put the candle down, and took up a white apron. I looked up to Mr. White's window, and saw a man coming to the window with things ready to throw out. When I spoke he drew back, we then went up, and finding the door fast, we broke it open, and there we took the prisoner.</p>

             came to the door to light me out. I saw what then I thought to be papers lying under Mrs. White's window; I went and found it to be a pair of stays, and Ewer took up a white apron; he looked up to Mrs. White's window, and said, Here are thieves in her room. I ordered a person to see they did not get out at the window; and I and Ewer went up. The prisoner had fastened the door. Ewer put his back to the door and bursted it open. We found the prisoner had put himself close up by a closet: we took him in custody. I took up a gown and slip also under the window. Mrs. White swore to the things.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mrs. White. How do you think he got into your room?</p>
               <p>Mrs. White. There was a pane broke, by which means he could open the window. I suppose he got in at the window.</p>

I heard a noise, and saw her looking at some leather, and going from one part of the shop to another. I gave my son a hint to watch her. I staid some time at breakfast; when I came into the shop she still was there. She bought a piece for three half-pence,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060023"/> and went out. My son said, after she was in the street, See how she walks. I thought she was drunk, as she walked lamish. Presently a large piece of sole leather dropped from her petticoats; she was but about five or six yards from the door. I desired my son to fetch her back. My son went, and took hold of the sleeve of her gown, and in turning her round short she dropped nine pieces more from under her clothes. I saw them drop. When she was brought into the shop, she went down on her knees, and begged I would excuse her, as she was very poor. (The leather produced in court and deposed to.) Here is my own mark on all the pieces; they were taken out of a small bing, where she had been on her knees looking out the pieces, about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these pieces?</p>
               <p>Silvester. They are worth about 6 s.</p>

            . I am son to the prosecutor; I suspected the prisoner all the time she was in the shop, knowing her to be a thief before. She was some time on her knees at the bing, where the pieces of sole leather lies; she bought a bit for three-halfpence ( produced in court) this is it; after she went out of the shop my father sent me after her. I gave her a short turn round, and she dropped nine pieces; they are my father's property. When she was brought back into the shop, she begged pardon.</p>

Upon that I told them, I would come and speak to them; but upon my going down with only my shirt and night-cap on, I thought to myself, I would not open the door till they had resolution enough to break the house; I went into the yard and staid there, and heard them chop with a thing I believe to be an ax, and with an iron crow, making at the shutter of the door, which is an inch and a quarter; it is a sash door; there I staid till I heard the glass all flying into the passage in the house. I heard such a noise of their breaking, that I thought my life, and the lives of my family would be in great danger; thought it was broke enough for them almost to get in without me. Then I said, Gentlemen, pray do not make this noise, I will undo the door. I drawed the lock back, it was a spring-lock, and unbolted it; they had knocked it so, that the bolt and all stuck very fast: upon my opening it, half a dozen men came in a very riotors manner, and asked me where my work was.

            ) Five of them found the staircase and went up, and the sixth man I fixed myself against, and entered into a discourse with him. I fell to telling him I had a good right to have looms worked, and they had no right to cut mine, for I was willing to pay; and that I had been very diligent to desire the men to pay the money, to save their masters property and their own.</p>
               <p>Q. Pay, what money do you mean?</p>
               <p>Clarke. They demanded two shillings a loom, which we were obliged to pay, or have the goods destroyed, and the master's work also.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that to be paid for?</p>
               <p>Clarke. Because they thought they had done some advantage to the journeymen in advancing their price, or having their price kept up. I also told him I had a little money that was collected the night before; that it was so little that it was not worth tending, but we should meet again next Saturday, and then I should have more money. With my telling him I had a right to a loom's work as well as any man in the trade, it prevailed upon him to call them down, and telling them they were all wrong, they would not come down till he was obliged to use cutters language, which was, Blast your eyes! and D - n your eyes! and so on. Then they all came down, and all went out. At their going out Mr. Gusset said, (that was the man that I conversed with) if he ever heard such a report of me he would cut my ears off. When they came down, I expected they were going away, and that I should hear no more of them. I began to lock the door, but the lock was so hard to get in that I could not fasten the door till they returned again, and demanded entrance. I told them I would open the door. Mr. Gusset came in again, and fixed himself before me, and asked me whether my wife ever made such work as that; I said she had, but they might depend upon it, she should make no more of it. (It was a two-coloured flowered sattin, which I have here) Then there came three other people in. I am not certain whether they had been in before. Mr. Gusset was talking to me, he put his face to mine, there was a man slipped behind his back whom I thought I knew by his stature and bulk, but was not then certain. I took him to be the man that is now in Newgate,

            ; after that there came a tall man in, about six feet high, with a broad sword, or a cutlass in his hand; he slipped by me; then the prisoner came in, with a different tone of voice, which was very particular. The very same voice I heard before in the street; he came in a different form; they all past before my face. This man came to my right shoulder, and put his mouth to my mouth, and spoke in the voice of a woman; he had a light-coloured great coat on, and another under it; he past round by my right shoulder. I saw him close by the other man that entered first; and I saw the tall man, whose name I understand is Bantam, with a sword over my head, waiting, as I thought, for the word of Gusset to chop me down.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words the prisoner said?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I cannot recollect any particular word, but his tone was so particular; the tall man first entered the stairs, and went up, the prisoner followed him as close as he could; then I addressed myself again to the man I first conversed with, when they were gone up to cut the work; but they had a good deal to do to find the work. I had a good deal of discourse with the man, in pleading my right to work, and if they cut the work it would be the wrongest thing they did since they went to cutting. I talked to him till another man under the window said, D - n you, what signifies standing talking to him? then I went into the yard, and staid a while, and heard two mens voices; one said, Here it goes. I heard them cutting the mountear and the things fall. My shop is up stairs, and there is a very long light; that you may hear any body speak there when in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060025"/> yard where I stood. I heard the lingoes fall (they are small leaden weights, part of the mountear,) and I heard the clashing of the glass moles to pieces, they belong to the mountear; there I heard Mr. Eastman's natural voice, saying, Here it goes. I knew him four or five years before, and have often discoursed with him about weaving; he was no particular acquaintance of mine, far from it; though he never affronted me in his life before. I cannot tell whether Bantam was up in the rooms were the work was. When they had done their business they all went out; Bantam was in the one-pair of stairs, he called to them as they were coming down, and asked if they had taken care of the reed; they said all things were safe; they went away, and I saw no more of them that night (all the four) there were six in the first time; they did not go away till the clock struck two. I got up in the morning, and went into the shop about six o'clock. I found the mountear cut all to-pieces (that is a tackle that causes the flowers to be made in the work; it is used in making flowered silk; it will make all manner of flowers. (Produced in broken pieces) and (two pieces of sattin produced) this is the work. It is called the Leopard spot. (The lingoes produced.) [they are about the bigness of the tube of a tobacco pipe, about six or eight inches long, fastened to a small cord or thread, at one end.] (A piece of a shuttle, and the reed broke in three pieces produced.) There were two shuttles, they broke one in two pieces, and damaged the other; the reed is entirely spoiled. The quill-wheel is a large thing; I have not brought that, they broke that; the use of that is to wind quills on pipes, which pipes or quills are put into the shuttle; that is a particular tool used in weaving all broad silk; the shuttle and quill-wheel were my property. (A brass point to a scabbard of a hanger or cutlass produced.) This I found in the room the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a candle in your hand when you opened the door?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No: but there is a lamp before the door, that we may see the colour of every man's clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive, and sure, or have you any doubt whether you saw Eastman in the manner you have said?</p>
               <p>Clarke. I have no manner of doubt at all; was I as sure of the other as I am of him, I should have done the same by him; but I was tender of

               <p>Clarke. Because I was determined they should never cut my work till they had first broke my house. I had a mind to see whether they had resolution to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner whisper?</p>

               <p>Q. How could you distinguish the prisoner's face when he was at your right shoulder?</p>

               <p>Clarke. No: never in my life. I have said to some people, sometimes, that I did know him; but I must not know him, because Mr. Cook desired me, for the safety of his work, not to say any thing. One time I was at the Red-lion, there was the prisoner; Bantam and another. I was tried there and examined as much as now. They were preparing a jack-ass to ride me; that was through the instigation of one of Mr. Cook's journeymen. I was obliged to say what I had said was in a joke. If I had not,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060026"/> possibly they would have rode me, and perhaps taken away my life. Mr. Gusset was chair-man there, they had laid a charge that Mr. Cook did not pay his men the price for work. I cleared all the points; then Mr. Gusset declared, the man that laid the Information before them ought to be punished.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not declared, you would not stir a step but for the sake of the reward?</p>
               <p>Clarke. No, never in my life; there is a gentleman can prove, I have said, I did not desire the reward.</p>

They broke the door to pieces, and cut the shutter, and broke the glass: they demanded entrance, and got in; then they went away again; they were demanded out again by the man below stairs; he blasted them, and said, They were all wrong, they were got to the wrong house; but they came again in about two or three minutes, and demanded entrance; two of them came up the first stairs, and demanded to know where the B - h his wife was, saying, they would murder her directly, and they would cut his ears off, if he did not come up and show them where the work was.

Then she took it in, and shut the door; then they said that is right, and blasted her again, and demanded the light from her; she was in a two-pair-of-stairs room; they took the light from her, and never brought it her again; they then went up another pair of stairs.

On the Sunday after he came to supper with me in Crabtree-row, near Bethnal-green church; his wife came first and he after her, after service; she having mentioned something of it, when he came in I asked him if he knew any of them, he said no, he knew never a man of them, so as to swear to them, he wish'd he could. After that he repeated the words, d - n them for rogues; he was not sorry the work was cut, for the work was so bad that he could not work it; he was glad it was cut out. Several times I have been with him, I at his house and he at mine. He always did declare he could swear to no man at all. My son and house-keeper were by at the time; he was just come from service, and began to tell me, Mr. Eastman and Mr. Haddon, were taken. I asked him, Who swore against Haddon? he said the little boy. I did not ask him after the other. Then he said he would go to Mr. Chauvet's partner; he was very uneasy. They proposed to free him by way of security for himself, and if they were not so good as their word, they must do the business themselves. I went with him, but cannot rightly tell what he told the man. He said he would speak to the gentleman about the two men that he had swore against; the servant said, what two men, they that are under sentence? he said no, the two men that were taken on Saturday night; he said his house was not safe; it was not so much in sight of the guards as his master's was. They went to an alehouse, and I went to Clark's house till he came back.</p>

I said, I hope they have not cut your goods. She said, no, nothing but the work. I said, it is pitty you did not know them. Did you make any remarks on them? she said no, none at all. Mr. Clark said the same, but said he was not sorry the work was cut out; for it was a bad commodity, and would never be worked out: he said he did not know one of them.

            . I am husband to the last witness. I saw Mr. Clark on the 17th or 18th of October. I believe both days. I was first talking with Mrs. Clark, who was saying how her sattin was cut out. She said her boy said it was Mr. Haddon. Mr. Clark being somewhat angry, said to her, hold your tongue, it was only a foolish little boy. He said, he likewise knew no person that was there.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live in Wilk-street. Some time ago my father employed Mr. Clark; he had some conversation with him about his work being cut out.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Dale. That was the 1st of September in the morning. I had some work cut out of my own, which curiosity led me to speak to Mr. Clark. This was early in the morning, between eleven and twelve. I introduced it in this manner, being a sufferer, whether Mr. Clark was exact in his information or not. I said to him, Mr. Clark, how came you to know the cutters better than I? he said I might know them if I would. I said, Mr. Clark, I would have known them if possibly I could, but how came you to know them? he said by information, or by enquiry, as he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to recollect the time you met Mr. Clark?</p>
               <p>Dale. It was the first of September.</p>
               <p>Q. When was your work cut out?</p>
               <p>Dale. My work was cut out the 21st of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect the time you met Mr. Clarke.</p>
               <p>Dale. It was the first of September.</p>
               <p>Court. The work was not cut out till the 11th.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the Friday se'ennight after your own work was cut?</p>
               <p>Dale. I answer fair questions, but unfair questions I cannot answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it last Friday was se'ennight?</p>
               <p>Dale. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet him?</p>
               <p>Dale. Opposite the new turnpike in Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the cutting of your own work?</p>
               <p>Dale. Mine was cut in the month of August, the 21st. I never heard what month Mr. Clark's was cut in.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said it was the first of September? Do you mean any other month?</p>
               <p>Dale. This is September, is it not?</p>
               <p>Court. No, it is December.</p>
               <p>Dale. Well, December then if you please to call it; it was the first of December.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he did know the cutters?</p>
               <p>Dale. I heard so.</p>
               <p>James l'Homme. I live in Wilk-street, Spitalfields. I have known the prisoner five or six years. He worked for the warehouse where I am foreman. He was a very hard working man, very honest, and very civil. He has earned upwards of 50 l. a year, one year with another, sickness and changing work, altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he work with you in September last?</p>

I believe it was half an hour past eleven at night, when I came from thence. I kept the open street through St. Martin's le grand into Newgate-street, and crossed into St. Paul's Church-yard and up Fleet-street. Just as I was near <placeName id="t17691206-32-crimeloc194">Apollo-court</placeName>

As I was near the chymist's shop the prisoner Shepherd, laid hold of my arm, and said where are you going my dear? I had had rather more liquor than I should have, but not drunk. I said, I was going home; she pulled me into the passage. (I lodge in the court). There we stopped. Mr. Baileys came past me. We moved a little higher, just under a lighted lamp; he past up and down again into Fleet-street; he came up a second time; when he got to the end of the court, she snapped out my watch; I said, Madam, you have robbed me of my watch; she immediately called out, Watch and Murder! Before any body came to my assistance Mr. Baileys fell to knocking me about the head, in order to knock me down. I was very sore upon my jaw, for a week after. I heard some body at the bottom of the court. I called out, For God's sake, do aid and assist, for I am robbed of my watch! There were two chairmen; one of them, named Johnson, came up, and took hold of Baileys; just as he came Shepherd got out of my hands; I charged the watch with him and the woman, and they charged me; so there was charge for charge. I was taken to the watch-house in Temple-lane. My watch was found after that when I was in the watch-house. When we went before the sitting alderman at Guildhall, the man that had it of a girl, was ordered to keep it in his care till the trial here.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last before?</p>
               <p>Maud. I had seen it just before I came out of the house in Goswell-street. I had not spoke to any body, except bidding a watchman a good night. When Shepherd said, Stop a little, I want to speak with you; I thought it had been a neighbour that lives in the court next door to a shopmate of mine; she is supposed to be a person of ill character, though never to my knowledge went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you stopped in the court, before Baileys came up?</p>
               <p>Maud. He came up directly; she stood against the wall, and I facing her; she shoved against me, and asked me if I would do something or other, at the time she took my watch. Baileys had been up once or twice in the court; if he was up in the court at the time she took it, he was up in a corner out of sight; as soon as she had taken my watch he came up as soon as possible any body could; in a quarter of a minute; he came upon her crying out; he never asked me what was the matter, but began driving me about under each ear.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Baileys before?</p>
               <p>Maud. No: I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he came up had you not Shepherd by the hair of her head?</p>
               <p>Maud. No: I never laid hands upon her before she cried murder; I never struck her nor beat her.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the first word Baileys said to you?</p>
               <p>Maud. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, Don't murder the woman?</p>
               <p>Maud. I do not remember he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, D - n you, I'll serve you the same?</p>
               <p>Maud. I did not: I never was guilty of swearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not strike Mr. Baileys?</p>
               <p>Maud. No: I did not, upon no part of him; I only held the woman.</p>

             that night was in Bell-yard, at the Haunch of venison, drinking at the bar; that was about half an hour after eleven; they went out of the house directly; I staid in the house may be a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I never saw him before to my knowledge; they stood by me near the space of ten minutes; after that I saw Shepherd and Maud go into the court together about ten minutes after I came out of the house, which was about a quarter of an hour after the two prisoners went out of the house; at the time Maud and Shepherd went into the court together, Baileys was standing with his back against the chymist's door; and when Maud and the woman had been in the court about two minutes, she began to cry Watch and Murder! then Baileys whipped from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060030"/> the door into the court, and sell to abusing Maud, beating him. I saw him strike him more than once; I went and took him by the collar, and pulled him from Maud; Shepherd strove to make her escape; the watchman in the street stopped her, and brought her back into Apollo-court. Maud charged the watch with her, for stealing his watch; going up the street to the watch-house, which is almost to St. Dunstan's church, the watch was found lying on a rail by a girl of the town; I saw her take it up; I asked her to give it me, and she did.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was it found to Apollo-court?</p>
               <p>Johnson. As near as I can guess, it was about one hundred yards distant. (The watch produced and deposed to.) I secured her in that watch-house, and the next morning we went before the sitting alderman at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. from Baileys. I went in and treated a woman in the alehouse with a glass of rum, whether there were not many women there?</p>
               <p>Johnson. There was another girl of the town in the house, but there were nobody drinking at the bar at that time, but the two prisoners; and more than that the woman at the bar fell out with another woman, and struck her in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Had you looked at your watch after you came out of the house in Goswell-street?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No: but when she and I were together I felt something taken out of my pocket as plain as possible.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take particular notice of them when you saw them going up the court?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I said to my partner, there was something going forward in that court; and I knew her again when I saw her in the watch-house afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear Baileys say any thing?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He said, you rogue, you rascal, I'll learn you to use a woman ill.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Maud doing to the woman?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I do not know. I never saw him strike her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Maud strike Baileys?</p>
               <p>Johnson. No, I did not. Upon my pulling Baileys from Maud, Shepherd ran away, and ran as far as Chancery-lane end, and the watchman brought her back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other woman up the court?</p>
               <p>Johnson. No.</p>
               <p>

            . I am a chairman, and ply at the Temple. I and my partner Johnson were talking together; I saw Maud and the woman at the bar come together, and turned into Apollo-court. I believe they might go about two yards up the court; after that my partner said to me, Do you see that man and woman go into the court? I said, I am looking at them; I did not know that you saw them. After that Baileys walked up the court by where they stood, and came down again, and fixed his back up against Mr. Buckle's door. three doors from where they were; presently Maud charged the girl with taking his watch; she began to cry out. I did not hear him charge her, but he said he had charged her afterwards. Then Baileys ran into the court, and said, D - n you, you rascal, I'll teach you to use a woman ill. My partner ran in and the woman ran out, and made her escape towards Chancery-lane end. Maud said, Stop that woman, she has got my watch! and other people called, Stop her, Stop her!</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Maud strike Baileys?</p>
               <p>Hunt. No, I did not: neither did I see Baileys strike him. I was not in the court. I saw nobody but Maud, the woman, and Baileys go into the court.</p>
               <p>Bailey's Defence.</p>
               <p>On the 31st of October, after I left Mr. How's house, to whom I am Clerk, which I believe was about eight o'clock, I went to see the new entertainment, called The Jubilee; then I went to a very genteel public-house; I had a pint of beer and a Welch rabbit, and came in order to go home. Just as I came to Temple-bar, a girl accosted me, and asked me to give her a dram, which I did; after that I came out and proceeded on my way to go home; first of all I turned up a court to make water, then went in order to go home; I had not gone but a few yards before another woman catched hold of me, and accosted me as usual; I pushed her away; I was apprehensive I should get my pocket picked; a moment was not past before I heard a most horrid cry of murder. I looked round, and saw Maud had hold of a woman by the hair of her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060031"/> head, beating he in a most cruel manner. I catched hold of him and said, For God's sake don't murder her! you don't know what may happen; he struck me on my breast; said he, Do you know that woman that has robbed me of my watch? I said, if she has you had better take her to the watch-house; said he, I will, and I'll take you for striking me; when we came to the watch-house, some where by St. Dunstan's church, I asked what I was come there for; he said, for striking me; then I said we must go through a due course of law. I was conducted to the counter, and the next day before the alderman at Guildhall; there was quite a different story told before the alderman than what was said the night before. Mr. How thought it very odd I was not at the office; Mr. Pain went there, and knowing I am of a good family, and of reputation, I was bailed. I hope your lordship and gentlemen will never suppose a young fellow of my character will ever enter into a case of this sort, if I had known it first of all. I said, if I had known the case, I would have taken care and avoided it. I believe in going from the place, I was conducted by a watchman on each side of me, that must know it was impossible for me to put the watch where it was found. I met a woman going to master's office since; she asked me if I was not in trouble about that affair; she said she saw a tall woman put the watch on the ledge. I do not know whether she is here or not.</p>
               <p>Shepherd's Defence.</p>
               <p>Going along by Temple-bar I saw some women run away together. The man came out and said, You are one that robbed me of my watch; he made a blow at my head, and catched hold of my hair, and put his hand in my mouth, and beat me in a most inhuman manner. I called, Watch and murder; nobody came; then this man came (meaning her fellow prisoner); he said, What do you do to this woman? Said he, if you want to know, I'll serve you the same; I got out of his hands; he said, Stop her, she has got my watch. I never saw the watch.</p>

            . I live in Little Britain; my husband is a watch-spring maker. I was coming by a little after eleven o'clock accidentally. I heard a noise; I stopped as a great many more did; I saw an uproar, and as I stood I saw a woman lay something down; as I stood at Bull-head-court by Temple-bar, there was fighting and crying out murder, and knocking down, and I saw another woman take it up after they were gone. She laid it down upon the jett of a window-shutter, and said, Here is the watch; I did not see it. I did not see the woman's face that laid it down. It was a tallish woman. I cannot say whether it was the woman at the bar or no.</p>

               <p>Poor. On the beginning of August I went to bed about ten o'clock. I cannot take upon me to give a particular account of the day; it was on a Tuesday, at night. My wife and I had been about an hour and an half in bed: I could not, nor did not sleep; but we lay and slumbered. We heard a great noise of people coming up stairs; they came thundering and rapping at the outward door of the house. At the passage coming in, they cried out,

            , you old whore, open the door! Poor, you son of a whore, open the door! or we will break it in. My wife said, My dear, stay in bed, and don't get up, for they will have more tenderness and mercy on a woman than on a man. I thought to get up, but she would not let me. They kept still crying, Blast you! you whore! you roghe! let us in! or we will tear down the door. Gentlemen, said she, have patience, give me leave to put on my petticoats; for you don't know whether I have a smock on. Blast your eyes! said they again, you never was without one. They kept rapping at the door before she would give them entrance. Gentlemen, at last, said she, be easy, and I will open the door. Then she came out and opened the door. We lay up one-pair-of stairs. She did not go down stairs after we came out of our chamber. Our street door is on our right hand, within about two feet of the chamber door. We heard them come up stairs; there is no outward door; they kept thundering at my room door. There is no fastening but only my room door. You come up one-pair-of stairs, the door is right before you. When the door is open, there is a little passage on the right hand to go into the shop by my room. I can't tell how many came in; but I can tell how many went out. I saw them all go out. They went into the shop where all the looms and work were. I did not go up till I heard the weight stones fall. Then I went and held my room door in my hand. My wife was then in the shop with them. I believe the stones fell in about two minutes after they were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell the jury the use of the weight-stones.</p>
               <p>Poor. They are to keep the work stiff to work. The weight is hung to the cane roll. I believe there may be about three quarters of a hundred weight, or near a hundred weight upon the roll.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might they continue in the work shop?</p>
               <p>Poor. I believe they were there about eight or ten minutes. They past near me when they came out. I saw seven come out in the whole. The prisoner was one of them; he, and two more of them, came in about two steps into my chamber, and shook hands with my wife, and said, Good night, mother Poor. I am sure he was one of them, as sure as I am here. I had hold of the door at the time. My wife was standing just on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side does your door open, within or without?</p>
               <p>Poor. My door opens within side. I was just by the door, with my head looking out at the door, which was about half open; she came back out of the workshop when the first of them came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Poor. I have known him, I believe, about four years and a quarter. I have eat and drank in his company sundry and sundry times.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any light in the house?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060033"/>Poor. No, I had not. I had only a large window. After this they all came down, and went out, and cryed out, Blast your eyes! are you all out? and fixed a shot. They spoke hoarse, like a boatswain of a man of war.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any weapons in the hands of them?</p>
               <p>Poor. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say there was light enough to distinguish their faces?</p>
               <p>Poor. There was: I saw them, in a manner the same, almost, as I see you now. I could not otherwise chose but see them. After they were gone, I struck a light, and went into the workshop. There were some pieces all lying about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner speak with a feigned voice, when he spoke to your wife?</p>
               <p>Poor. No, he did not, he spoke in a common way. I knew it to be his voice at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was every thing right when you went to bed the night before?</p>
               <p>Poor. They were all right and fit for working. The reed and things were all in their proper places, and when I went into the room, after they were gone, I found the work cut, hanging, some by one cord, and some by another. It was cut cross. It was bombazeen. The cane was all silk. Those things in my hand are what they call harness, that we work with, and this is the deed produced in court, the harness broke, the reed beat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not there worsted in bombazeen?</p>
               <p>Poor. It is shot down with worsted. There was about half a yard or three quarters of a yard of it made. It was silk and worsted when made; that was rolled upon the roll; that that was cut was the warping, joining to that that was completely made; about a yard distance from that that was cut, consisted of all silk; that that was made and rolled on the roll, was then not worth a pin to make any use of it. It was not worth a penny to any one, without to any poor body to make a pinch of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you call the harness a tool or a tackle?</p>
               <p>Poor. This is that that makes the work that goes up and down. We tread it up and down with out feet, and we strike the reed in at every shoot. They belong to Mr. Horton, and the silk belongs to him. The reed is not worth a pin now. They gave it a cut with a hanger, besides the beading of it. I found it worse than it is now. It was like the screw of a bottle. (probably he meant a cork-screw) I saw the prisoner after he was taken before Sir

               <p>Q. Are you an Irishman?</p>

             I applied so often to him it is almost hard for me to tell. About seven or eight days after the last day of August, my husband went to some of these men; he said, he was not at the cutting of them. I said to the prisoner it is so long ago my husband dare not work, and my curtains, and my bed, and things were all destroyed; What must I do? He said, I will speak to them, and do what is in my power.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by them?</p>
               <p>M. Poor. I mean the committee of weavers and cutters; and I related my distress; I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060036"/> gone to the committee several times; one time in particular I saw Horsford there, at the Duke of Northumberland's head, at the end of Gun-street; I went in with a journeyman of ours. I said, How do you do, Mr. Horsford? He said the same; he said, I want to speak to you, mother; I said, what do you want to say? said he, if you will be upstairs I'll tell you. I said, I have been called whore and b - h, I did not care to go up for such usage.</p>
               <p>On M. Poor's cross examination she spoke to the following purport.</p>
               <p>"She said, she hears by the two journeymen, the silk was cut on the 8th of August; that the cutters were all her acquaintance for four years past; that she could have known the prisoner in the darkest corner in London; that she saw him by the light of the stars and the light of the moon, what moon there was, so plain that she could not be deceived; that after they were out of her house, she saw them go into a neighbour's house as plain as she then saw the counsel that asked her questions; that she saw them when in her shop; that the shop was nothing but glass; that there were seven or eight of them; that after they were out of her house they fired a pistol, and said, all was well; that she had always said there were seven or eight of them; that there were several others in the shop besides the cutters, and one of them lay dead asleep; that her husband had either four or five journeymen, she could not tell which; that three of them laid in the shop.

Being asked how she came to be so flurried at the latter end and so cool at the beginning, she said knowing them all perfectly well she was not much frighted; that she was flurried upon seeing her bread going; she could not say she saw their weapons when they shook hands with her; that the last man that shook hands with her was Valline to the best of her knowledge; that Mahoney was the first, because he kept her with his hands till she came out of the shop with him; that the ninth of August, the next night, she did not go to bed at all, she was afraid of her life; that she could not directly tell the day of the month, she first gave information of the affair; she believed it might be a fortnight after. Being asked, when it was she was sent to Bridewell, she said she was sent to Clerkenwell Bridewell long and long and long after her goods were cut; that she was sent to Bridewell for assaulting Doyle and another; that before that she had not gone to a justice of the peace and given information; that she made the information the same night that she was sent to Bridewell; that she had spoke to other people about it, and she was both hungry and dry, and she begged of people to put her in the way of it; that at their cutting the work out, they said they would begin with Champion's the next night. Being asked what reason she had to think they would cut Mr. Horton's rather than Mr.Champion's work, she said there were two that worked for Mr. Champion, and they would save their own master's work; none of them worked for Mr. Horton; that she did not give notice to Mr. Champion, that his work was to be cut the next night, being afraid of her life; that she laid at Limehouse seventeen nights; that the shop was so light she could see to know a man's face; that she could not have seen a mouse or rat. Being asked, if it was light enough in the shop to see a cat, she said, indeed, she did not observe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060037"/> her eye was not upon the ground; it was at their faces; that she did not speak to none of her journeymen; but she saw Clark get out of bed, and run towards the other end of the shop, and he told her, and her husband afterwards, he got under a bed, and the women made game of him; that she saw him as plain as she then saw the council that asked her questions. Being asked how much money she asked not to make information against the cutters; said she never asked any, but did desire Mr. Horton to pay fifty-three shillings, on account of the loom; but she was offered thirty guineas by

               <p>That very night, when the goods were cut at mother Poor's house, I was at a house in Old-street-road; I think it is the Sign of the Well and Bucket. I went on account of a woman that was taken on a warrant, with intent to be one of her bail; as I was going I met the constable, or at least the head-borough, coming back. I knew him. I said, how do you do? be said, Is it you Horsford? I said, yes. He told me, he had been and left the woman in Bridewell. Then I went back with him to that house, and staid-there from eight o'clock, till between one and two the next morning, being the ninth; there was one Mr.

               <p>Barton. I declare to God he never was out of the house in that time, without he went out to make water; he was not missing five minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you very intimate?</p>

               <p>Barton. I paid my share of the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Which way did Horsford go?</p>
               <p>Barton. I can give no manner of account which way he went when he left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose custody has this warrant been in since?</p>
               <p>Barton. It has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the person's name that was with you and Horsford?</p>

Then he said he would go to the half-way house, the Well-and-bucket; we went there, and, from the time we went in, it was above a quarter of an hour past one in the morning before we went away.</p>

               <p>Q. WHAT is your reason for remembering the time?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. My particular reason for remembering the time, is, because Mr. Horton's foreman asked me if all was well; and afterwards said he had been at two or three places, and his master's work was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention where the work was cut?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. No, he did not; he said that night and that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your conversation while together at the Well-and-bucket?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. We talked of bailing the woman, he asked if we were house-keepers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know either of you before?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. He knew Horsford very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What other conversation had you?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. There were several things talked about. We talked sometimes about one thing, and sometimes about another.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect any?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. We talked about Wilkes and trade. There was a gentleman, on the right side of the fire-place, talked about geograffee, or geograffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Were no relations talked about?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. Mr. Barton asked Mr. Horsford about his grandmother, or his wife's grandmother.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the reckoning?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. I believe I paid part of it. I always do, if I have money. I am sure I paid some of it, but cannot recollect how much.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pots of beer had you?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. I can't tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you half a dozen?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. We had, I believe, more than half a dozen. I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Horsford pay part of the reckoning?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. I am certain he did, but do not remember what; I know the reckoning was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the constable pay any thing towards it?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. I am not sure whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain as to knowing the time of the night?</p>
               <p>Fitzharris. I have a very good reason for knowing that, there being a moment hand, or second hand, upon the clock. I went and took observation of it while the hand was going round<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060043"/> one minute, then it was past one o'clock. I am certain it was ten minutes past and above.</p>

I could not see the loom, it was so dark. I felt the work was cut. I could not distinguish a man from a woman then. My shop-mate that lay with me, told me they had been gone half an hour.</p>

               <p>Stevens. No, I am sure she did not. Clark came to me without a candle, in his shirt, and told me it was my shop mate's work, that lay in the bed with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was that loom to your bed?</p>
               <p>Stevens. It was within about two yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed that night?</p>

               <p>Stevens. I did, the harness was cut a-cross, and the reed bent quite double, and the silk cut beyond the harness.</p>

               <p>Stevens. I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the noise of the cutters coming in?</p>
               <p>T. Clark. Yes, sir, I got up.</p>

               <p>Clark. I could not distinguish any thing in their hands, the night was so execussive dark. I was in the shop all the time. I could not see any thing that they did, or any one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see as well as your mistress could see?</p>
               <p>Clark. I could see as well as she.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you near your mistress?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you stay in the room till she went back again?</p>
               <p>Clark. I did. When the cutters were gone, I went up to the loom on the right hand towards the window. I could not perceive any damage done to the loom; it was so dark I could see nothing. I called another of my shop-mates, who was asleep all the time the cutters were there. We could not see, but we felt and groped about. We could not see to distinguish any person. Was my own father there I could not have seen him from another man. Neither the colour of their clothes, nor their hair.</p>

               <p>Q. You say the cutters came in before your mistress.</p>
               <p>Clark. I could not see her come in, but I heard her voice. I got out of my bed before they came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060044"/>Q. How come you to get out of your bed then?</p>
               <p>Clark. To get out of their way. I knew they were coming.</p>
               <p>Q. By what?</p>
               <p>Clark. I heard my mistress say the day before, she expected them, that they would come at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what they said when in the room?</p>
               <p>Clark. I cannot recollect what they said. Neither can I tell who let them in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you afraid of them?</p>
               <p>Clark. I was not. I knew they would not hurt me, nor no-body that was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so?</p>
               <p>Clark. I have no reason, but I knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, Why did you get out of bed?</p>
               <p>Clark. I heard they would cut the work at the upper end, and I was afraid they would come to that place. I got out of bed to save that work from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose work was it they were for cutting?</p>
               <p>Clark: It was Mr. Horton's work. Mrs. Poor told me they were to cut that particular work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think it more likely they would cut the work near the door, or farther from the door?</p>
               <p>Clark. That was Walker's work that I went to save.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know they came to cut Walker's work.</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whose work did you get out of bed to save?</p>
               <p>Clark. I got out of bed to save Mr. Thompson's work. I heard they were come to cut Mr. Walker's work and Mr. Thompson's. Mrs. Poor said so that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body desire you to save Mr. Walker's work?</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you prefer Mr. Walker's work to Mr. Horton's? Did you desire them not to cut that work you went to save?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means was you to save it?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to them when they were cutting Mr. Horton's work?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, I did not. I heard them say, Mr. Horton did not give a price for his work.</p>
               <p>Q. What has Mr. Horton to do with Mr. Poor's Journeymen?</p>
               <p>Clark. He has nothing to do with them. It was, that he did not pay Mr. Poor price enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, Did Mr. Walker pay a better price than Mr. Horton?</p>
               <p>Clark. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you place yourself when you ran to save this work?</p>
               <p>Clark. I placed myself down towards the bottom of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew they could not see you, How could they find you out, to ask you whose work it was?</p>
               <p>Clark. No answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any bed that a man might escape under?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you under that?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, I was not. I stood up in the shop. I got out of bed before the cutters came in at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not joked afterwards with running away from a woman in her shift?</p>
               <p>Clark. That was some time after the cutters came in that I saw her in her shift.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cutters ask whose work was in the loom?</p>
               <p>Clark. They asked whose work is this, and whose work is this?</p>
               <p>Q. Who did they ask?</p>
               <p>Clark. The man in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the man in bed?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they could see the man in bed?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did they ask? they could not see you?</p>
               <p>Clark. I said that was Mr. Horton's, and that was Mr. Thompson's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell me you never spoke to them? You said they never asked you, or else you would have spoke. Did not you say you never spoke to them?</p>
               <p>Clark. No answer.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Whether your mistress was the person that was spoke to by them, and whether she spoke to them?</p>
               <p>Clark. They wished her a good night when they went out, and that is all I can recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060045"/>Q. Did not they ask her whose work this was, and whose work that was?</p>
               <p>Clark. I don't recollect that they asked her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then who did they ask?</p>
               <p>Clark. They asked me when I was towards the farther end of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of them come there?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, Sir, they went all over the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they, or did they not come to the farther end of the shop, where you was?</p>
               <p>Clark. Yes, sir, and all over the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they near you, when they asked you about the looms?</p>
               <p>Clark. They were pretty near me. They said, they would not cut that.</p>
               <p>Q. How many cutters were in the room?</p>
               <p>Clark. I believe there were more than two or three, but how many I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How many voices did you hear?</p>
               <p>Clark. I heard the voice of but one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that one?</p>
               <p>Clark. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they stop at all before they went down stairs?</p>
               <p>Clark. I do not think they did; I can't be sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them say any thing after they went out of the room?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, I did not hear them; the whole of what they said was, Whose loom is this, and whose loom is this? and they bad them a good night when they went away; and God bless you!</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body meddled with in the place, or molested?</p>

            . I remember the night the loom was cut; I said in the very next room to Mrs. Poor, in a room that I rent. I heard the cutters come up, and I arose immediately out of my bed, and looked through a hole in my own door, and there I stood. Their door and mine are within two feet and a half of one another.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see when you looked?</p>
               <p>Downs. I could see nothing it was so dark. I could not distinguish one man from another. I could not know a person's face, or any thing. I staid all the time in my shirt looking to them:</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you looking to them all the time til they went down from the time they came up?</p>
               <p>Clark. I was. I stood there to hearken to them. I heard them knock at the door, and desire them to open the door. She arose and opened the door. She said, coming Gentlemen, and unlocked, and unbolted it, and they came through, and went into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them speak?</p>
               <p>Clark. I never heard them say a word; they only knocked at the door. I did not hear them say one single word till they went away; her room was between me and the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a hole was it that you looked through?</p>
               <p>Clark. It was a large hole, above an inch long; an old large key-hole around one. I declare to God I don't know how many there were; I know there were more than one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see a woman in her shift?</p>
               <p>Clark. I did not: whatever they said in the shop I could not hear.</p>

            . I think it was on the twenty-seventh of September, about nine in the morning. Mr. Dean's son came to my house to acquaint me, that Mr. Poor had moved his bed away, and his wife was in Bridewell, and Mr. Dean was gone to Sturbridge-fair. I collect rents for Mr. Dean at my leisure time; I went directly and went into Poor's shop; there I made a distress for the deficiency of rent, two pounds thirteen shillings and four-pence, to September the 15th; when I had just began the inventory. Mrs. Poor came in. She asked me what business I had there. I told her I wanted the rent, and if she would pay me, I had no business there. She told me she had no money, how should she pay, we have no work? and made such excuses and was very hard, &amp;c. at last she came to words, and said she would blow my brains out; whereupon I was obliged to send for an officer; then she became more peaceable. When I had almost finished, she said she knew seventeen of the cutters, and she would hang them, except they would give her thirty pounds. She said she had got Doyle fast. I said, suppose they will not give you thirty pounds. She said then they might do as they pleased, for she would never appear against them.</p>

               <p>Q. What might be the value of all their goods together?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060046"/>Sykes. What I sold I sold for three guineas. I never saw many more goods in the house, tho' I have been in the house an hundred times.</p>
               <p>Q. What, in your opinion, were all their goods worth?</p>
               <p>Sykes. I do not suppose all were worth above ten shillings more than what I sold them for.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they worth six pounds?</p>
               <p>Sykes. No, nor four: no broker would ever give four pounds for all the goods they had in the house, looms and all; they were valued at three pounds three shillings, and I sold them for that.</p>
               <p>The jury withdrew with the warrant that was produced by Barton. When they returned the foreman told the court, that by observing it by the light the date so med to be the 5th, which had afterwards been made into a figure of 8, upon which they had sent a private messenger to Bridewell for the commitment of

            ; he is gone off; they broke the warehouse door, and got in there.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was the outward door broke?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. They had forced the door so that the lock had flew down the entry about eight yards, where I found it with the key in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed over night?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. I went to bed about eleven o'clock. The door was then locked and bolted with two bolts. When they broke in I heard the door fly open, and I heard something fall in the entry at the time, which, I believe, was the lock. Then I heard them beating against the warehouse door, which fell down I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of your house is your warehouse door?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. That is about a yard, or a yard and a half within the street door, on the right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that been fastened over night?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. I had fastened that, and had the key in my pocket; in a few minutes after they were gone I went down, and went into the warehouse, and found it cleared of every thing partly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go into any other room?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. I believe they did not. I did not find any body had been in the parlour; the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. I missed a parcel of raw silk; I believe about fifteen pounds weight of different sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. The value about twenty-five or twenty-six pounds. I missed some dyed silk, about ten or fifteen pounds weight, worth about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060047"/> twenty shillings a pound. I missed some silk triming; there might be about two or three hundred yards of it; the value about twopence or three pence a yard. I missed some black and scarlet gimp, about two or three hundred yards of that, the value about twopence or three-pence a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these goods before?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. I had seen them over night; as for the trimmings I had made them up for an order, and left them on the counter in the warehouse over night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you quit the warehouse over night?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. About ten o'clock; the dyed silk was in a glass case, which they broke down, and the raw silk was hanging on a peg.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of the men?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. No, I did not. I was afraid they would have come up, but they did not. When I went down I found my street door broke all to pieces, and the warehouse door lying along in the entry; the bolts remained on the door but the staples were flown out.</p>
               <p>Q. What number do you think there were of them?</p>
               <p>Cromwell. I can't tell what number.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you go there for?</p>

               <p>Q. Did any other persons go with you?</p>
               <p>Haines. Yes, there might be about eight or nine of us; we all went upon that agreement. It was about twelve at night when we went there; some had cutlasses, some had pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. What had the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Haines. I can't be positive whether he had any thing in his hand or not; we broke open the door of the house, and broke the door of the warehouse, and went into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all go into the warehouse?</p>
               <p>Haines. I cannot be positive who went into the warehouse, because it was all dark; there might be three or four in; we all cut and destroyed some lace and trimmings; we took some raw silk away; I can't justly say what quantity; some to make trimmings of.</p>
               <p>Q. How much raw silk?</p>

            . I should have thought there were nine or ten of them. When they drawed nearer the house then I was rather afraid; by drawing nearer, and crying out, for I heard the prisoner's tongue, Blast you, fire! Fire blast you, fire! I particularly heard Carmichael, for I knew him. I cannot say I could know any voice in particular besides him. There was, Blast your eyes and limbs, stand still, or I'll shoot your brains out, by G - d.</p>

            . I can't say how near; I heard his voice very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the watchman's stand to the house?</p>
               <p>Haines. It is about twenty yards from the house. The prisoner was at some distance from the house. It was towards the watch-house that I heard his voice. I have served the prisoner silk, out of Mr. Cromwell's warehouse, several times. I have known him about three years; he was a workman to Mr. Cromwell, and often came to his shop. Sometimes I have seen him come there two or three times a week: sometimes every day. I heard them strike with great violence against the outward door. They first struck at the parlour window, but there is a crossbar in the inside shutter, and they could not get in there. I heard every beat from first to last. The blows were like as if with a sledge-hammer. In about three blows they struck off the lock from the door, it flew to the stair foot; then it appeared to me they struck four or five blows before the bolts came off; then they fired into the passage as soon as the door was burst open; then I heard them chop at the warehouse door; it appeared as if they were chopping, and it looked afterwards as if they had chopped. I heard them huzza, and Carmichael cry, Blast you! fire, when in the house: The sash windows in the warehouse were all smash'd; that I suppose they did,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060049"/> at the time they were taking the goods out; the firing was without side after; there were some within, they fired at the gentlewoman's window that lodges in the next room to me. There are four rooms on a floor. There were bits contanings picked up in that room, that were fired in.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pistols were fired while they were in the house?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there three times?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. I should think three times half a dozen. There was some glass out of which they took the dyed silk; that glass was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. How came you to tell me you was sorry for me, after I had been at Sir John Fielding's, and was cleared?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. I spoke less than I knew by a great deal. After the prisoner was acquitted before Sir John, he came by Mr. Cromwell's house. I went to the door; he nodded his head to me and I to him. He said, Ah, here I am, blast you! and pointed his finger. Said I, You are a cruel fellow, how could you say I tried to s cragg you? Said I, I really could have done it, but I kept away, you good for nothing scoundrel; the voice I heard that presented a pistol, and said sit still, or stand still/, or you are a dead man, by G - d. I knew that voice. He said before the justice, I am a poor distressed fellow. I said I am sorry for you, you have distressed yourself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever work for Mr. Cromwell after he was acquitted?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. He came for work the next day, and I said, how can you come to ask for work? you see the man is ruined by a pack of rascals: he said, Do you mean me; madam? Then he turned about to the rest of the folks and said, G - d d - n them, What cruelty is here! How they have broke the door! I believe he did not work for Mr. Cromwell after this, for there was nothing to serve him with.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did work for him after.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my stand was near Mr. Cromwell's house in Moorfields. I remember his house was broke open about three months or eleven weeks ago; they came between one and two in the night, near one; as near as I can guess there might be sixteen or eighteen of them. I had cried past one. A gentleman came to the watch-house for a light over the fields; I went to light him over the fields. There were two men ran over the fields' crying, Lord have mercy upon me! I said to the Gentleman, let us go back. They shut the watch-house door. I was out, and could not get in.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is that watch house from Mr. Cromwell's door?</p>
               <p>Tarrant. It is about forty yards. A man sat down by my right side, and pulled my hat over my eyes, and there he held me all the time. I did not see any of their faces, neither did I know either of their tongues. The gentleman that was going over the fields got into the watch-house, but I could not. This man that sat down by me was one of the sixteen or eighteen.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue holding your hat over your eyes?</p>
               <p>Tarrant. About ten or twelve minutes; they fired away over my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the noise of breaking?</p>
               <p>Tarrant. No, I did not; after that they opened the watch-house door and let me in; then one of the men said, do you stand at the door? we do not want to hurt none of you. Who they were I do not know. One of them said, D - n your eyes, we do not want to hurt you! he bid me stand at the door, and keep it shut, that is the watch-house door; they fired through the watch-house window, there is the mark it made now. When they went away I lighted the gentleman over the fields; after that I went with my light to Mr. Cromwell's house, and found it as they say. I do not know that ever I saw the prisoner before I saw him at Justice Fielding's in my life.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Moorfields. This watch-house is about five doors from Mr. Cromwell's house.</p>

               <p>Hickey. I believe it is about an hundred yards distance. I believe it is either eleven or twelve weeks ago this night I was in the watch-house. They would not admit us out; they kept firing upon us. There were our watchmen in the watch-house, and we dare not come out; there was only one man spoke; he blasted our eyes, and d - d, and bid us put our lights out; we put out our lights; there was nothing but blasting and swearing, and such like as that.</p>

               <p>Cromwell. I received information by Haines that the goods were carried to Baker's in Hoxton. I found some silk at Baker's, a damask silk, which I know to be mine; and is what I had in my own house over night. It is a dyed silk.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the robbery was it that you found it?</p>

               <p>Q. to Whiffen. When was the first you declared to any body that you knew his voice?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. That was about three weeks or a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it as you did know his voice, that you did not speak of it before?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. Because he abused me, and told me I had a mind to scragg him; then I said you are a cruel man, If I had a mind to have done it I could have done it; he had not injured my property, and I did not mention it before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he committed for?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. He was committed for assaulting and abusing me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell the justice of the peace that he was one of the persons in this riot?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. That was just after he had assaulted me. I told the justice of it at the time he assaulted me, so that he was committed for the assault and this at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did you complain of first?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. I went and took out the warrant for the assault; I declared before his face, that I knew his voice, and saw him with a pistol and cutlass in his hand; I saw them all. I think I distinguished his face. I said before the justice I saw him hold a pistol, or small gun to a watchman. I got a fight of his face before the lamp was broke; they put their faces up as if going to strike at the lamp; I think I saw the prisoner in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to say so now?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. I thought I was not obliged to answer particularly to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the complaint for an assault before you laid the information?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the complaint for an assault, and information made the same day, and at the same time?</p>
               <p>Whiffen. I had the warrant served; and before the justice I said you are a cruel fellow to use me so; and after that I said I knew his face.</p>
               <p>Justice Wilmot. This woman and Mr. Cromwell came on a Saturday evening. I was told a man had threatened their lives; the woman was afraid to go home; upon that I issued out a warrant: this was the Saturday before the information. I think on the Monday they brought the prisoner to the Rotation. Upon her examination she said, he threatened to beat her brains out. I asked him if he had any bail to answer that. She said to him I never thought to appear against you, but if I had appeared at Sir

            . I am a Cordwainer. I heard the cry, Stop thief! I went out and pursued. Mr. Kitchen took the piece of cloth from Smith, and I took hold of Thompson; and we brought the three prisoners back. When before the justice he asked them what they did for a living; they said they cried fish about. Smith said Mary Palmer gave her the linen to make her a gown.</p>

               <p>I had been to see an acquaintance of mine on the other side Moorfields; I could not find her. I met Palmer, she said, How do you do, Mrs. Smith? (Her mother lives in Water-lane, White-fryars ); she desired me to take this home to her mother's to make her a gown. The man came up and said, Young woman I come to you for a piece of linen. I said use me civilly and I'll go with you any where; and I delivered the linen to him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Kitchen. Were they running or walking when you saw them?</p>
               <p>Kitchen. They were walking; they were almost at Westley's preaching place going to Moorfields, about 100 yards from Mr. Taylor's; I ran as hard as ever I could.</p>

            . On Tuesday night, the 7th of last November, I was at my door. I heard the cry, Stop thief! I went to see what was the matter. I met the prisoner with a pair of child's stockings in his hand. I asked him how he came by them. He said he picked them up in the kennel. I asked him if he had any thing more about him; he said, no. I took him into the shop, and upon examining him there were two pieces of silk and cotton handkerchiefs dropped from under his coat, by his side. (Produced in court.)</p>

I was then going to see after a place, when the gentlewoman ran out and called, Stop thief! I saw a lad run out of the shop, and scatter things all about. I ran after him and picked these things up; they were all over mud. It was not this woman but a shorter woman that came out of the shop. I went up the court with her, and picked up seven or eight stockings, and brought them into the shop; then I picked up another pair of stockings; and that gentleman asked me where I was going. I said I was going into the shop; then she came and catched hold of me in the court, and said I was the man that was in the shop, buying a pair of buttons. I was searched and no buttons found upon me.</p>

There were a quantity of silver and metal watches in the window, and a glass case full of watches and cases: in the front there were about 44 or 45 watches in the front and window; in one case are 81 hooks, and in another 36, all full of watches and cases. What I have said in the indictment I am able to swear to: a gold watch, a watch with the inside metal, covered with shagreen, a watch with a gold dial plate, the inside and outside cases metal, and cover'd with tortoishel, 60 silver watches; there were more lost, I believe; and about 60 watch-cases.

            15 pair of them were found upon the prisoner, some of which weighed two ounces and five pennyweights; they are marked upon the edge the same as the watches strap were out at the workmen's; and we have the movements to answer. I left all these things that I have mentioned in the shop, and my apprentice in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there first in the morning?</p>
               <p>Turner. My apprentice; he went between seven and eight, and came again immediately to me, and told me the shop was broke open, and all the watches were gone. I immediately went to the shop and found it so. I thought most likely they might be heard of in Duke's-place. I went there to Mr. Howard, who keeps a coffee-house, and told him the case; and told him if he found any such things offered with which names and numbers, he should be obliged to him if he would let me know. Then I went to Sir

I went that night to goldsmith's hall, and got hand-bills sent out, and employed some of Sir John's men, but did not find any thing. My shop I found broke on the Thursday morning, and on the Friday, the day after, I had word from Mr. Howard to come to him. I went. He said, Mr. Turner, Have you lost any cases as well as watches? I said, a great many; said he, are any of them very heavy? I said, Yes, very remarkably so. Soon came in Mr. Keys the Constable. Mr. Howard said to him, where are them cases? He pulled them out tied up in a handkerchief; there seemed to be a large quantity of them; he put them on the table. I said these are all mine, I can swear to them. How came you by them? He said one

I asked him how he came by these cases that were found upon him; he said some man brought them to him to sell. I asked him who. He said he did not know, and would not give me an answer.

             and Keys were by at the time. This was on the Friday, between eleven and twelve. We went from there to Guildhall; we could not be heard there; then we went to the mansion-house. Mr. Alderman Stevenson was there. The prisoner said to the same purport before him, that some man brought them, and he would not resolve any particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might you lose?</p>
               <p>Turner. I think upwards of an hundred watches besides the cases. I cannot tell exactly my loss; it is above what I have put it in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way do you think they got into your shop?</p>
               <p>Turner. The glass-case I found had been forced open with a chissel, which chissel they had left behind them. (Produced in court.). It fitted to the impressions made on the wood. I apprehend they must come in by a picklock or false key.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor, and am almost out of my time. On Wednesday the 22d of November, I left my master's shop about nine or a little after. I think the clock had struck before I came away. I left it safe.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of watches might there be in it?</p>
               <p>Wansler. I apprehend there might be about eighty watches of all sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of cases?</p>
               <p>Wansler. There were some silver watch-cases that hung up along with these watches; we had intermixed them; there were a number of them; we generally hang them up so as soon as they come from the workman, who had them for springing and lining. There were some my master put in hand that night; I apprehend there might be fifty or sixty silver-cases. The cases were numbered on the edge, and the weight wrote on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you fasten the shop up before you left it?</p>
               <p>Wansler. I made it fast as I always do. I put all the pins and bars in, and double locked the door; for a farther proof the gentleman at the tavern was standing over the way; he observed I was more particular that night to double lock it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find it the next morning?</p>
               <p>Wansler. I went the next morning about eight o'clock. I put the key in. I could not think what was the matter; at last, turning and turning I gave a push and it opened. I expected to have found it double locked, and it was only single locked. When I went into the shop I found it was stripped; there were but three watches left in the window. I could hardly believe my eyes. I went over the way and told a young man that my master's shop had been robbed, and desired to know what I had best do; he advised me to open the shop, and lock the door, and go home and let my master know of it; which I did. I found a chissel on a nest of drawers which was put under the glass-case. My master came, and I was left to take care of the shop while he inquired about.</p>

             the prisoner came to me yesterday fortnight, between ten and eleven in the day; and asked me if I would buy any watches. I asked him where he got them; he told me he had not got them; upon that I insisted upon having them. He told me there was a man had some watches to sell; and my heart was so heavy, having lost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060057"/> two hundred pounds worth of watches, and I had taken a man up, and he was cleared before my lord-mayor. I thought these were my watches. He said he did not know who had got the watches. I said, be so good as to inquire after the man, and if they are mine I'll give you ten guineas reward; he went away, and so did I. At night between six and seven he came to my house, and told me there were two men in Petticoat-lane, at the Bull-head, with a parcel of goods, he could not tell what they were, and if I would go there I should have assistance with me to stop them. I went directly and desired my brother to go and stop them, and I would go and get assistance; he went away and left me. I went to Mr. Keys, and desired him to go with me. We desired him to stop at the corner of the court, and, when he heard me call, to come in at the door. I went in and saw a man just at the entry of the door at Henry Lazrous's house. I went in; there was Mr. Lazrous sitting, and two women making an apple-pye. Mr. Lazrous said, Look about, there are some goods placed there. I looked as he directed, and saw upon the dresser some watches. I took hold o f them, and said, these are my own goods that I have been robbed of. I called the officer. I saw a man run out. I and the officer followed him; we were not able to seize him. I went into the house again, and took the watches, and put them into my pocket. I then said to Keys, may be there may be more in the house; we went up stairs, but nothing was to be found; then we took the prisoner, and in carrying him to the Poultry Compter, we went in at a public house near the Mansion-house. I took the watches out and laid them on the table, and looked them over; then I said to Mr. Keys, I do not know what I must do, these are not my watches; so I delivered Mr. Lazrous over to the officer, and I went home: that is all I have got to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you not recollect more that passed between the prisoner and you concerning these watches?</p>
               <p>Levi. I cannot; I was in such a flurry, I was quite raving mad. I shall never forget my goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no conversation with the prisoner about a bargain which he had to sell?</p>
               <p>Levi. No, Sir, he did not know where they belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say to you there was no danger in buying them?</p>
               <p>Levi. No, he said nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the watches brought down stairs in a hat?</p>
               <p>Levi. No, Sir; I can remember nothing about it, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell my lord-mayor about seeing a hat brought down full of cases?</p>
               <p>Levi. I can remember nothing about it, Sir, I was mad as could be. I thought I should have killed a woman in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the price the prisoner asked?</p>
               <p>Levi. He never asked a price for any thing.</p>
               <p>Hen. Keys. Last Thursday night, about seven or eight o'clock, the last evidence came to my house, and told me Lazrous Jacob had informed him there were two persons had a parcel of watches and watch-cases to sell. Levi desired my assistance. I went with a cutlass, and was very resolute to take them. Levi went in at the Bull-head. I was a little behind him; I heard him call out; there rushed out a man and ran away; I ran, but I fell down, or I should certainly have had him. I went in; there were some cases lying on the dresser. Mr. Lazrous said, God d - n you, if you had not made a noise, you might have taken the person. We went up stairs, and in the cellar to see if any others were secreted; we found nothing. Levi gave me charge of Lazrous, and said, may be he will give an account who brought them here. I brought him to the Compter. We went in at an alehouse: there Levi looked at the watches, and said, Lord, have mercy upon me, these are not my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that Lazrous Jacob had offered some watches, and watch-cases to Levi to sell?</p>
               <p>Keys No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did, or did not Lazrous go up stairs, and bring down a hat full of watch-cases?</p>
               <p>Keys. I saw none, because I was not in the house at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by, at that time?</p>
               <p>Keys. I was not in the house at first. When Levi had looked at them at the public house, and clapped his hands together, and said they were none of his; he gave them to me. There were fifteen double-cases and six boxes; the next morning I went to Mr. Howard's to look in the papers, if they were advertised, that the right owner might have them, and Mr. Howard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060058"/> told me they belonged to Mr. Turner. He said Mr. Turner would be there presently. I went to Fenchurch-street, and when I returned Mr. Turner was come; he claimed them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you know of a treaty about selling these watches?</p>
               <p>Keys. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know who had them in their custody?</p>
               <p>Keys. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you very ill used?</p>
               <p>Keys. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you beaten by some-body?</p>
               <p>Keys. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The most material evidence I have is Mr. Morgan, my lord-mayor's clerk; he took the account in writing these two evidences gave there; they wanted to go back from their evidence, and Mr. Morgan said you have swore it, and how can you now deny it? Mr. Morgan is not here.</p>
               <p>Keys. My lord-mayor asked me if I saw these cases in the possession of the prisoner. I said, no; for there were two or three of them that I saw lying on the dresser.</p>
