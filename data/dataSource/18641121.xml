I am a clerk in the Agra and Masterman's Bank, Nicholas-lane—the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> City of London Volunteer Rifle Corps, keep an account there—Major Richards, one of the Finance Committee, was in the habit of signing some of the cheques—this order was presented at our bank on 6th August, and I delivered to the person who presented it a cheque book containing sixty blank cheques, all marked M, 932—the person signed for the cheque book in the register—it was not the prisoner—these five cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are part of the book I delivered—this one for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid on 8th August; this for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 10th August, another for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 17th, another for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 30th August—I paid the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself; for the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, Nos. 28,865 and 28,866, and four sovereigns (<hi rend="italic">One of the notes was endorsed, "T.

                  </hi>. I am colonel of the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> London Rifle Corps—the prisoner was orderly clerk to the corps till March, 1863, when he ceased to have any connexion with it—we kept our account at the Agra and Masterman's Bank—this order is neither written by me or by my authority, nor are these five cheques—I am acquainted with the prisoner's writing; it varies very much—he writes one hand one day, and a different hand another—I have several letters of his, and my impression is that these five cheques and this order are his writing.</p>

I am an officer of the London Rifle Volunteer Corps—the prisoner was orderly clerk for a considerable time, and ceased to be in the employment of the corps in March, 1863—during all that time I was in the habit of signing cheques as a member of the Finance Committee, with Major Richards—in May, 1863, a new Finance Committee was formed—I then ceased to be a member, and signed no cheques—these five cheques were not signed by me or by my authority, nor do they purport to be—I believe this order for the cheque-book to be in the prisoner's writing—I have frequently seen him write—I have no belief as to the signatures of the cheques; they are a very bad imitation of my writing, which I should detect in a moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Can you produce any writing of mine which resembles, it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I ground my belief on constantly seeing your writing—I believe I have seen you write a name similar to this—I command a company of the regiment—I am major now—I have written company orders on the walls of the room, and my signature is well known to many of the men—I was never told by Sergeant-Major Hunt that on leaving the office you were short in your accounts, but I was told so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sergeant-major of the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> London Rifles—I know the prisoner—after he ceased to be orderly clerk, I took up the accounts, and since that time have always had charge of the bankers' pass-book—it was fetched away on the first of the month, unless that was Sunday—since the prisoner ceased to be orderly clerk, he has frequently been to the office—he called on me at head-quarters, 79, Farringdon-street, in July last, and asked me how I kept my accounts—I said, "Very simply; merely a debtor and creditor account," and I opened the drawer, took out the book, and. showed him—he said, "Suppose you want a cheque?"—I said, "Well, I get it signed and draw it"—he said, "Suppose the bankers' book is at the banker', and you want to know how much money there is at the bank?"—I said, "The cheque-book is always in my possession, and I know at any time"—he thanked me, and retired—previously to that he had been very ill, and recovered—he then came and asked me how I got on with the accounts—I showed him how I kept them, and that they were checked on the first of every month by Captain Brett, so that he was in full possession of how I kept the accounts—I recollect his coming a day or two before 6th August, he brought a letter for the adjutant, who came and spoke to him, and then retired to his room—the prisoner then asked me if I would oblige</p>

               <p>him with a sheet of note-paper—I did so—it was the common note-paper used in the office—I asked him if he required an envelope—he said, "No"—he did not write on the paper, but folded it up, put it in his pocket, and retired—I believe the paper on which the order is written to be the same sheet, it is exactly similar to the paper which was then in use—I have seen the prisoner write many times, and believe the order to be his writing—I have seen him write the signature of Major. Richards, so that I could scarcely know it—I know Major Richards' writing.</p>
               <p>

I have also been to Mr. Laurie for my office money for cleaning the office—the prisoner was not in very bad circumstances up to July—I did go and ask for money, and say that lie was almost starving, that was when I had spent a great deal; through his being ill, I was rather low.</p>

                  </hi> I am a brass finisher, of 23, Henry-street, Hampstead-road—on Saturday evening, 29th October, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I met the prisoner at the corner of Milk-street, Cheapside—she touched me on the shoulder, turned me round, and asked where I was going to—I said home—she said, "Can't you take me home with you"—I said no I could not—she was talking to me a little while and then said, "Will you treat me to a glass of ale before you go,"—I said I did not mind, and I treated her to a glass at a public-house close by—she came out with me to the corner, asking me a few questions—I said I could not stop any longer—I turned round to make ray way home, and felt my watch go out of my pocket—it was perfectly safe when I was in the public-house, attached to a guard—the prisoner directly ran away; two men came up and asked me some address, trying to stop me from running after her—I ran between them and went after her—I fell down, got up again and pursued and caught her—I called her a b——, and with that she gave me my watch—she then blackguarded me and called me everything, and ran away again—I ran after her again and gave her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an estate agent at Chesham, Bucks—on 14th November, about a quarter to 9 in the morning, I was in the Old Bailey—I had a gold watch in my waistcoat-pocket underneath two coats, which were buttoned up—I was standing still—there was a rush made and my hat was knocked off, but it was chucked up about a minute afterwards—I felt as I thought two hands at my waistcoat-pocket, my coats were torn open, and my waistcoat-pocket torn out—I had but 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there, and that was taken—I had nearly 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about me, but fortunately they did not get that—I had not gone to see the execution, I was only passing—when I felt the hands at my waistcoat-pocket, I looked down and Chips had the key and part of the chain in his hand—I caught hold of the chain and it broke—I had one part and he the other—they then hustled me and knocked me down; there were a great many in it, no doubt—I saw Chips and Hart, and Rayner stood by the side of me—when they knocked me down they got hold of my person, and I was never in such pain in my life—Rayner was on me when I was down—I said, "For God's sake let me get up, or I shall be murdered'—I was quite helpless—the prisoners kept close to me—I sang out "murder, police"—two constables ran to my assistance, and when I got to the barrier Rayner pretended to be my friend, but it was only a piece of hypocrisy on his part—they all attempted to run away, but the police got hold of them.</p>

I am sub-warder in the Middlesex House of Correction—on 10th November, about 10 in the morning, I was on duty in the tailor's shop—I saw the prosecutor there sitting down about seven or eight yards in advance of me—I saw the prisoner strike a blow at the back of his neck; he then turned round and advanced towards me—I closed with him, and while struggling with him, Mr. Parry, the master tailor, came out and took the knife from him—the prisoner remarked at the time, "You don't report me for nothing"—I saw the knife in his hand, and saw there was blood on the blade—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner was employed in the tailor's shop as a cutter-out—he would use a knife occasionally—it was nothing unusual to see him with a knife—I saw him with a knife that</p>

Smith, Payne, and Smith, as to John Stuart &amp; Co. of Manchester—I went to Smith, Payne, and Smith, and inquired about the respectability of the house—I sold De Witt wines two or three days afterwards to the amount of 2,107<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the first transaction was concluded on 2nd September—I gave De Witt delivery orders and warrants—I believe that was on the last day of September—it was as soon as the transaction was closed, and two or three days after that, which would be September 4 or 5—De Witt brought the bill in question to me with other bills, and told me to, draw for the balance, 562<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on John Stuart &amp; Co.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you quite sure he said "John Stuart &amp; Co., of Manchester," when he spoke to you first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Positive, because we went to inquire about them of Smith, Payne, and Smith—Manchester was not my idea, he said so—I cannot say whether he mentioned Manchester the second time—he delivered these bills two days after the transaction, it was concluded when he brought me the draft on that house—I delivered the warrants and delivery orders two or three days before—he made no representation when he brought me the bills, he only handed them to me, and as I knew several of the names, and knew that they were very good, I accepted them—I have known Mr. Ramage for the last fifteen years, but I do not think he has recommended me customers before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine cooper, of 28, College-street, Dowgate-hill—I introduced De Witt to Mr. Lopez—I did not see him at his office in Mark-lane, but I knew he had an office there—he told me before I took him to Mr. Lopez that he was a partner in the firm of John Stuart &amp; Co. of Manchester, merchants and American bankers—I saw him afterwards at Crutched Friars.</p>

Stuart &amp; Co. of Manchester, before I in<lb/>troduced him to Mr. Lopez, and it was on the faith of that I introduced him—I do not know whether Stuart &amp; Co. have got a house in Liverpool.</p>

Simpson came round and said to Wilson, "If you had got two b——coats on, I would not be long in pulling them off"—Wilson said, "Would you?"—he said, "Yes, I would," and struck Wilson twice with his fist and knocked him against a lamp post—Wilson went away to get up in the High-street, and asked a policeman to go and take Simpson in charge—the policeman said no, he must summon Simpson—Simpson used very bad language to me, and said that he would serve me the same—he then went after the prisoner and gave him in charge, but did not strike him—he fell against the lamp post when Simpson struck him—I saw no knife—I was near enough to see if one was used—I saw nothing after that, it was between 6 and 7 o'clock.</p>

On the night of 31st October, in consequence of some information, I went to the kitchen of the Maryle<lb/>bone Schools, at Southall, which belong to the guardians of the Marylebone parish—while I was watching there, I saw the prisoner Cook come to the window outside—Strong, another constable, was with me—I said to him, "There is somebody looking in"—I took off my boots, and went to a door further back in the room, thinking to meet Cook—as I opened the door, I saw him run into the pump-room—I followed, and in that room I saw a trap door open, and an old pair of shoes by it—I said, "Whoever it is, has gone down this trap door"—I got down, and after crawling about ten or twelve yards under the floor, between the surface of the ground and the flooring of the school, I found the two prisoners—I told them to come out, and I heard one of them say, "Throw the keys away," I could not say which—Strong got to Connor and took him out—I had to go ten or a dozen yards further after Cook—I said to him, "You may as well come out, you can't get out that way"—he looked round one of the small pillars, and said, "Is that you?" and then he came to me, and said, "The things are all right there," pointing to them—I pulled these things out (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are two money boxes, one of the locks which had been taken off a door, and a key which had been filed to make it fit—the superintendent has the proper key—I also found these books there—they could not see to read without a light, but they had several candles and matches there, and there were places where they had stuck the candles up, the boards were burnt—there were also seven children's frocks, an old blanket which was made into a bed for them, two tin cans, two tin mugs, and a poker—going to the station, Cook said they took the poker down to get one of the boards up in the office—he was formerly an office-boy in that school—the office was just above where they had been sleeping, at the further end—by taking up one of those boards, they could have got into the office—they said they had been there a week, they only went there for a living, and they had got that after the school had been shut up of a night by pushing up the window of the servants' hall, where they have their meals.</p>

               <p>went away, and I saw the female running down Mansfield-street—I missed 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my right-hand trousers pocket—I ran after the female and caught her—she asked me what the man had done to me—I told her I would tell her presently—there was no policeman there—she turned and went back again, and I followed her down the Kingsland-road again—she then called out some name, and the male prisoner crossed the road to her—they went off together—I followed them—we got very near to the Woolpack public-house, when they turned round and saw me following them about one hundred yards off—they then ran down Thomas-street—I ran after them—the male prisoner turned round and showed fight, and the female caught hold of my coat, and then other women came up—the male prisoner then struck me in the chest and got away again while the women held me—that was just under the new railway arch—I got away from her and chased the male prisoner again—he was stopped by a man at the top of the street—he gave him over to me—there was no constable there—the female prisoner and more women came up and caught hold of me again, and the male prisoner went down on his hands and knees, and begged and prayed me to let him go, and he would make it up again—the women pulled me away, and he got away again—I went after him again along the Kingsland-road, and took him to the station myself—the female prisoner and two or three others followed, trying to get him away—I told the police<lb/>man at the station about the female, and he went out and took her into custody—I was quite sober—I am sure the prisoners are the two persons who rifled my pockets when I was down—it was only half-past 6 in the evening, and I could see them plainly—it was getting dark.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you mean to say it was not dark at half-past 6 on 15th October? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not quite dark—I said at the Police-court that the male prisoner fell down on his knees, and begged me to let him go—he got away from me three times—there are archways all along the Kingsland-road—the woman did not speak to me; she might have mumbled something, but she never spoke directly to me, that I am aware of—I was not in her company at all—I did not go under an archway with her—she did not charge me with not paying her some money—I did not walk two yards with her—that I swear—I had come by the railway from Leytonstone, and was walking along with my hands in my pockets—I had one hand on the money at the time—I was not stunned—I could not see the male prisoner when I got up—it was some name the female called out—I was about twenty yards behind her then.</p>

I am a potman at a public-house in the Kingsland-road—on Saturday, 15th October, about 7, I was coming down Thomas-street—I heard voices near the railway arch, and walked down towards them—I saw the prisoners there, and saw the male prisoner strike the prosecutor in the chest and run away—he was stopped at the top of the street by a man—the female prisoner ran behind him—the prosecutor was surrounded again at the top of the street—the male prisoner stopped there a minute, and said to the prosecutor, "Let us go in and have some beer, and we will make it up"—the prosecutor said, No, he would not—he had hold of the prisoner by the collar, and he said, "Leave go of my collar, I can</p>

               <p>—I stood and watched them for a second or two, and I saw Brown draw his hand from the lady's pocket, and some money fall from his hand on to the cement; a shilling and a sixpence, I believe—I saw it picked up, and also a white handkerchief—the prisoner escaped at that time—I took the lady's tress, and about twenty minutes afterwards I saw the prisoners in Fore-set—I first saw Harrison forcing his way through the crowd, and Brown behind him—I caught hold of Brown, and told him I was about to him into custody for taking a sovereign from a lady's pocket—on the way to the station, he said, "I will give you half a <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>," meaning half a sovereign, "if you will let me go"—I found on him a sovereign, four shillings, and a penny.</p>

Shoolbred, and if I persisted in taking the female pri<lb/>soner on the warrant that I had obtained, he would see Mr. Shoolbred, who was coming to dine with him next week, and that I should be discharged—James Inwood said the goods were pawned by his wife to pay a fine for travelling on a railway without a ticket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the 50th Regiment, quartered at Parkhurst in the Isle of Wight, the regiment had recently come from New Zealand—in consequence of seeing some advertisements, or some books, I went up to London to consult Dr. Henery, at 52, Dorset-street—I saw Wray there—I asked him whether he was Dr. Henery, he said, "I am"—this was in August last year, I think about the 17th—I consulted him about some disease that I was troubled with—he gave me very little advice indeed upon the subject—he said he would forward a box of medicine to me—I asked what his charge was—he said a guinea for the advice he had given me, and ten guineas for the medicine—I asked him to send me the medicine in town to the hotel where I was staying—he said it would be much better to forward it to my address where I was living habitually, or something of. that sort—I don't recollect whether I had given him my address at that time, I think not, but I am not quite sure—I gave it him on that, and the medicine was subsequently forwarded, a day or two afterwards—I paid him in cash, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think it was—I took the medicine and sent for a further supply, I don't exactly know how often—I sent up a cheque each time—I sent six cheques—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on one occa<lb/>sion; altogether I paid 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 85 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these cheques are drawn in the name of A. F. Henery; and they are all endorsed except one, which was made payable to bearer—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the acknowledgments I received—they are generally, "Received your enclosure with thanks, A. F. Henery," one is signed, "Pro A. F. Henery, J. Wright"—after receiving this medicine and paying this money I consulted another medical man; I ceased to have anything further from Dr. Henery—I think I sent him a cheque afterwards for some money that I owed him, but I gave no further orders—I think that was about February, it may have been January or February—I neither saw or heard anything more of the parties till July this year—this letter was then put into my hands, professedly coming from Dr. Henery—I pre<lb/>sume it is in his handwriting, it is signed "A. F. Henery."</p>

F. Henery, M. D. W. Anderson.")—I did not reply to that letter, or take any notice of it, neither did I see the man—about two months afterwards the prisoner Anderson came to the barracks—I was informed that a person wanted to see me, and I went out and found it was Anderson—he said, "I come on the part of Dr. Henery," or words to the effect—I said, "I don't wish to have anything further to do with Dr. Henery,"—he said, "Oh, but are you aware that Dr. Henery has a very heavy claim against you?"—I said, "No; I am not,"—he said, "Dr. Henery sent me down because he has a claim of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against you"—I said, it was an impossibility, he could not have such a claim—he said that he had come down in a great hurry; that Dr. Henery had only told him of this claim the night before, and asked him to come down, as he had written several letters to me, and could get no answer—I said I had not received any of the letters, if he had written them—he then went with me over to my quarters—we had some conversation on the subject, and he asked me to give him a cheque for the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I declined to do so, and as I declined giving him a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he reduced his demand to 100 guineas—he said, "You had better settle the thing; draw out a cheque for 100 guineas"—I declined that also—he asked me that five or six times at least, and pressed me very much, even when he was leaving, he said, "Oh, you had much better settle the matter; give a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and let it be over"—I said, "Who are you? You make this claim against me, and I don't even know who you are"—he said, "Oh, it does not matter who I am!"—he declined to give me his name—just before he left, he said he had come down in a great hurry, and asked me to give him some money—I think he said, "Give me a sovereign"—I said, "What for?"—he said for his expenses—I said, "Dr. Henery sent you down; I think he is the man to pay your expenses, not me"—he said, "I came away in so much hurry that really I have very little money in my pocket;" in fact, he led me to believe that be could not get out of the island if I did not give him some money—I wanted to get his name, as he had refused to give it me, and I said, "Very well, if I give you a sovereign, you must understand, I shall demand a receipt for it," and to that he consented, and he wrote the receipt in my presence—he dated it wrong although I told him the right date (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "17th November. Received on account of ex<lb/>penses the sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi> from Captain Clarke. H.

As I am quite un<lb/>aware of owing you such a sum of money, I shall be obliged by your forward<lb/>ing to me the particulars, that I may hand them to my legal adviser.

Sir, I regret exceedingly to have to inform you that your letter did not reach me till Saturday night, other<lb/>wise it would have received my immediate attention. Nevertheless, I have to remind you that you promised the gentleman who waited upon you at Park<lb/>hurst that you would call in Dorset-street, therefore I do not understand your giving so much trouble in the matter. I have to inform you that my claim for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is for medical advice and medicine, for spermatorrhoea, brought on by self-pollution. If you will satisfy my claim without further trouble I will give you a receipt in full of all demands, or sign any paper that you may choose to draw up, so that you shall not be troubled again by your obedt. servant, A. F. Henery. P. S.—I called at Cox and Co. 's this morning, and found you were there on Saturday, so therefore I hope this will reach you there"—That was the first time that such an insinuation as is contained there was made—I handed that letter to my legal adviser, and took no further notice—on 5th October, another letter was put into my hand by my servant; this is it—it is signed, H. Wilson—I believe it to be in the same handwriting as the receipt which Anderson signed—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Warburton's Hotel, Newport, Private sitting-room, No. 4, Oct 5. Sir. I am here expressly from London to see you, with a view to effect a settle<lb/>ment, if possible, of Dr. Henery's claim, and anticipating your refusal to see me in your quarters is the reason I have penned this, and would recommend you to do so at once, for rely upon it I do not intend journeying here for nothing. Your letter from your solicitor has been received, and I have that and some from yourself, with me. Now, supposing I was to inform you application would be made at the War Office, with an explanation of case, and if we were to do so you know what the consequence would be; or sup<lb/>posing I was to inform you I expected to be in your neighbourhood in Scot<lb/>land next week, and that I do not intend leaving here, in the event of your still persisting in your refusal to pay, without making known in the neigh<lb/>bourhood for what purpose I am here. I am in no hurry, and will allow you time to reflect whether it will be better to pay Dr. Henery's legal and just claim, or submit to exposure of your filthy case. I have to inform you that I have waited upon one of the oldest solicitors in Plymouth since I saw you, with reference to a claim we had on his son; and, on explaining what we would do in the event of his not paying us, he soon saw the force of what we said, and paid us it. Now the reason I did not tell you what we in<lb/>tended doing in the event of your not paying when I was here before, was because you promised to call in Dorset-street, and relying upon your worked as a gentleman was the only reason I did not do so. Yours obediently, H. Wilson. P. S.—It is useless for you to pretend you are not in quarters, for I knew you to be there (and was there last night when I called) before I left London")—Some of my friends live in Scotland; my father does—I had not mentioned Scotland to either of the prisoners, but I wrote from Scotland once or twice to Dr. Henery, and one parcel of medicine was sent down</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">I do not think the first letter comes within the Statute; it contains no menace or threat.

"(The learned Judge having retired to consult the Recorder, proceeded), "It is unnecessary for me to express any opinion whether this is a menace within the Statute; I think it is very doubtful. I should, if necessary, rule that it was, because it has been so held before; but I cannot see any evidence here against these prisoners that they have committed any offence within the jurisdiction of this Court; that it, that they have, within this jurisdiction, sent, delivered, and uttered this letter. The important letter that was actually sent, delivered, and uttered, is that of 5th October, which was, in point of fact, sent, delivered, and uttered in Hampshire. If it had been sent by the guilty party through an innocent agent, there might have been a sending within the jurisdiction, if for instance, it had been tent by post from London; but in this case the delivery, in my opinion, was in Hampshire, therefore on this indictment the prisoners must be acquitted.</hi>

I am manager to Ferdinand Hershfeld Peraire, a merchant, of 24, Cannon-street—the prisoner was his town traveller for about thirteen months, and was in the employ of other parties besides—his duty was to obtain orders, receive the moneys when due, and pay them over to me or to Mr. Peraire—about the latter end of October I told him that several accounts of his customers were not paid, and I should have to take steps to recover them—he said that some of them were not able to pay, and made various excuses, and that he would try to get them in—when pressed closely, he said, "I told you, Mr. Baker, I have taken the cash of some of them"—I looked rather surprised, and said, "To what extent have you done so?"—he said, "To about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "I am indeed surprised to hear you say so; it is a very serious thing, and I feel it my duty to acquaint</p>

               <p>Mr. Peraire with it," but I did not do so till about a fortnight afterwards—during that time be canoe three or four times, and each time I said, "Mr. Hamilton, have you got any of those accounts?"—he said, "Mr. Baker, I am sorry to see you take it so much to heart, because I value your good opinion, and it will be all right"—I asked him each time if he was prepared to pay the money—he said, "No"—I said, "I cannot allow you to go on any longer; you or I must tell Mr. Peraire this morning"—he then went to Mr. Peraire, who was in the warehouse, and I heard him say that he had cashed some money—Mr. Peraire asked him to what amount—he said, "Well, perhaps, to the amount of 50<hi rend="italic">l"</hi>—Mr. Peraire came into the counting-house, and told me to send for a policeman—he then gave the prisoner in custody—he may have collected from 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. during his employment—Mr. Giddings, Mr. St. John, and Mr. Purchase, are customers of ours.</p>

               <p>were struck through by me they would have been in ink—when I first heard that he had received some of these accounts, I gave him a fortnight's time, on his promise that he should receive some money, and would pay it—he said many times that the Ornamental Wood Work directors were about to meet, and he should have some money—I believe he brought orders within the fortnight after he told me this; if he did I should have taken them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was going home from Billingsgate-market, and a gentleman got out of a chaise and asked me if I would carry a parcel from Cook's in St. Paul's Churchyard, and he would give me fourpence. I said, "I do not mind, as I am wet through" I went with him, and he put this parcel in my basket wrapped in a newspaper. He said, "Go up to the first floor, and ask them to look out the wholesale woollens" I came down and saw nothing of him, but he came to me again from the front of the warehouse; he did not come down by the lift, though he went up by it. He went out, and I went up by the lift, and presently he came with two parcels in slate-coloured paper; one was not quite so big as this. He told me to go down and give it to the gentleman in the cart. I was to ask for Mr. Wood, who would give something else. I could not see the gentleman or the cart, so I asked a gentleman it he knew where I could find Mr. Wood. He said that he did not know. While the first witness went to inquire, I went outside to see. if I could see the gentleman or the pony and cart, but could not The witness came up and said, "I want you." I said, "What for?" He said "You know all about what for; about that piece of cloth" I said, "I was sent in for it; the gentleman is in here" I went into the public-house but could not find him. He said, "If you do not come back, I shall make you," upon which I gave him a shove, but did not attempt to knock him down. He still followed me, and I ran away; he came up, and I thought he was going to hit me, so I made an attempt to strike him, but did not. He put his foot against me as I ran and threw me on my face, held me, and gave me in charge. I put my basket down, and as I got the cloth given me, I put it in the basket, and there I left it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was manager of Messrs. Geeve's saw-mills, New Wharf-road, Caledonian-road, until a month ago—they were the consignees of Burton's timber—the custom of the trade is to deliver out the timber on the consignee's signature—we held goods of Burton and delivered them to his order—at the end of 1863 there were some timbers of Burton's lying at our wharf—the books will show to whom goods are delivered; I have them here—I have the delivery-order here—I have nothing to show to whom they were consigned; they were ultimately delivered to a variety of people—I remember an application being made by a person named Brewster, about the middle of April, 1864—an order was presented to me by Brewster, and I delivered the goods—the order is here—I required nothing else to be done, except the endorsement of Mr. Tear—without that endorsement I should not have delivered them out—on my communicating that Tear, came in—he was waiting outside—he endorsed the order in my presence, and I delivered the goods—I was not aware at that time that Tear had become bankrupt—he did not mention that fact to me—the value of the goods, I should say, was from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On Saturday night, 15th October, a man came to my shop—he was about the prisoner's size, but I did not notice him much—I served him with two-pennyworth of Scotch bun, and he gave me a shilling—I gave him the change, sixpence and fourpence—I kept it in my hand, and after he had left, I found it was bad—I took it in doors and laid it on the table in the yard at the back of the shop—there was no other shilling; there—I marked it, and gave it to a constable half an hour after.</p>

I keep an eating-house, I, Union-place, York-road, Batter-sea—on 1st November, about half-past 2 o'clock, Denman came in, and I served him with three pennyworth of meat—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him a florin and threepence, and he left—I kept the half-crown in my hand, and in five or ten minutes found it was bad—I went into a dozen beer-shops, and then to the police-station, and gave the half-crown to a con<lb/>stable who went with me, and I saw the two prisoners at a distance; that was an hour afterwards—I recognised Denman—Hunt was walking with him—Denman turned round, recognised me, and they walked on—he took a paper parcel out of his pocket and put it into King's right hand; King put it in his right pocket—the constable laid hold of both of them, and just as we got to the water trough, King swung the constable round, and I thought he put it into the ostler's pocket as I saw a paper pass from his hand—I laid hold of the ostler by the collar, but the policeman told me it was all right, and I let him go—the prisoners were taken to the station and put in the dock—King was then taken into the office to be searched, and Denman was put to the bar—I asked him what was in the paper he had passed to King—he said, "Only a piece of paper to light his pipe"—they both denied know<lb/>ing each other before.</p>

"You shan't go any further," and one of them put his arms round my neck—I think the one behind me—im<lb/>mediately after that I felt a tug at my waistcoat-pocket, where my watch was; I felt for it, and missed it—my watch was safe before I met these men, because I looked at it to see how long I had to catch the train at the Elephant and Castle station—all three of them ran away in different directions; I and others followed, but we lost sight of them down Lock's-fields—I heard no more of it till the following morning, when I was called to the police-station at Stone's-end to see if I could identify the prisoner—I picked him out from a dozen others, as one of the men—I have not seen my watch since—I was quite sober.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner</hi>)—I had no watch, but I had a locket, with a Maltese cross attached to it—I tell the time as near as I can remember—I was not so far stupefied by the gin and water but that I knew what I was doing—when I asked the prisoner the way, I was by the Bethlehem Hospital, near the public-house—I do not know the sign of it; but it is at the top of St. George's-road—Bethlehem Hospital is on the other side—I did not observe any gardens; it was near a brick-wall—I do not know that where I was at St. George's-road, I was very near the Elephant and Castle—I did not know my way at all up that road—I had not been so far up—I often go out to meet my husband at night—when I went out with him, or to meet him, I went down the Kennington-road, and turned towards Westminster-bridge; but the prisoner took me into the York-road—I knew what I was speaking about, but I did not know my way—I did not know where Blackfriars-road was, though it is a year and nine months since I first, went to Brixton—I did not know the other end of the York-road, or that it ran into the Blackfriars-road—the prisoner took me that way, and up Stamford-street—I did not know that it was not the York-road all the way along—I believe the public-house was in Blackfriars-road—I was not struck by the gentleman, I was pushed down by him, because he was taking improper liberties with me, which he ought not to have done, and I resisted it—I did not strike him at all—I had no latch-key in my hand—I went into one public-house with the prisoner—we did not remain more than five minutes—I drank the gin and water and went out again—I believe the prisoner to be the same young man, but he is so differently dressed, I can hardly tell him again—I think it is the same face—I received no money from the gentleman or from the prisoner—I have been married five years—I do not know where Tooley-street is, or Duke-street, London-bridge—I know the railway terminus, but never noticed a street which runs by the side—I never went by the name of "Chatham <hi rend="italic">Poll</hi>"—no associate of mine is called <hi rend="italic">"Exhibition Polly</hi>," who got into trouble: I do not know what you are speaking of—I do not know</p>

On 1st September I accompanied Keats to Fuller's house—I got there about 4 or 5 o'clock—I waited about half an hour before Fuller came—I then told him he was charged with robbing the South Western Railway Company, and asked him whether he had any objection to my searching his house—he said he had not, but that the front room was a lodger's room, and was locked, and I could not be admitted—I asked him whether it was man and wife or a single man—he said he did not know—I asked him their name—he said he did not know—I asked him where they worked—he said he did not know—I said if he did not admit me into the room I should break the door open—he went down stairs, produced a key, and unlocked the door—I searched the room, and took posses<lb/>sion of what I found in the house.</p>

I reside in the Manor-road, Deptford—I have cause to remember Saturday night, 15th October—I was going through South wark-square, about a quarter to 8, on my way to the train, when I felt my neck encircled by the hands and arms of some one whom I never had the pleasure to see—I suffered a good deal of pain from being pressed so much—I tried to call out, but could not—I could see the persons walking to and fro in Southwark-bridge-road; there was plenty of light there, but where I was it was all dark, to the great discredit of the Board of Works—the railway works there have cut the square all out of shape—I lost my watch and chain, but I did not feel them taken; it was done very cleverly—I really do not know when I had last seen my watch safe—I suppose I had seen it since the morning, but I forget—there are so many clocks now that one does not look at one's watch so often—I know I had it—I rather think I must have been insensible towards the last, for they threw me down and I did not feel the fall—I did not see either of the prisoners—I could see nothing, it was too dark—all I saw was one man standing quite still in the middle of the road, looking at the operation.</p>

You are going to shove something against me now"—I said, "No, I am not; there is a man at the station who says you sold it to him"—I took him to the station and showed him the watch—he said he knew nothing at all about it, he had never seen it—I then fetched Linscott from the cell—Cochlin was placed between seven other men, and Linscott identified him as the man he bought the watch of—Cochlin denied it—next morning, before the Magistrate Cochlin said, "Yes, I sold him the watch; I bought it of a man in the <hi rend="italic">Cut.</hi> I gave three shillings for it on the Sunday morning, and I sold it to him on the Sunday afternoon"—I asked who the man was, and he could <hi rend="italic">give</hi> me no account whatever of him.</p>
