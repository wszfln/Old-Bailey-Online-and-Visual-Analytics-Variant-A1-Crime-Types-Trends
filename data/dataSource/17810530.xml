               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300003"/>Is she a married woman? - Yes: her husband is a servant in another family.</p>
               <p>Relate all you know of this unfortunate matter. - I went into her room on the 14th of May, about noon. The prisoner was sitting on the bed-side, and I observed blood upon the floor near where she was sitting. I asked her</p>
               <p>"what was the matter?" she said, she was ill, but did not tell me the cause of her illness. I left the room immediately, and went and told my Lady. There were, I think, two of my Lady's children with her; the one that she nursed, and another three years and an half old.</p>
               <p>How long before that had you seen the prisoner? - I had seen her in her room that morning, some hours before: she then complained of a pain in her head. My Lady came down stairs with me; my Lady asked her</p>
               <p>"how she did?"</p>
               <p>Relate the questions Lady Carysford asked, and the answers given by the prisoner. - I don't think I heard her answers. My Lady came out of her room into the next room with me, to speak to me; I told my Lady what I suspected; then my Lady returned into the room; I heard my Lady tell her</p>
               <p>"she was ashamed of her;" the prisoner asked for what? my Lady said,</p>
               <p>"for having been with child."</p>
               <p>Had it been known or suspected in the family before, that this young woman was with child? - Yes; it had been suspected some time by the servants, but nobody had ever told my Lady of it. She said, she had not been with child, as she knew of. My Lady ordered me to go down stairs, and send for a midwife; I went down, and told the man to fetch the first midwife he could meet with. My Lady went down stairs, and I went up and sat in the room with her till the midwife came; I don't recollect that any conversation passed between us. Some time after the midwife came (her name is

            ) she came up stairs, and asked the prisoner</p>
               <p>"what was the matter?" I think the prisoner told the midwife, that she had miscarried; I am pretty sure she did say so. After some enquiries, the prisoner desired the midwife to look into a box, which was under a small bed in the room, opposite the bed she sat upon. That box was locked; I think the prisoner gave her the key, but I was in a great deal of confusion, and cannot exactly recollect: when the box was opened, I gave but one look into it, and saw a child; but I was so frightened that I don't know whether it was its back or face that I saw: the midwife mentioned a wound, and at that one look I gave, I saw a wound, but I did not make any particular observation upon it.</p>
               <p>After the child was found, what did you hear the prisoner say? - The midwife asked her</p>
               <p>"why she had cut its throat?" she cried very much, and said, she did not. The midwife asked her</p>
               <p>"what she did with those ugly scissars, which the midwife said were in the box?" I did not see them in the box, but I saw them outside the box. The prisoner said, she made use of the scissars to disentangle the child.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the midwife making any reply to that? - I do not: she asked her for the after-burthen; the prisoner said it was in the box with the child. It was not there, for it was not come away at that time. I remember, in the course of the day, I asked her</p>
               <p>"if she had prepared any baby-linen for the child?" she told me, I should find some in a drawer at the foot of her bed; I looked there, and did find some.</p>
               <p>Were they the sort of things that are usually prepared for a new-born infant? - They were.</p>
               <p>You said it had been suspected in the family for some time that she was with child? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you known of that suspicion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you, or any of the servants, been able, from observation, to form any judgment how far she was gone with child? - I believe every body thought she must have been near her time, for we had noticed her great with child for three or four months.</p>
               <p>She was not so big, however, that it had come to the observation of your Lady? - My Lady, I believe, suspected it a little before it happened, or rather that she had got some dropsical disorder.</p>
               <p>You said the prisoner had lived near two years in the family: what character had she in the family? How had she behaved herself? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300004"/> She took good care of the child she nursed, and was an inoffensive woman; she discharged her trust well, and behaved very civil and well to every person in the house.</p>
               <p>Had she appeared to be tender to, and fond of children? - Yes; she was remarkably fond of the child she nursed.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation, particularly, in what manner she behaved when the child was discovered in the box? - She cried, and seemed much distressed; but denied knowing any thing of the murder; she denied having done any violence to the child.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the scissars? - I don't recollect any thing about the scissars after.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know whether these were the scissars she usually had, and carried about her? - I do not know that circumstance; I know she had a pair of old scissars.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>When the midwife came, the prisoner told her she had miscarried? - I think she did.</p>
               <p>She told her so voluntarily? - I think she did.</p>
               <p>And she directed the midwife to the box where the child was? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a midwife; I was sent for to Lady Carysford's; I was conducted up to the prisoner's room, by my lady's orders; I asked her,</p>
               <p>"How she did?" she said, Very poorly, or to that purpose. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have had a child, or else have miscarried." I formed that opinion, from seeing the floor bloody near the bed. She said, she had not. I pressed her farther; I said,</p>
               <p>"I was sure she had;" and I insisted upon knowing where it was. She pointed with her hand to a box that was under the bed, and said, It was in that box.</p>
               <p>Did not she first say she had miscarried? - I don't recollect that she did.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect that she did not; or have not you a certain recollection about it? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Did she seem much confused, or afflicted? - She seemed to give very odd answers at times, as if she was not quite right in her head: I was not used to her before; but she seemed very odd and pale.</p>
               <p>She must certainly have been pale from her situation. Did she appear much agitated in her mind? - Yes, I think she was; she gave the key either to Mrs. Macdonald, or me, I can't be sure which: I opened the box; upon opening it, I found a fine male child, with an incision in its throat.</p>
               <p>From the view of the child did it appear to be a full grown child, or as having come before its time? - The child appeared to me to be full grown, or nearly; I saw an incision in the neck, under the throat.</p>
               <p>What kind of appearance had it? - It appeared to me as if it had been cut.</p>
               <p>Was it a large wound? - I did not take particular notice of the length of it, but I saw that it was not from ear to ear.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether it was a deep wound? - I observed the skin was cut, but I did not observe whether it was a deep wound.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether the windpipe was cut? - I did not; I was much frightened, and shut the box down again.</p>
               <p>And you did not observe whether the wound was deep, or superficial? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you, or any person in your presence, examine the wound afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>From the appearance of the child was it possible for you to form any judgment whether it had been born alive or dead? - I cannot positively say; it might have been strangled with the cord.</p>
               <p>After you found the child, what questions did you ask the prisoner? - I asked her</p>
               <p>"How she came to cut its throat?" she said, She found something hung very much, and she thought the child was entangled; (she said) she knew nothing of cutting its throat.</p>
               <p>Did she say what she had done to disentangle it? - I told her,</p>
               <p>"She had used those scissars;" she said, If it was done, if it was cut, she had done it by disintangling it. I said,</p>
               <p>"What did you use those scissars for?" she made no answer then, I believe; but there was nothing else but these scissars to have done it with.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the scissars at all? - Yes; and they seemed to be a little bloody: I asked her,</p>
               <p>"Where the after-birth was?" she said, It was with the child; I looked for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300005"/> it, and could not find it. I said,</p>
               <p>"It is not come away;" she said, It was, and she did not know where it was, if it was not with the child. I afterwards brought the after-burthen from her; I might have been there three quarters of an hour before I took it away.</p>
               <p>Could you form any judgment, from the appearance of the woman, whether she had had a difficult or an entangled labour? - No, I could not form any judgment; but it is likely she might, for want of assistance.</p>
               <p>But if she had been in the situation she described to you, with the child much entangled, and without assistance, must she not have been in great pain and agony? - To be sure she must.</p>
               <p>When children in the birth are entangled with the string, is it not usually about the neck? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If the child had been so entangled, from your observation of the wound upon the neck of the child, was it or not possible that that wound might have happened in her attempt to extricate it? - It is very possible, and very probable, that she might not be capable, at that time, of knowing what she did in her extremity.</p>
               <p>Am I to understand you, that, if the child was so entangled with the string about its neck, it is possible that that wound might have been given in the attempt to disentangle it? - It might with an unskilful woman; especially with her, if she was not in her senses.</p>
               <p>I believe it is not an unusual thing for children to be entangled about the neck? - It is very common.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any thing else that is material? - No farther than that, while I was with her, she appeared sometimes to be delirious.</p>
               <p>- KING sworn.</p>
               <p>I am beadle of Marybone parish. I was sent for to the Rotation-office, and was directed to apply to the coroner, for him to summon a jury; the jury were summoned, and sat.</p>
               <p>Was any surgeon sent for, to examine the body of the child? - No, the jury and coroner thought there was no occasion.</p>
               <p>Court. They both thought extremely wrong.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence.)</p>

             and I went out on Friday night, the 12th of January, with a cart and horse, on purpose to steal fowls or hogs, or anything we could find. We drank at a public-house, at Westborn-Green; these two young men, Smith and Sexton, were sitting there. From thence we went to Mr. Watson's; we went into a field, and went round the back way, where the hay was; he handed the fowls to me, and I pulled their necks; there was a middle sized-dog, who kept barking all the time. We heard somebody coughing in the house; the prisoner bid me stop till they had done coughing, which I did; we counted the fowls; there were eighteen of them. Then he bid me drive the geese up; I went; there were some rails across a little pond; the geese went under the rails, and escaped. Then I told him, there were some hogs; he went directly and turned them out, and he desired me to take the fowls. There was a large fat sow, and a large barrow pig; they appeared to me, in the night, to be quite white; we drove them away towards home, and then up a lane, out of the road, in order to run them down, and tie their legs; after we had so done, and tied their legs, the prisoner got a large stick out of the hedge, clapped under them, and put them into the cart.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300007"/> Coming along, we met the same two men upon the road; we bid them good night; one went by the side of the cart, and tried to look in, to see what was in it; I do not know whether he could or not see what it was, because we threw some light straws, and I think a sack or two, over the hogs. When we came to Paddington-turnpike, they strove to stop us; the turnpike-man would not stop us, but opened the gates. Porter desired me to lay hold of the head of the horse; he said, Come to Covent-Garden, I will not go to Smithfield this morning; which was to make the men believe he dealt at Covent-Garden. After we got through that gate, we jumped over into the fields, and ran home as hard as we could; I had not been home above five minutes before Porter came to me; I believe he desired me to get away directly; we went away for about a fortnight, I believe, and were in Westminster; my wife lay in at the time.</p>

On the 17th of April, I was attacked by four footpads, at just after twelve at night, as I was going to my house, near the Boot, by the Foundling Hospital. I had been at the theatre; it was very dark; I was alone. I met two at first; one said, Your money! I went back two or three steps, and asked them, What they wanted? When I was four or five steps from them, I thought, as I was so much nearer town, I could make my escape; I ran about fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>You trusted to your legs? - Yes; but the thieves were too nimble for me. Seeing the man was near me, I turned back; I thought I might save a blow. I turned round, and put my cane up; I saved a blow by catching hold of his hand. He struggled a little while, then there came up the other three; they stood at some little distance: the man that turned round upon me, took me by the collar, and I collared him; he took hold of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300008"/> my hair, and turned me round; my cane dropped; they all came up to me, and I was cut very much upon the head; I lay senseless. I only felt one blow upon the head, the others I never felt: I kept my bed four days. When I came to my senses, I found an hanger under me: they took my hat, three pair of silk stockings, which I had in my pocket, my shoes and silver buckles, a pair of stone knee-buckles, an handkerchief, a Charles the Second's crown, and two sixpences. When I recovered my senses, I found them robbing me: one was tearing the knee-buckle out of my knees; I felt every motion of theirs: one said to another, Have you got the pistol?</p>
               <p>What answer was made? - None. One had one of his knees on my cheek, and the other knee on my ribs: that man staid the last.</p>
               <p>As it was a very dark night, should you be able to know them again? - No: I could not see them at all: they first kept at so great a distance from me, that I could not discern any human faces.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell whether they had their own hair, or wigs? - They had short round hair every one; that is all that I can tell of them.</p>

               <p>You have heard of his having been at sea? - I have heard he deserted from the St. Alban's; but how true that is, I can't tell.</p>

He asked me to go along with him; I went with him, and she bought the watch. I should have been at sea before now, only I am not in a condition to go to sea.</p>

I was going home from London to Pleasant Row; Calcott first came up to me; it was a dark night, considering the time of the year: he accosted me, but what he said I don't remember; but he gave me a touch of the elbow. The next that came up to me was Webb; he had a bludgeon in his hand; he stood with the bludgeon lifted up in a position to knock me down; he said, Your money! I was about 100 yards from my own house; I thought I could run home; I was getting off the foot-path, to get upon the road; upon which Calcott took me by the collar: he was buttoned up quite close; he got his hand in under his coat, as if he was drawing something out. I looked over my left shoulder, and saw two more men advancing up; they called out, D - n his eyes! what, does he resist? blow his brains out! As soon as the other two closed up, they pushed off my hat, and held it before my face; it was pushed off behind, but Calcott, I imagine, held it, for it was held even flat against my face; then Webb rifled me; I lost five shillings in good silver, a bad shilling, and four-pence halfpenny; one was a halfpenny, three parts cut. When they took that five shillings, they said, What money have you got about you? I said, I had a little silver, which you have got, and a few halfpence in my waistcoat pocket; they took them out instantly; then they asked me for my watch; I said I had not one; they felt me all the way down, from my head down to my shoes; my watch I kept in my hand all the time.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay with you? - About ten minutes; then Calcott led me on towards my home, for two or three yards; he held my hat before my face; then he said, Walk on, make no noise, and no resistance; if you do, you are a dead man. When he was gone, I looked over my shoulder, and saw them walking up the hill towards Islington.</p>
               <p>They were not disguised? - No: nothing over their faces. Webb had an old round hat on when he committed the robbery; there were no lamps upon the road; my own lamp at my door was not lighted: there had been so many robberies committed on the road, that I took my watch out, and put it into my hand, when I came into the road at the Angel at Islington. I was robbed on a Tuesday night; on the Wednesday I was sent for to Bow-street; I went on the Friday; I enquired at the office; they told me the foot-pads were in at the public-house; they asked me if I had seen them; I said I had not: I was asked to go into the public-house, to see if I knew them; I went into the tap-room; there were fifteen or sixteen people there; I was desired to look about to see if I knew any body; I looked about, I fixed upon Calcott; they asked me if there was any body else; I said, no, there was not. I was desired to go into a back-room; there were about ten or a dozen there, I believe: when I came out again, a man asked me if any body I knew was there; I said, yes, the little man that has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300010"/> got an apron on, is the man that rifled me, but he has now got a cocked hat on; when he rifled me, he had a very old round hat, and his hair hung down below his face; that was Webb; I understood they were all four in custody; I did not see the other two.</p>
               <p>Did you discern the faces of the other men? - I cannot say I did observe them; they came up side-ways, and I had my hat before my face.</p>
               <p>What dress had Calcott on? - A drab-coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Calcott. He said, a light-coloured coat, before the justice.</p>
               <p>Hine. It was a drab-coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Calcott. He mentioned before the justice, that some people had seen me drinking at a public-house in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Hine. I understand there were people that saw them there, but they are not here.</p>
               <p>Webb. The gentleman said, I had a round hat on, and my hair hung over before my face; if I had had a round hat on, he could not so positively swear to my face. I never was in custody before.</p>
               <p>How could you see his hair, when his hat was on? - His hair came below his hat, and I saw his face very plain when he stood with the stick up, as I mentioned before.</p>

I was sent for, on the Monday se'nnight, to the Rotation-office; there I saw the prisoners; I knew them as soon as I saw them; I was clear, when they robbed me, I should know them again; they were in no disguise at all; the middle one, Pyke, had a scar on his cheek; Robinson was of a fair complexion, and his own hair; I can swear to him. I advertised them; the runners, knowing where I worked at Hampstead, sent for me; when I came there, the three prisoners, and another, were in the office, who was charged with breaking open an house in Bloomsbury. I was asked by the clerk, Whether I should know the persons that robbed me, if I saw them again? I said, I should know them in my conscience; I went through the office, and pointed out the three prisoners; but was not sure, in my conscience, to Collinwood.</p>

               <p>Pyke. He swore Collinwood was the first man that stopped him, and demanded his money: he is a private soldier in the guards; he has been hired by the runners to swear against us.</p>

               <p>Did you swear positively to Collinwood, before the justice? - I swore to those three, but were not positive to Collinwood.</p>

I got a padlock put on the door, and went back to my place. I returned to my lodging again on the 19th, about ten o'clock at night; the staple of the padlock was quite loose, but I did not observe it till the next morning; then I looked in my drawers, and missed some other things. I got a search warrant. I found a piece of gymp trimming of mine, in the prisoner's apartment. The constable charged her with having robbed me: at first she denied it; afterwards she confessed, and she went with me to Monmouth-street, and several places, where we found the things.</p>

               <p>I am errand-boy to Mr. Lutell. On Monday the 7th of May, I was coming up Fish-street Hill, with a bundle of Mr. Ross's things; it had like to have fell on the ground. I had two great coats and a parcel besides the bundle. I asked a man going along the street to help me with it; he said he would carry it for me; he took it out of my hand; I told him I was going to <placeName id="t17810530-17-crimeloc65">Fenchurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Did you see the bundle snatched out of his hand? - No; I was rather before him; he then ran away, and I called out, Stop thief! and the prisoner was stopped at the corner of Birchin-lane with the bundle.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300014"/> I took the bundle out of his hand, while the men held him. I took it home to my master's; he is an apothecary: there were some of my master's, and some of Mr. Ross's things in it: they had been out of town together, and I had been down to the livery-stables for them. I put it down on the table, and my master took it, and sent it down to Mr. Ross's, I believe. My master is not here.</p>

About five minutes after he was gone, I missed a gold watch of my master's, which was kept in the kitchen, for the use of the cook: I went up, and told the cook, I thought Cantofer had taken away the watch. On the Sunday morning I went to the Rotation-office, and got Macdonald to go with me to the prisoner's lodging: upon entering the room, Macdonald asked him, Where the watch was? he immediately confessed the fact, and said, he had lodged it at a pawnbroker's in Long-Acre, as he came along.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises made to him, to induce him to confess? - None.</p>

The prisoner brought the watch to me, to know whether it was gilt, or gold, on Saturday the 19th of May, at near eight o'clock; I perceived the watch to be gold. I questioned him, how he came by it? he said, he bought it at Blackwall, of the Jews, for a guinea. I stopped the watch.</p>
               <p>What is the watch worth? - The box, without the outside case, is worth three guineas; and the inside may be worth a guinea more: it has been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Are you certain he is the person? - Yes, I knew him again as soon as I saw him; it was about twenty minutes before eight o'clock; it was light, and I could well discern his face. I never saw him to my knowledge before; nor did I see him then, till he had hold of my collar, and demanded my money.</p>
               <p>Was any person near at the time? - Three gentlemen were coming from Kentish-Town, who were within a minute's walk of me; I did not see them till after he had robbed me.</p>
               <p>How long was the transaction about? - I suppose not above two minutes.</p>
               <p>During that two minutes, you must be in some agitation of spirits? - I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Could you take such accurate observations of the person of the man, as to swear positively that the prisoner is the person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any person with him? - He was alone; he had a great stick in his hand; he took me by the collar, and in a little time he said, Your money! I said, I have but a few shillings about me; I hope you will not take it from me. He said, Little or much, do not hesitate, or I will have your life.</p>
               <p>Did he, when he made use of this expression, stammer as he does now? - I did not hear any such thing. I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out an handful of silver: I had about 40 s. in my pocket; I left only an half-crown and a shilling in my pocket. He said, Here is not all; turn your pocket. I put my hand into my pocket again, and took out the half-crown and shilling. I said here is all; you may have my pocket turned, if you will; but I hope you will not take it at all. He gave me the half-crown again, and took the shilling. When he took the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300017"/> shilling, he pointed to my watch, and said, What is that watch? I said, I hope you will not take my watch. He immediately laid hold of the chain, and drew it out: he turned about. I said, Pray don't take my watch; it will grieve me to lose it, more than my money. He said, He had taken it. He turned, and went away. There is a gap at the corner of the field; I saw a man there. I said to him, Are you an honest man? He seemed staggered. I said, If you are an honest man, help me to take that man, pointing to the prisoner; he has robbed me of my watch and money. He said, Are you in earnest? I said, yes. He said, I saw you talking together, but did not know he was robbing you. While I was speaking to that man, two gentlemen came up: I told them the same. The man disappeared: we thought he had got into a ditch; we all went back, but did not find him. I gave information of the robbery at the office in Bow-street: I was afterwards sent for to Bow-street; I was shewn a man, and asked if I knew him; I said I did not. I was then taken into another room, where there was the prisoner and another man; I knew the prisoner immediately; I had a hint not to say any thing to him, if I knew him. I was taken before the justice a little after, and saw him there, and knew him directly.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of March, between ten and eleven at night, I was at supper in a cellar in <placeName id="t17810530-22-crimeloc89">Bridges-street, near Drury-lane</placeName>

They abused me, and called me a German dog, and began to push one another upon me, and hustle me about. The prisoner was the first man who began this: they struck me, and knocked me about, and continued to beat me in this manner for half an hour; and during that time, I lost my watch, for I am certain I had it in the cellar; and Davis and the other persons, who had behaved in that manner, were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300018"/> there when I looked at it: whether he saw me look at it, I cannot say; I missed it within ten minutes after they let me alone. I said I had lost my watch: upon saying so, all, or the greatest part, of the persons in the cellar went away; there were ten or eleven people there.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober? - Yes: I went in with a friend of mine (a Mr. Taylor) he was there all the time; he is not here: the reason why my friend did not interpose to have them taken into custody was, he was so much beat that he was ill for fourteen days after. On the 5th of May, I met the prisoner alone in Prince's street, and saw the chain and key of my watch; there are two seals upon it, which are not mine: I immediately stopped him, and told him he had my watch, and he must go along with me; he neither denied nor admitted that it was my watch, but said, if it was mine, he would give it me directly. I took him to the house where the constable was, and then he took out the watch, and gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Wilson; he went out on the 12th of January, in the afternoon, before dark; I was left at home.</p>
               <p>Were the doors shut up when he went out? - The door was upon the spring lock; I heard a kind of noise, like the motion of the sash; the sashes of the parlour were down; I was below in the kitchen; I immediately ran up stairs. This was the front parlour, and I was in the back kitchen, under the back parlour. When I heard the noise, I did not know where it was; I ran up stairs, and found the sash in the front parlour thrown open; I went down, and got a light. This was between five and six o'clock; it was quite dark. I found a sword and pistol taken away from the parlour, and one pistol was dropped in the parlour. A gentleman dined with my master, and my master went out with him.</p>
               <p>Had you been in the parlour any time that afternoon? - I had.</p>

               <p>Was any person in the house besides you? - A young woman called upon me, but she did not go into that room. I never left the house.</p>
               <p>I suppose you was frightened? - I was not much frightened; I put the sash down, and then shut the shutters. My master went to bed immediately as he came home; I did not tell him of it till he saw it, because I thought somebody in the neighbourhood had done it to frighten me, and that I might hear something of it the next morning.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing of value in the parlour, besides this sword and pistol? - Yes, there were some silver spoons, but they were in a cupboard; it was not locked, but the doors were shut. It was a very dark night.</p>
               <p>Was any of the glass of the sash broke? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 7th of May, in what they call the New Cut, a new road that is made from the sign of the Happy Man to Battle Bridge, a little after ten at night, in company with another person; they were on one side the road, we on the other; they crossed over to us; we went to see if we could find any body who had been concerned in a footpad robbery, committed the night before.</p>
               <p>They did not know you, I suppose? - If they had, they would not have come to us, I believe. I passed the first, and laid hold of the prisoner at the bar; I clapped my hand against his left breast, and said, Holloa! young fellow, what have you got here? I shifted my hands, to secure him; and he dropped this sword immediately, naked; afterwards he dropped the sheath: he dropped the sheath before I had well secured his hand; when he dropped the sword, I put my foot upon it immediately. He had no arms but that; it has been in my custody ever since.</p>

This is my sword; it belonged to General Melvin; he left it with me to make one for Lord Dunglass, as I have been in the army contract way; and I was to make one, at the same time, for General Melvin: he left it with me some time about the beginning of December; I had it as a pattern for Lord Dunglass; as this was a soft metal, not tempered, he wanted one that was tempered of good steel. I understood this was to be mine; I kept it as a curiosity: I suppose there is not such another in all England.</p>
               <p>Was the pistol yours? - It was. I have never seen my pistol since.</p>

She was examined; we found half a guinea and 3 s. 6 d. in her pocket. The husband was ordered out of the room, and the justice asked her, how she came by the money? She said, her husband gave it her, while they were at breakfast, at nine that morning. Then the prisoner was put on one side, and the husband was called in. The justice asked him, if he had given his wife any money that morning? He said, no, he had not given her a farthing that morning; nor could he trust her with a shilling; that she would pawn every thing he had.</p>

Then he clapped his left hand against my breast, and forced me down upon the ground, against the pales: he then put his left hand into my right-hand pocket, and took some money out. I looked him full in the face. He said, Blast your bloody eyes! I will cut your head off if you look at me: he got from my side, and unbuckled one of my shoes. I told him, they were plated buckles, but he was welcome to them; but begged he would not use me ill. He then came towards me again, with the hanger: they said, he would cut me if I looked at him; and they endeavoured to force my hat over my face, but it only covered my left eye. I kept looking at him; he stood up, towards my left foot, and I saw him receive the cloak from the other prisoner, who had robbed my wife: he clapped it between his knees.</p>
               <p>How many of them were there? - At first there were three. The prisoner Boys was the first that came up upon the path to me, and

               <p>Do you know the other man? - No; I only know the one that came first up to me: it was quite a bright moon-light night; the moon shone directly against the pales where I lay.</p>
               <p>How long might they be with you? - Five or six minutes; I cannot say to a minute, but thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner Errburrill before? - Never, to my knowledge. I gave information the next morning; and he was taken on the Monday evening, the next day. I was with them when they took them; they were taken within 3 or 400 yards from the spot where I was robbed. I pointed out Errburrill to them, and said, he was the man that came up to me with a cutlass.</p>

He had a cutlass under his coat; the other had a sword, which he dropped from behind him; the constable clapped his foot on it, and I picked it up. I pointed to Errburrill, and said, he was the person that robbed me, and held the cutlass over me. Errburrill said something about having been in company with some common-councilmen overnight. I heard nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>

               <p>Perhaps better. - I was, perhaps, more in spirits to make a just remark; I was not in liquor; I never was drunk in my life. I cannot say but I was a little in fear at his holding a cutlass over me.</p>
               <p>You were not quite so cool as you are now about it? - Yes, I was. I lost about 2 d. out of my right-hand breeches pocket: two or three of the halfpence, I am positive, were good. When he was before Justice Blackborough, he said he found the cutlass.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At Battle-Bridge. I was going home.</p>
               <p>Did you know the other prisoner before? - I have seen him in the neighbourhood before.</p>
               <p>Did not you drink with him on the Monday morning, at a public-house? - No; at the time of the robbery I knew nothing of him.</p>

We were attacked by three footpads: one of them came up, and pulled out a cutlass from underneath his coat, and held it to my husband; he went to strike my husband over the head, and he lifted up his hand.

I saw Errburrill come across the road; he came up to my husband, with a stiff attitude. I said, the instant they were gone, I should know their faces again.</p>

               <p>Did you take notice of his clothes? - I cannot justly say; I know they were a dark colour. He had a round hat.</p>

I walked up, and saw the prosecutor lay upon the ground, and a man with an hanger standing over him, and another alongside of him; one stood off in the road.

               <p>On the 7th of this month the prosecutor called on me, in the morning, and told me he had been robbed over-night. In the evening two more constables, myself, and Mr. Johnson, took a walk over the fields; we went down what they call the New Cut, that goes across the two roads: the prosecutor was before me some distance; I and Redgrave were together; there was another constable behind us. The two prisoners crossed over to me and the other constable: I passed Errburrill, who was first, and laid hold of Ives; I clapped my hands on his sides, and said, Holloa, young fellow! what have you got here? I felt the handle of this (producing a sword) under his coat; it was drawn; it dropped down by my foot; I put my foot upon it, and after that he dropped this sheath. I called out; they came up, and Redgrave laid hold of Errburrill; the others came up, and we secured them. As soon as the prosecutor came up, he said to Redgrave, that is the man that robbed me last night, and had the cutlass. Redgrave said, he has got a cutlass now, for I felt it under his clothes. The prosecutor came up to me, and took the sword from under my foot, and stood by while they were tied together.</p>

               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Had Johnson described the clothes the men were in before? - He said, dark-coloured clothes. He said, he should know the person again that stood over him with a cutlass.</p>

I told him, she was not at home. He asked, whether she was gone down towards Fleet-street? he said, he would go and try to see her. He returned in five or six minutes; he said, he had not seen her: he went away, and came again exactly as the clock struck eight. The girl was come home, and he came indoors with her, and went out with her a little before nine; and returned, as nigh as I can recollect, about a quarter before ten o'clock. There was a young man sat facing my door, in liquor; he went with him up into Hatton-garden, to assist him home. The prisoner, and a Mr. Roberts, the master of the young man, came back to my door again; he staid then till about three-quarters after ten, or near eleven o'clock; it was past ten when he came in.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; my stand is in Shoe-lane, the corner of the White Swan. On Sunday, the 6th of May, when I called ten o'clock, I opened my box, and heard the half-hour chimes at St. Paul's; I went into Collet's shop; the young man was sitting on one side of the fire, and

               <p>My husband is a watch-maker; he is Errburrill's master. I let him in on the Sunday night before he was taken up, at about a quarter before eleven, I believe; we generally go to bed about eleven. I bid him go to bed. I locked the door, and took the key; I chained the door, and bolted the windows; just after, I heard St. Paul's strike eleven. I had the watch in my hand, and looked to see if it was right, before I hung it up.</p>
               <p>Was your husband at home at the time? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>BOYS MAY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watch-maker; Boys is my apprentice; he was christened after me. On the 6th of May he came in before eleven. Mrs.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300026"/> May had a watch in her hand; she said, the clock was striking eleven. I was smoking a pipe; I put it down, and went to bed immediately. He has lived with me five years last April. He is very honest; I have trusted him to take large sums. I always found him very honest.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Before Justice Blackborough, this witness said he knew nothing of his coming home; that he went to bed at half after eleven. - [May. I said no such thing. On the Monday night he had staid out all night; on the Tuesday morning, going by Clerkenwell-church, I saw my boy, with a parcel of men, that, I supposed, had taken him up. I was greatly surprised, and very much flurried. I went with them before the justice, who asked me if I could say what time he came home? I said, I could not tell whether it was eleven, or half after eleven; but my wife let him in, and could tell particularly. I was so flurried, I could not tell what I said, or did. I had not had any intimation that he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Kipping. When he saw the lad, he said, This is no wonder at all; I told you what you would come to, when you lay-out four or five nights at a time: now he says, he never knew any thing amiss of him.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I ask you again, was he an honest boy? - Yes; I would trust him with untold gold, if I had him home now.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the prosecutor. On Sunday se'nnight my husband lay down on the bed: I had an acquaintance in the room; my child wanted to go down stairs with her. I bid her take the child down, and I would come and fetch her up: I went down after her, and hearing the dog bark, I thought it was my husband's brother had come in. I went to see, and a woman went out: the child said the dog barked at her; but not thinking she had been in my room, I went up stairs, and missed a tea-chest. I went into the next room: they said I had better go after her: I said I could not run then, the fright had seized me so; but if they would run after her, I would follow them as fast as I could. By this time it was about a quarter of an hour after I saw her go out: we went after her, and at the top of Red-lion street, I saw her with something in her apron; I walked behind her; she stopped till I passed her; I then pulled her apron down, and saw the tea-chest; I brought her back, and called my husband; he took her up stairs, and found the spoons in her pocket: she said a man gave them to her in Holborn.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar came into our shop last Tuesday was week, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, to buy a silk handkerchief; I shewed her several pieces. I was in the shop, by myself. She agreed for one, for 4 s. and, just as I was cutting it off, she put her hand into her pocket, as I imagined, for her money, to pay me; and, instead of money, she took out a handful of snuff, and rubbed my face all over with it; she rubbed it in my eyes and mouth; then she took the remainder of the piece of handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Did you see her? - My eyes were blinded; as soon as I opened my eyes, she was between the shop door and counter. The piece of handkerchiefs catched on the latch of the shop door, and the spikes of the kitchen window. I ran out, snuffy as I was, and begged of the people to stop her. She left the handkerchiefs behind her, hanging on the kitchen window, I believe.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the person? - I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>What became of the handkerchief that was cut off? - That was, all over snuff, on the counter.</p>
               <p>What was the value of the handkerchiefs? - Two shillings a-piece. A person picked the handkerchiefs up; but he went away: the handkerchiefs remained on the spikes.</p>

               <p>Was that the room you used to work in? - No: she asked the favour to let her entertain some friends to dine with her that day, the 24th: I gave her leave. The door was locked. I gave her the key, to lay the cloth. She was in the room about five minutes, between two and three o'clock. She had a leg of mutton boiled, at my expence. She came out of the room into the back room, put the key in her pocket, and said she was going for some capers to the mutton. She went out, and staid above half an hour. I was a little surprised that her company did not come, nor she return. I looked for the key of the door. I could not find it. Then I opened another door that goes into the room. I immediately missed my watch.</p>
               <p>How long before had you seen the watch in the mahogany case, in the parlour? - Four or five minutes. I had but just come out, and locked the door, when I gave the key to her. I called my women down I had at work, and desired them to go round to the neighbouring pawnbrokers, to get them to stop it, if she offered to pawn it.

               <p>I am a pawnbroker. On the 24th of May, between three and four o'clock, a watch was offered me to pawn by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How far is your house from Mrs. Scott's? - About three or four hundred yards. She then said her name was King. I never saw her before, but I can swear to her person. I asked her whose watch it was. She said it was not her own, that it belonged to one Mrs. Smith, in Drury-lane. I had some suspicion of her. I sent the boy with her to Mrs. Smith's. The prosecutrix's woman found the boy, and the woman came to our house.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>

               <p>I have no witnesses but God and your honours. If I had meant to steal it, I would not have pawned it so near hand. I had an acquaintance to bring me some money on Sunday. I wanted a little before hand. I did not mean to wrong her of it.</p>

He presented a pistol, and asked for my purse. I gave it him. There were a guinea and three or four shillings in it. He then asked for my watch. I did not give it him immediately.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300030"/> He bid me make haste, he must have it. I then gave it him. It was a gold watch in a single case. There was likewise a gold chain, two seals set in gold, and a gold key. They rode off immediately.</p>
               <p>How long were they about this? - About two or three minutes; not longer. The man on the right-hand I could not see: the man on the left's face was so hid, I could see little of him: he had a great coat over his chin, a hat flapped over his face, and a large handkerchief round his neck. I could not distinguish them. I looked out of the coach, and saw two men ride down the lane. My servant brought a man to me, who said he knew these two men I saw ride down the lane. I then told him I had just been robbed.</p>
               <p>What is that man's name? -

            , I think, he calls himself. He was a stranger to me; I never saw him before. I asked him if he would go with me to Justice Sherwood's office: I took him into the coach with me, and we went down to the office; and Justice Sherwood sent two men with that man to watch for these men. In the morning I heard they were both taken.</p>
               <p>Can you describe the person that was on your side, his stature, or his clothes? - He had a very large great-coat on, buttoned over his face; it was rather a dark colour, I think. He appeared to me rather a square man, of large features; I saw very plain that he had a very large nose. I thought he was a little marked with the small-pox.</p>
               <p>You did not make any observations on the other? - No; I could not: I did not see his face. I was alone in the coach; it was my own coach; and I had a servant behind.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found on the men? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Were the coachman and footman both sober? - The footman is a sober man; I cannot say much for the coachman.</p>
               <p>Was he sober that night? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>He is often in liquor? - So often, that I can hardly distinguish when he is and when he is not.</p>
               <p>Could you see how the other man was dressed? - In a light great coat: I only saw his back. When they came to the Justice's, there was a number of people attending for one of the prisoners, to prove he was at a public-house at the time.</p>
               <p>You did not observe any thing about the horses? - Nothing at all. I have had the coachman six months; he is a very good coachman; he drives as we I drunk as sober.</p>
               <p>He has not heard his character? - He knows it very well: that is the character I had with him, though he was recommended as a very good coachman.</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 6th of this month, I was driving my master home from Clapton to Bethnal-green. I was stopped by two men that were riding on the road: one of them clapped a pistol before the horses heads, and made me stop directly; and after that made me look over the horses heads, not to look back.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observations on the person or dress of the man? - He was a moderate-sized man; a pretty fair complexion. It was a very light night: he had a great coat on, and a handkerchief round his neck; but, being in confusion, I did not take notice of his dress. He went from me, and threatened the footman behind, and made him hold down his head. The other went and opened the door, and threatened my master very much, and bid him be quick. They turned round, and went as if they were going to Old Ford, behind the carriage.</p>
               <p>How long were they doing this? - Not above a minute.</p>

               <p>You say, the business was only one minute in performing; will you take upon yourself to swear to the person of a man you saw only for the space of a minute, and never saw before; and under the terror of the robbery? - I mean to speak nothing but the truth.</p>

               <p>Did you make any accurate observations upon the man, so as to be able to swear to him so positively? - I am certain he was the man.</p>
               <p>You was in a flurry at the time? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>How came you to be so sober on that day, more than any other day in the year? - I do not know that I was remarkably sober.</p>
               <p>You are apt to be remarkably drunk. - If I had been a drunken servant, I should not have staid so long in my place as I have.</p>
               <p>Your master gives a different account of you; he says, you are a drunken servant. - My master don't know when I am drunk or sober.</p>

I saw the two prisoners on horseback; they passed me, and I looked them full in the face, and said, There you go, Billy. The gentleman's servants hearing me say that, came up to me, and asked me if I saw two men pass me on horseback? I said, Yes. He said, Do you know them? I innocently said, I do. The gentleman, hearing me say that to the servant, asked me, if I knew them? I said, I knew them very well; they were two neighbours of mine; and mentioned their names. The gentleman desired me to go into his carriage, till information was made; which I was very 1oth to do.</p>

We came again about six o'clock, and planted ourselves at each end of the walk, and waited for his coming home. I was reading a news-paper in a neighbouring public-house, and saw him come home, on horseback, about a quarter before eight. As soon as he alighted from his horse, I apprehended him, in his own yard. I left him in custody of Farrell, and searched the house: I found nothing but some powder, in a piece of paper. He asked me to go with him to Sherburd's father. Going along, this young man was coming by. Holliday struck at him, and hit him a blow on his face: he asked him what that was for? he said, For going to Sherburd's father that night. We went to Sherburd's father; he said, he knew where Sherburd was, and sent for him; his sister fetched him. I said, he must go before the justice likewise. I took them to Sherwood's, with the assistance of Farrell; and they were committed.</p>

Just as I turned into Artiilery Lane, a young man came running up to me, and asked me if I had lost an handkerchief; upon which I put my hand in my pocket, and found my handkerchief was gone. He told me a boy had picked it out of my pocket. I turned back with him:

               <p>Passing along Bishopsgate-street, on Sunday evening the 6th of this month, I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket: he turned up a passage; I followed him, and took hold of his coat; he asked me what I did that for, and I pulled him out into the street, and by that time Mr. Hodgson had returned; but before that, I told him a gentleman had lost his handkerchief, and he pulled it out of his pocket, and threw it about his neck: he said it was the handkerchief he always wore about his neck: that was while he was in the passage.</p>
               <p>Are you quite certain you saw him take it out of the gentleman's pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>( The handkerchief was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I was sent for: I saw the bureau had been forced: I found a large spike-nail in the room; I tried, and it fitted the mark where it had been wrenched open. They did not attempt to go away, nor make any resistance. I found an handkerchief and neckcloth in the window.</p>
               <p>CORN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I promiscuously went into the Two Brewers, in Shoe-lane. I went to meet a young man at four o'clock, as I had appointed, to buy two canary birds. I met this young woman at the door: we recollected one another: we sat about half an hour: then this young man came and said he was sorry he kept us so long, but one of the birds was dead. We had a bowl replenished. Just after, she came in, and said we had broke her master's desk open. I know nothing of it; nor did any there, I am persuaded.</p>

               <p>I had not been five minutes in the room before the girl came in, and charged us with breaking a desk open.</p>

On Sunday last I had three guineas and an half, a gold ring, and some silver; the gold ring was put into my purse with my money. I had four guineas which were left me by a relation: I changed one, and had three and an half left, and some silver. I took a hackney-coach in St. Paul's church-yard to go to Shadwell: the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300037"/> was in company with me.

I was not very sober: I was a little asleep in the coach. When I awoke, I found the prisoner putting my purse into my pocket. When I came home, I missed my watch: the watch was returned to me by the prisoner; he said he had taken care of it for me. When I came home, I examined my purse; and my money was gone. When I charged the prisoner with taking the money, he said he would enter an action against me for scandling him.</p>

               <p>What wharf is your barge moored at? - Wright's wharf, in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate. There were 157 quarters of corn on board, in 314 sacks.</p>
               <p>When you came down on the Sunday morning, what did you miss? - I saw a great hole on one side. I examined it. There were 17 sacks missing, containing four bushels each.</p>

               <p>Who did that punt belong to? - The prisoner's father. The prisoner worked in it. He built a fine place in it for the reception of himself and a boy in the night.</p>
               <p>He was not on board when you found the sacks? - No; she was made fast to a Dutchman, and nobody on board.</p>

He took first five quarters in the skiff, and carried it to his punt, and put it in his punt; then he went and took three quarters more, and Clod took the punt to Union-stairs: then we came along-side the punt, and put the three quarters in, and laid there till morning; then we went on shore.</p>

               <p>Before I went to bed I saw the house was fast: I fastened the doors and windows with my own hand. In the morning I found my chamber window was opened, and a piece of it broke off: the sash was down, and whole, when I went to bed; I was in bed at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300039"/> time; I take it to have been done between one and two o'clock; I was waked by the noise; I pulled by the curtain, and I saw my gown half out of the window; when I went to bed, I laid it on a chair back. We had a great wash; there were seven-shifts in the platter, that had not been put by. I saw the platter was empty; I was in such a fright, I could hardly open the door, but it was God's mercy he did not kill me.</p>
               <p>You was not waked with the breaking the window? - No, with the going out. I burn a rush-light; that was blown out; the maid went and fetched my daughter, who lives a little way off. I had some handbills printed, and dispersed. The prisoner was very ragged the day before; the next day he had good clothes on. The keys were taken out of my pocket, and the beaufet opened, and the tankard, pint mug, and spoons taken out. I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) The dollar I had had above forty years: my husband gave it me before I was married; and the housewife and dollar were found on the prisoner when he was taken: I saw them at the justice's.</p>

I asked him, where he was going with it, at that time of night? The other gave me answer, what was that to me? I took the prisoner to the watch-house; the other ran away: the other said, he would go for the master he bought the lamb of. The prisoner went very quietly to the watchhouse; then the prisoner said, his master owed him 13 s. and one of the men bid him take the lamb for the money. He gave me a direction to his master. I went to Mr. Hembrew's slaughter-house, to see if it was open.</p>

I was immediately dispatched from the office for a nightman: this was about one at noon. I went with the nightman to search the necessary. We pulled the flooring up. He went down, and brought up a female child.</p>
               <p>Could you see the child before it was fetched up? - We had looked with a candle, but could not see it. The nightman washed the child.</p>

I said she would not disturb me. We both went to bed together. I went to sleep. I awaked, and asked her how she was. She said she was very ill. Some time after I asked her again how she did.

Mrs. Marsh called the prisoner, and asked her what was the meaning of it. She said she had not been very well.</p>

               <p>Were there any marks of violence upon it? - There was the appearance of a blow upon the head; but it did not appear to be inflicted by any acute body, but something blunt; a board, or stone, or the like.</p>
               <p>Might not that bruise be occasioned by its falling from her body into this little house? - If it fell upon any hard substance: it was on the back part of the head.</p>

On the 25th of May, about four in the afternoon, the two prisoners came into the shop, to purchase a very small quantity of clear lawn; my shopman and I shewed them several pieces: there were other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300045"/> customers in the shop, and there was a parcel of muslins lay on the other counter: after they had looked at the lawn, they ordered a half yard to be cut off, which came to 15 d. I saw Price fingering the muslins on the other counter: I went round to her, to shew them to her, and to tell her the price: she said it was too dear: I then went round to the other woman, to cut off the lawn, and take the money. When they were going out, the man informed me, one of them had taken a piece of muslin. I ordered the shopman to follow them: after some time the shopman brought them back; and afterwards two others were brought in: as they were going into the parlour, through the shop, a piece of muslin, about three yards, dropped; but I do not know from whom.</p>

On the 4th of May, about eight in the morning, I had occasion to go down into the kitchen; when I had been there about three minutes, I thought I heard some person in the shop. I immediately ran up stairs, and missed this piece of cloth from off the counter; it lay on the counter when I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you leave any person in the shop? - No. I found the door wide open; it was shut when I went down: I went to the door, and saw the prisoner, with the cloth on his shoulder; he turned round, and saw me at the door; then he threw the cloth down, and ran away: I called out, Stop thief! and ran after him, and overtook him a little way up Bedford-street: I never lost sight of him. I seized him, and brought him back. My master came down, and we took the prisoner to Bow-street Office; and he was committed.</p>
               <p>What did the cloth contain? - Twenty-eight yards: it is of the value of 10 l.</p>
               <p>(The Cloth was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Rutherford left her clothes at our house about five or six weeks ago, I believe it was. I was over the way, at the cook's shop, drinking tea, about four or five in the afternoon. I saw the prisoner go into the house where I lodge, and I saw her coming out with a great apron-full of things. I went up to my own room, and found the door open, and the boxes in the room open. I had locked the door when I went out; but it is a very poor lock. I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment. I went after the prisoner, but lost sight of her for almost half an hour; then I catched her just by the Star brewhouse, with all the things upon her: I brought her back, and charged a constable with her.</p>

I went to Bow-street, and gave an information of it, but never found her till Wednesday fortnight; then I heard she was in Tothill-fields.

               <p>The prisoner came upon Shrove-Tuesday to me, where I work, and asked me if I would have any thing to drink. She had lodged in our house about a fortnight. She went over to the public-house, and wanted some gin. I said I had rather have beer. I called for a pot of half-and-half. She went out, and said she would come again. She came again in about ten minutes. She had three gowns, a petticoat, and an apron, in her apron. The prosecutrix came the next day to our house, and asked for her.</p>

They were both infatuated in liquor. The prosecutrix desired me to pawn the gown for half a guinea, which I did, and stopped the half-guinea, because she owed me 18 s. She was very much in liquor; and so was I. As to her other gown, she lent it to Yorkshire Poll.</p>
               <p>To Vaughan. By what do you know the day of the month on which the gown was pawned? - By the book. The prosecutrix came three days after it was pledged, and said

After looking some time after them, and going twice down Wapping, I saw two girls with a watchman at the Hermitage-stairs, and by their direction I found the prisoners at a house in East Smithfield. As soon as the door was opened, I saw them, and challenged them; they denied knowing any thing of me, or my money. White had an old night-cap in her bosom, with nine guineas and a half in it; one was a particular one, an old one, which, with the moidore, I took for two guineas, it being light, and being a King

The constable was then sent for; he questioned them about the remainder of the money: they both denied having any more; I took them up stairs, and searched the apartments above, but found nothing there. Weyland had only one stocking on; being asked for the other, she said it was below stairs, and part of the money was in it; she came down, and told us that the stocking laid under the table; there were ten guineas in it, and one guinea upon the floor; they declared that was all they had; I took them to the watch-house, and they were committed: I observed them, and I am sure the prisoners are the persons.</p>

               <p>"MONEY READY.</p>
               <p>"A Gentleman of strict honour and integrity, who has upwards of 3000 l. unemployed, would willingly advance the same, or any part of it not less than 300 l. to any Lady or Gentleman of fortune and character, with the utmost secrecy and dispatch, and on terms agreeable to the nature of the security. Principals only will be treated with, by applying or addressing to S. F. at the Globe tavern, Hatton-street, Hatton-garden."</p>
               <p>In consequence of this advertisement, I went to the Globe tavern. I asked if the principal was to be spoke with. The landlord of the house said he was not there; but, if I pleased, he would give me his address. He said his name was Alvarez, and he lived at No. 30, Skinner-street, Bishopsgate-street. I went there. The second<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300049"/> morning; I saw the prisoner. I asked him if he was the principal who had the money to lend. He said he was not the principal, but he was employed by several gentleman of fortune and character to lend their money. We went together to Bread-street coffee-house. We had a couple of dishes of coffee there. He said he must enquire my character; and if he approved of it, I might have what money I pleased. We parted then. In a day or two after, Mr. Alvarez came to my house in Aldersgate-street. He told me he had enquired my character, and liked it well; and I might have what money I pleased. I told him I wanted but 200 l. He then asked me what I dealt in. I shewed him. He gave me an order for a groce of gentlemen's pocketbooks with instruments/ I thought it a very large order. I said it was so large an order, I could not undertake to execute it. He said he would give me time. I said I could not execute it till he let me have the money, but it should be forwarded against he let me have the money ready. On the 12th of March, Mr. Alvarez came to me. I was called down from dinner. He took me to the Half-moon tavern, in Aldersgate-street. He called for pen, ink, and paper; and asked for my draughts. He said I could not have less than 400 l. I was greatly surprised at his asking for my draughts; I said I expected to give a bond for the money. He said it was all the same; the Gentleman did not wish to put me to so much expence, he would take my draughts. I then drew four notes. After they were drawn, he said the Gentleman was extremely angry he had not brought the premium with him: he must have part. He desired to have three guineas. I gave him three guineas, as part of the premium. The next day he came for two guineas more, for part of the premium. I gave him two guineas. Three days after, he came again, and pressed me for five guineas more; he said he could not do without it, and must have it. So I gave him five guineas. I gave him thirty-one guineas for premium, in part.</p>
               <p>Did you ever receive the 400 l.? - I never saw the colour of his money: I received no part of it. On the 28th of March he sent for me to the Vine tavern, in Holborn. There he told me he was come to finish my business. He desired me to bring all my accounts of the different monies he had received, and of the goods he had had of me, which was 109 l. 10 s. 1 d. I went and gave him all this account in one bill of parcels. He desired to see how much he was in my debt; in the whole it was 551 l. 10 s. 9 d. He had given me two or three notes of hand for the different notes and money.</p>
               <p>That does not accord with the idea of this money to be given as a premium. - That money is not in that account. He gave me a note for the 400 l. and the 109 l. worth of goods he gave me a note for at three days, which he was to come and take up in three days. There was 26 lb. of tobacco I bought for him, which I had not put into the bill of parcels. After he gave me that note, he said, if I would get a bit of fish for supper, he would come and sup with me that evening, and bring the money. This was upon the 28th of March. He did not come in the evening; but at nine at night he sent me a note, that he could not get the money, and could not come till eleven next morning, when he would call upon me. I saw no more of him, till I received a note from him to come to him at a spunging-house. I went. He there told me I must lend him 70 l. or he could not get me the money. That was in the beginning of April. He sent for me then to the Windmill, in Rosemary-lane: he said he was arrested by

I told him I would have nothing more to do with him; and left him. While I was in there, Mr. Menham, a Gentleman he says he expects, was there in company with him; he went out of the room. I had a friend there. Mr. Alvarez and my friend had some words. I desired my friend to go out of the room, while Alvarez and I settled the business. Alvarez wanted 70 l. more of me. I would not give it: I thought he had had enough. He then called the landlord of the house in. I paid 10 l. to that Mr. Menham, of Fenchurch-street, for giving me up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300050"/> four 100 l. notes, on the 7th of April; and Mr. Menham then obtained a promissory note from me for 5 l. 15 s. which I have been troubled for to-day.</p>
               <p>How came you to give him the note for 5 l. 15 s.? - He said he had been at a great expence in getting these notes back, and expected some satisfaction for himself for taking all this trouble to serve me.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Are these two papers your hand-writing? - They are both. I received these when I gave Menham the 10 l. and 5 l. 15 s. It is a receipt Menham or Alvarez wrote, and I signed it.</p>
               <p>You said it was in consequence of this advertisement you found out Mr. Alvarez? - It was.</p>
               <p>I believe upon your meeting you agreed to give him four promissory notes of hand? - I did; and I did do so.</p>
               <p>What had you by way of counter-security? - His promissory note for 400 l. He was to bring me the money for that on the 7th of April. I saw he never intended to pay me, and wished to get my own notes back.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you might think it would affect your credit to have these notes out? - I was determined not to pay them without I had value for them.</p>
               <p>You then applied to Alvarez for your notes? - No; to Menham: he was the person who applied to me about getting them back.</p>
               <p>Then you found yourself desirous of getting back these notes? - When I found I should not get the money.</p>
               <p>Your notes were not then due? - No.</p>
               <p>Those notes you are now in possession of? - I am.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect having a variety of dealings with Alvarez? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I understand you have given several premiums? - That is that I call upon him for now.</p>
               <p>The intent of giving these premiums was for the purpose of his raising the money? - It was.</p>
               <p>Within what time had Alvarez contracted with you to raise the money? - Within 12 days.</p>
               <p>At what distance from first seeing him was it you required these notes to be delivered up? - About a fortnight or three weeks after his note of 400 l. was due, and I found I should not get the money.</p>
               <p>Was you not told by Alvarez, that his principal, who had employed him in this business, upon discovering your name, did not very much approve of your notes? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you he was employed by a Mr.

               <p>Did not you strike a balance of all matters and accounts that were then between you? - There were no questions asked about any thing. There is a receipt I signed there, which is for the notes Mr. Alvarez gave me.</p>

            , with one of Douglas's notes; Mr. Alvarez bought some goods of Mr. Barnet, and gave him this bill in payment. Barnet would not deliver the goods to Alvarez till he had spoken to Douglas himself, to find if Douglas was a good man: Mr. Barnet came to Mr. Douglas, and he told him.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. Was you there? - No: but I shall tell you what Mr. Douglas has told me: he said it was his note, and he would pay it when due: all his notes were honourable bills; when Mr. Alvarez came with the second bill to Mr. Barnet, which had, to the best of my knowledge, to run about nine months.</p>
               <p>Do you know what was done with the first bill? - I have heard Mr. Barnet mention, but not else.</p>
               <p>He wanted more goods upon the second bill of 100 l.? - He took 32 l. worth of goods upon the second bill, and gave Barnet orders to deliver the remainder: a few days after, he wanted to lay the second bill out with Barnet, as cash for goods.</p>
               <p>Tell the conversation that passed between Alvarez and Douglas, upon the 7th of April. - Mr. Douglas came to my house, and delivered to me a bill for 440 l. or 540 l.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what conversation passed between Douglas and Alvarez? - Yes: Douglas promised to pay me for my trouble: the meeting was at one Mr. Smith's, an officer's house, in Rosemary Lane, about eleven or twelve at night.</p>
               <p>How long had you been Mr. Douglas's friend? - From the time I went to know if this bill was his hand-writing, I was employed by Mr. Douglas; and when Alvarez found Douglas had been at my house, and desired me to settle the matter, I made an appointment with Mr. Alvarez to meet Douglas; so Alvarez appointed Mr. Smith's, in Rosemary Lane, to meet at: I sent Douglas word to meet there; Douglas did not come at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did Alvarez, when you were together, at this settlement, tell Douglas, that if he would be patient, he could raise him the money upon these notes? - Mr. Alvarez had 132 l. from Barnet, and goods.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether any part of that money was given to Douglas? - I do not know: Douglas mentioned to me he had lent him 30 l. I was present; Alvarez told Douglas he had parted with his bills, and could not get any money upon them, but 132 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Alvarez tell Douglas that he had received 132 l. upon two of his bills? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You venture to swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was present when he told Douglas so? - Douglas and I were present: there was another gentleman present, a friend of Mr. Douglas; but he bid him go out.</p>
               <p>Was he, the other gentleman, present when Alvarez told Douglas he had received 132 l. for his notes? - No: Alvarez and Douglas bid us to go out of the room; they had something to say to themselves they did not care any other gentleman should hear.</p>
               <p>Court. Mind the question I ask you: who was present when Alvarez told Douglas he had 132 l. upon his notes? - Douglas himself told me so when he went away from Alvarez, about twelve at night.</p>
               <p>Did you hear Alvarez tell Douglas so? - I was not in the same room.</p>
               <p>The question I now ask you, requires no other answer than yes or no: Did you yourself hear Alvarez tell Douglas that he had received 132 l. upon his notes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What answer did Douglas make to that? - Mr. Douglas said he had nothing to say; that as he could not give him any money, he meant to have his bills from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300052"/>How could Douglas say that, when he had said he had 132 l. upon his notes? - Alvarez said he would get his bills out of the hands of Barnet in a few days.</p>

               <p>Then he did not pretend he had got this money of Barnet? - He had it in goods; and Douglas could not make use of the goods: and when he got the money to pay Barnet again, he meant to get the bills out of Barnet's hand, as Barnet would not advance any more money upon them?</p>
               <p>Did Douglas approve of this use being made of his notes when Alvarez told him that? - Douglas answered, he should not pay Barnet; he should not pay any body: and meant to have his goods back again: and if he could not pay him what goods he had received of Douglas, he should give him security more: he said, if you cannot raise any money, give me the goods you have got of me; if you are put in a non-plus about it, give me my goods back again that you have got. After this was mentioned to Douglas, Douglas went away with the other gentleman in a great passion, and said he should take his own time, only to get his bills as soon as possible. When I went away, Douglas begged favours of me; and said, he would pay me for my trouble, if I could get these bills again without any blemish upon them. I went to Alvarez, and told him he should get the bills out, or there would be bad consequences.</p>
               <p>He wanted his bills back again then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he want the premium back too? - No. He mentioned nothing of the premium. He mentioned that he had lent him money to the amount of 30 l. sometimes 3 l. at a time, sometimes 5 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Alvarez present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he deny it? - No. He did not deny that he lent him the money.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Was that money lent by Douglas to Alvarez? - I know no more than Douglas told me, that he lent him the money, and had his note for it.</p>
               <p>Did you hear what Alvarez was to have of Douglas for his trouble, if he raised the money? - I heard nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a gentleman, Sir.</p>
               <p>No other business? - Yes. A merchant.</p>
               <p>A gentleman merchant? a merchant in what? - In what I can buy to get money by.</p>
               <p>One of those merchants we meet about the streets? - No. You are greatly mistaken. I am a man who sends goods abroad.</p>
               <p>Abroad in the street, you mean? - I am a merchant who has suffered a great deal here in this country.</p>
               <p>And if you stay here many years longer, you will suffer more in this country, in all probability. You were the friend of Mr. Douglas? - Mr. Douglas sent me, as his friend.</p>
               <p>And you, a capital merchant, employed by a friend, expect to be paid for doing him a service? - I have been hunting about for Douglas for seven or eight days.</p>
               <p>Then one of the merchandizes you deal in, is friendship, which you sell. You sold some of your friendship to Mr. Douglas? - I sold him some he has not paid me for yet.</p>
               <p>He gave you a note? - He gave me 10 l. in cash, and 5 l. 15 s. to give Barnet. He lent it Alvarez; and Alvarez gave me a note for the balance he owed Douglas.</p>
               <p>Court. For whose use was that fifteen guineas you received of Douglas? - For Mr. Alvarez, and for the use of Mr. Barnet.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that the 5 l. 15 s. was not for your trouble? - No.</p>
               <p>Is not the name of Mr. Smith, at the Rosemary-Branch, Jeremiah? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You said you heard Alvarez tell Mr. Douglas about having received 132 l. from Barnet. You mentioned first of all, that a gentleman was present: was that gentleman present at the house? - No. We were out in the other room. They bid us go out in the other room.</p>
               <p>Then you did not hear them say it? - Mr. Douglas and Mr. Alvarez mentioned it to me.</p>
               <p>But you told his Lordship, that you heard Alvarez tell Douglas, that he had received 132 l.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman was there then? - No. He was affronted with Mr. Alvarez, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300053"/> would not go in. I was called in as the friend of Mr. Douglas.</p>
               <p>Then you did not know Alvarez before? - No; we were not acquainted.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you swear you did not know Alvarez before this transaction? - Yes, I knew him.</p>
               <p>Then why do you hesitate about it? - I might know him by sight. I had no connection with him.</p>
               <p>Did not you know him very well before this? - I did not know him very well.</p>
               <p>How long had you known him? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Had you known him a week, or half a dozen years? - I did not know him half a dozen years, nor three neither. I cannot tell, upon my oath, how long I knew him.</p>
               <p>You can tell the difference between a week and a year? - I knew him longer than a week, but can't say that I knew him a year.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear you had not known him a year before this transaction? - I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that you knew Douglas at all before this business? - No.</p>
               <p>You knew Alvarez a twelvemonth before, but had never seen Douglas before; how came you to meet to settle the business between Alvarez and Douglas, as Douglas's friend? - Mr. Barnet sent me to Douglas, to hear if this was his hand-writing; and Douglas called me up into his room.</p>
               <p>Court. And adopted you for his friend immediately?</p>
               <p>Counsel. You heard nothing of these premiums? - No: I heard Douglas say Alvarez came to him at different times, and he lent him money.</p>

I went to drink with him. I went with him as far as Aldersgate-street. He said, Do me a favour: I have a little transaction with one Mr. Douglas. I went to Douglas, and told him, as Alvarez desired, that Alvarez would be glad to see him. I went to Douglas. He said he would come to him. He came. They drank together. Douglas said, We are friends now together, but I could ruin you. I have a note of 400 l. odd: I could ruin you: but you shall have it back again. Alvarez said, As we are friends together, I will call upon you tomorrow; and for the goods I have had of you, I can pay you in seven weeks. He called next morning and took the goods, and paid him a note for 161 or 2 l.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any talk about 400 l.? - He said he had got his notes up, and the other notes he had got by him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 15th of May I went to see my mother. I had been gone sixteen years from home. As I was coming along, a man stood at the corner of <placeName id="t17810530-52-crimeloc238">Saltpetre Bank, in East-Smithfield</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17810530-52-crimeloc238" type="placeName"

I had never seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300054"/> him before in my life. I told him I thought it was almost too late. Never mind it, says he; it is not so late: there is an alehouse just by: take a bit of a walk, and take part of it. I went with him. I walked up about 15 rod, and I espied a light out in the middle of Saltpetre Bank. There were about ten men, and one girl: they were drinking in the middle of the street, upon the pavement. When the man and I went up to them, there was a large gallon pot full of beer, and three quart pots going round among them. They asked me to drink. I took a pot of beer to drink. They immediately all rose upon me, and took the staff I had out of my hand, and knocked me down several times. I made a resistance, and tried to get away. They said, do not strike him again, but draw your knives, and let his puddings out. Then they all drawed their knives upon me.</p>
               <p>Who said that? - Not one in particular. I believe they all mentioned the words; and I saw their knives all drawn. They said, if I made any resistance, they would let my puddings out. A gentleman hearing the noise, came up, and said, Sailor, come out of them.</p>
               <p>What did they do, after they had drawn their knives? - They beat me about the head. When the gentleman came up, they left me, and went and beat him about the head, and beat a part of one of his fingers off. The prisoner Thompson had his hand in my pocket: they took all my money out; he hauled my pocket the wrong side out.</p>
               <p>How much money did you lose? - Fourteen shillings, I had in my pocket: the rest of the prisoners were round me, and had their hands round my neck; they took off a cotton handkerchief, and a breast buckle out of my shirt: they tried to get this black handkerchief off; it was tied tight, and they almost choaked me: I cannot tell who did that: the gentleman halloo'd, Watch! watch! as loud as he could halloo. As the watch came round, the people scattered, and some went off.</p>
               <p>Who was that gentleman? - One Mr. Probyn.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of the other persons that were there, except Thompson? - Yes. I know the faces of every one that was catched.</p>
               <p>Are you sure Thompson was one of the men? - Yes: he hauled my pocket inside out.</p>
               <p>What opportunity had you of observing him? - They had a light; I saw all their faces distinctly, and knew them the next morning. Anderson had a cockade in his hat: he was captain of the gang; I am positive he was one: he had a cockade in his hat, which made me think at first it was a press-gang: he rose, and seized my stick, and knocked me down with it; he had a pot of beer in his hand, when I first came up: he struck, me over the head several times; I have the marks in my head now.</p>
               <p>Do you know either of the others? - Yes, all three.</p>

               <p>Did you observe the faces of these five so as to be able to swear to them? - Yes, I can swear to them any day in the year; the other five got off.</p>
               <p>Should you know them again? - Yes, I should know them all, if I was to see them.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen any of them before? - I had not been on shore long.</p>
               <p>Was not you thrown into confusion when they all got up and attacked you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Consider whether, in the situation you were in, with ten persons round you, and thrown into a flurry, whether you can take upon you to swear to the faces of five people? - Yes, I can. I am positive these five were there: they were taken up the same night. While I was endeavouring to get off, the watchman came and laid siege to them, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300055"/> took these five directly. They only said they were not there: the little boy said he had not taken any thing out of the gentleman's pocket; that was true enough, for he had his hand in the wrong pocket: that was the little shaver, Woodhouse.</p>
               <p>Was your buckle found upon either of them? - No: it was not found.</p>
               <p>Were they searched? - One or two of them was; Thompson was. The constable did not find any thing: they were not all carried to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Had these people any weapons? - No, only their knives; they had every one a drawn knife.</p>
               <p>Was the man that took you to them taken? - No; he was not taken.</p>

               <p>The other five were like the five that stand at the bar? - Yes, much the same.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing you did, when you came up to them? - I took the pot and drank.</p>
               <p>I should think the first thing you did, was to take notice of every one's face. - I did observe their faces.</p>
               <p>At what time was it? - After one in the morning; I had just come out of my mother's house.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect meeting with any body else, after you came out of your mother's house? - No; I never spoke to a woman since I came to London.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect meeting somebody in the street who asked you the depth of your pocket? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect turning your pocket out in the street, and saying you had but sixpence? - No.</p>
               <p>Was it light or dark? - There was a candle alight.</p>
               <p>From that light you can swear to every man's person? - Yes, I do.</p>

               <p>I live in the Green-yard. At a little more than a quarter past one o'clock, I was going along, at the top of Saltpetre Bank in Rosemary Lane. I heard an outcry. I went to see what was the matter. When I came down to the place, I saw a candle burning in the street, and a good many people sitting in a cluster together with some beer. I saw the prosecutor. He cried out, take your hand out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Were any of these people round him? - Yes, nine or ten, or more.</p>
               <p>Had they any weapons? - I did not see any at the time: I put my hand out to the sailor, and called him away. Four or five of them immediately rushed upon me in a body.</p>
               <p>What did you see them do to the man in the jacket? - I did not see them do any thing to him, at that time they came to me; and one of them put his hand into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you see them do any thing to him afterwards? - Yes; they fell upon him, and beat him.</p>
               <p>Which put his hand into your pocket? - Woodham. When I found his hand in my pocket, I catched hold of him, and said, Are you going to rob me? I will have you taken to the watch-house. Upon that, Thompson turned from the sailor, and struck me a blow, and knocked me round and round, and cut my cheek; then the other prisoners pursued with their blows, beating me and him at the same time.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of the rest besides Thompson and Woodham? - Yes; all except Anderson: I do not remember seeing him there. I saw Ruglass there; he

             a knife upon me: he struck at me with the knife: I saw him coming up to me. I ran, and cried Watch! as hard as I could, and maintained my cry till I came to the watch-house door.</p>
               <p>Did you see Marsh? - Yes; Marsh followed Thompson's blow when he struck me.

             I did not see at the time.</p>
               <p>What opportunity had you to observe them so particularly? - Their pressing so near upon me, and there being a candle so near; it was a very large candle. As I was going away, one of them knocked the candle out with his hat.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300056"/>Can you take upon you positively to swear to the four you have mentioned? - I can; I did not see Anderson till I went to alarm the watch: Anderson was sitting at the watch-house door with a quart pot in his hand, talking to a girl. I said there was a sailor would be killed; he said he would go to assist the poor sailor. The const able of the night, two watchmen, this Anderson, and a woman went back with me. When we were going up in search of the people, this woman went to run before. I said to Anderson, What woman is that that was with you? she is going to send the people away, that we should not find them: upon that he ran away after the woman.</p>
               <p>Did he go after her as if he was going to bring her back? - No; as if he was going the same way with her. When I came to the corner of a passage, I found Anderson and the other four prisoners talking together, just above the place where we were attacked. All the rest were run away. I said to the watchman, Here they all are. Anderson returned upon me immediately, and put his two hands upon my breast, and said, Holloa, holloa, have you seen any thing of them? I made answer, Yes, I saw them now talking to you, and I see them running through there now; do not stop me. The watchman said, It is of no use to go seeking them through that passage, there are so many ways; they will be all gone. We all went into the passage after them; but they were all gone. Then the constable of the night said to Anderson, I have a suspicion you were concerned with them, by going to send them away: who are you? He said, what was that to him? he was a man. The constable took him into custody, and said he should give an account of himself on the morrow.</p>
               <p>What became of the sailor? - We met him as we came up from the watch-house, crying, with his pockets out.</p>
               <p>Did he take any notice of Anderson when the constable took him into custody? - Yes, he said he was one.</p>
               <p>Did he say he was one before the constable took him into custody? - No, he had not seen him before. When we had got Anderson almost to the watch-house, these four came rushing out of the passage again. I saw

Marsh was taken at the time I took Thompson, in Wellclose-square: they were surrounded by the watchmen and constable of the night. I could not see them distinctly as they rushed out: I knew them as soon as they were taken. The sailor knew every one.</p>

               <p>I am a peace-officer, of St. John's, Wapping. On the 15th of May, early in the morning, Probyn came down to me, and desired me to come down to Saltpetre Bank, for he said some men were murdering a sailor. I immediately took a staff; and my two watchmen, and Davis and I, went with him. I saw Anderson at the watch-house door, when he came down for me, talking to a woman.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing? - Nothing at all. We went up to Saltpetre Bank, to find the people robbing the sailor. When we got half way up the Bank, we met the sailor coming toward us.</p>
               <p>What became of Anderson? - I did not see what became of him then; he did not go up with us.</p>
               <p>Where did you first see Anderson again? - When we came to the corner of an alley, where we expected to see the prisoners, there we saw Anderson again.</p>
               <p>Was any person with him? - Nobody at all. Mr. Probyn was a-head of us. He said, here is one of them; and Anderson said, they are all gone through here.</p>
               <p>Who made you first suspect Anderson? - I suspected Anderson, because the sailor said he was one of the gang.</p>
               <p>Why did you take Anderson first? - He came into the watch-house after we took the other prisoners.</p>
               <p>You did not suspect him before? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to take him then? - The sailor said he was in the gang, and was one that beat him; and then I took him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300057"/>Did the sailor know any of the other prisoners? - Yes, he knew every one before we took them in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>You did not suspect Anderson, nor attempt to take him up, till after you had taken the other prisoners, and got them to the watch-house? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. I heard the rattle. I came to the watch-house, to see what was the matter. The officer said we must go up to the Bank; there was a sailor robbed. We went up to the Bank, and saw Anderson there by himself. Probyn went up before us. I saw nobody with him. He followed us down: and we met the sailor. How came you to come back before you found any body? - We found Anderson: he said he would go down with us to the watch-house. Mr. Probyn said, the people were run through an alley.</p>
               <p>Did not you meet the sailor as you were going? - No, as we were coming down back to the watch-house, half way down the Bank, we met the sailor: going down to the bottom, we met Thompson and Marsh. When we came up to Thompson, Probyn said, This is the man that struck me. The sailor, when he heard that, went over the way, and said, This is the one that took the money out of my pocket. We took them and Anderson to the watch-house. The other two ran away. Afterwards Probyn saw them, and gave the alarm; and we pursued them. They were taken about half an hour after.</p>

               <p>What day was it? - I do not know the day. The prisoners were taken the next day. He said, Holloa, ship-mate, where do you live? I said at Saltpetre Bank. I said no more. I went down to Saltpetre Bank. Then he said, Holloa, ship-mate, again; and a man said, Holloa, will you come over here to drink? He went down the Bank: there was a parcel of men drinking: he drank twice with them; then came over to me, and gave me 2 d. And then he pulled out 6 d. and pulled his pocket out, and said this was all he had got. He pulled some papers out of his waistcoat pocket. I bid him take care of his papers. He called me a bloody bitch. Upon that I went into my lodging, and saw no more of it.</p>
               <p>Was it the same morning that the people were taken? - I believe it was: I am not sure to the morning.</p>
               <p>Did you know the man that addressed you? - Yes, this is the man (pointing to the prosecutor): he turned out his pocket, and said, Feel if I have any more. I felt. I said, you may have no more that I know of. I went in, and he called me out again, and called me a bloody bitch. I was frightened out of my wits.</p>

I asked him if he knew any house up. As I was at the door, a man came down, and said a sailor on Saltpetre Bank was ill used.

            , my under-gardener, came to town, and, in consequence of what he informed me, the prisoner was taken up; I had him before Mr. Alderman Townshend at Tottenham. He was accused of having sold hay unknown to me, which I conceive is a theft. The alderman summoned those people who had bought it; they appeared before him: before they appeared, the prisoner desired the book might be sent for, in which he said he had kept an account of all the hay that ever had been delivered; this is the book (producing it). The book, in the articles of charge to the different persons, totally differs from the account they give of the hay received. I never gave him liberty to sell hay to any person but Mr. Newton, a stage-coachman, who was to take any quantity I could spare; and a gentleman who lived within two doors of me, who begged I would let him have a few trusses, which I did: I always settled accounts with them myself, and he never had permission to sell hay to any body.</p>
               <p>Where was your hay kept? - It was stacked very near a barn, close to the high road.</p>
               <p>Had he any particular charge of it more than the other servants? - He used to have the keys; but, upon this Field coming into my service, it appeared he had given Field the keys of the barn: it was from the circumstance of the keys being ordered to be taken from the under servant, thinking it most proper, that this was discovered.</p>
               <p>In what manner was the charge committed to him? - He had only the general care of the things that were there; he and the woman who passed for his wife, but I have just now discovered is not: she was my servant.</p>
               <p>Has he not bought straw and hay for you? - When I have given him money and orders for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Has he not sold hay for you? - Never, but, by my express permission, to Mr. Newton and Mr. Medina: he has delivered hay by my express permission.</p>

After I had been there some time, I was ordered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300059"/> by Woodward to carry a truss of hay to one Holmsley. He said it was by my master's orders. It is above three months ago: I carried it. After that, I was ordered by the prisoner to deliver hay to the servant of Mrs. Webb, who came for it. I delivered twelve trusses at different times: and I afterwards carried five more trusses to Holmsley, at different times, by the prisoner's orders.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any money for this hay? - No. After that, the prisoner said the hay began to get short; his master made a noise, and he must sell no more. I bound a load myself, and left it in the barn; and out of that load I missed seven trusses, five of which went in one day. I missed the trusses in three or four days, or a week, after I had bound them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He had the key of the barn in his pocket: I do not know how they could go out, except by himself: he was as likely as any body to take them.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was the key of the barn? - In the door.</p>
               <p>Did it stay there always? - I left it in the door, while I went to give my horses some hay.</p>
               <p>Then when you left the key in the door, any body might have gone in? - That I cannot say. Two trusses went when I had the key in my pocket: about ten weeks ago, there were three trusses more: the servant of Mrs. Holmsley came, and said she must have them. I said, I had no orders for her to have any. I delivered these on Friday morning. On Saturday I told the prisoner, I had delivered two trusses of hay to Mrs. Holmsley: he said, they were to have two trusses more, and that would make their complement: that was about two months ago. I did not know but that it was my master's orders, till I spoke of it to my master, and he told me the contrary.</p>
               <p>(Upon his cross examination, he said that the prisoner and he had had some words; that the prisoner called him a thief, and said he was robbing and defrauding his master; that upon this, he went to his master, and asked him if he had robbed him of any thing; and told him that he had delivered bay to people by Woodward's orders.)</p>

               <p>I keep a couple of cows, at Stoke Newington, in the neighbourhood of Mr. Tulk. I bought some hay of the prisoner. He came by Mr. Tulk's orders, as he told me. The last I bought of him was twenty trusses. I paid him for six, and owed him for fourteen; it was delivered me, all of it, I believe, by Mr. Field; but I can't be certain: I spoke to Woodward for it, knowing him to be a steward to the farm; and Woodward sent his man over with it.</p>
               <p>Who did you understand you was to pay for the other fourteen trusses? - Mr. Woodwood; and that he was to pay his master: it was delivered to me as Mr. Tulk's hay.</p>
               <p>Did he ever desire you to keep this matter secret from his master? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tulk. If your Lordship will please to ask her, if she did not say, before alderman Townshend, she paid him money at different times. - I paid for more than that, but not for this year's hay.</p>

               <p>I keep a public-house in Stoke Newington. I bought a little poney about Michaelmas last. I asked Mr. Woodward to let me have some hay: he said he had hay of his master's to sell; I could take no more at a time than two or three trusses. I don't know how much I had of him; he said he kept an account. I believe it was field delivered it; I bargained with Woodward for it. About the beginning of March, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300060"/> told me Mr. Tulk had forbid him from selling any more; and I had no more of him.</p>
               <p>Was it known in the neighbourhood that he managed for Mr. Tulk? - It was understood so.</p>
               <p>Was it delivered publicly and openly in the town where Mr. Tulk lived, and by Mr. Tulk's own servant? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was at my house: I was going to buy some hay that came along the road: he asked me if I was going to buy some hay; I said, yes: he said, I believe my master has some to sell; in the course of two or three days, I will let you know. In two or three days after, he told me his master gave him leave to sell one load, which contained thirty-six trusses; he sent it in; that was, I think, December the 4th. I told him, when it was sent in, if he would enquire what the market price was, I would pay him that; but I have not paid him for it yet.</p>
               <p>Whose hay did you buy it as? - Mr. Tulk's: I considered myself as debtor to Mr. Tulk for it; if Mr. Tulk had asked me for the money, I should have paid him.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner desire you not to pay any body but him for it? - A little after Christmas, he delivered a bill to me in Mr. Tulk's name. I asked if I should pay him: he said, No; but, if Mr. Tulk called, I should pay him.</p>
               <p>Did he ever press you for the payment before? - No; from that time I left word with my wife at home, that if Mr. Tulk came, she should pay the money, or if Woodward came, to pay him, and take a receipt from him for the use of his master; and he never asked me for the money from that time to this. Mr. Tulk has that bill now, which he delivered me four months ago.</p>
               <p>Did you offer to pay Woodward? - Yes; but he said, when his master came, I should pay him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tulk. Will your Lordship please to ask him, whether there was not a dispute about the weight, which was the cause of its not being paid for then? - I took hold of a truss, and said it was rather light. A man with me took hold of another, and weighed them: five or six were under weight; some were over. Then I sent for the man that bound it up: he came down, and there with a pair of steel-yards weighed it; some was under, some over: we put one on one side, and the other on the other; so every body might see it.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Tulk. How often did you settle with the prisoner? - Generally weekly; if not, it was his own fault.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when you settled the last account with him? - It was up, I believe, to a week or a fortnight before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Was any credit given, in any of these accounts, for hay sold? - I am sure there was not, nor any money accounted for, though he received money several times of Mrs. Holmesly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>(He called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

               <p>I advertised a sale of thread lace, for the 10th and 11th of May, at Mr. Squibb's auction-room: on the 9th, two of my servants left the premises; the next morning, the 10th, when I went to the place between ten and eleven, the lace was all, except one little bit, gone. It was taken to Mr. Squibb's auction-room on the Monday, and there remained till it was stolen.</p>
               <p>I had seen it on the 9th. Intelligence was brought to my house in Bow Church-yard, that the auction room had been broke open, and the lace stolen; and I found that information to be true. I applied at the office in Bow-street for their assistance, to recover the goods, and apprehend the thieves. I received information from one of the persons at that office, that there were not above four of the persons, who are receivers of stolen goods, that were capable of making so large a purchase.

I was told that Saturday, being the Jews sabbath, he would not perhaps buy stolen goods; but on Sunday, it being a likely day, I placed myself and some friends in some houses in Bishopsgate-street, to watch if Levy should go by. On Sunday, exactly at half after eleven o'clock, I saw him go by: I gave a signal to my friends in the neighbourhood to watch where he went to; he was followed by myself and my friends to Newgate-street. About the middle of Newgate-street, he was met by the prisoners at the bar, and, I think, two others: (the name of one of the others was Hart:) he patted them on the back; then they turned round and went back, and he with them; they turned round Pye Corner, there I lost sight of them. I speak positively to the two prisoners meeting Levy. A servant came running to meet me from towards Cow-Cross: he said, they are housed; that was about eight minutes after I had lost sight of them; he told me to go on, and I should see Burdington. I went to Burdington, who stood in view of the house where they were housed: he said they are in that house, No. 10. There was a woman standing centry at the door. I sent another person, that was with me, to the place appointed, to Sir

In about five minutes, they called to me that my goods were all safe, and the thieves were taken. I went in. I found the lace, to my very great satisfaction, all within about 100 l. worth. I found about 200 l. worth in a two-pair-of-stairs back room: the two prisoners were there, and Levy and M'Neil's wife were in the room when I came in: the lace was upon the table when I saw it; one of my servants was putting it in the bag; it was part of what I had lost; there were marks upon it; and I have some of it here now; I have not a shadow of doubt that it is mine. I asked M'Neil whether that was all the lace that was there. I addressed myself to Ridgeley to the same effect. They both said at first, they did not know, they believed it was. So I pressed it upon them repeatedly, to let me know if there was any more that I could get, and I would not indict them capitally if I got all my lace.</p>

               <p>I was requested by Mr. Elderton to assist on the Sunday in detecting these people, and was near to him in Bishopsgate-street when Levy passed, and followed him from thence to Newgate-street, where he was joined by the two prisoners. I saw M'Neil and Ridgeley in Newgate-street, walking towards Cheapside. Levy met them; he turned back with them: they all three walked together down Newgate-street; they turned at Pye Corner: when they came near to Smithfield, M'Neil ran before; Ridgeley and Levy continued walking together after him. I lost sight of M'Neil at the further side of Smithfield, but never did of Levy and Ridgeley, at least not for two minutes together. I saw Ridgeley and Levy enter an house in Cow Cross, No. 10; there was the name Lawley on the door. I turned back as soon as I could, without causing suspicion: I sent that information to Mr. Elderton, or to Mr. Parker, and staid myself within a little distance of the house: in a short time, the people from the public office, who were but at a little distance, came, and went into the house. A woman was at the door when the officers went in.</p>

               <p>Who was that woman? - The woman that was up in the room afterwards, and passed for M'Neil's wife. I did not go in for some time, probably ten minutes: I stood without: when I did go in, the prisoners at the bar, with M'Neil's wife, were in the two-pair-of-stairs back room. The goods then had been put into the bag.</p>
               <p>Did you understand whose lodging it was? - I understood it to be M'Neil's.</p>
               <p>Did Ridgeley say any thing in your hearing? - I do not recollect what words passed.</p>

             sworn,</p>
               <p>I was one of the officers who went to take these people. When we first went into the house, we saw a woman just at the door. Jealous knew her, and she was ordered into custody, and brought up stairs. I searched her. I went up stairs; the two-pair-of-stairs door was fast; Jealous broke it open. I found M'Neil, Ridgeley, and one Lee, alias Levy, in the room; and upon the table close by the bed, there was a great quantity of lace. Breaking open the door, and we rushing in, threw it all down. After securing them, we sent for Mr. Elderton.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you find the three men when you first broke open the door? - To the best of my recollection, they all stood round the table together; M'Neil nearest the bed, Ridgeley by the window, and Levy beside him. I cannot be sure. We secured them. The first question I asked M'Neil was, how long he had lived there? I think he gave me no answer to that; but he was without his coat, standing in his waistcoat, with his hat on. Ridgeley was in a black coat, to the best of my remembrance, the coat he has on now, with his hat on, and a small stick in his hand. I did not ask any more questions of M'Neil. I asked Ridgeley his name. To the best of my remembrance, he said it was Knight, or White; and said he came out of Hertfordshire. I asked him how he came there? he said he knew M'Neil; that, as he passed, M'Neil stood at the door, and asked him to come up; that was the way he came there. I asked

             the same question; and he told the same story. I then proceeded to search the room; but first I searched M'Neil's wife, and found some lace in her pocket; that Mr. Elderton owned. She refused to let me search her; I was obliged to be a little rude, which I do not like to be, and to force it from her. Then I asked M'Neil how his wife came by it; he said he gave it her: for that reason I left her behind me, and would not take her into custody.</p>
               <p>What more did M'Neil or Ridgeley say, while you was present? - I can't particularly recollect; I am very loth to say much to prisoners when they are in custody. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300063"/> proceeded to search the room. M'Neil said, I need not give myself much trouble; I should only find some quere dubs, meaning picklock-keys. I found these (producing a large quantity of picklock-keys); here is a key (producing it) which will open the door of the room where the lace was.</p>

               <p>Did you know from the prisoners themselves whose lodging it was? - The landlady was sent for up, and pointed out who took it: upon which M'Neil said, it was his lodging. Ridgeley said, he had only just come up into the room. After the keys were found, I went to Mr. Squibb's auction room; the door was double-locked, and this key opened it.</p>

On the 4th of April, in the evening, I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) out of the shew-glass in my shop. I had seen them at six o'clock that evening. When I went to take in the watches at nine o'clock, as I commonly do, they were missing. The coffee-pot was taken out of the parlour.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I had an information against the prisoner. I went and took her up. I searched her lodging. In a caravan box I found these two watches and a coffee-pot. She lodged in Devonshire-street, at one Mrs. Romer's. They have been in my possession ever since. I have two other watches, that were delivered to me at the Rotation-office; one of them she said she had lent to her husband.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Fitzgerald, a pawnbroker, in Holborn. I have a silver watch I had of the prisoner. She came and asked me if we bought such things. She said she wanted a plain gold ring. I bought it, and gave her a plain gold ring and 12 s. for it.</p>
               <p>What is the gold ring worth? - Six shillings.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. What is the watch worth? - A guinea and a half at the least.</p>
               <p>Bowles. It appeared, according to my judgement, to be a very old movement.</p>
               <p>(It was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Counsel to the Prosecutor. How did you find out all these things? - By Mrs. Hamilton's directions.</p>
               <p>Had you promised her any thing? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Had not you told her, if she shewed you where the property was, you would not hurt her? - No, never in my life. The magistrate said, as some things were found upon her, she might as well confess where the property was: it might be more favourable for her. Nothing was said by me. It was my wish to be as favourable as possible.</p>
               <p>You desired to be favourable, but have been as severe as you could: you have indicted her capitally. - I desired to indict her otherwise, but was told I could not. She told us of the things at the same time.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found prior to her confession? - Nothing but what was found in her lodging.</p>
               <p>To Dixwell. The watches you found, you found by her direction? - No.</p>
               <p>Had not you said something to her? - No, nothing at all: it was late at night.</p>
               <p>Did not you go to a public-house with her? - No, not that night: we went into a public-house in the morning. I told her she had better confess, and let the man have his property again.</p>
               <p>Had you found any thing before that? - Yes, the two watches and coffee-pot.</p>

She had her arm extended out at the door, and I suppose she then gave the watch to the person who had tapped. She was taken to the watch-house, and searched; but nothing was found upon her.</p>

             delivered up the watch, and said Douglas asked her to dine with her; and as her husband was a soldier, and not to be at home that evening, she permitted her to lie with her. Next morning she observed the watch upon the chimney-piece: she asked Douglas where she had it? and she said she had it from Jackson.</p>

               <p>To the Prosecutor. How long have you been in possession of this watch? - I think, ever since January was twelvemonth. It was a present sent me by my father from NewYork. He is an officer in his Majesty's service. The person who brought it said it was a gold watch, and I never doubted it.</p>

               <p>I keep a public-house. On Monday the first of May, the prisoner brought this paint, contained in this handkerchief, to my house: he left it, and said he should call for it at four o'clock in the afternoon, or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300066"/> by nine the next morning. I looked at it, and found it was what I did not chuse to have in my house, it being a prohibited colour. Knowing it to be of a dangerous consequence in my house, I conveyed it to a neighbour's, where I had it under lock and key. The next day a neighbour came and told me the prisoner was taken up for defrauding Mr. Hodgson. I went to Mr. Hodgson: his clerk was at home: he came down, and proved the property to be his master's.</p>
               <p>(The colour was produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Court. What is it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson. It is China cinnabar, a colour for the use of limners. The marks upon the several papers, I put upon them at the time I bought them, to know the qualities.</p>
               <p>Had your clerk, the prisoner, any of this colour of his own? - No: there were but few of us that bought any at the sale: it was bought out of a French Indiaman, a prize.</p>
               <p>Nor he had no business to take any out of your house? - No, for no purpose whatever.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. Whether he can prove, by any possibility, that I had ever stolen any cinnabar from his house; and was it missed during the time of my residence in Mr. Hodgson's family? - It was not missed till Mr. Palmer came and told me; and when I saw it, I went and took the stock of this account, and found twenty-one packages gone, six of which are here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can Mr. Palmer prove I delivered these goods into his house? - Upon my oath, he delivered these five papers to my wife, and I was close to her when he delivered them to her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There should be ten in each of these packages: there is now in one but nine; therefore one is gone out, I suspect, as a sample.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This cinnabar has not been found upon me; I have neither stole it, nor did I absolutely take it from Mr. Hodgson's house, as it is alledged against me; neither did I know the nature, or quality, or quantity, of that material in his house; nor did I see it open in his house: it was given to me to dispose of by two persons, who said they belonged to Capt. Cotton, of the Hawk Indiaman; they must have it there, or else it must have been smuggled, because it pays a heavy duty here. I taught the science s and mathematics, at Aspley in Bedfordshire, and surveying, navigation, architecture, drawing, and geography, with other branches of the sciences. I have, for most part of my life, been in the country: I have not been a year in London since my infant age: I lived in the country till last Christmas.</p>

               <p>Did he at any time tender a note to you? - Some time in November last he came to my shop, and said he wanted about 50 l. worth of books for his library; and if I would let him have them, he would deposit in my hands, as a security, a note for 150 l. which had about six months to run. He said the gentleman lodged, and (I think he said) boarded with him.</p>

On the 16th of May, I think it was, I called upon Mr. Farril with it. Mr. Farril was not stirring. I left notice that I would call again next morning with it; which I did, and then saw Mr. Farril: he refused to pay it. I immediately went to Fiske with it, and told him that Mr. Farril had refused to pay it, and said that it was not his note. Fiske replied, that it was his note, that he had it of him, and he should be made to know it. I told him he must go in and settle that point with Mr. Farril, and wanted him to go with me; but he declined going then, saying, he would go soon. A day or two after, Fiske called on me with his attorney, and desired to know if Mr. Farril had charged him with a forgery. I told them what Mr. Farril had said; that the word forgery was not used, but expressions equivalent to it. Last Tuesday morning I again called on Mr. Farril.</p>
               <p>How many days was that from the last time you was there? - The 16th I went first, the 17th I saw Mr. Farril, and this was the 29th; when I called again, then Mr. Farril said it was a forged bill. Fiske was sent for, and came directly: he persisted in it, that it was a genuine bill, and that he had it of Mr. Farril; and said, that nobody was present but Mrs. Herbert when Mr. Farril gave him the note; but that Mr. Gray and

             was immediately called up; she said, that Mr. Fiske told her, that he had a note of Mr. Farril's, which he believed Mr. Farril did not think of; I think that was the expression. Mr. Gray was sent for, but could not be found; I did not see him, either there, or at the justice's. The prisoner expressed a great deal of readiness to go before a magistrate, and we all went to the office in Litchfield-street; Mr. Mercer and Mr. Crofts were sitting. Mrs. Herbert was sent for, and examined; she denied having any knowledge of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>I believe you have known the prisoner some time? - Yes, being of the same trade, I knew him of course.</p>
               <p>You had no difficulty in taking a note of his indorsement? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know of Mr. Farril's living at the house of Fiske? - I took care to inform myself that there was such a gentleman lodged at his house.</p>

               <p>You say, when you first went to Mr. Farril, his servant told you he was in bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You afterwards went to the prisoner, and told him that Mr. Farril said it was a forged note? - Tantamount to it; that he denied its being his note.</p>
               <p>Did not Fiske, upon that representation, insist upon its being a good note; and that he would bring an action against Farril for saying it was otherwise? - Not at that time; that was afterwards, when he called upon me with his attorney.</p>
               <p>He told you he would go to his attorney about it? - No; he said, that it was a genuine note, and he should be made to know it.</p>
               <p>Afterwards he came with Mr. Lee, his attorney? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you not desired to push Mr. Farril to make a positive assertion, that it was a forgery, for the purpose of enabling Mr. Lee to bring an action? - I was. They said they came to know if Mr. Farril had charged him with forgery, as it was intended to bring an action. I then told them what Mr. Farril said to me; that he had not used the term forgery, but had used equivalent expressions: that he never gave such a note, that it was not his, that he never owed Fiske any such money, I think, were the expressions.</p>
               <p>You could not be positive in your information to Mr. Lee, that Farril had charged Fiske with an absolute forgery? - I said it was a charge of forgery by implication; but that the word forgery had not been made use of by him.</p>
               <p>But the inquiry was directed to know whether he had said so or not? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>I think you have said, that Fiske never made any kind of difficulty about going to a magistrate, nor expressed any kind of apprehension<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300068"/> of danger? - He expressed a great deal of unconcern about it.</p>
               <p>Do you know how long Fiske remained at home at his own house, after it was communicated to him by you, that he had been charged with this being a forged note? - From the 17th to last Tuesday the 29th.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at home, and in his business, as usual, on those days? - I never was there between those days. On the 29th I found him in his shop as usual.</p>
               <p>He said nobody was by when the note was given, but Mrs. Herbert and Farril? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know who Mrs. Herbert is? - I never saw her before that morning.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Herbert came, Farril and Fiske were both present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she express any degree of amazement, that Fiske should demand 150 l.? or pretend that Farril could not owe such a sum? did she say any thing about it? - She said she did not apprehend it to be Mr. Farril's note. I cannot recollect her particular expressions.</p>

               <p>Do you know his hand-writing? - I think I do. I have seen him write, and have received many letters from him. I have seen the note before; and entirely agree with Mr. Chambers, if the note had come to me, without my having had any notion of it before, I should have taken it for his hand-writing: but, after examination, it is wrote, taking it all together, better than his hand-writing is in general; it is more uniformly well throughout.</p>

               <p>Then, if this note had been produced to you, you say, at first sight, you should have had no doubt about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Are there not some parts so like, that no man alive could distinguish them? - Yes; like Mr. Farril's best hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mrs. Herbert? - Yes; I do.</p>
               <p>Is she a married woman? - I apprehend she is.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you may know if Mr. Fiske, the prisoner, has accepted accommodation-notes for Mr. Farrill? - Yes; he has so, indisputably.</p>
               <p>As to what has fallen within your knowledge, how much money has he been accommodated with by Fiske, by those notes? - I believe, with very little more than 50 l. within my knowledge; I do not know how much out of my knowledge. When Mr. Farrill fell out with his friends, he was left in distress, without any money for support; he had been out of town; he could not very well come to town without money: he mentioned it to me and several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300069"/> friends: he applied to Fiske; and there was a note drawn for 150 l. accepted by Mr. Fiske, to accommodate Mr. Farril. None of the parties knowing any thing of the nature of drawing notes, it was so imperfectly drawn, that it was not fit to negotiate: in consequence of which, it was sent back; and another, I believe, drawn, that was not negotiated, because the credit of the parties was not sufficient.</p>
               <p>Is not Mr. Farril, at this moment, indebted to Mr. Fiske for board and lodging? have you not heard him say that? - No; I believe he discharged the debt when he left the house.</p>
               <p>Court. There were accommodation-notes passed between Fiske and Farril? - There was 150 l. accepted by Fiske to accommodate Mr. Farril, which was not successfully negotiated; and in return, three notes, of 50 l. each, given in lieu of it, in order to be negotiated; one of which I know to be out.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know about what time it was when Fiske accepted these notes? - In October.</p>
               <p>Do you know, as Fiske accepted notes to 150 l. in accommodation of Farril, whether Fiske did not take Farril's note? - I do not know. I asked Mr. Farril if he had done it: he said Fiske made no difficulty about it.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he was in town the 12th of October? - I know he was.</p>
               <p>Court. This note bears date at the very time of the transaction: it is not probable, but that, when Fiske accepted notes to accommodate Farril, he took Farril's note in return; which note this certainly is. Whether Fiske has done right in negotiating the note, is a very different question, and is the only consideration that will prevent my doing, what I should otherwise do, grant a copy of the indictment.</p>
               <p>If Fiske really is aggrieved, he will take such measures as he is advised.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. I shall not ask for a copy of the indictment.</p>

On Sunday the 13th of May, at about half after ten o'clock at night, an acquaintance of mine came to the gate with a horse he was going to put into a field: he said, as it was dark, if I would go with him a little way, he would treat me with a pot of beer. When I had got with him about an hundred or an hundred and fifty yards from the gate, I was collared; but who the person was, I did not know, it was so dark. I asked, if they were going to rob a poor turnpike-man? Just at that instant, there came a flash of lightening; and I saw one of the company particularly. They let me go when it lightened. I went back to the turnpike-house; I unlocked the door, and left the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300070"/> key outside.

That brother came into the turnpike-house just after we had tied the prisoner's hands, and asked what was the matter? and I charged him with being one of the men that had stopped me. When the brother came back, he said he had never seen the prisoners: but he told a different story before the justice.</p>

               <p>I am a collar-maker. On Sunday, the 13th of May, I was going to a field with a horse. It was very dark. The turnpike-man was going a little way with me. Somebody came up and collared him, and bid him stop. He said he hoped they would not rob a poor turnpike-man. They made no answer, but went off towards the turnpike. There was flash of lightning just then; but I was going off, and did not see them. I took the horse to the field. In coming back, soon after, I heard the cry of, Murder! I found Massey at the door of the turnpike-house. He said he had locked two men in, that had knocked him down. I went in with him, and we laid hold of the prisoners. A brother of the prisoners came in about ten minutes after the door was opened, and wanted to know what was the matter. Massey said he knew that was one that had stopped him on the road; and we secured him. He pretended he did not know the prisoners. They were stroaked down by a person, but no arms were found upon them.</p>

The prosecutor was outside the house: he said, For God's sake, come: I am almost murdered; I am almost choaked. He was almost out of breath. I ran over to the gate. When I got there, they had opened the door, and seized the prisoners. He said they had knocked him down in the toll-house, and demanded his money. Their brother came in afterwards. Massey said, This is one of the men that attacked me in the road; I believe he said, that knocked him down in the road: and he was secured.</p>

Just at Gray's-inn-lane end, we heard a cry of Murder! repeatedly. Mr. Swinnerton and I got out of the cart, and went to the toll-house. There we saw the prisoners. The turnpike-man charged them with knocking him down, and attempting to rob him. While we had hold of them, another came in, and asked what was the matter? The turnpike-man said, You are one of them; I can swear to you. I shut the door directly, and said, We will keep all in that we have got in. As we were taking them to prison, they were very abusive.</p>

               <p>I am brother to the two prisoners. On Sunday, the 13th of May, we took a walk to Kentish Town. We had two bottles of ale. Then we came to Mr. Armitage's; then we went to the Nag's-Head; there we drank till about half after ten; then we were going home, by Battle-bridge Road. In going past the toll-house, (I was before my brothers twenty or thirty yards) there was a cry of, Murder! they both returned back to the toll-house, and I turned back after them; and they directly took me in charge. Massey said he had seen me with some people that had stopped him before. I asked them what was the reason of my brothers being tied? All the answer they gave me was, I should know time enough to-morrow. I did not know what my brothers were charged with till next morning.</p>
               <p>Were your brothers and you in com pany together? - Yes; I happened to walk a little before them.</p>
               <p>Had you parted company? - No.</p>
               <p>You had got before them twenty or thirty yards? - It might be more. Not hearing my brothers, I turned back, and then I heard the cry of, Murder! upon which I went to the turnpike.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you heard the cry of Murder? - It might be five or seven minutes. I walked down the road towards Gray's-Inn Lane, hearing the cry of Murder! I then missed my brothers, and turned back again, thinking that something had happened.</p>
               <p>What do you think they stopped for? - They went back, after having been through the toll-gate, upon the cry of Murder: they went back to assist the person that was crying Murder. The gate-keeper was crying Murder by himself, as I understood.</p>
               <p>Do you know how they came into the toll-house? - They were pushed in by the keeper of the gate, as I understood from them; I did not see it; it was too far off.</p>
