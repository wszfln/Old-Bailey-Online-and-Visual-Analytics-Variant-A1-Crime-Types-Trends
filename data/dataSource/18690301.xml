                  </hi>. I live at 7, James Street, Somers Town—on Saturday night, 23rd January, I was standing on the footpath near the bridge in the City Road—I saw the prisoner there, running about the road—I suppose he had a knife in his hand, for he cut my throat and ran away—he did not say anything—I had not had any dispute or quarrel with him—I had never seen him before—I had no companions with me, I was by myself—I was standing quite still—the prisoner ran up and cut me; I expect it was done on purpose—I had seen him running about the road about two minutes before—I did not see him quarrelling with anyone—he had his coat and hat off—he was not drunk, that I know of—I was taken to the police-station, and the doctor attended to me—I saw the prisoner at the station; he appeared sober then.</p>

I am divisional surgeon of police—on the Sunday morning, soon after 12 o'clock, I was called to the station and examined Seymour—he had a wound on the right side of the neck, just about the level of Adam's apple—it was a punctured and incised wound, evidently the result of a stab—it extended from behind forward for about half an inch—he appeared to have lost a good deal of blood, he was very faint indeed—it was not a deep wound, it looked as if done with a blunt knife—Seymour was perfectly sober.</p>

I am in partnership with Mr. Grimsay, as wholesale trimming manufacturers, at Bethnal Green—Genower came into our employment in January, 1868—I did not know him before that—we have been aware since last June that we were losing property—we missed some bobbins upon which silk is wound—they are stamped with our initials by a metal stamp—these are our bobbins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—some of them have had the mark effaced, but we put them in water, and the wood swelled up, and now you can see the initials risen up—we do not sell them with silk on them,</p>

               <p>we send them out to people who work for us off our premises; they are weighed out to them—Mrs. Penn worked for us once, and now does so again, but I believe she did not work for us between Midsummer and Genower being taken in custody—we also missed other property—this China silk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was sent to us to be dyed—this brown silk is the same description as some we lost—this black purse twist is ours, we have had it three years—this fringe was made in our engine-room—these boards are the same class of goods as we lost—four knots of China silk which had been sent to be dyed were found in a drawer, and I had a conversation with Genower with reference to them—he made a statement to me—I applied to the police, got a warrant, and went with an officer to Walker's house, 250, Bethnal Green Road; there are eight rooms, I think—there is no shop, but "Walker, trimming manufacturer," is put up—on entering we saw Walker, and the officer said that we had a warrant to search his premises to see if there was any property of Kerr &amp; Grimsay's there—he seemed to know my name, and to know me—he said, "There is none belonging to them here, you are welcome to look round my place"—I said, "It's no use you saying that, because you bought some brown silk on Friday last from Genower"—he said, "Oh, I know now who you mean," and produced this box with this green silk, and the twist, and these beads, and said, "These are the things I bought of Genower"—I had only spoken to him in reference to the brown silk—we searched the place, and in a bin for keeping bobbins, in the same room, we found 417 bobbins—I examined them, and said, "Our marks have been erased"—Walker said nothing to that—he was then taken in custody—I saw a lad named Watts on Monday last, but did not recognize him as having seen him at our warehouse—we do not sell bobbins at all.</p>

I live with my father, a furrier, at 1, Carlton Place, Bethnal Green—I have known Walker eighteen or twenty months—I first knew him by going to work for him, and about nine months ago he told me to go to the warehouse of Kerr and Grimsay, 7, Wilmot Square—he went part of the way with me, and showed me where it was—he gave me a paper, and told me I was to see a young man named Genower, and say that I came in the name of Mrs. Fenn—he did not tell me what I was to get—I took the paper, so that I should not forget the name—I went into the ware-house, I did not ask for Genower, but he saw me and took the paper which I had in my hand, and said, "Oh, you have come from Mrs. Fenn?"—I said "Yes," and he gave me a parcel covered with paper, which was made up before I got there—I put it into a bag which Walker had given me—there were other people in the warehouse—I have been there eighteen or twenty times during the nine mouths, by Walker's directions, and always saw Genower—I went for work for Mrs. Fenn, but do not know what I got, as it was placed in a bag—it was always given by Genower—I sometimes saw that he put bobbins into the parcel—I have not been since Christmas—I have seen Genower at Mr. Walker's more than once, but do not know what he came about—I took all the things to Walker—I never saw Mrs. Fenn till yesterday—I never took any money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the deceased—on this Wednesday night, just before 9, my mother was out, and I went out to meet her—I met her coming across the road, and walked across with her—when we got about the middle of the road I saw Mr. and Mrs. Blanch going along on the pathway, about three or four yards from us—I did not know them then—I had never seen them before—I said to my mother, "Mother, how high that person holds her clothes"—I did not intend them to hear it—that was all I said—my mother replied, "That gentleman at the side is the one that beat your little brother"—he is thirteen—I said, "He would not have done it if I had been there"—that was all that passed between me and my mother—we came up to the gate, and as mother turned round to open the gate Mr. and Mrs. Blanch were there, and began using very bad language—Mrs. Blanch then came and pushed open the gate, and struck mother two or three times on the side of the head, I think it was on the left side, with her fist—they were hard blows—my mother fell up against the wall which divided the two houses—Mrs. Blanch then struck me on the face; she gave me a good knock—I don't know why she did it, I suppose it was because I took my mother's part—I stood before her—my mother then came outside the gate and asked her what she did it for—the prisoner then Dame up—Mrs. Blanch sent for her—someone went for her—I heard Mrs. Blanch call somebody, and she immediately came, and Mrs. Blanch said "Give it to them Amelia," using a very bad word—she said, "Give it to the b—Amelia"—she and Mrs. Blanch then caught hold of mother and beat her, and threw her against the iron railings—they beat her on her head and shoulders and face—they beat her violently—I got my mother up, she was on the ground, she had fallen from the blows; I got her up—father came out then, and the prisoner struck him with something that she had in her hand—I can't say what it was—it was something black—she struck him in the right eye—my mother was standing just by—I was standing with her, close to father—I told father that Mrs. Blanch had hit mother, and he went to her and Mr. Blanch—the prisoner came up to mother and said, "I will do for you;" and she caught hold of mother and struck her violently again, and threw her down on the pathway, and she rolled over on to the kerb—that was</p>

"You wicked creature, you have given me my death blow"—and she said, "Yes, you b—r, and here is another one for you:" and she struck her again with her fist in the face as she laid on Mrs. Clark's shoulder—she appeared very angry while she was doing all this—I and father then took mother indoors, and gave her some brandy—she said she felt very bad, and said, "I don't believe I shall ever go outside again, my head is so bad"—we put her to bed—about 2 o'clock I was called by my little brother, and went to my mother—she was then insensible—I gave her some water, but her teeth were closed, and she bled at the mouth, and her eyes were shut—she never spoke after she went to bed, and never opened her eyes—she died at 7.45 in the morning.</p>

I did not know who she was then—mother said it was Mr. Blanch, that hit Georgey, and I said, "He should not have hit him if I had been there," because I would have taken his part—that was said just as we passed—it was all done in a few minutes—Mr. and Mrs. Blanch turned back, and came after us—we saw them when we went to shut our gate; we were both inside the gate—Mrs. Blanch did not say, "I want to know how it is you are so constantly insulting me in this way"—my mother did not say to father, "Here is the b—pensioner that struck our boy, and who you have been waiting to see for some time;" she did not speak, she was too bad, besides, she would not use such language—it did not take place, as I know of, and I was there all the time—father did not rush out of the gate and commence sparring at Mr. Blanch; he came out quietly to see what was the matter—he did not strike a blow at Mr. Blanch which hit Mrs. Blanch—after Prosser came out, my father and mother and I did not rush at her, and drag her to the ground, and punch her—I did not touch her, nor did mother strike her at all, nor did father strike her so that she went into the road—I never saw her go into the road—she did not fall into the road, she was on the pathway—I never saw her on the ground at all—I did not see anybody strike her; she did not give anyone a chance of striking her—before Prosser came out Mrs. Blanch had struck mother several blows on the head, hard blows, with her fist, on her head, face, and shoulders; and she also struck me—she gave mother two or three blows first, and then she struck her again—that was before Prosser came out—I stated so before the Magistrate (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, did not contain that statement.</hi>)—I was so excited, mother having died that same morning, and I was never in such a place before, and I did not state it all at Worship Street.</p>

I will do for you!" and both she and Mrs. Blanch rushed at Mrs. Glover, and dashed her against the iron railings—she fell with her head against them—Mrs. Blanch said to Mrs. Prosser, "Give it to the b—r, Amelia"—before the woman could scarcely get up on her feet they dashed her to the ground again, both of them—I am quite sure they both struck her—Mrs. Blanch was the first one to strike her—they struck her all about the breast, face and all—Mrs. Glover said, "You cruel creature, you have given me my death blow"—I did not stop any longer after that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I was called to the deceased between 2 and 3 o'clock on Thursday morning, 4th February—she was lying on her back, totally insensible—her skin was cold and clammy—her pulse slow and laboured—the pupils of the eyes were fully dilated and could bear pressure with my finger, showing all the marked symptoms of compression of the brain—she died a few hours after—I made a <hi rend="italic">post morten</hi> examination, externally, and found two large bruises over both thighs, one on the left breast, and a puffy tumour over the right ear—on removing the scalp, I found that inside the puffy tumour there was a large clot of blood, which terminated on the peritoneum—on removing the skull-cap, I found from six to eight ounces of clotted blood on the surface of the brain—the right ventricle was empty, the other contained a clot of blood weigh<lb/>ing from two to three ounces—the other organs of the chest were healthy—the left lung showed recent signs of congestion—the left kidney was ex<lb/>tensively</p>

               <p>diseased—my opinion is, that the cause of death was extravasation of blood on the surface of the brain, and in the substance of the brain—I should say caused by a blow or fall—there was nothing in the chest or kidney to cause death—she had been under medical treatment at the London Hospital, and had been evidently treated for spitting of blood occasionally—there was marked disease of the kidney, but nothing to cause immediate death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might the extravasation be caused by a single blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say, positively—in all probability a single blow would cause a rapture of the vessel—any violence to the skull to produce extravasation must produce a rupture of the vessel—if the vessel ruptured is small, death would be much slower than if it was a large one.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 83, Devonshire Street, and am clerk to a colonial broker, in whose employ I have been twelve years—on Wednesday evening, 3rd February, I went out with my wife—when we had proceeded a little distance from our house we met the deceased and her daughter—as they passed, one of them said, "There she goes, the stinking b—h, I suppose she is going to a penny gaff"—my wife turned round to me and said, "Those are the Glovers, that is the way that I have been insulted for some time past, and I think it only right that you should ask what they mean by it"—I turned back with my wife, towards their house—when we got to the gate the mother was inside the gate, and the daughter was out<lb/>tide—the mother appeared very excited, and pulled the daughter inside the gate and slammed it—my wife said, "What do you mean by insulting me in this way continually"—the deceased called out to someone inside the house, and Mr. Glover came out and commenced fighting, or endeavouring to fight me—he aimed a blow at me, but it struck my wife—as he struck her, Amelia Prosser, my servant, returned the blow to him; she came from the house—the father, mother, and daughter immediately fell on the ser<lb/>vant; the deceased caught hold of her by the hair, and she was dragged forcibly by the three into the road; she was on the ground, the husband was kneeling on her chest, and the mother and daughter were standing over her, pommelling into her—the only remark my wife made was, "Amelia, Amelia, for God's sake come away, this will be the death of me"—she did not say, "Give it the b—," or, "Give it to her <hi rend="italic">Mill</hi>, give it to her"—she never used any such words, she did not in any way incite the prisoner to strike the deceased, she never raised her hand throughout the whole affair—while they were upon the prisoner my wife caught hold of the first person she could, and it was the daughter, by the net-work which she wore round her pelorine, I believe it is called, and in endeavouring to pull her off I believe she tore it—as soon as we had removed the daughter we caught hold of Prosser and dragged her forcibly into the nearest house that was open, which was a beer-shop; the skirt of her dress was torn and covered with mud—I have it in Court, in precisely the same state; her hair was hanging all over her face—there were two scratches on the side of her face, and she complained of being very much kicked—I and my wife's brother went out to endeavour to find a policeman, but were not able to do so—we were out five or six minutes, perhaps ten, and returned—I saw the whole of what took place from the commencement to the end—my wife did not strike a single blow, or use the expressions imputed to her—the prisoner had</p>

I live at 5, Abbey Street, Bethnal Green—on the morning of 8th February, about 2.30, I was coming round the corner of Abbey Street into Cheshire Street—I saw the two prisoners at the window of Mr. Temple's shop—Baker was taking the shoes out, and handing them to Wilkinson—they ran away, and I ran after them—Wilkinson ran down a court, and Baker ran down the road—I followed Baker first, because Wilkinson could not get down the court, as there was no thoroughfare—I nearly got hold of Baker, when he turned round and threw the shoes at me when I was close to him—I could not catch him then, and I went back to the court and stood in the road—I called "Police?"—Wilkinson came down the court, came towards me, and said, "What is all this about?"—I said, "I think someone has been breaking in over there, and one has gone down there"—he walked across the road, and I followed him—he stooped down and said, "Holloa, he has got him"—I caught hold of him and said, "I have got you, there were two of you, and you were one of them"—a policeman came up with Baker—I went down the court with the officer and found some shoes at the bottom, seme in a dust-bin, and some outside—they were taken across to Mr. Temple's shop.</p>

               <p>sleep in the room on the second floor, which used to be occupied by her—I never occupied it for a night—I did not see Mary Fox next morning in that room in her nightgown—I was not in bed that room when Cottee more than once came to the door and knocked—I was not in the second floor room at all, neither back nor front—I can't remember where I first saw Mary Fox on Monday morning, October 1st—I do not remember whether I saw her before I came down stairs, or whether anybody called me in the morning—it was my custom to be called, and also for someone to bring me a cup of tea—I do not know of my own knowledge whether Miss Hall came to the house that morning, but when my father was out of town I believe she came every morning—my father had gone down to his country seat for pheasant shoot<lb/>ing—he went down by the night train to be there on the 1st October, for the pheasant shooting, and I attended to his practice during his absence—Monday morning, from 9 till 10, is set apart for vaccination—I did not on the night of 30th September, or on the morning of 1st October, commit adultery with Mary Fox, nor at any time, or in any place—I discharged Cottee in consequence of this letter I received from Mrs. Godrich (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I read part of it to her—Mary Fox was not called upon the trial at the Divorce Court, and to the best of my belief she was in America, but I don't know.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You hold some public appointment! <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; as medical officer of health to the Parish of Kensington—that is my only public appointment—it is a fact, that since my petition was dis<lb/>missed, some explanations have been demanded of me by the parties under whom I hold my appointment—I was threatened with dismissal—I urged as a justification, that I had indicted the only witness against me, and said that their motion was premature—it does not depend on the result of this trial whether I am to be dismissed, the matter is over, and I am retained—Mrs. Godrich's petition was filed in June—we had been living unhappily for some years, and I had not slept with her since 1866, or very likely 1864—she lived in the house—it was one of her grounds of complaint against me, that I was in the habit of coming home late, and coming home intoxicated—another charge was not that I was in the habit of beating her—she once charged me with beating her with a cane, and she taxed me with frequently abusing her; and, on one or two occasions, with breaking the ornaments in the room and pulling the blinds down, but not with breaking the furniture—she taxed me with kicking her out of bed, but not with looking her out of the bed-room—she never taxed me with turning her out of the room after the birth of the first child, abusing her, seizing her by the throat and frightening her very much—I swear she never taxed me at Hastings with having struck her and knocked her out of a chair, or with ill-treating her at Hastings—I was at Hastings with her, eleven years ago is the last time—I don't remember whether I have been at Brighton with her since I ceased to sleep with her—she did not remonstrate with me about my sleeping in a different place to where she slept, and say that it caused remarks—I was at Brighton when I did not sleep with her—I remember it, but I can't say that it was before 1864—she slept at an hotel called the King and Queen, I think, and I slept in an hotel, of which I don't know the name, in East Street, one night, and then I went home—I went to see her at the hotel where she was stopping—I presume that they knew there that I was Dr. Godrich, and that she was Mrs. Godrich—she did not say that it exposed her to unpleasant remarks, my not sleeping with her—she taxed</p>

               <p>me with having caught me with my arm round Miss Fowler's waist, em<lb/>bracing her—she is my sister-in-law—Miss Fowler and I very often went out together, as we lived opposite—I used to take her out to drive some<lb/>times, by my wife's desire, with the children, and sometimes alone—I did not take her out to dinner at Putney—we did have some biscuits and a glass of sherry there—she was, I suppose, examined in the Divorce Court, but I was not there—I did not take her out to lunch very often—if I met her when I went to see my patients she would walk with me—the Star and Garter is at Putney—I have got costs against the two co-respondents, so I have not to pay the costs—we have lived very unhappily, and have not slept together since 1864, and she has made several charges of adultery against me—Mary Fox came to my house somewhere about August or September, but I can't say, because we had so many servants—she came first as a servant—she must have come in August, about a month or six weeks before this—I had not known her or seen her before—I have never taken her to casino's, or places of that sort—my father being surgeon to the police, I had some orders for Cremorne when it was the police <hi rend="italic">fete</hi> there, my cousin asked me if I would give the orders to her two servants, I said, "Yes," and she said, "Your servant can go, too, if you like," and the three servants went—that is all I know about getting her orders for Cremorne—it is not true that I took her to places of amusement—I have not walked out with her alone, but I met her once in Kensington, by appointment—I was with a friend—it was about 7 o'clock on the Tuesday evening—I was going to the Vestry—I met her to give her a sovereign, because she said that Mrs. Godrich had assaulted her, and her bonnet and dress were torn—I said that I would give her compensation, that I had not got any money then, but if she would meet me I would give her a sovereign—this was after she was discharged—I never walked out alone with her before 30th September, or took her to a place of amusement—I used to give her money to pay for what I wanted in the house, which she accounted for, but not as a present—she remained in my house after the 30th, till some time in December—she did not remain till my wife returned, but left about a week before, or it may be a fortnight—she left because she said she would not remain—she did not know Mrs. Godrioh was coming back, neither did I—I have not the slightest idea where she went after she left me, but when I made the appointment with her she had rushed to my father's, when she said she was assaulted—I was at my father's, she complained to me, and I told her to meet me that night at Kensington—I did not give her a sovereign then, because I had not got it in my pocket—I could have got it from my father if he had been at home—Mr. Pile is the friend who was with me when I met her at Kensing<lb/>ton—I never saw her after that—I swear that I never saw her after she left my house, except on those two occasions—I don't know whether she went into service—she never applied to me for a character, she may have to my wife—she told me she was going to America to be married, when she was in my service—it is impossible for me to say whether that was before 30th September—I had no conversation with her about marriage, and do not know how she came to tell me that—I heard from her father, just before the proceedings in the Divorce Court commenced, that she had gone to America—my petition was filed in October, 1867—I did not know when I filed it that she had gone to America—I fully believed she had gone—when I filed my petition, I knew that the first charge in Mrs. Godrich's petition was adultery with Fox—my solicitors inquired whether Fox was in this country,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186903010044"/>
               <p>I suppose—they did not tell me so—I heard that she had gone, from her father, before the trial—he did not tell me where she had gone—I did not ask him anything about it—I had notice when Mrs. Godrich's petition was filed, in June 1867, that one of the charges related to Fox—I did not then make inquiries; I put it into the hands of my solicitors and left them to do as they liked—I am not aware whether I told them she was in America—I dare say I said I believed she was there—I believe Mary Fox went down to Ramsgate on Monday morning, 1st October—I most likely gave her money to go, but I don't remember it—I remember, from your calling my attention to the fact, that I did see her that morning—I can't tell what time—I think she stopped a week—I can't tell whether she returned on the following Friday—I can't say whether I discharged the prisoner on the day after Fox returned, but if the letter is handed to me and I can see the date I will tell you—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) there is no date to it, only "Saturday"—if it was directed on Saturday I should get it on Monday—Fox did not complain immediately after her return that Cottee had said that she would prove or charge her with some improprieties of conduct with me—nothing to that effect—she did not tell me that Cottee had threatened to write to Mrs. Godrich to let her know of Fox's goings on—she did not tell me that she answered Cottee and said that she would make her prove it—I have no recollection of her stating that she and Cottee had had any altercation at all—I have no recollection of her saying so—I know she never said anything about impropriety of conduct—she did not tell me that she had some quarrel and words with Cottee—I could not have discharged Cottee before the Monday after Fox returned, because this letter is dated Saturday—I do not know whether I said at the Police Court that this letter was destroyed, but I could not find it—I told Cottee why I discharged her, and read part of this letter to her—I do not know whether Mrs. Godrich sent for her shortly after her return from Ramsgate, but I think it is very likely—about the 3rd or 4th June, shortly before the filing of Mrs. Godrich's petition, the furniture was taken from my house—a dozen men did not by my orders come to the house on the morning of 4th June, and take the furnitnre away—I mean to say that the furniture was removed before my wife's petition—three men, I think, came with a van, and the proprietor of it, and removed the furniture—I do not know whether my wife was in bed, or where she was, I know she was in the house—they began early in the morning—they did not strip the house—I left a lot of fittings behind, not fixtures—I had slept there the night before, and my wife also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did they actually take away her clothes, and some of her jewellery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what they took away; the only jewellery I had was some sham ornaments not worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the articles of wearing apparel were sent to her—her jewellery was not taken away, only to the value of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the bulk of her jewellery went I know not where—some of her clothes were taken away by accident to my father's house, and returned a day or two afterwards, Miss Hall will tell you when—it was before the filing of her petition, I believe, but I do not speak positively—I was there part of the time when the men were there, but I had to attend to my patients—I gave directions to the men to take everything away—I do not know whether they went into her bedroom—45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was taken away in her desk—the money was demanded of me afterwards, by her brother, Mr. Walter Fowler, but was not returned—her clothes were returned; I do not know whether it was by the advice of the solicitor; I remember now that the clothes were</p>

               <p>sent to her solicitor's office—I do not know when Fox came back from America—I never saw her till the day before yesterday, but I heard, a week or a fortnight ago, that she had come back—I did not hear it before the proceedings in the Police Court were concluded—Fox was not called before the Magistrate; I did not know that she was in England—two of the men who gave evidence against my wife have not been committed by the Magistrate on a charge of perjury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Two women? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not present—I was not there when the matter was inquired into—I heard one woman committed here for trial, but not the other—Miss Hall was present, but was not called; I have not the slightest idea why not—Miss Hall was in the habit of coming to call me of a morning, when my father was out of town—she lived six or seven minutes' walk off—she considered I did not get up early enough—I some<lb/>times went to bed late, and sometimes at 12 o'clock—the charges of cruelty were not inquired into at the Divorce Court; the issue was adultery on one side and on the other—I was not in Court one moment—Cottee used to bring letters up to me sometimes, while I was in bed, and put them through the door, or come into the room, either Cottee, or Fox, or any of them—Fox, most likely, came into my room—it was always my practice to have a cup of coffee in bed, and I have no doubt all the servants have been in—I should say most decidedly that Fox has come in with my coffee, and most likely while I was in bed—after Cottee was discharged, Fox and I were the only regular inmates of the house; but Miss Hall has slept there, and Mr. Woodward—when Miss Hall did not sleep there, or Woodward, I and Fox were alone in the house—there is a front and a back room on the third floor—Cottee used to occupy the back room, and I slept in the front—there is a communication between the front and back—the second floor front room was Mrs. Godrich's room, and there is a communication between that room and the nursery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you desired Fox to sleep in the nursery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had desired them to keep the beds aired, but who I said it to I do not know.</p>

SERJEANT SLIIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you a patient at Putney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I drove there with Miss Hall, and had some sherry and biscuits—with respect to this sovereign, the girl Fox ran down to my father's house, I was at home, she had her bonnet torn and likewise her shawl; she said that she would summon Mrs. Godrich at the Police Court—I did not want an exposure there, and I said "I will give you something"—with that exception, either before or after 30th September, I never gave her any money except for wages and necessaries, but a woman came to me once and said that Mary Fox was living with her and could not pay her way, and I gave her two florins—I will not swear whether I gave Fox a sovereign or a sovereign and a half—the removal of my goods occupied a couple of days—I had pre<lb/>viously made arrangements that my wife should have all my father's house, except the ground-floor, which was devoted to business, and supper was provided for her—previous to the removal of the furniture, I communicated to her that any articles she wished to reserve for herself she might reserve.</p>

I am the wife of Dr. Godrich—I was married in 1856—I continued to live with my husband up to 7th June, 1867—we had been entirely separated from 1864, but my husband before that rarely came to my room above two or three times in the year—in 1867 I was obliged to leave altogether—my husband stripped the house—directly after that I filed a petition in the Divorce Court—I was not aware at that time that Mary Fox had left the country—I had been to her mother about the middle of September, 1866—I went to Ram gate, and took my two children with me—I left Mrs. Cottee and Mary Fox in the house—Cottee had been with me since June, as cook, and to assist generally—I had not known her before that—I had never seen her before May or June—she was recommended to me—I think Fox came into the service in July, as housemaid—she had regular fixed wages—I think it was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I really forget whether she was engaged weekly or yearly; she came as a servant, certainly—Dr. Godrich accompanied me to Ramsgate, and stayed there four days—he lived in the same house with me—we stayed at the Royal Hotel till he left, and then I took apartments—Fox came down to Ramsgate to me on 1st October—she remained, I think, three days, and then returned—Dr. Godrich came down to me afterwards, at Ramagate—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Saturday, 8, Morning, Trevor House,—Dear Frank, I have arranged with Mary, and she thinks she can mind the house very well.

Perhaps, as Woodward is up in town, you can arrange so that Charles Heaven could be at our house of an evening, and sleep there. Did Mary get up safely; I kept her the whole week, she looked so wretchedly ill. The weather is miserably dull, we are praying each day it may change.

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale provision merchant, and formerly carried on business in my own name, but it has been turned into a limited company, which for the last eleven months has occupied a stable and loft on the other side of Danes' stable—Tongue has been employed there about seven months, as horse keeper—he had the keys of the stable and loft, and had full charge—I never knew anybody to assist him, unless it was one of our boys—it was pretty well all he had to do—he ought to have slept at home—he did not deep in the loft, to my knowlege—I have noticed that the horses got thin and out of condition—about twelve horses were generally kept there—I put myself in communication with the police, and was present when some oats were marked, but did not see the whole of them marked—I saw some beans cut and marked on a Wednesday, about 13th or 14th February, in our Ware-house, 24, St John Street, but I did not see what was done with them—I have been shown some beans found in Danes' stable, and identified them as a portion of what I saw marked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Crosse-examined. Q.</hi> Had Tongue been in your service, on and off, for twenty years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I considered him a very honest, industrious, steady man—there was a break of two or three years, but he has been back some years—I had no idea that during me absence in the day-time a man was left on the premises with the keys—I have said that a boy sometimes assisted him in turning the wheel, but no man has been em<lb/>ployed by me to assist him—I have twelve horses in the yard—it is called New Inn. Old Bailey—Tongue has been employed there between six and eight months, and it is only latterly that I have had complaints of the condition of the horses—I was examined before the Magistrate, and I may have said, "We have occupied the stable about eleven months; throughout the whole of that time I have complained of the condition of our horses"—if those words were taken down, most likely I said them—I did not notice it the first two or three months, but I heard other people make remarks—I think Tongue is married—there was no necessity for him to sleep in the stable, as he lived in the neighbourhood.</p>

                  </hi>. On 20th January the prisoner came to my place of business in Rathbone Place, with a man who called himself Williams—I had never seen Williams before—I knew the prisoner by name—Williams said "Is Mr. Witt or Mr. Wilkinson here?"—I said "I am Mr. Witt, can I do any<lb/>thing for you?"—he said "Yes, I am a pianoforte manufacturer, and bring my foreman with me to select some goods"—that was how he introduced the prisoner—I asked him where he carried on his business—he said "No. 12, Hornsey Street, Holloway"—I asked where he was trading, and he said "Prin<lb/>cipally to Jersey"—he asked me to show him some goods—I took him down stairs to show him the goods, and he told his foreman (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>) to select the goods—ho spoke to him just as tradespeople do to their clerk—the prisoner looked out goods to the value of 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said "Those will be the goods which I think will suit our purpose; now you go to my master and make the terms"—we went upstairs, and Williams said some<lb/>thing to the prisoner which I did not hear, and the prisoner went outside—Williams then said "I sent my foreman out, because it is not necessary that he should know all my transactions"—he then produced this bill, which he said was from one of his customers, and asked if I had any objection to take it—I said, if it was a good bill, I certainly should not have any objection totakeit"—(<hi rend="italic">The bill was for</hi> 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated London, December</hi> 29th, 1868, <hi rend="italic">at two months, drawn by Thomas Williams upon and accepted by T. and H. Montague, Bridge Wharf, Cambridge Heath Road, payable at the London and County Bank, Hackney Branch, and endorsed by Thomas Williams</hi>, 12, <hi rend="italic">Hornsey Street, Hornsey Road.</hi>)—Williams wrote the endorsement in my presence—he called the foreman in and told him to go and fetch the horse and cart, to get the goods at once, because the men were at home waiting for them—the prisoner said the horse and cart was in the City just at pre<lb/>sent—Williams told him to go and look after it—they then went away together; in the evening, the prisoner came back with a man who he said was the coachman, and the goods were taken away in the trap he brought with him—I asked the prisoner on that occasion how long he had been with Mr. Williams—he said from twelve to eighteen months, and that he had sixteen or eighteen men under him, in superintending the manufacturing department, making the pianos—he said Mr. Williams was a man of wealth,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186903010070"/>
               <p>and had gone into the piano trade for speculation—I read him Williams's address, and asked him if that was right—he said "Yes, 12, Hornsey Street, Holloway"—I asked him whether the factory was in the house—he said "Yes," the front was a private house, but behind was the factory—he said that he had been a piano manufacturer himself for some years past but had failed, and that he worked for Mr. Kelly for some years on his own account—that I knew to be true—on the faith of those representations I allowed my goods to be taken away—I should not have allowed them to go if I had known the prisoner was not in the service of Williams, and if I had known this was a private house and no factory—Shelly's name itself influenced me in allowing them to go, knowing he had been in the trade—two days afterwards he came again, and brought me a letter, and said, "My master sent me with this letter"—it was in an envelope—he said, "My master sent me for some goods"—this is the letter—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "28th January, 1869, 12, Hornsey Street, Holloway Road—Gentlemen, be pleased to deliver to bearer what goods he may require, and charge the same to my account. If you have not sold the plank veneers, I would like the lot at the same price, yours, &amp;c., Thomas Williams.")—The prisoner had looked out some plank veneers on the first occasion, and taken a part of them away—I was a little suspicious, and I asked him again about the position of Mr. Williams—he made the same remarks as before, that Mr. Williams was a man of some wealth, and went into the piano trade just for speculation—upon that I gave him some more goods, but to a very small amount, about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—he wanted more, but I could not give him more—the fact of him being a foreman, and having eighteen men under him, was mentioned again—I sent my partner out with him, to ask him if the statements he had previously made were really correct—I went next day to 12, Hornsey Road—I found an old lady there—it was a private house—there was no factory, nor any in that road, nor were there any men at work there; nor any business carried on at all—I have not got any money for my goods—the bill became due on 3rd March, and was dishonoured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was Mr. Wilkinson present during the conversation you had with Williams? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my clerk, Elliott, was—the prisoner was near enough to hear what passed—I have not said that I believe the pri<lb/>soner did not intend to act dishonestly towards us, nor any words to that effect—I don't remember any statement of the kind—I have known Mr. Betts since the prisoner was in custody—he produced himself as bail for him at the Police Court, and I have seen him here—I have not stated to him, that in my opinion the prisoner did not intend to act dishonestly in the matter—he stated it to me—he said, "He did not believe Shelley acted dishonestly towards us, but that he was led away by Williams—I did not agree with him in any way—I did not say that was my opinion—the pri<lb/>soner did not appear the worse for liquor when he came; that I remember—I have not said so—my partner saw him on the second occasion, not on the first—I knew the prisoner before, by name, as a pianoforte maker—I only knew him by name, I never knew him personally—I should think a trades-man would know a man who has gone through the Bankruptcy Court—he did not say that he had worked at Mr. Kelly's—he said he had worked for him when he was in business for himself—I did not know the name of Williams before—I had a Directory on my premises—after the goods were delivered I looked in it to see if the address Williams gave was correct—it was not in the Directory, but I had only got the one for 1867—I believed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186903010071"/>
               <p>that Williams was a pianoforte maker, upon the prisoner's representations—I knew the prisoner had been a bankrupt, but if a tradesman fails and then goes as foreman, it has a very honest look—I know now that the prisoner was at work for Mr. Perry, a pianoforte maker, at 72, New North Road—I did not know it before this—it was not on the supposition that the bill was a good one, that I agreed to supply the goods—it was on the prisoner's repre<lb/>sentations—it was about 3 in the afternoon when Williams and the prisoner called first, and between 6 and 7 when the prisoner called for the goods—Williams called the prisoner his foreman in his presence, he introduced him as his foreman—I should think he heard Williams give the address, 12, Hornsey Street; if he did not hear it I showed it to him after Williams gave it—if the prisoner had given every facility to the police, we should have found Williams in the first instance.</p>

Q.</hi> Where was the letter dated from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't swear to that positively—to the best of my knowledge it was Hibbert Street, Liverpool—he gave me the letter open—it was in an envelope, I have no doubt I had the envelope in my hand—I can't swear that it had come through the post; to the best of my recollection it had—he did not say he was in the employment of Messrs. Anderson—he never led me to believe it—he told me he was a railway official—I understood he was a clerk at the goods department, or something of that sort—he did not give me his card—I swear that—I don't recollect his showing it me—I won't swear it—I looked in the Directory—possibly it was his showing me his card, that</p>

               <p>made me do that—I can't swear I did not give his card to the solicitors for the prosecution—he told me that he also had a coal agency—I found in the Directory "W. F. Garner, coal-merchant, depot, London and North Western Railway"—I believed that he was a railway official as well as a coal-merchant—no one was present at our conversation next morning, when I fetched the goods back—he did not say "There are your goods, and you shall take them off the premises"—nothing of the kind—he said he had not sent them up—I was very peremptory with him—he said it would make no difference to him—I parted, with the goods on the faith that they were ordered by Anderson of Liverpool—I did not send the goods away before I sent off the telegram—I did before I sent one telegram, but I sent two—I let him have the goods, believing that he was commissioned by Ander<lb/>son to buy them—the van in which the goods came, belonged to a carter named Baker—I did not know that the goods could not be sent to Liver-pool from that station—we had some difficulty in getting a truck to put them in at first—I let him have the goods on the strength of the letter and his representations to me, which seemed highly probable, and the letter being addressed to the "London and North Western Railway"—not station—the word "station" was not on it—I took particular notice of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brick merchant, and carry on business with I Robert Martin—on 8th December, 1866, I entered upon a contract with the prisoner—this is the agreement—(<hi rend="italic">This was an agreement between the De<lb/>fendant and the prosecutors, dated 8th December</hi>, 1866, <hi rend="italic">for the lease of two plots of ground, on which buildings were to be erected by the prisoner forth-with, in failure of which the agreement was to cease and determine.</hi>) Under that agreement I advanced the prisoner 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on two houses—on 2nd September, 1867, he had expended on the houses about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he ceased to work at the houses three or four months afterwards, I should think; I can scarcely say, in consequence of his haying left the houses for about six months—I caused a copy of this notice to be served upon him, according to the agreement entered into—I did not serve him personally—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To Mr. Charles Lyle. In consequence of your having failed to perform your part of the agreement between you and ourselves, we do, in exercise of the power reserved to us, we give you notice that we determine the same, and we shall take possession of the plots of ground. Dated 2nd day of September, 1867. Signed, William Standing and Robert Martin; and wit<lb/>nessed by Elias Davis.")—No notice was taken of that by the prisoner; he did not communicate with us in any way, and we took possession of the property—we were not interfered with at all by the prisoner—he came to us one day, and asked us to advance some money, and then we said we understood he had parted with his interest to someone else, and we had no power to advance him any money—he said he should go and have a row with them—I afterwards sold the property to Mr. Blackburn, on 10th August, 1868, under this agreement—I am not sure that I saw the prisoner afterwards—I saw him before, and he said he wanted some more money—that was about the end of last year, or the beginning of this—from the commencement of the houses, he continued working for about four months—at the end of that time, that would be about March, 1867, he took the things away, and did nothing to them after that—I can't say whether he went near the houses or not; I should say he did not.</p>

               <p>never did so—he only raised two carcasses of houses—the agreement will show when the two were to job finished—you have it there—we did not take possession before the time was completed, I am quite sure we did not—I was very sorry to take possession of either—the other two houses in the second agreement were not advanced to the first floor, only four or five feet of brickwork—he very likely sent a message to me to say that unless I advanced him some more money he should pull the houses down again—I took possession immediately after I served the notice—the houses had been abandoned for six months at least, we had no alternative, and should have been glad if he had completed them—I positively state that I never asked the prisoner to run a bill—I don't know whether my partner did—I think it is very likely there were more bills than these—he had many bills—I don't know what interest he had to pay us on this bill—he never paid us any—I am sure he was not asked to run bills—the notice was served on the Saturday, and we took possession on the Monday—we had no com<lb/>munication with the prisoner in matters of account—we could not have got hold of him at all—we had no object except to get the houses finished—I sold the houses to Mr. Blackburn—no consideration has been paid—I suppose he would have taken up his lease before this if the prisoner had not pulled his property to pieces—the prisoner could not have asserted that the property was his own—he has not, that I am aware of—I don't see how he could have done so.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Latchmere Road, Battersea, and am a commercial traveller—the prisoner lives at No. 10, which is next door to me—on 1st February, about 3 a.m., I heard screams of "Murder," coupled with my name, and tapping at the wall—I called out that I would come directly, and called my sons up—I saw the prisoner come from the adjoining house, and on going down stairs found the prisoner in my daughter's bed-room, blood running from her head—the prisoner was in the passage—I said "Halloa, young fellow, what have you been up to?"—he never spoke a word—he had his trowsers and shirt on, but no boots—I requested him to fetch the police—he would not do so, and at last I demanded that he should fetch them, but he would not move—the prosecutrix bogged of him to fetch the police—she said if your father was here he would have run all over the neighbourhood for the police by this time—she said, in his presence, that she was lying in bed, and had a stroke on the side of the head, and woke up and called for protection—I went into the next house with the police, but saw no evidence of breaking, or of footmarks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is No. 10 next door to No. 12? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the even numbers are all on one side—the prosecutrix tapped against the wall with the heel of her boot, and screamed, "Mr. Lawrence, they are murdering me"—I know the prisoner's father and mother, as next door neighbours—they were 80 or 90 miles away in the country at the time—his father is an officer in the Civil Service—I have lived there five or six months, and have heard them say that they have lived there six or seven years—as soon as I came down I saw the prisoner in the middle of the passage—my sons had let him in—I went with him next door—the door was opened—one window in the front door was broken, and another in the back door, and another opposite the landing in the bed-room; three broken panes in three different parts of the house.</p>

               <p>1st of February, I found the prosecutrix and prisoner at my father's door—my brother opened it—I asked the prisoner what was the matter—he said that somebody had been murdering Caroline, or striking her—she had a great deal of blood on her face—the prisoner was dressed in a dark shirt and trowsers, he had no boots; I could not see whether he had stockings—I heard my father's evidence, it is correct—my father told him to go for a constable, but he did not say anything—I went over the house next door when the first policeman came.</p>

On Sunday morning, 31st of January, about 3.30, I saw the prosecutrix and prisoner outside the door—I said to the prosecutrix "What is all this noise about, what is the meaning of your stand<lb/>ing out here?"—she said that while she was lying on the bed upstairs some man or burglar had been hitting her about the head, and nearly murdered her—the prisoner said nothing at that time—I went up to his bed-room which adjoined the prosecutrix'—there was no clothes on her bed, only the ticking, which had blood upon it; the window was open, and there was a quantity of blood upon the floor, and drops of blood on the outside sill of her window, which is on the second floor; it is very high—each story is about ten feet—I asked the prisoner who opened that window?—he said that he did not know—I found a poker secreted against the wall outside the prisoner's bed-room door—his bed-room window was open—I asked him who opened it?—he said "I did"—I said "Whose poker is that?"—he said "Ours"—I said "How do you account for it being here?"—he said "It has been hare over a week"—I asked the prosecutrix if she knew the poker—she said "It was theirs"—I asked her if they were in the habit of keeping it there—she said that it had been there, but on the Saturday morning, when she cleaned the house, she took it down into the kitchen"—I said "Are you positive of that?"—she said "I will swear it"—on the landing, as you go down, six or seven steps from the bed-room, I found a pane of glass broken, and asked the prisoner if he knew how it was broken—he said "No"—I looked round at the fastenings and they were all secure—he said "Very likely the party may have escaped this way"—there were no means of escape from the aperture—the catch was fastened—I undid it, and in raising the window a piece of glass fell from the inside—I went down to the parlours and saw that everthing was secure—the front kitchen was also secure—a pane of glass in the area door was broken, the top panel, and there was room enough for anybody to get their arms through and reach the top bolt; but it was impossible for anyone to reach the bottom bolt—the bolts were both fastened—the prosecutrix said that the glass had been broken some months—the catch at the back kitchen window was broken off, and the prisoner said that it had been off some time—he lifted the sash up a little way, and said "He may have got out this way and made his escape"—there was a row of flower-pots, and some gallipots outside the window, and it was impossible for any<lb/>body</p>

               <p>to have got out that way without disturbing them—I lifted a flower pot and found that it had not been disturbed, as it was damp underneath—I said to the prisoner "It is impossible for anybody to have got out this way"—the prosecutrix said that she had been all over the place, and was perfectly satisfied that nothing had been moved, and no fastening disturbed since she fastened them up—London went to the house with me afterwards—I stood at the door with Mr. Lawrence and the prosecutrix, and the sergeant came up—when I first saw the prisoner he had on a dark shirt and trousers, no necktie, stockings, or boots.</p>
