                  </hi>. I am the wife of Harry Miller, a bricklayer, and live at the Nile beerhouse, 30, Church Street, Greenwich—I learnt through Messrs. Passingham and Hall that the Nile was to be disposed of—on 2nd December I saw the prisoner on the subject; my husband saw him first—the prisoner said that he was doing 27 barrels of beer in a month, and that it was a lease for 11 1/2 years—on 3rd December I went and saw the place—I was told that the fixtures belonged to him—he asked 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first, but came down 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the fixtures, for which I was to pay money down.—I paid 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when these statements were made; the prisoner was there on 3rd December when I looked at the place, and my husband also—there were fixtures there; it was then he said he was doing 27 barrels a month, that it was a good living trade, and the fixtures were his—I was to go into possession before or after the 11th December—I took possession on the 11th, I then paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—at that time the assignment of the lease was made to me by Messrs. Passingham and Hall—the prisoner was present when the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid, this is the receipt—Mr. Fowler was my solicitor—this is the agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This agreement stated that</hi> 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was for the lease and goodwill, fixtures and effects</hi>, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">deposit.</hi>) This is the prisoner's signature—the money was mine, not my husband's—the prisoner executed this assignment on the payment of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the lease—Passingham and Hall acted for Clark—I believed the prisoner's statement that the fixtures and things were his property—if I had known that the fixtures were not his I would not have parted with my money—he did not tell me that the house had been closed for nearly 12 months, or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605030004"/>
               <p>that the lease was made on 28th September, 1885; I never found that out till afterwards, I think a week after I had taken possession, after I had parted with my 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—before I took the Nile I had managed the Star in Regency Street; I made that answer—at the Nile we did not sell a barrel of beer a week; I tried to make that answer but could not, I don't think anyone could, it had got a very bad name—we had some beer from Chandler's, and some from Pontifex and Moore, of Beckenham—I am still carrying on the business—lately the average sale has been about a barrel a week, but before that I don't suppose I had sold three barrels a month—I don't think it possible that 26 barrels a month could ever have been done there—I should not have taken the assignment and lease if I had known all the circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the Star three months, that was my first house, that licence was in my husband's name—Mr. Fowler was acting for me all through this matter—I paid the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the fixtures on 2nd December; I had not then seen the house, my husband had seen it the day before; it was on his report that I paid the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on what the prisoner said, that he was doing 27 barrels a month—I know that a public-house trade fluctuates—I knew that the prisoner had met with an accident, he told me so—he said the trade could be worked up; I believe he said something to the effect that he was not selling the trade, but the licence was worth more money—I don't think I said before the Magistrate that nothing was said about the lease at the first interview—20<hi rend="italic">.</hi> deposit was first asked, Mr. Lewis, clerk to Passingham and Hall, suggested that I paid him the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by cheque; the business improved at Easter—I did not try to recover any money by civil proceedings; I said I should be content if he would pay me back half the money—I sent him an apology for the charge I had made against him—he said the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. mortgage would be cancelled if the trade did not come up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was after I had been there a few weeks that I said I was willing to take half, because I was losing money every day—I told him he had committed a forgery, I meant a fraud, in selling me the fixtures, and he had taken me in in every way and I told him he had swindled me—he said if I apologised to him by letter he would cancel the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. mortgage, that was the reason I apologised, but he did not do it, he used very bad language towards my husband; I never got a shilling from him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the inventory of the fixtures, I believed I was getting them as my property.</p>

I am a clerk in a public institution, and live at Greenwich—I am one of the owners of the Nile, one of the trustees; I had the letting of it—I think it had been closed from May, 1885, to Sep<lb/>tember—a person named Miles was the previous tenant, when he left three quarters' rent were due—the rent was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I have never seen the prisoner till this trial; this is the lease he had, I was a party to it; it is for 11 1/2 years, from 29th September, 1885—I did not execute any assignment of the fixtures, or sell them, they are the property of the trustees—Mr. Humphreys was my agent in the matter.</p>

               <p>five or six months but am not sure—he agreed to take it, he was to have the use of the fixtures—at Christmas I found Mrs. Miller in possession, she claimed the fixtures, I told her they were the property of the landlord—I went through the list of fixtures, and marked those that were there previous to the prisoner entering into possession.</p>

I am collector for Chandler and Co., brewers, of Hackney Road—the account with the Nile was opened by the prisoner on 1st October, 1885—I produce the book which was made up between us and the prisoner; it was made up by me from a copy of the brewery ledger—I have got delivery tickets showing the number of barrels sent—on 1st Oct. he had four barrels and five kilderkins, and up to 4th Dec. one barrel and two kilderkins—I think Mrs. Miller had two kilder<lb/>kins from us, she had dealings with other brewers—the average during the whole time that we supplied the Nile would be about 23/4 barrels per. week—when the prisoner left the house we took back one barrel of waste and 11 gallons of stout, which was not fit for sale.</p>

                  </hi>. My father is a tobacconist, at 62, New Oxford Street—on 6th April, about 11.50 p.m., the prisoner came in for a threepenny Manilla cigar, and gave me a half-crown—I saw it was bad, and broke it in the tester—I bad taken another half-crown from him five minutes before—he was smoking it, he had smoked about an inch of it—I said "This is the second bad coin you have brought me in the last five minutes, and I shall give you in custody, I don't look upon it as an accident"—he said "You are talking rubbish, I have never been in your shop at all"—I said "I am quite sure you are the same person"—he was going away, but I went to the door and stopped him—I showed my father the two half-crowns—the prisoner said several times it was all nonsense about his being there before, and he swayed to and fro very much—I did not take much notice of his face on the first occasion, but I noticed his coat, and his height, and the tone of his voice—he paused between each word, he was so tipsy—he did not ask for a Manilla the second time, only for a cigar—I gave him two shillings and threepence change on the first occasion, and on the second occasion I have him change for a good florin, one shilling, a sixpence, and threepence—I gave the two half-crowns to the police; one was broken in two, and the other bent slightly—the gas was very dim, it was half turned out; the shop was being closed.</p>

"You dare hit me"—he sat down again in his chair—grandmother put the frying pan on and he took it off, and hit her with it behind the left ear—I then ran in and fetched my mother—I did not see the result of the blow, grandmother did not speak, she fell back, and my mother came in and then she died—she was sitting in the chair before the fire when she was struck, and she did not fall—I ran for my mother and she came back with me into the room, my grandfather was still there; she said "What have you done to her?"—he said "I will kill her," and used very bad language—she ran out then and fetched Mrs. Whitcroft, and I remained there till she came back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Conrad Burrows, and at this time was living at 9, Grosvenor Street, Bethnal Green Road—the deceased, Mary Little, was my mother; she was 67 years old—she lived next door to me at 10, Grosvenor Street—the prisoner is a cabdriver, and she had been married to him about six years—I saw my mother frequently; they lived on very bad terms together—before this 3rd of April she had made complaints to me, and I had heard the prisoner threatening her life—I saw several cuts on her finger the week before—I went into her house on account of hearing a scream, and saw her hands and face covered with blood; the prisoner was in the front room smashing the things; I got her into my yard; he ran into the room and slammed the door, and fastened himself in; he then broke it open and came into my yard; a gate joins the two yards—he broke the line and threw the prop down, and said he would kill the old cow that night—he was in drink—I have heard him threaten her life hundreds of times—he drank dreadfully—he used to go out in the morning with his cab, and return home between one and three in the morning—he was very uncertain in his times—on this night she was in pretty good health, only she had such a horrid dread of his coming home—she had taken some washing home in the afternoon—about seven in the evening she went off in a faint, that was after she had taken the washing home—she worked as a laundress—I bathed her head with vinegar and water, and she came to, and sat with me some time—about twelve o'clock she came into my house—my little girl was up then, she had just come home with me—in consequence of what my mother said I let her go back and sit with her—she appeared to be well then—about half an hour, after they had gone I heard my little girl scream in the street—she told me something, and I went into the house and saw my mother in the chair by the side of the fire, she was dying—I spoke to her but she could not answer me—I saw a mark on the left side of her head behind the ear—the prisoner was sitting in the armchair on the other side of the fire—I said "What have you done to my mother?"—he said "I will kill the cow"—I said "You have done it"—he then jumped up and said "Go out of my place"—I asked him to get some water for my mother, and he refused to go—he said "How can I go"—I went and fetched a neighbour and Mrs. Whit<lb/>croft, and when I came back he was still sitting there—before I fetched the neighbours I saw her head go back, and then she died, and I left my little girl with her and fetched a neighbour. And put water in her mouth but it ran out again—I then ran and fetched a doctor, and when I came back my mother was on the bed in the back room—Mr. Davis,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have lived beside the prisoner and the deceased just over three years—the son who came in lived in Collingwood Street—he was in the habit of calling on Saturday night—I ran in and out between the two houses—the prisoner and I were not on the best of terms—my mother did not fall down when she fainted, she fell back in the chair, she fell on the floor afterwards but I was not there then, I had been to fetch my brother—I had never seen her faint before—I have heard him threaten her life hundreds of times in the presence of neighbours—as far as my mother told me he was a good husband when not in drink—I did not see him crying after he was told she was dead.</p>

I am assistant to Dr. Thomas—on Sunday morning, April 4th, about half-past one, I went to this house and saw the deceased lying on the bed dressed, I should say she had been dead about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I examined the body—the left side of the neck was covered with soot and so was the lower part of the face—there was a superficial cut below the left ear—I could do nothing and left.</p>

On Sunday morning, 4th April, the police came to me and I went to this house and saw the deceased—I saw a superficial wound behind and below the left ear, it was slight scrape, all black and covered over with blood, it was like the scratch of a pin—next day I assisted Dr. Thomas in the post-mortem—both sides of the brain were congested; there was a clot of blood in the medulla oblongata—the cause of death was compression of the brain from the clot of blood—that would be produced by a blow behind the left ear I dare say—that is a very fatal part in which to receive a heavy blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The blackened part was from soot, not the effects of a blow; as far as I could see it was the flat part of the frying pan that must have struck her—I have heard it stated that the deceased had had a fit some hours previously and that she tumbled down, that would account for some of the clots in the brain—there were two clots, one in the left ventricle and one at the top of the spinal cord, I don't believe the one in the left ventricle caused the death, but the other did—I don't think that a sudden fall on the floor would have caused that clot—it is not usual for the clot to be found on the opposite side to the blow.</p>

On 24th December, 1884, I married the prisoner, he is a sailor—after the marraige he went to sea—in December last I was staying with my brother, Mr. Bushnell, at Hampton—about a fortnight after Christmas the prisoner came there and told me in my brother's presence that he was a married man, and had been married 10 years when he married me, and that his wife had since died—I don't think I made him any answer—he stayed that night at my brother's—we did not go to bed together—next morning he took my rings from my hand—that night he asked me for a pen and ink to write my name, I said I could not get any, it was too late, it was half-past 12, and if I went down I should disturb my brother and sister—he said never mind, and he drew his razor across his arm and said "You can write your name in this blood"—I asked him the reason, he did not give any—I wrote my name and he put the paper inside his desk—I have never seen it since—he went away next morning—I did not see him again till the Thursday, he then asked me if I was going home—I said no, he said no more, but fetched me a smack in the mouth and went away—I saw him no more till 29th March, I was still at my brother's, he came about a quarter to 11 at night, after we were all in bed, he asked to see me, I went down into the kitchen, he asked me if I would take the rings back, I said "I want no rings only the one I have bought myself, the keeper"—he said "You won't take them?"—I said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605030033"/>
               <p>"No."—he put the rings back on his finger and walked out of the house—he came back on the Tuesday night about 8 o'clock, he came into the kitchen where I was, he said "Maria, are you mending your dress?"—I said "Yes"—he sat down for a few minutes, he then said "Maria, go on your hands and knees and beg my pardon, otherwise I will shoot you"—I saw him draw a revolver from his pocket, he pointed it towards me and said "I will shoot you"—my brother was sitting opposite, and he jumped up and knocked his right hand down, and I ran out of the kitchen—as I reached the back door I heard the revolver go off—I did not go back into the kitchen until he had been taken away—he was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 5, Hope Cottages, Asylum Road, Upper Caterham—in January, 1885, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Million</hi> relating to the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> paper. (<hi rend="italic">This advertise<lb/>ment stated that</hi> 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">would be given away in prizes, and that the first</hi> 100,000 <hi rend="italic">subscribers would each receive the "Golden Argosy" for</hi> 13 <hi rend="italic">weeks and a prize by remitting</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">that to those who collected five subscriptions and remitted</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">at once, the paper and a prize would be sent free; and that the list of awards would be printed in the "Golden Argosy "and forwarded to all subscribers immediately after March</hi> 16. <hi rend="italic">It also gave a list of the chief presents, consisting of five prizes of</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">each, five of</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">ten of</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and smaller sums, as well as rings, watches, pianos, and other articles, and</hi> 95,237 <hi rend="italic">other useful and valuable presents ranging in value from</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.) In consequence of that I sent 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in stamps to the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> office, 13A, Salisbury Square, Fleet Street, and in return received a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> and two numbered receipts—each subscriber had to send 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each receipt—I afterwards saw a notice in the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> for 14th March, I think, about the prize distribution being postponed, and I sent a further sum of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. about a month afterwards—I received two more receipts, making four altogether—I saw an announcement in this number</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605030035"/>
               <p>of 9th May of the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> that the award of presents would be made as soon after 16th May as possible, and that I was to send 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for postage—I sent back my four receipts in accordance with that, but I first wrote to the office, and in reply received another copy of 9th May with these words about the postage underlined—in consequence of that I sent the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to coyer the postage of the four valuable presents—I saw the list of the prizes published in the Golden Argosy in June, I think—I had received no present for my four receipts—I received by post, with a half-penny stamp on, a picture like this, and a glass pen with ink in it—on one box was a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stamp, and on another box containing studs was a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stamp—after receiving those I went to the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> office on 11th July, and asked the female clerk for Mr. E. B. Lewis, whose name appeared in the paper as manager—I did not see Mr. Lewis—early in March I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Million</hi>, or some similar paper, of the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>, and in consequence of that I sent 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to H. C. Edwards, at 34, Bouverie Street, the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> office—in reply I received a number of the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> and two numbered receipts—I afterwards collected 51 subscriptions of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each from different people to the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>, amounting in all to six guineas, which I sent by postal order to the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> before 15th May—in exchange for those I received 11 more receipts, making altogether 13 receipts which I had from the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>—in the May number of the Journal I saw an announcement that 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was required for postage—I wrote a letter to the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> and received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that subscribers must send up their receipts, with</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in stamps for each one, and with name and 'address written on the back</hi>) In consequence of that I sent 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to cover the postage for these 13 presents I was to get, and I sent back my receipts with my name and address on the back of them—I received the June number of the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, containing a further notice about renewals—I did not renew my subscrip<lb/>tion; I had sent 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a year—on 13th June I received by halfpenny<lb/>post, in exchange for my 13 receipts, another copy of this picture from the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>, that was the only thing I received—the same day I went to 31, Bouverie Street; I saw "The <hi rend="italic">Household Journal"</hi> on the door there—I asked for Mr. Edwards—I went into the office, where I saw the prisoner and another gentleman; I said I wanted to see Mr. H. C. Edwards—the prisoner said "I repre<lb/>sent Mr. H. C. Edwards; he is out, and t am responsible for everything in his absence—I produced my picture and said, "I do not consider that this picture is sufficient to satisfy me for all the work I have done. I am obliged to come up by rail because I can get no answer to my complaints even when the letters I send are registered and marked 'private '"—I said I had sent up 13 receipts—the prisoner and the other gentleman said "The agents will have something better than a picture, "that it was a mistake sending me a picture—I said I had been obliged to go to the expense of railway fare because I could get no reply by post, and the prisoner paid me my railway fare—I went away, the prisoner having said I should have something else during the week, and having given me a stamped and addressed envelope marked "private," for me to write to Edwards—on 22nd June I received by post a box con<lb/>taining a chain, some studs and pins, made of brass I suppose, they were not gold—I should not think their value would be more than 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605030036"/>
               <p>2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I am no judge—I again went on 22nd June to Bouverie Street, where I saw the prisoner, having asked for Mr. Edwards—he said Mr. Edwards was out—I first saw a female clerk, and then the prisoner came out alone—he asked me why I did not write, that he had already told me he was responsible for everything in Mr. Edwards' absence—I asked whether Edwards was likely to be in in the afternoon—he said he was uncertain when he would be in—I said, "I am not satisfied with what has been sent to me, neither are the subscribers whose money I sent. There are three courses open before you; you either fulfil your promise to me and to those whose money I sent, or you refund every penny of the money I have sent you, or else I will see whether the law has anything to say in the matter. I will have a written guarantee from Mr. Edwards that he shall either refund the money or make good his promise"—he said, "I will write and then Mr. Edwards will write," and he repeated his statement—I afterwards received a letter, dated 24th June, enclosing 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in stamps, the balance of the postage money from the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>—I have lost the letter, but this is an exact copy which I took of it (<hi rend="italic">This stated that they considered his application for the return of his sub<lb/>scription quite irregular, but that they returned</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">that being not necessary for postage.</hi>) I then got the July number of the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> containing this list of winners of the more valuable prizes—on 11th July I went to the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> office, where I first saw a female clerk, but after insisting on seeing Mr. Lewis some gentleman came and peeped his head at the peep-hole for a moment and went back again; he said he had recognised my voice as soon as he heard it, and had seen me before—I did not see who he was, he was too quick for me—I asked for the names of the winners of the chief prizes in the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi>; I did not get them—on 22nd June I placed my complaint before the proprietor of <hi rend="italic">Tit Bits</hi>—I had seen no copy of either the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> before sending my money, it was on the faith of the advertise<lb/>ments I sent it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> For the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I sent to the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> for myself I was to have the paper for six month—I never saw this method of selling periodicals by means of drawings or presents before—I only know of giving prizes in competitions—<hi rend="italic">Tit Bits</hi> give prizes every week; and now if you are killed on a railway with a copy of <hi rend="italic">Tit Bits</hi> your family gets 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I thought they would get success by starting in this way—I read the stories in the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi>—I con<lb/>sidered the paper was fairly good, but it was too much money—my object of getting the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. subscribers was to get extra receipts for myself—I didn't know whether the presents would be divided into so many, or be simply one—each of the five persons got the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>—those who subscribed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had it for six months, and those who subscribed 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> every month for twelve months—I had 13 receipts for the 51 subscribers, being one of them myself—there were no others of my family among the 50—Francis Gibbons is here, none of the others that I know of—I expected to get something better than a halfpenny picture for my work—getting the subscribers entailed a vast amount of trouble—Mr. Rawlinson was with the prisoner on the first occasion I went up; I did not have the conversation with Rawlinson—he spoke to me and went downstairs before I had finished—I said to him "If you are the principal in the business I have something else to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605030037"/>
               <p>say," and he said "That gentleman there will attend to you "(pointing to the prisoner)—they had both spoken to me about business—the chain sent to me was a double chain, not like this one, and not a gold one; not so bright as this, but a dull tarnished thing—I went to Mr. Newns on 20th June, because he was inviting in <hi rend="italic">Tit Bits</hi> complaints from people who considered themselves duped—Mr. Newns sent for his solicitor—he stated in the paper that he undertook to prosecute—he did not tell me after a certain time that he had satisfied himself that the prisoner was perfectly respectable, nor did he tell me of his innocence—he did not advise me to cease to prosecute the prisoner—I don't know Mr. Newns's writing, I never had any writing from him—I don't know his private address—his solicitors are Best and Pitts, of Ludgate Hill—it was brought to my knowledge that a respectable gentleman was printing the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>—I forget if it was Mr. Collingridge—I forget if it was brought to my knowledge that Rideout and Wilkinson were Americans—my attention was several times drawn to an advertisement with regard to electro-plated goods at the name of Wilkinson and Co., Regent Street; I had circulars three times from them after I commenced taking in the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi>—Wilkinson has absconded; he and Rideout were supposed to have gone away at the end of May or beginning of June—Wilkinson appeared twice at the Mansion House, and then absconded from his bail—I never saw Rideout before the Magistrate—I did not notice who were the printers of the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi>—I don't remember ever seeing the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> on the railway bookstalls—I have looked among other papers for them, in fact I think I can offer evidence that they were never sold by Smith and Son—I did not think it was likely I should get the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. prize, but I thought I should something worth more than the picture—I have seen the same studs as these in the street at one penny the set—there were three studs, and one for the collar—I won't say that the imitation pearls were not in the pin when I received it—the balance of postage was not returned to me from the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi>—I had four tickets there, and sent 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the cost of postage was 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I think—I never understood from them that they would return postage for articles that came by post—they said in cases of articles coming by rail they would return postage—the postage money was returned to me from the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> after I had threatened—the money for my fare was given me before I threatened, on the day I went up, that was only a half-crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The announcement of those prizes just below the chief prizes influenced me most in sending money, I thought if I did not get the highest I might get one of those—I saw every one of my subscribers before I went to complain to the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> office because they are all my customers, not one of them showed me any valuable prize that they had received—at no time did I see any one in possession of any valuable presents which he had received.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woodford, Essex, and am a telegraphist attached to the <hi rend="italic">Northern Echo</hi>, 189, Fleet Street, in which I saw an advertise<lb/>ment in January or February, similar to this one in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Million</hi> with regard to the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi>, and in consequence I took to that office at 13, Salisbury Square, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as a subscription—I saw the prisoner, a clerk, and a person whom I believed to be Rideout; that was at the beginning of February—I got from the prisoner a numbered receipt and either two or three copies of the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi>, which was published every week—I afterwards saw in that paper this announcement about the dis<lb/>tribution of prizes being postponed for two months—in May I saw a notice about the postage and in consequence sent fourpence—some time in May or June I received a present, that was after I went to the office—I went there on June 19th, I had received no present then—I saw the prisoner and a clerk—I demanded the return of my subscription and the fourpence postage as I had not received a prize according to the terms of the advertisement—the prisoner refused the return of either the postage or the subscription—the prisoner and his clerk said they could not return either the subscription or the postage and said something to the effect that the presents were on the way—I left and on the following Monday, the 22nd, I received a number of writing slips called "Arn's Mastery of the Pen," they came by post with a halfpenny stamp, I believe they are things to teach you how to write, their value would be about two<lb/>pence—on receiving this I went again to the office—I believe I then saw the prisoner and the clerk I had seen before—I made no complaint about the prize, I asked for the names of the winners of the first, second, and third prizes, the three principal prizes of the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi>, having pre<lb/>viously seen an announcement in the paper which gave the number of the chief prize tickets; either the prisoner or the clerk told me to make appli<lb/>cation in writing; I did so on 16th July and got no answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know <hi rend="italic">Tit Bits</hi>; I believe one or two papers of that class have got a sudden and enormous circulation by a system of prizes—the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> was sent to me for thirteen weeks—I understood from the advertisement that the value of the presents would not be below 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and were to range from that up to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or a very high sum—I did not calculate the average of what the presents would come to in respect of 100 subscribers, or what outlay was intended to be made to establish the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> at starting with 100,000 subscribers—I made a rough calculation at the time and came to the conclusion that it might be done, if carried on honestly—I did not take into account that getting the subscribers direct there would be no discount to the newsagents—I admit it could be done—I thought very probably they could get large numbers of advertisements as soon as they could secure 100,000 subscribers</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605030039"/>
               <p>—there was nothing objectionable in the paper—I don't think the paper contained the opinions of other papers; I did not see them; I did not read the opinions of subscribers—I have seen the Art Union system—I am aware that in Dublin there are constant subscriptions for churches raised in that way—if I had had a prize value 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I obtained subscriptions from more than a dozen persons; none of them are here—the advertisement I saw in January was similar to that in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Million</hi>—I understood it was done for the purpose of getting a list of 100,000 subscribers by March—for the 13 weeks' subscription they have the paper for 13 weeks—I did not doubt the ability of their fulfilling their promises—before the Magistrate I said I expected there would be a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. present for every subscription—I believe most of the persons whose subscriptions I forwarded received a paper regularly—I think I said some of the subscribers received presents in June; it must have been July, I believe—I expected to be paid for my trouble by getting a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. present for every five subscribers, and my objection was that I did not get that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My wife had no present that I know of—several of my subscribers showed me presents that they had received; one was a parcel of penmanship slips, which were returned to the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi>; then there were several pins similar to this, and pictures, all similar to things I put in penny packets of sweets, with the exception of the pictures.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at 12, Princes Square, Canning Town—early in March last year I saw an advertisement for a clerk, and in consequence applied for the situation at the office of the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>, 31, Bouverie Street—I saw Mr. Rawlinson, and on his suggestion made application in writing—I received a letter from Rawlinson, and next day went to the third floor of 31, Bouverie Street, the office of the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>—I saw the business of the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> being carried on there—I saw Rawlinson, who introduced me to Wilkinson—Wilkinson showed me the ledgers of the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi>, in which the agents' names and a counts were entered—I have not seen those books since I left the office about May 9th—Wilkinson then took me downstairs to the office of the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> and gave me instructions as to my duties—I had not then seen the prisoner—I kept the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> ledgers containing</p>

               <p>the agents' accounts—at the time I was making the entries I saw the prisoner there nearly every day; I can't define his position—he came from the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> to the office of the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> had two offices, one at Salisbury Square and one in the same building as the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>; there was a private telephone between them—I was engaged entirely on the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>—I saw the pri<lb/>soner there nearly every day from March to May; I took it that he was cashier for the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi>, he had no business with the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> that I am aware of—he appeared to have the greatest amount of business with Mr. Rawlinson, he was almost daily at the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>—I kept three ledgers; when one was full I took up another—there was a series of three or four—my business was to see that letters received from agents were collected and then collated by another person, and then entered from his collation on my book—I did nothing else from March to May; I had enough to do, more than some people would have taken on with—I was there from nine to six, with three-quarters of an hour for dinner—other men were engaged in entering for the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi>—by agents I mean persons who had collected live subscriptions—I saw Wilkinson there, he gave me my directions—about 3rd April I saw Rideout there, he seemed to be the principal of both papers; we knew they were connected—Wilkinson continued to attend, and finally I heard he was ill—ostensibly whatever business the prisoner had to do was with Rideout in a private office—I observed one day he went to Mr. Wilkinson's drawer and asked Rawlinson for some papers, and the pri<lb/>soner took them—I had seen the advertisement of the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> as to the distribution of prizes; I knew it was supposed to take place on 15th May—I got no notice to leave, but I was dismissed and given a week's salary in lieu of notice by Rawlinson, who said to me, in Halley's presence, he was sorry he did not require my services any longer as the work on which I was engaged had come to an end—I said I was very sorry—he said probably I might be wanted again in a fortnight or so—I said, "You know my address and will write, "I and the prisoner said "Don't write but call upon me"—I afterwards wrote to Wilkinson at the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> but got no reply—a fortnight after I left I went to the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> office at Salisbury Square, where I tried to see the defendant, but was unable to—by entering the names of the agents I became acquainted with all those who had sent in the most subscriptions.

               <p>business with him with regard to the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> every day, all I did was advising him in starting the paper—it occurred to me whether it might be a lottery or not, he wished to be safe; I got Counsel's opinion at his request—I did not go with him arithmetically into the advantage of starting with 100,000 subscribers—I know nothing about the importing of goods from America, nor about the lady clerks, nor the adver<lb/>tising, nor the printing—I did business with Wilkinson as apart from Rideout since January, 1885—they were both introduced to me by a third party who had not known Rideout for any length of time but had been introduced to him by somebody else—I understood Wilkinson was a jeweller carrying on business in Regent Street—on the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th May I prepared an assignment of the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> to the prisoner, the transfer of the business was to date from the 1st of May—the assignment was left in my custody, I sent it to Rideout, having made a copy at Halley's request which I sent to him, it was not in dupli<lb/>cate, I acted for all three, Rideout only assigned—I had no knowledge of Wilkinson's position in the matter—I have got the draft of the indenture, it was executed on 6th May—my impression is that the reason Rideout gave me for transferring the business was that he was shortly going to America.

Best and Pitts, Solicitors, of 57, Ludgate Hill—my articles have expired now, but I am still with them—I have had the conduct of this prosecution on behalf of the firm, and also the inquiries prior to the prosecution being instituted—on 3rd July I went to the office of the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>, and purchased the July number, which has been produced—I saw a young lady clerk, and inquired for Mr. Edwards—I could not see him, and went again on the 6th, and made inquiries for Mr. Edwards with a like result—I then went back to the office, and in consequence of something that was said to me at the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> office, I wrote a letter to them, and sent it by hand—I did not know the prisoner as Edwards.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were receipt books; we entered on the counter<lb/>foil the name of the subscriber, we had nothing to do with those who sent the largest number of subscribers and I did not become acquainted with their names—there was no Mr. Lewis there.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605030051"/>
               <p>jewellery of all descriptions, each as these things and betterones—they were not sent off from our office, but sometimes a carman would bring a large case by accident and then they would be sent to Bouverie Street, where they were stored.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw only one case unpacked at Salisbury Square—Wilkinson was our <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> when Rideout was away, and after he came back Wilkinson was frequently there, I cannot say up to what date—Wilkinson engaged me at his shop, 135, Regent Street, on 31st Decem<lb/>ber, the jewellery he sold there looked good, I never examined it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It appeared an extremely nice, superior-looking shop, it was on the first floor, Wilkinson was a very nice gentleman—prior to May the prisoner was only doing clerk's duties; he received all instruc<lb/>tions, the same as all of us, from Rideout, or from Wilkinson when he was acting for him—every complaint made by subscribers was given to me to attend to at once, and goods were brought to me to send if customers had not received presents—the cardboard boxes were there a long time before the time of sending off before the 15th March—directly the goods were there every effort was made to send away the presents—a large staff were employed, we were hard at work but it could not be done, we really endeavoured to send to those people who subscribed first, it was an immense amount of work—when there were many in a family persons could either have one good present or a number of smaller ones—when articles were damaged in post another of the same sort was supplied.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Every morning there were 100 letters with remittances inside—all my time was occupied in opening such letters, we put the money by till the end of the afternoon and then the prisoner banked it—we continued to receive money in this way till I left in August—I don't know how many subscribers there were, there were a great number—I saw nothing at all in the boxes before 15th March, they were all empty—the distribution was postponed for two months and then we had a further increase in the subscriptions.</p>

               <p>which came in the last week, were returned—I saw no invitation to the public to send money after 23rd June, the advertisement was the same from January to May—I once or twice took the money to the City Bank, Ludgate Hill, and paid it into Rideout's account, Rideout was my employer at that time—I knew the prisoner had become proprietor by the common rumour in the office—up to May the prisoner had only acted as manager or chief clerk—the post-office orders were in Lewis's name, they were all paid into Rideout's account.</p>

I first became connected with the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> on 6th or 7th February—I was at the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> office, and went to the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> for Mr. Rideout, to learn how they opened letters and did their business—from 1869 to May, 1876, I was with a large firm of accountants, Chadwick, Adams, and Co., and after that I was with my cousin, a large distiller in Charterhouse Street, but when he retired I was seeking a situation, and I used to travel in the same carriage from Wimbledon with Rideout and Wilkinson, who lived together there—I knew Wilkinson because my brother was his man<lb/>ager</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605030053"/>
               <p>in Regent Street, that was a thoroughly genuine bond fide business, his jewellery is not supposed to be 18 carat hall marked, it is marked what it is—I was offered a situation at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week to start with, as cashier to the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi>, an exactly a similar position to the prisoner's, who had been two years with my cousin—his being there was partly why I accepted—the prisoner did not have the same wages as I had, I would not go for less—Rideout made the engagement with me, the prisoner was there partly through my brother's introduction, he is I believe a nephew or cousin of the late Mr. Alderman Figgins—I spent a fortnight or three weeks in seeing the method of the business, I certainly thought it was possible to carry out the system, and every day I thought it was more possible because I saw the enormous amount of subscriptions coming in—I was at the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> rooms at Salisbury Square then, the Bouverie Street office had not been taken—after a fortnight I began my duties, I banked the cash every day at Hill's bank, where Rideout kept an account—I did not see Rideout's pass book after about 8th or 9th May, he came to the office one day and asked me for it and took it away; and I have not seen it since; he also took his cash book, I opened a new one for the prisoner—Rideout said he had ordered empty cardboard boxes and they were being delivered there, there was no room for them till we took them to the first floor at Bouverie Street—the presents came in in bulk, the distribution for the journal was not to take place before June, and the presents came in about then, things came after Rideout left, from America I believe—Wilkinson acted under a power of attorney for Rideout—when he went to America Rideout told me I was to look after the business, he left about 1st March—400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods ordered and paid for by Rideout came from Wilkinson's, some real gold watches value 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were sent away, they were nine carat gold hall marked, over 80 of them were sent away I know—the brooches and things came from Veit and Co. opposite Ely Place, they are large importers of American and Swiss watches—a very large quantity of real silver bracelets, a large number of paste diamond earrings with 15 or 18 carat gold settings, and silver settings, of the value of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pair, really good-looking articles, which a great many people would wear and not be detected, and silver pencil cases from Veit's and other people were sent off; they were supplied and paid for by Rideout—many of these sums were cabled to America for that purpose—my belief is that the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 7th January was for goods—the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 24th February was for America; all the large sums were sent to America, I had nothing over 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave receipts for ordinary bills, the receiver had them—the cash book was kept properly and balanced each day; Rideout took it away—at the end the money came so quickly we could not enter it, there were 1,500 letters a day for a fortnight—this cash book was started on 1st May—Rideout had not informed me that the prisoner would be the proprietor—he asked me to buy the business before, and I almost consented, and then the matter dropped, and he informed me on 1st May that the prisoner had—most of the plates for the woodcuts of the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> came from America—the proof sheets were sent to the office for correction by Mr. Harris, the editor—after the prisoner became proprietor he continued to keep the <hi rend="italic">Household Journal</hi> account at Hill's bank, and the <hi rend="italic">Golden Argosy</hi> account at the City Bank—the 611<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. transferred from Rideout at the City</p>

               <p>Bank was a cash payment; the account was opened by a payment—I was there up to the Receiver coming in—the prisoner conducted the business in exactly the same way Rideout had; I got the cash and told him what I wanted—the initials on the cheques for presents I don't know—Rideout had no control over the bank then—the "E. G.

               <p>enough profit and they might do without it—I told Rideout at the time, but he said it would ruin him if he did not have it; that it was only an average—it was just alter that the money was coming in so fast we could not enter it—in the same number in which that appeared renewals of subscriptions were asked for and promises given of further receipts—we afterwards got a greater influx of subscribers—I believe there were one or two inquiries at the office as to who the prize winners were—I never heard who they were—that was the first letter of the kind I had written—I said afterwards I did not know whether it was a proper thing for me to do—I had instructions to open all letters that came to the office unless marked "private"—I supervised the lady clerks—I knew Best and Pitts had been to the office asking names of prize winners before that—I had given instructions that they were not to be told unless they asked in writing—I told Halley that solicitors had been there inquiring as to the names of the three prize winners, and he said "They had better write"—he had seen the names when Rideout gave them to me and knew I had them in my desk—I have not got that paper now—I wrote the names and addresses on it of the three prize winners at Rideout's dictation at the beginning of May—I don't remember consulting the prisoner about it; I won't swear I did not; it was only a matter of him saying "Yes" or "No"—I believed the statement contained in the letter was true, that they had been twice to the office and Edwards had been refused to them—I gave general instructions that if they asked to see Edwards they could not see him, because he was not there—Edwards was the name given in the advertisement—I gave those instructions on my own responsibility, I being only a clerk—I took Rideout for Edwards originally—I knew he was in America—I did not know who was Edwards after he went away—I knew Halley had bought the business—there never was any Edwards, to my knowledge—there were ledgers in the office in which the names of all subscribers were entered, with the names of the agents; they were kept by Carr—he and some one else were specially employed to keep them—those books would have been accessible to me, but I had too much work to do—I never had the curiosity to look and see who were entitled to the chief prizes—I asked Rideout who won the first prize and he told me—I never asked Carr—I had not got the books at the beginning of May, when I had the name of Wesson—Rideout had them; he took them to America to work out the big prizes, the other ones being worked out by the receipts more easily—he was supposed to supply all the first lot of prizes that appeared in the paper—Halley could have looked at the books—I should say now that these men were not entitled to the prizes; I had that suspicion when the case was first initiated, at the beginning of June, because Rideout had gone away and we did not receive presents that I thought were compatible with his promises—these oleographs came over about the beginning of June, and I thought they were not the proper things—we did not Begin to unpack till then—the transfer of the business was at the begin<lb/>ning of May, but we received those things about the beginning of June—I never thought financially of buying the business; I should have expected to get it for nothing with the responsibility of the business on my shoulders—I should have got partners with capital before I took it; I should have gone into it—I thought the thing was a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> affair and could be worked in a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> manner and would make a big fortune—I</p>

Morris" on the counterfoil for my own guidance when I was checking the pass-book, as I believed he had 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I doubted it when Child came on 23rd June—I believed I filled in "Morris" some time in June, when checking the pass-book—I should not like to swear it was not in July; it was not after July—"First prize" is in my writing; it was entered in my cash-book "First prize"—I knew nothing of the cheque for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn at the City Bank on 28th July—I did not see him after the 27th—he never told me he was going away—when the prisoner took the business Beesley was a clerk and he took the position the prisoner had held—we drew the money out for these two cheques for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and paid it into the bank—Hazell, Watson, and Viney went with me—Hazell, Watson, and Viney refused to print the paper, but their head man (who had set up for himself)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> As soon as I began to pay in I knew that the account at Hill's had been transferred to the prisoner, that was about 8th May—between 1st May and the time the prisoner began to draw Rideout had drawn out one cheque of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was on 1st May, that was the only real one—I find in the counterfoil book a trace of an arrangement by which 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were to be drawn out from Hill's account—before the prisoner had any right to draw on it all, Rideout got out the sum of 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 7th May for the purpose of buying presents, that was part of the payment the prisoner made, and in that way the banking account was diminished by 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner had no power to draw cheques till 8th May—30 or 40 crates of stuff arrived, sent by Rideout a little before the 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out or between that and 15th May—I have an idea I did not date the cheque for the second prize the day I drew it—Rideout instructed me how to draw the cheques, and prior to those instructions Rideout had taken away the books—I did not see any of them—if I had succeeded Rideout I should have taken care to make arrangements for meeting the promises as to presents—Rideout told me and I believed that he had provided money for the three large money prizes—the refusal to print was about the time of the prisoner's first appearance at the Mansion House—until the prisoner was proved guilty I did not think it necessary for me to tell the police that Rideout was at Wimbledon—I was not sure myself whether there was anything in the case—I heard of <hi rend="italic">Tit Bits</hi> when Messrs. Best and Pitts and North came to see me, that was before I wrote and sent the names—the prisoner has borne a very high character—my cousin was very pleased with him and sorry to part with him when he gave up business—the prisoner went to America without saying where he was going, I should have advised him to stop—directly he had gone I thought I had better draw out the balance for the benefit of the creditors under the words "postage" and "wages"—out of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., after paying salaries, was left unapplied because the journal was not posted, and that I put with the other and paid it into the account, which was afterwards put in by the Receiver—I did not get the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he left in the other bank; Beesley met Mr. Viney and took it round, I left to go into the country and did not see it—I have an entry of its actually going to the Receiver—I kept the books without reference to Rideout—probably I should have asked the prisoner before sending the names to Best and Pitts, I cannot say if I did.</p>

Ransom and Bouverie's, he told me he was going to pay money in there, but I never saw any cheques—the cost of cableing to America is to send direct through the American Exchange; that applies to all cheques of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>and upwards—I cannot tell you why the letter was not written till the 28th though the cheque was drawn on the 7th and actually paid by the bankers on the 14th—Mr. Rideout was then helping Halley, who did not know anything about the business—it was written by Halley's special direction—Rideout was not in the office—here is "Return to the bearer, G. A."; those are Halley's initials—they would not have cashed it without that—I am sure this is one of the three cheques sent from the <hi rend="italic">Argosy</hi> office.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 45, Bookham Street, Shoreditch—the deceased Henry Hibberd was my husband; he was 55 years of age—he was assistant at a wholesale druggist's—up to 26th March he was in his usual health—on Friday he became poorly, and on Saturday he remained in bed—he did not sleep well in consequence of his complaining of illness—I went to Dr. Money's dispensary—I saw the prisoner there; I told him that my husband complained of pains in the back and shoulders—he said from that he should think he was suffering from inflammation of the kidneys and liver (he had seen my husband before, some time last year, and had prescribed for him)—he gave me a bottle of medicine to take home—I gave it to my husband, but he got no better, and on Sunday, the 28th, I sent my son to the dispensary—he brought back</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605030062"/>
               <p>another bottle of medicine, which I also gave my husband—on the Monday he got worse and I sent for Dr. Money to call—I thought the prisoner was Dr. Money—the prisoner came at dinner-time and saw my husband; he said, "Old gentleman, you are very ill;" he said, "I am, the medicine is not doing me any good"—the prisoner asked to see the bottle; my son gave it to him; he looked at it, took a paper out of his pocket, and said "Yes, I have left one thing out"—he then examined my husband and put something which I have since heard called a stetho<lb/>scope to his heart, and he said "You can't sleep?" and he asked him if he could see any dark objects coming before him—my husband said he could not sleep soundly, but he did not see anything like that, meaning dark objects—it was principally the church he was thinking of when he was rambling (he was beadle at Hoxton Church)—the prisoner said "If you could get sleep you would be better; I will make you up a draught: you get half a pint of the best stout and divide that in two, and the draught in two," and I was to give him a half as soon as I received the draught and the other half in two or three hours; if that did not produce sleep he said he would call and see him in the evening—I was to call at the surgery for the medicine in an hour and a half or two hours—I did call; I did not see the prisoner; a little girl gave me the medicine—I don't remember whether it was wrapped up in paper—this is the bottle (<hi rend="italic">produced)</hi>, it was about half full when I got it—I did not notice the label at all—I can read—when I got home, about half-past three, I gave my husband half of it in half of the stout—it did not produce sleep, and about six in the evening I gave him the other half in stout in the same way—I did not look at the label then—after that he went to sleep—soon after he had gone to sleep my son came in and noticed his appearance and he went and brought Dr. Money—that was nearly half-past six—my husband never spoke again; he died about a quarter-past eight—Dr. Money came himself; that was the first time I had seen him—next Tuesday morning I saw the prisoner at the surgery—he said, "What have you been doing, Mrs. Hibberd?"—I said, "I have done just what you told me to do;" he said, "Yes, I admit I told you to do so, but in going home I thought he might require a third draught," and he had put in three draughts—he asked me if I had read the label; I said "No"—I asked him for the certificate—when Dr. Money came he took the bottle away with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had never come to see my husband at home before—he prescribed for him two or three times last year for irritation of the stomach; he complained then of pain between the shoulders, nothing else—I don't remember telling him that he was unconscious and wandering; I won't say I did not—when the prisoner saw him on this occasion he had been slightly wandering at times on the Sunday—he slept a little on the Sunday night—he had a little boiled mutton for dinner on Sunday—he had been 27 years in the employ of Barrow and Co., wholesale druggists—he had nothing to do with the drugs, he was in the rhubarb department; he had not to lift heavy weights—the prisoner remained with him about five minutes on the Monday: he was in bed; I think he examined his back—when I fetched the medicine I did not think it necessary to read the label; the prisoner had told me particularly to divide the draught into two and the stout in two, and I took up the bottle and poured the half out into the stout</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605030063"/>
               <p>to the best of my belief—he told me to give the second half in between two and three hours—I don't think I could have been mistaken—I never read the directions on the bottle; Dr. Money read it when he took it away—my husband had never complained of pain in the chest or in the region of the heart; he had never been ill a day in his life, not to lay up—he never complained of any shortness of breath, nothing particular, nothing to mention.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 32, Tachbrook Street, Pimlico—I am a M.R.C.S.—I have a dispensary at 29, East Road, Shoreditch—the prisoner has been my assistant there about 13 or 14 months—he has not passed any examination to my knowledge—in my absence he was in the habit of prescribing for patients—on Monday, 29th March, I was sent for to see Mr. Hibberd; I got there a little before 7 p.m.; I found him unconscious, breathing in deep gasps, at long intervals—the pupils of his eyes were very much contracted; he was in a state of deep coma—his heart was beating tumultuously—he was perhaps nearly half a minute between the gasps, that would indicate that something had interfered with the excitability of the respiratory centre in the brain—I was not able to do anything for him, I considered it a hopeless case—I asked Mrs. Hibberd for the bottle, and she handed me the bottle produced—it was empty—I read the label out loud; it is in the defendant's writing—I remained perhaps a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I did not see him alive again; I heard of his death within an hour—I was present at the post-mortem examination, on Saturday, 3rd April, by Mr. Phillips—the defendant was present—I gave it as my opinion that he died from the effects of a narcotic poison on his brain—these prescriptions (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) are the prisoner's writing; they are dated 17th August, 27th August repeated, and 18th September repeated—that of 27th and 28th March is my writing; that is a sleeping draught, it contains a drachm of chloral</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605030064"/>
               <p>hydrate, a sixth part three times a day—on 29th March there is a fresh prescription, that is one drachm of chloral hydrate—this has evidently been changed from one and a half to one; that is the prisoner's writing; the other ingredient is one drachm and a half of bromide of potassium, and one drachm of solution of morphia, that is much weaker than Batley's solution of opium—this one drachm represents half a grain of muriate of morphia—the next ingredient is tincture of capsicum, cayenne pepper—that is a stimulant for the stomach, not affecting the nerves; that is to be in three ounces of water—three ounces would make half of this bottle—if half that mixture had been given at a quarter-past three, and the other half at six, I should not have thought that would account for the state in which I found the deceased at seven, but I suppose it did—I should not think a medicine of that kind would act more power<lb/>fully on a man with such a state of heart as I saw—I have not admitted that there was any disease—the muscular walls of the heart, in my opinion, were weak, flabby, and somewhat thin; they did not stick out as they should do in their normal condition—I am very doubtful indeed whether the heart was more flabby or flat; that might be expected from the considerable decomposition that had taken place—I did not examine the heart by the microscope, and cannot speak positively as to whether there was fatty degeneration of the heart—it would require caution in giving medicine of this kind to a person suffering from heart disease; if there was heart disease at all here, I don't think it was that sort of disease that would forbid the use of such a draught as this—in my judgment there was no increase of size whatever in the heart, consequently there could have been no increase of size discovered by percussion; the heart was not weighed, therefore I cannot speak by the card—if it existed during life, it would show itself merely by a weakened impulse; I should say it could not be discovered by auscultation, not with certainty—before giving a narcotic of this kind it would be an act of necessary prudence to examine and see whether the heart was diseased; if it was discovered that the heart was diseased even to a small extent, in my opinion circumstances might warrant the use of such medicine—if divided into three, and a third taken every four hours, in my judgment it would not be in the least a dangerous administration—if the heart was found to be diseased, I should say yes, but I do not admit that it was diseased—assuming that the heart on the Monday was as I saw it on the Saturday, I don't admit that the dose would have been an imprudent one; if I did say so, that was not my meaning—I was bothered—I do not agree that this was an improper dose—supposing half the mixture given to a man without heart disease, and the other half in two or three hours if he did not sleep, I should not think that would be a dangerous administration, I should not mind taking it myself—I have often given it; it is a full narcotic, but not a dangerous one—much larger doses are recommended on authority—the danger of a narcotic is in many instances more dependent upon giving the doses too rapidly, than upon the actual dose given—I expressed my opinion at the post-mortem that the heart was weak and flabby, and that there was the commencement probably of fatty degeneration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The heart was not weighed—a combination of chloral and morphia is used by the profession—it is most difficult to find out slight disease of the heart previous to death—I know no means of finding</p>

               <p>it out—it is impossible for me to give a professional opinion from the post-mortem, whether the deceased had been suffering from delirium tremens; he seemed to have been the subject of continued indigestion—from the examination of the stomach there were all the symptoms of his having suffered from drink—the prescriptions that have been produced are such as would be prescribed for delirium tremens—I presume that some symptoms, the result of drink, ware mentioned, otherwise this combination would hardly have been prescribed on 17th August—the prescription is: chloral one drachm, bromide of potassium two drachms, one drachm of tincture of digitalis and chloroform, water six ounces; one-sixth part three times a day—that leads me to the conclusion that something of the sort had been complained of—digitalis is given for everything—I think the kidneys and liver were beginning to show signs of drink—the liver was not a drunkard's liver at all; it was only very slightly, if at all—if the heart was originally healthy, I should expect to find it flabby four or five days after death, with the body in a decomposed state—before I took the prisoner as an assistant I had testimonials from those who had employed him, and I have not had a single complaint from any of my patients.</p>

I live at 2, Spital Square—I am a M.R.C.S. and of the Apothecaries' Company—I have been 25 years in practice, and am Divisional Surgeon to the H division of police—I was requested by the Coroner to make the post-mortem examination in this case—Mr. Money and the prisoner were present at the time—the vessels generally were loaded with blood, most notably those of the brain and lungs—the heart was large, flabby, and dilated—the ventricles were dilated, and the walls thereof thin—the stomach was large, and that of a dyspeptic; the mucous membrane was thin, and the sub-mucous membrane thick; the liver was slightly degenerated—the body as a whole showed signs of fatty deposit; there were evident deposits in various parts of the body, not mixed with the tissues, but deposited upon them—the body was advancing in decomposition to a certain extent, not very far, still decomposed, five or six days after death, but there was enough to enable us to form a judgment of his state of health during life—the appearance of the heart was not the result of post-mortem decomposition—the kidneys were healthy—there was a small quantity of fluid in the stomach—I smelt it, to my sense it smelt slightly of chloral; we were divided in opinion; it would be hard to judge of the smell of fluid in the stomach of a decomposing body—the cause of death was <hi rend="italic">abnoea</hi>, or want of breathing power; that might be produced by the administration of a narcotic—by <hi rend="italic">abnoea</hi> I mean that the breathing power was paralysed, from the appearances and from the symptoms that were described to me—I did not altogether come to that conclusion from the post-mortem appearances only—the power of the lungs was paralysed—I say that from the loaded state of the vessels of the lungs, taken together with the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605030066"/>
               <p>symptoms that were presented preceding death—I have heard Mr. Money's description of the state of the man when he saw him—from what I saw on the post-mortem I cannot escape from the conclusion that a person of competent skill examining the man during life would have found out that he was suffering from heart disease—chloral is a dangerous drug to administer to any man who is suffering from heart disease of that character that I saw on the post-mortem—I have before me the pre<lb/>scription of 29th March—it is a narcotic—that would not be a dangerous administration to a healthy man, no more than chloral is a very uncertain drug in its action; if it was necessary to produce sleep it would not be dangerous—if one-third was administered every four hours to a man in the state in which this man was, in my judgment it would be dangerous—I think, if suffering from heart disease it would be highly inadvisable, and probably dangerous—the Pharmacopoeia dose is from five grains to thirty; thirty is a full dose—as far as chloral is concerned, bromide of potassium would depress the heart's action somewhat, and enhance the action of the chloral—a solution of morphia would very much enhance the sedative effect of chloral—in certain doses it touches the heart—it would stimulate to a certain extent, and then it would depress; given in combination 15 drops would be a quarter of a grain of the salt of morphia—that given in combination with the chloral would depress the action of the heart—in my opinion the administration of this medicine would account for the death, and that it did account for the death was agreed by all present at the post-mortem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have made a great many post-mortem examina<lb/>tions, and several of death from chloral, and I have found the heart diseased as in this instance—in the case of a good heart, I think a dose of half this would be an admissable dose; if a first dose did not produce sleep, I might have thought it necessary to give a second; it would all depend upon the symptoms the patient presented—I conclude that the heart was undergoing fatty degeneration from the enlargement of the cavities of the ventricles, and the thinness of the walls, and the breaking down of the substance under pressure—I did not examine it micro<lb/>scopically, because we all agreed that the heart was degenerated at the post-mortem—if there had been any dispute about it I should have gone fully into the matter; but there being a concurrence of opinion I took it for granted that my opinion would be supported—there was a clot of blood in the left ventricle—if there had been any blood in the right auricle it would have escaped before I saw it—my assistant dissected the heart from the body—I did not see it taken out—I have no hesitation in saying that blood did escape from it, because it always does—the brain was healthy in structure, but the vessels were congested—I examined the stomach carefully; I came to the conclusion that he was a chronic dyspeptic, I should say he had been for years—that might have arisen from a variety of causes, errors of diet and so on—as I did not know his previous history or habits it was impossible for me to tell what it arose from—it may have arisen from indulgence in drink, or matter of diet—you may eat yourself into dyspepsia a great deal more easily than by drink—fatty degeneration is very often overlooked before death, it might have been overlooked in this instance, but not enlargement or dilatation of the ventricles—that might be found out by auscultation; the sounds of the heart would be altered—that would be told through the</p>

               <p>stethoscope—I take it from this prescription that the whole that was in the bottle consisted of 60 grains of chloral—that would be a very large dose to give to a healthy man—I have known 160 grains given without proving fatal—it is not unusual to give half a grain or a grain of morphia for a dose—there was only half a grain in this bottle.</p>

My father is a professor of languages at University College and I live with him at 84, Riversdale Road, Islington—I was introduced to the prisoner on a Wednesday about a year ago, I was with a friend at the time—he had then a large bazaar at Stroud Green Road—I went there with my brother sometimes and ultimately he visited at our house, and on 20th June I went through the form of marriage with him, this is the certificate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then lived with him at the Stroud Green Road—about the end of July or the beginning of August I opened a letter addressed to him from a person writing as his wife—I asked him for an explanation and he told me it was not his wife but that it was a woman he had been living with, and then afterwards he told me it was his wife but that she had led him a very bad life and he tore it up—two or three days afterwards he produced this document (<hi rend="italic">produced)</hi>, and I communicated with my parents and showed it to my mother and then to my father, and then I went back and lived with my father for a little over a week—I then received a letter from the prisoner's wife with this certificate enclosed, and I and my mother went and showed it to the prisoner—he said he had never known it before, but it was a great happiness to both of them that it was so—I then went back and lived with him until January this year, and when the business failed I went and lived with him in Crystal Palace Road—his wife afterwards went to my mother's house and I separated from him again—I recollect the prisoner attempting to commit suicide in March; he was taken to the German Hospital, and after he recovered I took him back to my house—there was no proof that he was not my husband—ultimately he was arrested.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of 12, King's College Road—about the middle of April last year I advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> for a situation, and in reply received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was headed 6, South square, Gray's Inn, and stated that Messrs. Erlebach and Co. would be glad if he would call to-morrow with reference to his advertisement.</hi>) I called at 6, South Square, and went up two flights of stairs there, I think—I think the name Erlebach and Co. was on the door downstairs, not upstairs—I was shown into a room where I saw Stuart—I said I had called about the letter—he said "We think of getting up a bank; we want a secretary, but I should prefer you to see Mr. Dormer, who attends to the matter more"—I think he said then, "I could have the post myself, but as we are getting it up I prefer not to" (referring to the secretaryship)—he said it was to be called the London and Scottish Bank—I did not see Dormer then; we arranged for another meeting, and I called again the week after, when I saw Dormer—Stuart came in, and in his presence Dormer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188605030078"/>
               <p>said "We are starting this bank and we want a Secretary, who will have to take up shares in the bank so that he shall take more interest in the concern"—he asked me what salary I should want; I said "250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said he would put it before the directors, he could not tell me himself—I don't know if I then decided what number of shares I would take up—I called again a few days later and saw both Dormer and Stuart—Dormer said in Stuart's presence that I was to make a written applica<lb/>tion; I did so—after I had arranged to take up 50 shares, Dormer told me if my references were all right they would give me the berth—they were 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shares, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on application and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on allotment—I wrote applying fur the shares and the situation, and two or three days later called again—Dormer said in the presence of Stuart that I was accepted by the directors—I paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by somebody else's cheque to my order, which I endorsed and handed to Dormer—Dormer wrote out this receipt, which Stuart took away and copied and brought back—Dormer signed it "Erlebach and Co." (<hi rend="italic">This stated that</hi> 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was received from Arthur Davis as a deposit of</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per share on</hi> 50 <hi rend="italic">shares in the London and Scottish Bank, subject to his appointment as assistant-secretary to the bank, and that the shares were to be sold at par if Davis gave up the appointment.</hi>) I took from the table a preliminary prospectus and memorandum of agreement of the London and Scottish Bank (Limited)—there were no directors' names on it.

(<hi rend="italic">Signed Erlebach and Co., stating that they were awaiting the receipt of the written withdrawal, that they might lay it before their clients.</hi>) I placed that letter in the hands of my solicitor, Mr. Neave, and wrote a withdrawal—I instructed Mr. Neave to commence an action in the High Court to recover my 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I served a document at the office myself in connection with this action—I got nothing out of the action, I never got a farthing of my 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back and I have paid my solicitor's costs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Dormer.</hi> I understood you the bank was registered—you told me the promoters were as good as directors—I don't remember if I said in my affidavit I was told it was a company about to be formed—I understood the bank was going to be started—I won't swear you did not say that signatories were the same thing as directors—I saw there were no names to the blank memorandum of association—I know you put us to a great deal of trouble in the action—I never attended the Court and don't know when judgment was given—I left the matter to my solicitor—we got judgment and you appealed and we got the day—it was after the Long Vacation, I believe.</p>

               <p>get another situation for a time, and come back to him when he was more busy—I told him I had been round to the addresses of the directors and found that none lived there—I had seen at the office in July, I think, this prospectus of the London and North British Bank, with the names and addresses of the directors on it: Lord Chichester; Mr. Tottenham, 13, Park Lane; and Chas. W. Erlebach, 6, South Square—I said I had been to 13, Park Lane, and that nobody of the name of Tottenham lived there—Dormer said he did not know, he had known him for some time and he gave him that address, and he thought as he was a single man he would take lodgings anywhere—I said "I have been inquiring about Lord Fitzwarrine Chichester, and I think it is a forgery;" I thought he had got his name under false pretences—he said "It is not a forgery"—Stuart was present in the room at this conversation—a few days after, Stuart said he had the letter from Lord Fitzwarrine Chichester autho<lb/>rising the use of his signature, and he went into his office and produced a letter in Philpott's writing, across which was signed in pencil simply "Lord Fitzwarrine Chichester"—I have not seen that document since I read it.</p>

He said it was his Lordship's consent to become a director—Philpott said until he had signed it in pencil he did not know how to spell the name correctly—on the prospectus the address of Charles "William Erlebach was given as 6, South Square, I saw no Charles William Erlebach there—Dormer said to me, "This is owing to the Munster Bank, the public would not take up shares in this, as it was on the same principle"—on 14th October I asked Dormer again for my salary for August and September—he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the two months, he said I could have the week following to look for another situation—I went again on 1st and 2nd November and asked Dormer for my money, he said he was prepared to meet me on Wednesday, that was two or three days afterwards—I then went and saw Philpott—I asked him if Dormer was in, he said he did not know, but that Stuart was—I told Stuart I wished to see Dormer, he said he was not in—I told him I had come for a settle<lb/>ment; Stuart said he did not think Dormer was prepared for it—I went and consulted a solicitor, Mr. Dutton, and commenced an action against Erlebach for 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. my deposit and 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for wages—I served a writ on him myself at his house, and got judgment, I got no money—after that I went to Dormer's house again, 28, Ridley Road, and found the place locked up, that was at the end of November—I then went to the office and found that locked up—during the whole time I was at the office there was not the slightest sign of the business of a bank being carried on—I saw no books that I was to keep—Dormer asked me about the first or second week in June to sign a paper, he said he wanted to get a friend of his made a director, and would I give him a vote—he put certain forms before me, I did not read them because the heading at the top was turned over; I put my name without seeing what I was writing under, I do not know what it was—I have never seen my name in print on any memorandum of association—I signed on a paper similar to that memorandum of association—I did not know when I signed it it had anything to do with the London and North British Bank—those,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Dormer.</hi> I signed about five or six of these memo<lb/>randa—you brought me one first and then the others, one above the other—you gave me no opportunity of looking to see what they were—I was sitting at your table in your chair—you would not let me move them and look; if I had tried by force I might; you were holding them—I went to another office in Gray's Inn Square to have my signature witnessed—I went over my signature there with a dry pen; they were then held up against a wall outside the office door—your hand was on the top of it then holding it against the wall; there was no paper over it; I could not see while you held it—you did not say you wanted names signed because it was necessary to get seven for registration—I saw it was headed for printing—the headings of the other copies were under the first one, and the whole five were covered in that way—I signed about the middle at the bottom; there were some signatures there already—when I came to your house after the accident you came to the door as usual looking much the same—you said you had been knocked down by a cab and robbed—that a cab had gone over you—you might have been robbed afterwards—you did not tell me you had been knocked down by a rough—on the Monday I saw you at the top of Southamp<lb/>ton Buildings paying the cabman—I believe I was five or six yards off—you walked as usual till I touched you, and then you began to limp; you do not usually walk with a limp—when I first came to you I knew you as Erlebach; I saw your name on your door—I asked Phil<lb/>pott who the gentleman was whose name (<hi rend="italic">Dormer</hi>) was on the door—he said "Who you call Erlebach"—that was about a fortnight after you engaged me, about the same time that I began to do work in relation to the company—I did not know if you were Erlebach—people who came for Erlebach were shown in to you.</p>

               <p>looking at something and writing from it—Dormer gave me the holidays in June—I cannot be sure if you were there; you were always in and out—I never spoke ill of Dormer when I was in his service—this is the notice I gave in October. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he wished to leave that day month and wished the repayment of his money and</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">due for salary.</hi>) That was addressed to Dormer, at 28, Ridley Road, his private house—there is no reference in it to Erlebach and Co.—that was because you told me to apply to Dormer for money and I looked on him as the head of the firm—I did not know the gentleman I saw when I came back from my holiday was Campbell till afterwards—I believe the telegram was, "Dormer is very ill; close the office early"—I cannot give the exact words—I don't think I asked you for any books—I knew your name was on the prospectus as secretary pro tem.—I asked Philpott because I was more intimate with him than with you—I never asked you for my salary—you once said you were very hard pushed and were waiting till Dormer came back to get some money from him—I said at the police-court that you said you would rather give 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than that Lord Chichester's name should appear on the prospectus, because he said he would not become a director; at the same time you showed me a letter that bore, you said, Lord Chichester's signature, and that he said "I hereby agree to become a director of the London and North British Bank, and hereby authorise you to print my name on the prospectus as such"—I think you said Mr. Tottenham had obtained it for you—I don't think you said anything about his solicitor—you said nothing about a County Court judgment against Lord Chichester.</p>

               <p>Stuart put me to making entries in a book from directed wrappers, copying them, nothing else—Mr. White worked there with me; he came the same day and did the same work—that work went on, on and off, until I left—they were wrappers to put circulars in and send by post—five days after the end of the month Stuart paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave this receipt—I still went on at Finsbury Pavement—I waited a fortnight after my August salary became due and then Stuart gave me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he said Dormer was away and would pay the balance when he came back—on the first occasion I saw him pay White's salary also—I got the balance of my August salary on 7th September, and on that same day he handed me this document (<hi rend="italic">A notice that his services were not required after Thursday</hi>, 8<hi rend="italic">th October next, signed Erlebach and Co.</hi>) That is Stuart's writing—when I wanted to know why I was served like that he would give me no answer, but said an explanation would be given me on the following Saturday, and that I should get my September salary then—on the following Saturday I went; I saw Philpott; I told him I had come for my salary—he said no one was there—after that I called every day or every other day—I saw Stuart on some of the occasions I called; he did not pay my salary, he said he had nothing to do with finance, Mr. Dormer attended to that, and that he was away with an injury to his leg, I think he said—on 14th October I wrote that I could wait no longer, and that failing a cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and my salary I should place the matter in other hands the next day—I left that at the place, I think—I got this answer, signed Erlebach, with Erlebach and Co. on the paper.

Good salary to competent man; security or investment required"—I replied, and on 22nd June received a letter asking me to call, in Stuart's writing, signed Erlebach and Co.—I called at the office of Erlebach and Co., 6, South Square; Philpott opened the door—after waiting some time in the waiting room, I was shown into another room, which had the name of Dormer on the door—as I went in Dormer came in, and just as we were beginning to speak Stuart came in by a door in Dormer's room—Dormer said "Let me introduce you to my partner, Mr. Stuart"—Dormer said "We received your letter in reference to this appointment as bank manager," and he asked me what my experience in banking was—I said I had been in the National Bank of Scotland for a certain number of years, but had lately returned from abroad, and was anxious to get another bank appointment—he asked me for my references, and I gave them—just then Stuart took in from the door (I think Moss or some one handed them in) a bundle of prospectuses—Dormer gave me one to look at; it was similar to this of the London and North British Bank, with the names of the directors on it—he asked me to look at it, and I made some remarks on it—he said "That is the North British Bank that we are going to start"—I said "What chance is there of floating it?"—Dormer pointed to a heap of letters on the table and said "No shares have actually been allotted yet, but there are several applications"—Stuart said "I alone amongst my friends in</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This, among other matters, requested him to address his letters to Stuart as secretary, and not to the firm.</hi>) Between 18th August and 13th October I wrote various letters addressed to Stuart as secretary—I got no answers to those—on 30th September I wrote a special letter for my three months' salary; I had no reply, and wrote others, and then I telegraphed to stuart and received this reply, "Stay, will write to-morrow. Stuart, London"—about three days after I received a letter, after having written two more letters. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he thought it was understood the salary was not to he paid until after allotment of shares, as until that woe done they had no funds in hand, and that they were working the matter at the highest pitch, and would like him to do the same in Scotland.</hi>) On 17th October I returned to London, never having seen anything beyond the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I started with—on the 19th I called at 6, South Square—Philpott opened the door and showed me into the waiting-room—I afterwards saw Stuart, who said he was glad to see me and was pleased with what I had done, but he was over head and ears in work that day, "Will you come back on Wednesday at 2 o'clock, and I will give you till dark to talk over what has been done; you can have a holiday to-morrow to put your house in order"—I called again on Wednesday at 2 o'clock, and saw Philpott only, who told me to come back next day at the same time—I did so, and saw Stuart; he referred me to that letter he had written about no salary being paid until the allotment of shares—I told him it was very hard lines I should go and live with my people and receive no salary—until then nothing had been said about salary not being paid until after allotment—Dormer told me my salary should be paid monthly—Stuart said he was going to have a meeting of the directors, and he would put the matter before them strongly—that was on the Monday, the first day I came back—I said "Is the bank going to go on?"—he said "Most certainly"—I called after the supposed meeting of directors—I saw Stuart; he paid me no salary, he said the directors had instructed him not to pay me until the shares were allotted—he told me to come back in a few days—on 10th November Stuart told me he thought they would not open until the end of the year—I offered if they paid me all due to the end of November, namely, 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I would not charge them during December unless I worked—Stuart then wrote out and signed my letter of appointment as sub-manager, which I had been asking for ever since I joined—I had it stamped afterwards—I said to Stuart I would not leave until I got it—Stuart said he would lay my offer about taking 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before the directors—I called on Thursday, 12th November, and saw Stuart; he said the directors were struck with my offer, but they would let him know on Saturday whether they would accept it or not—I called</p>

(<hi rend="italic">In this he undertook to deposit</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">or take</hi> 100 <hi rend="italic">shares as security.</hi>) On 18th July I received a letter signed "Erlebach and Co." (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they found his references satisfactory, and that if he would call they could complete the matter.</hi>) I called at 6, South Square on 20th July—Moss admitted me; I was shown into Stuart's room, and was taken into Dormer's room, where I saw Dormer and Stuart—Dormer spoke prin<lb/>cipally, and we talked over the matter, and it was arranged I should come on the following Thursday to commence my duties as clerk and pay my deposit—Dormer said it would be much more to my interest to make my deposit 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it would make me stand better in the eyes of the directors, and I should receive 12 1/2 per cent interest at least—the security was against breach of trust—on Thursday, 23rd July, I called at the office and paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-notes to Dormer in Stuart's presence—Philpott then brought in this agreement, which I signed, and Stuart witnessed, after I had paid my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">This was headed London and North British Bank," and was an agreement that Ellis should be employed as clerk or in such other occupation as the directors might think fit; that he should divulge none of their secrets; that he should deposit</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">at the same rate of interest as that of the yearly dividend of the bank, and that that sum should be returned when he left the service, unless he was discharges for breach of trust or dishonesty, and that his salary should be</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per annum.</hi>) The receipt was endorsed on that—Dormer said I could not commence yet because the offices were not ready, and that I was to come next morning—I understood the offices were at Finsbury Pavement—I went next day, and they told me to go on Monday—I then went to South Square, and Stuart set me to direct wrappers—I went there for six weeks doing the same work—one day I went on little errands to auction rooms to inquire about the dates of furniture sales; that was to kill time, I suppose—on 11th August I gave a month's notice to Stuart by letter—previous to that I had written asking the directors to reduce my deposit, and had given the letter to Stuart, who said he would put it before them—I got no return of any of it; I think that matter dropped because I gave notice to leave—I saw Stuart several times after that—he end of the first month he said, "The directors think, as you are leaving so soon, you had better leave the settlement till you leave, and settle altogether"—I did not see Dormer about the salary; nobody ever suggested I should see him—I continued at the office after giving notice—before the month had expired Stuart gave me leave to go home to</p>

I went back to the office the day after receiving that letter, before the expiration of my month, to see if there was anything to do at the office, notwithstanding the letter—I several times applied to Stuart for my salary; I never got any—he gave as a reason that one of the directors was away in the North of England, and that three of the directors had signed a cheque, but that he could not cash it till it was signed by the fourth—he appointed another day for me to go—he said my money had been paid into the same bank, but he would not tell me which it was—after several applications Stuart gave me this promissory note, dated 17th September, for 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at two months, signed by Dormer and Stuart—the body of it is in Stuart's writing—I went to the office up to past the middle of September—I presented the note when it was due on 20th November; it was dishonoured—on 17th November I received this letter asking me to renew with 5 per cent, interest added—it was not renewed—I received none of my deposit and no salary—I had noticed the name of Mr. Tottenham, 13, Park Lane, as a director—I inquired at 13, Park Lane, and afterwards said to Stuart I had been there and learnt that no individual of that name had lived there—Stuart said he had been told the same tale by a gentleman in the street.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This stated that Dormer could not be at the office until Monday.</hi>) On the 27th I saw Stuart and he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., my month's salary, and I gave him this receipt—when he gave me that he said that was my real salary—I last saw Dormer on 20th November—on 19th November I wrote that formal resignation of my appointment—I went to the office on that day and saw Philpott; he said he had had orders not to admit me into the office; he did not say why—I refused to go away, and Stuart came out to see what I wanted; I then asked him for pen and paper and wrote out that paper.

I carry on business with my mother at 95, Finsbury Pavement, as stationers—about February, 1885, Dormer, who I had previously known, gave me an order for some stationery; he had an office at 26, Finsbury Pavement—he asked me whether we could do some printing for a public company, and I said "Yes"—about February, 1885, I received an order to engrave three card plates, one was "Erlebach and Co.," one "W. Stuart," and one a considerable time afterwards, for heads of letter paper—I printed a lot of papers with headings of Erlebach and Co., and on 18th February, 1885, I received an order to print a pre<lb/>liminary prospectus of the London and North British Bank, and the London and Scottish Bank; I printed it and sent copies to Finsbury Pavement—it was all in blank, there were no officers and no directors—it was printed from a written draft—I printed different proofs of them up to May 14th, when the name was changed to the London and North British Bank—from that time up to June 22nd I printed different proofs of this prospectus of the London and North British Bank, on 22nd June I first printed copies with the directors' names; this copy with the names in red ink on it was supplied to me, it is I think in Philpott's writting—I printed some with it, and then printed some more with Fitz Warrene spelt right, and with "Suffolk" altered to "Norfolk"—the orders were from Dormer, I don't think anybody else—I received an order from Stuart for envelopes to be supplied to the office—about June, Dormer took one room over my shop as an office, no name was put up—after that I saw Mr. Watson and Mr. White, who have called there frequently; I don't know whether they were engaged or not—I never saw Stuart in the room, I have seen him come there—I engraved a card plate for Stuart, "P. C. Stuart, 6, South Square, W.C."—it was charged to Dormer, the whole account stood in Dormer's name—in November they owed us 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for printing for the bank—I called for it at the office constantly, and always saw, sometimes Stuart and sometimes Dormer; they made all sorts of excuses; we have had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from them, and 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Stuart.</hi> I found four or five cheques payable to you—these are letters, referring to three undertakings, addressed to Totten<lb/>ham, Leslie, and Field—I find in the postal book an entry by Philpott relating to Tottenham and Field—I received a letter at Glasgow, which I have no doubt came from your brother—I seized all the papers at Dormer's house, and searched among them for all the exhibits—there was no deed of partnership executed by which you and Dormer agreed to carry on business as Erlebach and Co., there was an agreement—I commenced to look for you on 1st May, 1885, immediately after the complaint was made—I found you had left London clandestinely, without letting people know where you had gone—by tracing a box I found you had gone by the North London Railway, your name and address were attached to the way bill—the box went on 8th December very likely, and I believe you went the same day—some time later I saw the name, William Patterson Stuart, appearing in the newspaper in connection with an application for the office of chief constable of Hull—I wrote to the town clerk of Hull, who sent me your application—I showed it to Moss and he identified it as your writing—I had no doubt you were the one I was making inquiries about—I had no warrant then—I arrested you in Glasgow on 19th Feb<lb/>ruary—I found out that you appeared to have been deputy procurator fiscal for Paisley—from inquiries I made it seemed you had been in pretty straitened circumstances and had gone from place to place—your furni<lb/>ture had been seized at one place, that was hearsay—I found you had been deputy procurator fiscal only from what you told me and from what appears in your letter of application for chief constable of Hull—I do not suggest you were not—I have other reasons than the papers I found at Dormer's for knowing that White was victimised, I had heard of him before the correspondence—I came to know of Sorrel through the letters and letter-book—I found a letter addressed to Erlebach and Co. by Richard Hall, of Shepherd's Bush, I don't see it here—I have seen Mobsby; I only found one agreement relating to him, that was between Dormer and A. H. Mobsby, of Carter Lane, whereby they agree to promote the London and Scottish Bank; I don't know if the Mobsby I saw is the same man—I believe he has been victimised by Dormer to a considerable extent—I found letters from Laurien, Norman, Taylor, and Kerr, none from McIntosh—you had a book called on the outside "Call Book;" in that, on June 30th, the last name is Tottenham, immediately above it is W. D., and W. D. appears on the previous date—the call-book was found at 28, Ridley Road.</p>

                  </hi>. I was chief mate on board the ss. Gorji on 21st November, when she sailed from London to Cardiff—from Cardiff she sailed for the Persian Gulf, stopping on the way at Jeddah on 27th December—next morning the prisoner, who was chief steward on board, held the keys, and had charge of the cabin generally and the saloon, said he had seen some coolies coming out of my room with a small bundle wrapped up in one of their clothes, as though there were revolvers or something in it—I went to my room at once and missed my binocular; I told the captain and several people I had missed it—the prisoner knew after I missed them that they had been stolen—the ship proceeded on her way to the Persian Gulf, and on the way back she again stopped at Jeddah—while lying there on 27th February this year I received on board six large cases and one small case of "gold to the value of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," according to the shipping note, in coin—the shipping note was given to me by the prisoner, who said the specie was in the cabin ready for</p>

               <p>stowing then—I went to stow it, and he accompanied me aft—the prisoner and a coolie from the shore assisted me to stow them—they were close to the trap door, and were handed down by hand through the trap door into the lazarette, the place where stores are kept, to which the prisoner as steward would have access—then I went into the alter peak, which is below the lazarette, where some specie was already stowed—the prisoner remained in the lazarette—we found we could not hand the cases down, and the prisoner said "Wait a minute, I will fetch a rope to lower them down to you"—he brought a rope and lowered the end down to me, and asked me to put a bend in it, a running bowline—I made a slip knot, a noose in it, and then the cases were lowered into the after peak with this rope—after that was done the prisoner coiled up the rope and said "I will keep the bend in it, as you will want it at Port Said"—he then took it on deck—I followed him on deck; I saw the hatchways closed—I cannot say I took special notice of the rope after we came on deck—the prisoner, I, and the coolie were the only ones that lowered the specie—the next day, 28th February, we sailed from Jeddah—on Monday morning, 1st March. I was called from my berth by the second officer, at five minutes to 2—I went aft to the saloon and found all the saloon doors open, and heard a knocking coming from the steward's room—there are folding doors at each end of the saloon, four doors altogether, two folding doors and a fore and aft door as well; they were all open—the hatch of the lazarette was open, and the door of the steward's cabin was closed, and he was knocking on the inside and crying to be let out—he heard my voice, I suppose, and said "Let me out, for God's sake, I am looked in," some expression of that sort—he said the key was lying on the deck out<lb/>side; I saw a key in the middle of the hatch, on the grating right oppo<lb/>site the prisoner's door—I picked the key up and unlocked the door and let him out—there was no light in his cabin—I said "Why did not you strike a light and get out at the window?"—I believe he said he was too frightened, or did not think of it; I cannot be sure about the exact words—he made that remark, but whether at that time I could not say; he said he had been knocking since five minutes past 1; he gave me the particular time—he said "I struck a light and noticed the time by the clock in my berth"—he volunteered that, I did not ask him—when he came out of his berth he was greatly excited, he had his shirt and trousers on; he rushed out into the saloon with a revolver in his hand and said "Catch him, catch him," and went towards the fore part of the saloon, and round the starboard side of the house—I went round the port side of the house—we saw no one—I went into the saloon and ordered lights to be brought—the prisoner said he had been knocking and shouting to be let out from five minutes past 1 till I let him out, and that he had fired three shots from a revolver; he said he had been knocking with his boot, and the key had fallen out on deck—when they brought a light I went down into the lazarette; I found the hatch communicating with the after peak off, and lying on one side—by showing a light down there I missed one case of the gold specie which I had stowed—I noticed nothing more at that time—I came up and reported to the captain that the case of specie was gone, and we mustered all hands to make them give an account of themselves—they were kept aft while I and the chief and second engineers and officer went to search the forecastle and forepart of the ship—we found no trace of</p>

               <p>anything that could lead us to the missing specie—the men after being questioned were dismissed to their quarters—I then went down into the after peak—whilst going down there I noticed a coil of rope lying on the side of the after peak hatch—I went down below again and had a thorough search, but found nothing—as I came up out of the after peak hatch I noticed a small peculiar shaped ring lying beside the rope—I picked it up and handed it to the third officer—the next morning I asked him for it again, and kept it myself till I handed it to the Consul at Port Said—this is it, and this is the rope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the same as he had lowered the specie down with when we stowed it, and it still has the same bend in it—on the Saturday afternoon that the specie was received on board at Jeddah I gave the prisoner two sweat cloths at his request—these two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are similar to them—on 27th February the prisoner purchased from me a musical box for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he remarked then that he had not the money but that the captain had some that he would ask him for and pay me as soon as he got it—on the day previous to our arrival at Port Said I believe, March 5th, I asked him to pay me the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said he had not got it then, he would ask the captain for it in the morning and give it to me—on the same morning that we arrived at Port Said, March 6th, he paid me with two sovereigns, one of which I have here, it took my attention and I kept it—it is from the Melbourne Mint, 1885—I saw the sovereigns found by Mr. Morgey counted in the saloon—I did not notice the mint of those—round the edge of this coin were two or three dents, which made me look at it—I gave it to the third mate—on 6th March we got into Port Said, and the prisoner was given in custody on the Saturday and remanded till the Monday—on the Sunday Mr. Morgey and Mr. Stapleton came on board and went into the saloon—I was called into the saloon and saw Mr. Morgey passing a bundle from the locker behind the stove into the saloon, singing out "We have found it, we have found it"—when I found the rope and took it away from the lazarette the prisoner saw me bring it out of the cabin—I said "I will keep this rope, as it may be useful"—he said nothing—that was all I said—the same morning the case was missed, but afterwards I noticed on the outside of the deck house, which was of teak and varnished, some smears down the side of the house, done by the toe of a boot I fancied—they were close to the window of the prisoner's cabin, leading down from the roof to the deck—they were footmarks—while I was looking at them the prisoner came behind me—I remarked "How is it you did not get out at the window?"—he said he had tried, but could not turn the button, it was too stiff; he then tried it in my presence, and turned it quite easily as I thought with his finger and thumb—when we arrived at Port Said the prisoner was given into custody on the Saturday, and on Sunday Mr. Stapleton and Mr. Morgey came on board—I saw Morgey bringing a parcel from the locker, which was open, saying "We have found it, we have found it"—two or three others were present in the saloon—the same piece of signal halyard was tied round the parcel—the outside of it was a newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Cardiff Weekly Mail</hi>, December 12, 1885, with an address—inside that was a sweat cloth similar to this one, and inside that cloth was the money—I saw it counted on the saloon table—in sovereigns and a few half-sovereigns there was 799<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I looked for the smears the day after I noticed them, and they were removed; I think they must have been washed off with soap and water or something light, so as not to disturb the varnish—I took from the prisoner the revolver</p>

               <p>which he came out of his cabin with, after we had been round the saloon—I emptied the chambers; there were four discharged cartridges and two had been struck by the hammer but had not exploded; they were dented—I did not notice if the pistol was foul inside, and cannot say whether it had been recently discharged—the loss of the money was the subject of conversation many times; I cannot say what the prisoner said, but the substance of it was he tried to throw the blame on the second mate, Mr. Cahill—if the pistol were fired off in the steward's berth I should say most certainly it would be heard loudly in the captain's; it is a matter of 30 feet at the outside between them—this is the key the steward gave me in Port Said, it opened the steward's cabin door and the after cabin doors—I picked up two bullets in the prisoner's cabin; they were handed over to the police—they had been discharged from that pistol; they were flattened—one is buried in the deck now, I believe.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A police officer was sent down to make a sketch of the saloon while the ship was in the London Docks—I showed him over the saloon—I did not tell him any alterations had been made; nothing was altered, except the screen, and that was removed on the morning of the day of the robbery—it was a small canvas screen, put up for the captain's convenience; it came alongside the house, completely concealing the after passage-way, so far as going across the ship's deck could do so—the money could have been placed where it was found by unshipping a metal ventilator—I know the ventilator had not been unshipped—I did not inspect it specially, but I should have noticed if anything in the fittings had been tampered with—I had my eyes on it to see if I could trace anything—I believe it was screwed from the outside, and therefore it could be unscrewed from the outside—I should have noticed if it had been unscrewed—my suspicions tended towards you almost from the first—I had no one to support me in them, and I called the boatswain to me and said "Go aft, and look round the house carefully and see if you notice anything peculiar at all"—he went round, came back, and said he did not notice anything peculiar at all—I said "Go and look again, on the starboard side, aft"—he said "I cannot notice anything peculiar"—I said "You must be blind"—I went aft with him, and then I found these marks were gone, so that I have no further proof of my assertion they were there—they were invisible to the man I sent to see them—it was the following day that I took the boatswain there—I could just see the smears then—I found the ring on the morning of the robbery and handed it to the third officer—I made no report on it for this reason, although my suspicions were very strongly directed towards the steward; I did not want to do him or anybody any harm on mere suspicion, I wanted to have very certain evidence that anybody had stolen 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I with twenty-four others, might have had the suspicion rest upon us; and I said I would move heaven and earth to try to clear it up, that was one reason why I did not state it to anyone before it came before the Consul, and there I stated it fully—the captain and I suspected the second mate—I did not want to open your eyes to where my suspicions were—I do not accuse the second mate; I think you cannot deny that you are the person that fostered the suspicion—if I had stated my suspicions the matter would not have been cleared up—I made a report to Captain Miller about 4.30 on the day of the robbery—I saw the second officer with</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The log-book was here produced.</hi>) My signature is to every entry in this log-book—a witness is present who saw me give you the sweat cloths—the shipping order disclosed the value of the six cases to be 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—you handed the order to me and after that I cannot say whether the second or third mate saw it—I did not see it come on board—I kept a sovereign which you paid me in part payment of a musical box, that excited my attention—when the money was paid there was exactly a sovereign short—the money was paid me before we arrived at Port Said, but this money was not found till afterwards—I have taken no means to find out whether that sovereign was similarly marked, it has two or three marks on the edge which I thought might be done for a special purpose—contradictory statements were made, but they have been explained away—Simpson, the officer, was down one watch below, and when we questioned him he said he had only been on deck once—it appeared that he was on deck twice—he was seen the second time by a witness who has been called—he was seen in the chief engineer's easy chair, and his explanation was that he was ashamed to acknowledge that he was off the watch—he acknowledged it afterwards but did not say so at first because he did not like to admit being in the chief engineer's chair—if we had entered all the conversations in the log it would have filled half the book—the captain gave me a letter saying that I was not to allow any member of the crew to go ashore without his sanction; but on a Sunday, when the captain was lying down asleep and we did not want to disturb him, the third officer and I just took a walk on shore, and if we could not do so it would be a very hard thing—I should have acquainted the captain if he had been awake—he did think then it was a breach of discipline and commissioned me to write a letter to the third officer, without accusing me, but telling him to carry on the work pending my examination—scores of times you have openly boasted that you had got the captain under your thumb—I do not think anyone was present when you said you could not move the button—before you left Port Said I was looking to see if anything we missed was stowed away, and among other places I looked in your room again and I said "I wonder what became of the key that was reported as being missed," and the second officer said "Is this it?" taking it from his pocket—I said "I don't know, try it"—he tried it and it fitted—I said "Why did you not give it to me before?"—he said "I never thought of it"—I had searched on the Sunday but did not see it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the master of the steamship Gorji—on 28th February, about 10 p.m., the ship was on her way to Port Said, and I went on the bridge to see that all was right; I then turned in—the doors of the after cabin were open; going to my berth I could see right through the saloon—next morning, March 1st, I got up at 2 o'clock, and the doors were closed; I tried them, and found them locked on the aft side from the inside of the passage—whoever locked them must have been in the passage, that is the passage where the prisoner's cabin is—I pushed them, and they fell open; the trap was open—I heard a very loud knocking—I went on deck and called for assistance; Logsdale and several officers came—I heard the prisoner's voice coming from his cabin saying, "Let me out, the key is on the deck outside, I am locked in"—Logsdale unlocked the door, and the prisoner came out—his cabin was dark—he said, "Catch him, catch him"—I saw no person—I mustered the crew, made a search, and missed a box of specie containing 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner was acquainted with that fact—he said some one on board must have shut the door and locked him in—I said, "Why did you not get out at the window?"—he said he could not break the bars—I said, "Why did you not try the buttons?"—he said, "I did not think of that in the hurry of the moment"—if the button was turned the window could be opened; I tried it, it turned pretty easily—no one was sleeping there but the prisoner and myself—I was not aroused by any noise—I had great confidence in the prisoner; I entrusted to him the fact that I had a great sum of money on board, not the specie, but belonging to the owners, and he knew where it was—one of his duties was to look after the cabin and the keys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had every confidence in you—I had at times larger sums in my room than the amount stolen—I was away in Brussels six nights in succession, and all things under your charge were correct—after the robbery, in consequence of feeling insecure about the money in my berth, I concealed it, but showed you the place where it was—if I was on the bridge and you were asleep a person could go down to where the specie was—if I was on the deck and an officer was seen entering the saloon at an unreasonable time of night he could say that he came to see everything correct, and he would be perfectly justified—on the morning of the robbery, my door and both of my windows were open and any one could see from the deck whether I was asleep or not—I had a light in my cabin—when my suspicions as well as yours were turned to the second officer and were made known to the chief officer, Logsdale, he did not claim to suspect any one else—when I arrived on the bridge at five minutes to 2 I ordered the chief mate to call the carpenter and boatswain—my impression is that the second officer's shoes were off—when he came aft again at four o'clock and asked if we had any question to put I fancy he still had his shoes off—he was relieved from duty at four o'clock and was about to retire—he said that he heard shots—I asked him why he did not come out—he said he thought there might be a mutiny—if he had heard shots in the night and could not leave the bridge, he should have Bent some one to see what was going on—at 8 o'clock he said he thought there might have been shots, but he was not certain—the chief officer and I fired some shots in the prisoner's berth and found that they could not be heard on the bridge, there was too much noise coming from the stoke-hole—I was not awoke by any noise—I should not hear</p>

I got up and found it was gone out, I turned round to go out and came against the closed door, I found it was locked from the outside. I then suspected something and knocked at the door and fired three shots from my revolver; while I was knocking I heard the key fall out of the look, I tried to get out of my room window.

He stated that when he found himself locked into his cabin he shook the bars but found he could not break them; that the window was always very stiff during the voyage, but after the robbery the screws must have been turned with a screwdriver', as it then moved easily; having free access to the lazarette day and night he could have taken the money five minutes after it came on board, and disposed of it at Sun, where the vessel touched, and that he believed if he had been allowed to remain on board he would have recovered the money; that when at Port Said he had no idea that he was suspected. As to the sweat cloth, he got two from the mate, as it was customary to clean the paper and woodwork before the ship went home, and he left two in his cabin when he left the ship, wrapped round a musical box; that the captain had some money of his in his charge, which he returned to him at Port Said, and he added to it one English sovereign from his pocket; that he did not suspect the second officer till he said that he had spoken to him about turning the button; that the captain left the ship at Gravesend, leaving no orders to prevent his going ashore, but he remained on board and came on to London; he contended that the second officer was the guilty party.</hi>

I live at 15, Waterloo Terrace, Islington, and was steward on the steamship Manoa, which on 13th January was lying in the Royal Albert Docks—on the morning of either the 13th or 14th I had my overcoat, under coat, trousers, and cardigan jacket hanging on a nail in my cabin—these parts of my discharge, this pocket-book, and this photograph of my wife are mine, and were inside my under coat—I left the ship for a half to three-quarters of an hour, and when I came back I found my cabin door, which I had-left shut, not locked, was open—I missed my coat and trousers, the great-coat and cardigan jacket were left there—I never saw the prisoner before, I do not know him.</p>

About 4 or 5 a.m. on 27th March I stopped the prisoner leaving the Company's premises; I asked him to come into my box—I said, "I am a police officer, and have been watching you this afternoon; I saw you go on board two ships, one was the Poonah, and then try several cabin doors; have you anything about you you have no right to have?"—he said ""No"—I searched him, and on him found these keys (three are those of cabin doors and two are skeleton), a pocket-book, a photograph, and nine discharges belonging to a steward named Davy—I asked him where he got the discharges from; he said he was minding them for a friend of his—I asked him how he accounted for the keys; he said they belonged to a ship in the St. Katherine's Docks—I asked him what ship; he said I was going to take him to the station, he was not going to say—I said I must take him.</p>

                  </hi>. On 6th February I was a dresser at St. Thomas's Hospital, and assisted Mr. Frondey and Sir William McCormack in per<lb/>forming an operation on Maberley, who was put under ether; he had two scalp wounds on the left side of his head above the ear—the scalp was turned back, and I saw a small irregular puncture, not done by a sharp point, more or less triangular, half or 3/4 of an inch the longest way, and ¼ of an inch at the greatest width; that was the lower wound; it was com<lb/>pressed, compound and comminuted—in the bone of the skull there was a small puncture and a fissure an inch and a half long and curved, and between the fissure and the puncture the brain was depressed, the inner plate of the bone was splintered, the puncture went right through—the lower wound could not have been caused by a stick like this, but the higher one might—the depression might be caused by a blow from an instrument of this kind, but it is equally probable that the instrument which inflicted the puncture depressed the wound—I think the puncture might be caused by the iron tipped toe of a heavy boot—the man was not insensible when I first saw him—he continued in the hospital about six weeks, he was in danger for at least three weeks.</p>

A fracture of the skull might be a fissure or a puncture; there was no depressed bone—it could not be done by falling on a stone, unless it was very angular—he was not a heavy man and would not have fallen heavily—if he was lying on the ground and a man had done it by running over him with nails in his heels the scalp would have been crushed, which it was not, and if it was an edge which came in contact with his skull there would have been an appear<lb/>ance of grinding—I have not seen the prisoners' boots.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FRITH</hi>. The inner plate of the bone was split, and the skull entirely punctured—I do not agree with this, "the inner plate of the bone was splintered, but the skull was not entirely penetrated," because at the same spot after trepanning had been done and some part of the skull removed some splinters of bone were found—I do not consider the puncture could have been caused by this stick; splintering implies contact by force with an angular substance—I think a circular shape does not affect it, the injury was from an angular substance coming against the skull, not pointed, because a pointed instrument, to have done the damage, would have gone into the brain—splintering shows nothing but that a sharp instrument has been against the bone.</p>
