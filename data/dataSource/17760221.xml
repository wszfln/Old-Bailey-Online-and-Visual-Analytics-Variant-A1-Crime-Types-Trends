             cross examined.</p>
               <p>Whether the prisoner had any of the money? - The prisoner and Jones had the money between them: the prisoner brought some of the things in a bag, and Jones brought the rest in a handkerchief. I gave 1 l. 13 s. for the whole; I should have thought them worth five or six pounds; I took the judgment of my wife; she said 1 l. 13 s. was enough. I said to Jones, what the duce have you been about? I heard he kept a girl; I thought these might be some of her things: he said no, I had them on the mace; this I understood to be, that he got them upon credit, in what is called the swindling way. The application to me by Dignam, who attends the justices, was not till about three weeks after they brought the goods.</p>

White, that is upon it, was his mark, that the letter had gone from his office that morning, which was the same day, Saturday; Mr. White called a person out of his shop, who is here, and asked him if he remembered any thing of this letter, the person said he did remember that he took it in on the preceding evening from an elderly woman that, he believed, went of errands for the prisoners in Newgate: I then went and enquired of Mr. Akerman if there was any woman attended the gaol that answered the description, he said there was; he sent one of his people to seek for her, but they were not able to find her that evening; Mr. Akerman told me if I would come the next morning he would certainly find the woman; I went the next morning to Mr. Akerman, and the woman was produced; she told me she went of errands for Girdwood, and that she did carry a letter directed to a gentleman, whose name she had forgot; but that it was directed to Davis-street, the corner of Mount-street, Berkeley-square, and that it was written in a secretary hand, as she called it: I went to Sir

I replied I did not know: the prisoner turned his face to me, and said, Is that young man in your company? I said, No, Sir, I never saw him before: nothing farther passed till I left the house, then I came into <placeName id="t17760221-5-crimeloc26">Bow-street</placeName>

               <p>Did you and the prisoner come out together? - He walked on the other side of me with other people: as I was crossing the way he said, Sir, would not you choose something to drink after the heat of the house; I replied that it was my intention, and immediately I walked into a public house just straight before me in Bow-street, I cannot say exactly the house, I was never in it before; the prisoner came in directly after me, I called for a pint of porter, I drank what I chose of it, and asked him if he would take the rest; he said, Thank you, Sir, your good health, Sir; when he had drank the beer he set the pot down upon the table, and turned himself round to me with a kind of grin, and asked me,</p>
               <p>"What I meant by the liberties I took with</p>
               <p>"his person when we were in the playhouse?" I answered I knew of none; he replied,</p>
               <p>"D - n</p>
               <p>"you, Sir, but you did, and there were persons,</p>
               <p>"reputable merchants, in the house, will</p>
               <p>"take their oath of it:" alarmed at this, I replied I did not understand what he meant, and rose up in haste, called for the waiter, paid for the porter, and then hastened into the street: the prisoner came out directly after me, and at about eight yards distance from the public house halloo'd out.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in the public house? - Ten minutes perhaps.</p>
               <p>The prisoner came out immediately after you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By that time were the croud from the playhouse dispersed? - The people were not all come out of the playhouse, there was a great crowd coming down the street; he halloo'd out,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, Sir, stop, I'll raise a mob about</p>
               <p>"you if you offer to run;" he immediately came up to me and seized my arm, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n it, Sir, this affront is not to be put</p>
               <p>"up with, such an insult is not to be borne,</p>
               <p>"you have offered me an indignity, and nothing</p>
               <p>"can make me satisfaction:" in my fright I asked him what he wanted; what would you have me do, was another of my expressions: Do, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"why you</p>
               <p>"must make me a present;</p>
               <p>"a present of what I replied? he answered,</p>
               <p>"Come, what money</p>
               <p>"have you got about you, how much can you</p>
               <p>"give me?" I said I had but little money about me.</p>
               <p>At this time had he hold of you by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210009"/> arm? - All the time - But what I had he must take, and accordingly put my hand in my pocket and pulled out about three guineas and some silver, to the best of my remembrance, which he took from me.</p>
               <p>How much silver do you think there was? - About twelve shillings, as near as I can guess: he said,</p>
               <p>"Is this all you have?" I said it is all indeed; he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n it, Sir, this</p>
               <p>"is not enough, I must have a farther sum:" I then attempted to leave him, but he kept hold of my arm and made me stand still, which put me in much fear; I was fearful he had a design of mischief upon my person, but soon after I walked on and he walked with me, still holding me by the arm.</p>
               <p>Were the crowd there when all this passed between you? - The crowd were going by when he said he would raise a mob about me; I believe there was no crowd when he took the money; I walked across Russel-street down Bridges-street, he had me by the arm the whole time; he said on entering that street,</p>
               <p>"I believe I know you, Sir, you live twenty</p>
               <p>"miles from town; I replied I was sure he did not know me, as I never saw him before; advancing nearer to the Strand, he said to me,</p>
               <p>"Come down to the bottom of this street, Sir,</p>
               <p>"I have some friends at a coffee-house there,</p>
               <p>"and we will go and settle this affair." I told him I should not go near his friends nor with him, as I knew nothing of them nor him: I turned back and came through Vinegar-yard.</p>
               <p>Did he then let you go or keep hold of you? - I twisted out of his arm on turning back, and came through Vinegar-yard: he followed me, and in about ten or twenty yards, he took hold of me again in the way for Great Queen-street: as we were going down Queen-street, he asked me,</p>
               <p>"If I would meet</p>
               <p>"him at a coffee-house," I can't recollect the name of it, near Temple-bar; I replied I should not come to him or any of his friends; he said</p>
               <p>"D - n it, Sir; if you are not ashamed of</p>
               <p>"any thing you have done, you need not be</p>
               <p>"afraid of meeting any man:" I answered, I was not ashamed to face any man, but would not meet people I knew nothing of: he asked me just afterwards where I lived, and what was my name, which I refused to tell him; then he said,</p>
               <p>"He would see me to my lodgings," and he asked me</p>
               <p>"what time I should be out</p>
               <p>"in the morning:" I replied, it was uncertain, perhaps it might nine o'clock; he said,</p>
               <p>"Very well, I shall see you." Nothing more material passed, but being late I hastened to my lodging; he went with me to the door: it was then near twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. In all this time did you ever call out to any body to help you to get from him? - I was in such terror I had not power.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. The threat, as I understand, was that he would raise a mob on account of indecencies? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your terror was for fear of being charged with an unnatural crime? - It was.</p>
               <p>And you was afraid any body should hear what passed, as it would touch your character? - I was.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>All the transaction of his laying hold of you, and your giving him the money, was in Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might you be in Bow-street? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>People were passing and repassing the whole time you was there? - People were passing; I cannot say I observed, the whole time I was so much frightened.</p>
               <p>Did you at the time this happened, look upon it to be a robbery? - I looked upon it as money forced from me.</p>

               <p>They are for the same fact? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The next day he came to you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>From the time he took hold of you, till you got to your lodging, you did not call out to any body? - I don't remember any body passing us after we came into Queen street.</p>
               <p>How came you to remember so particularly the expressions made use of? - They made a very strong impression upon my mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210010"/>Did he pretend to have any arms about him? - No.</p>

               <p>Did he, give you any intimation of such an imputation before you went into the public-house? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him before the porter came? - Not a word; as soon as he put the pot down, he turned to me in the manner I mentioned.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in the room at that time? - I believe there were two people in a box at a distance.</p>
               <p>Did he when he spoke this to you in the house, speak loud enough to be heard by the people at a distance? - No, he did not speak loud enough for them to hear.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at the playhouse near six months ago, the prosecutor came and sat by my side, and asked me how I liked the entertainment, which was the Padlock; when I came down stairs he followed me and tap'd me on the shoulder and asked me if I would go and drink? I said I was very agreeable; we went to a public house in Bow-street, directly over the way; we staid there about three quarters of an hour; he called for the waiter and paid for the porter; I offered to pay for it, but as he asked me in, he said I should not pay for it; coming out he asked me my way home: I said I was going to Chancery-lane; he said he was glad of it, because he was going that way and would accompany me: as we were going along that part of Lincoln's-inn-fields next Holborn, he behaved very rude to me, and wanted to kiss me; I pushed him from me, and asked him what he wanted? he said he did not mean to affront me: we had not gone many yards farther before he wanted to force his hands into my breeches; I called out watch several times; he had then ran away, but hearing me repeat the call so often he was afraid he would be stopped, so he stopped and said, he was very sorry he had offered the thing to me that he did, and said, if it would be any satisfaction he would go on his knees to beg my pardon; he told me he was a gentleman living hard by, and begged I would not hurt him; that I should see where he lived, and begged I would see him home to his lodging, which he said was not far off, and if I would be so obliging to call in the morning, he would make me a present for the affront he had given me. I being poor, and not having wherewith to prosecute this man, if I had taken him up, I went to a friend and told him the affair, and asked him what I should do; he desired me as the gentleman had told me to call in such a time to go, and that he would go with me; we went at the time, which was between nine and ten o'clock, and Mr. Newman was ready to meet me below stairs; he called us into a back room, and bid me and my friend sit down; we had not spoke any thing at all then, but he went to a person in the shop and spoke to him; he came back into the back room from the shop, and said, he wished us to go along with him into the city; we went into the city, and just going up Ludgate-hill, he begged of me and my acquaintance to go to the London Coffeehouse, and that he would wait upon us in about a quarter of an hour's time or a few minutes; we went and he came there in about a quarter of an hour's time with a bit of paper and some money, as it proved afterwards, inclosed in it; he laid hold of my hand and put it in my hand, and at the same time told me, that was in token of my shewing him the friendship the night before, in not exposing him as I should have done; he gave me a 10 l. bank note, and the rest in money, to the amount of 40 l. I did not ask a farthing of him; we staid about half an hour after drinking a dish of coffee; as we were coming out he said to me, if I may rely upon your conduct, if you are in any necessity you shall never want; this was the day after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210011"/> the affair; so we parted; I know no more of the three guineas than the child unborn; he endeavoured to suck my blood like a vulture. I know nothing about it; the man that went with me is gone into the country; his name is Hopkins.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. What day was the prisoner taken up? - On the 5th of January.</p>

               <p>You saw him the next day after the affair happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any one with him the next day or with you? - There was nobody with me, there was a man with him I did not know.</p>
               <p>How came you not to take him up then? - I did not know how to act; I should have taken him afterwards when he came to my house, but I did not think I had proper authority.</p>
               <p>When did he come to your house? - On the 18th of November.</p>
               <p>Before that, had you told the story to any body? - I had intrusted a friend with it; upon the 18th of November, I got the prisoner's name, he wrote it down on a piece of paper, and I went to Sir

               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Would you have applied to any body if he had not come a second time for money upon the 18th of November? - I always had an intention to take him the first time I saw him, after I knew I had power so to do.</p>

               <p>On the 9th of this month, about a quarter before two in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my house to look at a lodging; my wife desired she would walk into a little room even with the shop; I was down in the cellar chopping wood, I came up to her; she was sitting in the little room; I saw the watch hanging there; my wife was serving in the shop at that time; she was there about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I missed my watch in about five minutes after the prisoner was gone: she agreed for the room, and desired me to go for her character to the Ship and Baker, a public house in the Borough, which she said her sister kept: I ran to the Ship and Baker, but they did not know any thing of her. She had been before to see the lodging and a man with her: I recollected that the man said he lived at No 2. Windmill-street; I went there; I enquired at the Black Bull, and found the prisoner had lived servant there; I got a direction to a public house in Bear-street, Leicester-fields, where I found the prisoner; I charged her with taking the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210016"/> watch, she denied it; I afterwards found the watch at one Wood's, a pawnbroker, at the corner of George-court, Princes-street.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner pawned a watch with me on the 9th of February, between the hours of one and four in the afternoon, in the name of Mr. Murray; she said it was her husband's property: I lent her a guinea upon it.</p>

               <p>I had been several times to the prosecutor's about the lodging; he said he could not get the people out that had it; but when he got them out I should have the room: while we were in the little room he wanted to lye with me; he said he had no money, and gave me the watch, and bid me keep it till he came and brought me some money; he never came, and so I pawned it.</p>
               <p>SMITH. No such thing passed: we were in a little room adjoining to the shop; my wife was in the shop all the time and the door was open.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a very good character.</p>

               <p>I am a bricklayer; I was concerned with the prisoner in robbing Mr. Boulton; it was on Monday night the 8th of January, about six o'clock; as near as I can remember, it was near the bason in Hyde Park we met him, as we were coming from Grosvenor-gate; I went up to him and asked him what o'clock it was, I took hold of him, and the two prisoners came up and took his watch and his money as I held him.</p>
               <p>Was that all you took? - No, we took his coat; I cannot remember much about the buckles: after we had taken his coat and watch and money, we desired him to go about his business; then we returned again towards Hyde Park corner; I pawned the coat at the corner of Derby-court, Jermyn-street, for five shillings, and Langar pawned the watch at Mr. Johnson's in the Broad-way, Westminster; I stood at the door while he pawned it; from Hyde Park we went down Piccadilly, Langar went to try to get the watch off; I met with him again at Charing-cross. Dickinson crossed the way to speak to somebody, we missed him and went and pawned the watch, and then we all met at the Bull-head in Peter's-street, Westminster; we had about seventeen shillings each.</p>
               <p>How was Langar dressed? - He had on a brown close-bodied coat, a plain hat, white<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210018"/> breeches, and I believe, a light-coloured great coat.</p>

I lost my hat in the scuffle; one of the men struck me, and told me to go the other way, and not to look back or to follow them. The shortest proposed to kill me; but the tallest, which is the prisoner, opposed it, and said it should not be done. After some time I took courage, and looked round, and saw both of them running towards Grosvenor-gate; I gave information at Sir

               <p>Upon the 9th of February in the morning, I apprehended the prisoner; he was in bed in a room with a woman; in a drawer in that room I found this seal (producing it). I asked the prisoner, if the seal was his? he said he knew nothing at all about it; but in the same drawer there were some regimental cloaths, and these the prisoner owned to be his: I have had the seal ever since.</p>
               <p>CLARK again. This is my watch and my seal. I had taken an impression of the seal four or five months before I was robbed. When Heley shewed me the seal, I said I believed it was mine, and told Heley I had an impression which I had taken from the seal, and that is the same produced. [The seal and impression were produced in court.]</p>

I first stopped the man, whilst I held him, the prisoner took his watch and money; there was a bad half crown and a six-pence amongst it, there was likewise a purse and some half-pence, and there was half a guinea and some silver in that purse. We went through Grosvenor-gate: the prisoner had possession of the watch, it was pawned opposite St. Ann's Church Soho. I stood under the wall till the prisoner came back; he had half a guinea upon the watch. I had one half guinea and the prisoner had the half guinea that was taken from the prosecutor. The prisoner had on a close-bodied brown coat, I am not certain whether he had any great coat on.</p>

I asked him what he wanted; I went out; when he got me about twenty yards he knocked me down, and took three guineas and a purse out of my pocket: as soon as he had robbed me he ran away. A man who was putting his horse in called out to know what I did there; when I got up I went to the Black Lion; I was all on a gore of blood; he cut my mouth very bad.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - I was as sober as I am now: we had two pots of beer among four of us. The prisoner was taken that night, and I saw him at the Rotation Office next day. I knew him, and immediately swore to him at the Rotation Office. Two of the companies at the Black Lion went out after him, and a coachman that is here took him; it was at the time the snow was upon the ground, and it was pretty light, but I did not see his face when we were out.</p>

               <p>What did he knock you down with? - I don't know whether he knocked me down with a stick or his fist; my own stick lay by the side of me afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did you call out? - No: it was under the dead wall; I called out, and a man asked what was the matter, and the prisoner said I would not let him go away.</p>
               <p>How long had he been in your company at the alehouse? - He went backwards and forwards, he was there till we drank two pots of beer; I cannot say how long it was.</p>
               <p>How long do you think? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>You did not resist? - I could not resist, I am an old man. I came back to the house as soon as I could; he got me by the arm and ran me along.</p>

               <p>I came to town with Mr. Cooper on the 30th of January.

As soon as they were gone out, the landlord said, Do you know any thing of that chap? I told him we knew nothing of him. I went after Mr. Cooper, and just as I was going, he came in al l over blood, and said, the man that took him out had robbed him. The landlord and others went out after him, and a little before twelve o'clock they catched him. I saw him at the watch-house after he was taken; he had shifted his cloaths, he had then lightish cloaths on; he had an old blue coat with a red cap on when he called Mr. Cooper out of the house. I saw the money the constable of the night took out of his pocket, there was eight shillings or thereabouts.</p>

Cooper immediately got up and said, he would like to see the woman, for he knew her very well. I asked the prisoner, why he did not bring the woman in, because the woman would steal? and he said, she would not come in, she was down at the wall. Mr. Cooper went out with him; he came in again, and said he was knocked down. He asked me, if I did not know the man? I said I did, because I knew him in his apprenticeship. He said he would give any body ten pounds to take him; I said, I would go, if any body would go with me, and seek him; we could not find him for two hours; when we were out in Gray's inn-lane, we saw two lads, who said he was in a house; they took him in Gray's-inn-lane a little after that.</p>

               <p>Did you observe whether there were any carriages passing, or people walking at that time? - There were a great many people walking, but not any carriages.</p>
               <p>Had your servant a stambeau? - Yes; he desired the servant to hold it on the other side of the coach.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect how he was dressed? - He had a light-coloured loose great coat on, and his hat was slapped.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to be a thin man or a fattish man? - Neither one nor the other.</p>
               <p>Had he his own hair or a wig? - I could not distinguish that.</p>
               <p>Was his mask, or whatever it was, over his face only or over his head? - It was not over his head; it seemed to be only over the lower part of his face.</p>
               <p>On which side of the square was it? - The north side.</p>
               <p>Did you see which way he went off? - We were going to Upper Grosvenor-street, he went the contrary way.</p>

He lay upon the floor without any thing under him or upon him, afterwards he had straw: he was removed up stairs the Friday before he died; I never heard him ask his master for a bed; when he was moved up stairs, he was moved into a back room, and there was a little grate and a fire-place there, and the same bag of straw that he had had for the last part of his time below stairs, was carried up stairs for him to lie upon, and a great coat to cover him; when he first got up stairs, he sat himself down in a chair by the fire, and then crawled into the bed; I carried him water-gruel and broth, and the day before he died, I carried him a bit of backed veal, which he ate; he had frequently tea and bread and butter; he groaned almost continually, till he died; my master locked him in: about three in the morning, on the Saturday before he died, he called for water, my master got up and gave him some; Mr. Day called my master up; he was locked in, and my master always locked the door and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210034"/> kept the key; I believe it was that no body should go in to give him any thing, when he came down he told my mistress, he had given the nasty dog a good kick.</p>

The Sunday night before he died, he was brought down into the shop again by Mr. Griffiths, who is brother to the prisoner's wife, and by the prisoner himself; he brought down the bag and straw too, because he groaned so much that he disturbed a woman who was lying-in in the next chamber; when Griffiths and my master brought him down, my master scolded him for groaning: there was a little fire in the shop when he was brought down; there always was in the day-time a fire, it was not a cold place; the deceased lay in the shop till Monday morning nine o'clock, and then Griffiths and my master carried him up stairs again: I got up about four in the morning, in order to let my master and Mr. Griffiths out, for Mr. Griffiths was going in the coach to Wells; when they came to the in the coach was gone, and my master and Mr. Griffiths came back again: about nine in the morning when the deceased was sent up stairs again, I was ordered to bring the bag and straw up again in order to lay him above stairs in the manner before: I made a fire for him, and gave him some tea and bread and butter, but he could not eat it: this was the Monday morning before he died: I was sent then to the hospital with a galley-pot, when I returned the deceased was dead.</p>

I came in and found the boy was dead; my master said, he would have a jovial burying of it, and would get drunk upon it; there was no body by when these words were spoke, but my master and Mr. Griffiths, and he said he would buy a coffin and bury him on Tuesday night; then Mr. Fryer rushed in, and insisted upon seeing the body of the deceased, and said, if any body touched him, he would put them all in Newgate. Mr. Evans laid him out: my master knew of his sore legs as soon as he came from Bridewell. Upon Monday the 15th of January there were some plaisters put on his legs, which Mr. Fryer had got from a surgeon: on Sunday the 14th of January my master sent him up into a back garrett, there he cried for cold, and then Mr. Fryer took him into his garret, made fire, and Mrs. Fryer made him some tea and toast; he staid there till the evening, then my master was angry, and sent me and the man to fetch him down; we fetched him down and he was laid in the shop; my master went about to several people to get letters to get him into the hospital; the deceased could not walk at all when he came from Bridewell; he had some meat two or three times; one time he asked for some supper and my master gave him some bread and cheese; he had his cloaths on when he died: it was a warmish shop, but when the boy lay there he had nothing to lay over him; as for myself I had a blanket, a sheet, and a little mattrass.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness. We lie in a two pair of stairs room, and we have a sore-garret in the prisoner's house. While I was a-bed, on the 14th January, I heard somebody go up stairs about seven in the morning, and come down again: I cannot tell who it was; but I thought I heard Self's voice in the back garret. I heard the boy crying, and I thought I heard Self say, you shall not lie down, for I shall find it out, and will lick you. My husband got up first; for we were both in bed at that time; we heard people going up and coming down stairs. I went up and saw the deceased sitting by the fire in my garret; I asked, how his stockings came to be wet? he said he had been out into the yard in the snow, and his feet got wet: I carried him some tea and bread and butter, which he eat and drank heartily. He asked for some meat: he said his master had never given him any meat since he came from Bridewell, but only water gruel and broth. I carried him some pork and some two-penny. He said, he had had nothing but bread and water in Bridewell, and had lain upon the boards there, and since he came home he had never had his cloaths off, and had no bed to lie upon in the shop. Mr. Park the apothecary's man came to visit me that day; I desired him to send him some plaisters, which he did the same evening. I looked upon his legs; there was a little blister upon one knee, and upon his other leg a large blister, and in pulling down his stockings the stockings had eat in and they tore his flesh away. Self came up in the afternoon and brought him some broth. I said, that was not a time to bring the boy his dinner, for he was very ill, and I had taken care he should have his belly full before that time. His master said, I don't know, I believe he is lazy, though, I dare say, he will eat every drop; and he did eat up all. I told Self of the boy's blisters, and shewed them to him, and I bid him put him into a bed, or he would die. Self said he could not do that, for the boy was lousy; but he would endeavour to get him into the hospital as soon as possible. I told Self I had sent for plaisters to a doctor, and if he would leave the boy with me, I would put him into bed, and dress his legs. He seemed very angry at that, and went down stairs; the deceased begged of me that he might not go down stairs; but after Self and Griffiths were gone down, the journeyman and the apprentice were sent up for him; this was about half after five. I carried the plaisters that night to Self, and desired they might be applied to his legs. I heard him groan upon Sunday the 21st, but never saw him after this Sunday till he died.</p>

I opened the body of the deceased: his principal disorder was in his heels occasioned by the kibes, and the severity of the weather, which numbers of his age were at that time and are still subject to; there are numbers that are not yet well. His feet were quite ulcerated, and the toes quite mortified.</p>
               <p>What do you think these ulcers in the ancles proceeded from? - I am persuaded from the severity of the weather, what is commonly called kibes and chillblains.</p>
               <p>From chillblains ill managed? - Yes, or more likely not managed at all.</p>
               <p>Were there any sores upon his shoulders? - There was a slight bruise.</p>
               <p>What did that proceed from? - It might be from lying hard, or any accident; but the bruise upon his shoulder did not appear to me to be the least dangerous, or any thing connected with his death. Upon opening him I found nourishment in his stomach and bowels near as much as I should have expected in one in his condition. When a mortification begins we generally suppose it prevents people from eating. I don't think he was starved to death; his flesh was much emaciated, but that must be the case from the mortification.</p>
               <p>You have heard the whole evidence that has been given; now taking this lad in the condition<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210036"/> he is proved to have been in when he came home from Bridewell, supposing due and proper care had been taken of him, and proper food had been given him, Do you believe, from the judgment that you form upon the whole of the evidence, that he might have been recovered? - Most probably; but there is no certainty, for it depends upon how far the disease was gone before he came from Bridewell. Upon the whole, it appears to me to have begun in Bridewell; it would increase faster in Bridewell than it would after he came home, because his food at Bridewell was bread and water, which would greatly emaciate his blood, and he lay in a room upon the floor where there had been no fire, whereas after he came home, though he had no bed to lie upon, yet he lay in what the apprentice calls a warmish room, in which there was always a fire kept in the day-time, and after he came home he certainly had a better diet than he had in Bridewell; suffering him to keep his worsted stockings on must have contributed very much to the increase of his disorder; I think his death was occasioned probably by his ill treatment both in Bridewell and after he came home. This disorder has been very frequent upon account of the hard weather; I have had a number of patients under my care, and not one who has been properly treated has died; but if any one of those I attended had lain but a single night in a garret or Bridewell, they might have been frost bitten, which might have brought on a mortification, and they might have died. I think the whole blood of this boy might be emaciated; the blood might have been made so thin by feeding upon bread and water, and lying in Bridewell, that he never could recover afterwards. Mr. Self was so solicitous for the preservation of this boy, that he did not only come once, but a week before the boy died, and desired I would get a letter to get the boy into the Middlesex hospital. I said I could not get him an in-patient, because I reserved my letter of recommendation for some body else; but could get him admitted an out-patient. He said the boy could not walk; when he said the boy was lame, I did not tell him that there was any danger in the disorder; he did not ask me to come and see the boy.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Park the apothecary. I was present at the opening of the body; I agree with Mr. Spence as to every thing relating to the appearance of the body of the boy. I was with Mrs. Fryer on the 14th of January; she asked me to go up to the garret and see the deceased; he was then sitting before her fire; he pulled down each stocking, and there was a large blister upon each of his legs. I did not pull off his stockings, for his feet smelt very offensively, and his legs were much swelled; there was no care taken of him, so that his stocking struck to his skin, and the stockings were eat into his legs. Mrs. Fryer desired me to send him some plaisters, which I did. After he was laid out there were no appearance of plaisters having been put on his legs.</p>

             M'CONNELLY sworn. I am servant to Mr. Self; I came there three days before the boy returned from Bridewell. He was very bad, he had water-gruel and bread twice that day, and mutton broth once or twice. It was Mrs. Self gave the orders to fetch the boy down upon the 14th of January. Mrs. Fryer asked me to help him down; I said he had gone up, and could come down.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The boy had been very bad and wicked: I thought I had a right to break him of these tricks, which were robbing me and several other people; I never struck him all the time he was with me. I sent him of an errand on Tuesday, and he ran away, and did not return till Saturday. When he came from Bridewell he was very bad, I gave him necessaries; I thought he had got the goal distemper, that was the reason I did not let him go to bed; I had no design to hurt him; I tried all I could to get him into the hospital. Moss had the itch when he came to me first, he gave us the itch, which with difficulty we were cured of; I was afraid I should get some bad distemper from the deceased, as I had before done.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who said they never saw him behave ill to his apprentices, and that he always bore a good character.</p>

               <p>About six or seven weeks ago I met with Whitlow; he asked me if I would agree to rob my master's house with him and Stevens; I agreed to it; and at first it was proposed that I should let them know when my master and mistress were out; two pistols were bought, and they were to come and ring at the bell, and put the maid and me in fear, and rob the house of the money and plate; and they were to leave us tied. A long time passed and no opportunity happening, it was agreed they should break in at the compting-house window last Sunday was se'nnight, and break open the desk. There are two bolts to the shutter, they bid me leave the upper bolt undone, and bolt the bottom bolt, and that they would break open the shutter and lift up the bottom bolt; they came on the Sunday night and broke in; I was on the outside of the wall, and helped Stevens over the wall; they broke open the window, and broke the clerk's desk open; and they came again a second time, I was then in the kitchen, which is right over the counting-house: they told me on the Monday, that there was but six guineas good; they took away the desk and carried it into the church; they said they got back again over the wall by means of a little ladder they had; that when they got over the wall the first time, it was about seven o'clock; that when they got over the second time, it was about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>WHITLOW's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I have a barge called the Ord; it lay on the 16th of February at Arundel-stairs: Chamberlayne has served me a year and a half constantly, and the other prisoners occasionally; Chamberlayne was in my service at this time, Fieldhouse was not; I don't know what was in the barge.</p>

               <p>I had coals in this barge; it was impossible to miss them.</p>
               <p>To ELWOOD. In consequence of the information you had, you went to Foreman's house? - Yes; he said Chamberlayne used his shop; that he knew he was a coal porter, and asked him the price of coals; that he told him coals were thirty-six shillings a chaldron,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177602210042"/> and he ordered him to bring him a chaldron, which he was to do in the morning, but he neglected doing it till night; he said he gave nine shillings for the three sacks; I believe he gave the full value; he went very readily before the magistrate: from the character I heard of him, I would not have prosecuted him if I had not been bound over.</p>

               <p>I live with Mrs. Cook: on Monday the 12th of February, between two and five o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to see some printed linens; I shewed her several patterns, she said they were not the patterns she wanted; there were several things on the compter at the time; I had some suspicion of her taking something, because she shook her petticoats: a woman came into the shop just before the prisoner went out; when the prisoner was gone out that woman said, she saw her put something under her petticoats; I went after the prisoner and brought her back; I said I wanted to speak to her in the next room; she was not willing to go in; as I was pushing her into the room, she let fall this piece of printed cotton upon my shoes; I did not see it fall, because I was close to her; I stooped and picked it up; I said, that was what I wanted; then she wanted to go: I said, she must not; I took her into the parlour, and she offered me two guineas for the piece of print she had taken to let her go: I sent for a constable, who took her into custody. [The cotton was produced in court and deposed to.] I am sure the cotton was on the compter when she came in.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker: I took these stockings in pawn of the prisoner, between ten and eleven on Thursday morning; I lent her two shillings on them; she pawned them in her own name: she has pawned many things for people, and fetched them out very honestly.</p>

               <p>I went to the prosecutor, to see if she wanted me; she asked me to light the fire and put the kettle on for her; when I had done that, she gave me these stockings, and desired me to pawn them for eighteen-pence, or two shillings; I went and pawned them, and fetched her a quartern of gin, and then she desired me to fetch a quartern of brandy and put it under the bed; I did, and when her husband wanted the stockings she denied it; they were both in bed, and he was asleep at the time.</p>
