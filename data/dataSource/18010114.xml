               <p>Q. Did he present any thing? - A. Yes; he presented a pistol to my friend's breast, it appeared to be a short thick pistol, but being dark, I cannot be particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Neither of you were armed? - A. We had a gun in the chaise, but we made no resistance; Mr. Lifford gave him two half-guineas, and a guinea, I believe, I did not see the money; he did not seem satisfied with that, and I gave him a purse, containing a guinea, one or two half-guineas, I am not certain which, a seven shilling piece in gold, and some silver; he then demanded our pocket-books, we told him we had none; he pressed us very hard, and I said, d-n you, cannot you believe us, we told you before, we had not; he then demanded our watches; he took from me a double case metal watch, a steel chain and a metal key, there was no seal to it; I had had it twelve or fourteen years; I described it at Bow-street, before I saw the watch; he then took my friend by the hand, and said, God bless you, I have got a wife and family, and then rode off towards Acton; we were not more than forty yards from the White-horse inn, we intended to drink tea there, and we told them we had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout was it that you were stopped? - A. Near the three mile stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ride off pretty quick? - A. Yes; the man that keeps the White-horse, said, the Bow-street officers had been there the night before, and he expected them there again; they came in the course of a quarter of an hour or ten minutes afterwards, they separated and went away; I told them the maker's name on the watch was Watson; this was on the Tuesday; on the Saturday following, I went to Bow-street, I described the watch, and then it was produced to me, and I swore to it, it had the chain and the key exactly as I lost it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not describe the man as riding upon a dark horse? - A. Yes; I said, I believed it was a dark coloured horse, but it was impossible to see the colour of the horse it was so dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that you thought the man was a bigger man than me? - A. No, I did not say so; I said, I could not swear to the man, neither can I now.</p>

Only the watch; Mr. Thackthwaite described it; he said, there was the name of Watson on the watch, the number he could no tell, but there was a small dent at the bottom; he said, it was a metal watch with a steel chain; the conductor of the patrole, Creedland, sent me and another man away to Hammersmith turnpike-gate; we got there something before seven o'clock, and remained there till twelve; I was then in the toll-house, and my comrade was looking out.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the last up in the house the night before? - A. I was; I fastened up the place as usual, it was all very safe when I left it; I was up first in the morning; the prisoner was taken to the watch-house before I was alarmed; my husband saw the prisoner at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why is not he here? - A. He did not know that the trial would come on to night; I saw some of the things at the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. But with the prisoner's father? - A. We had some words about a year ago, because he sold milk, and so did I, and he wanted my landlord not to let me have the house I now live in.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard that the prisoner stands here to answer with his life for the charge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say, you know there is such a thing as a forty pound reward? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard, that if a person is convicted of breaking open a house in the night, the party prosecuting is entitled to a forty pound reward? - A. I don't know any thing about the law.</p>

I went with Jones to search the prisoner's house in New-inn-yard, on Friday the 28th of November; I went up two pair of stairs, the prisoner was there, he seemed rather frightened, and Mr. Jones told him we came there to search his lodgings; he said, we should not search the lodgings, without a search-warrant; and I stopped there; while he was gone, the prisoner was very busy in the back-room; I was in the front-room, and he was in the back-room, shut in; I heard him throwing the things about; I called to him, and begged he would not spoil any thing; I looked through the key-hole, and saw him very busy, his body was partly out at the window, and he threw something out; when Mr. Jones came back, I went into the room, and found in his pocket some shaving cakes, and two or three wash-balls, and these keys; the next day, I went to a house, in Risdon's-buildings, one of these keys opened the street-door, and another the two pair of stairs room door, where we found a great quantity of property, which is here; I went into the kitchen of the house, in New-innyard, and in a little place, parted off from the kitchen, I found a blanket, containing a quantity of starch, hair-powder, and other things; we took the prisoner and the goods to the office.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. My brother is the proprietor of Risdon's-buildings, I collect his rents; the prisoner at the bar took a house there, in the month of October, it was a new house, not quite finished; when he took it, it had never been inhabited; he spoke to me several times about a window being put in backwards, he had the key about the 12th or 13th of November.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Jones.) Q. Look at those shaving cakes? - A. These are my property, they have my stamp upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell any of those articles to the prisoner? - A. No; these wash-balls are finished, but they are of my manufacture; some of these puffs have my private mark, in my wife's handwriting; and these bottles of essence are tied together, by my niece, with one piece of leather, and comes from my shop; this starch has no mark, but it corresponds with the sample that I have got;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140008"/>here are seventy-five pounds weight of wash-balls, almost all unfinished, they are of my manufacture; almost every manufacturer weighs the soap of a different weight, and they are cut differently; I have cut one of them, and from the inside I am able to swear that they are of my manufactory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell to the prisoner any unfinished wash-balls? - A. I never in my life sold any unfinished wash-balls; there is one ball among them, that we never sold a dozen of; these tin pomatum moulds I know particularly by the sizes, they are made on purpose for me; the size of every manufacturer differs a little, so that we may know them; this engine for polishing wash-balls, I can swear to, it is tipped round with brass, by particular direction, it was made on purpose for me, they are generally tipped with iron; here is a mark upon one of the boxes, in the hand-writing of one of my servants, it is the tare of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. These cakes, you say, are of your manufactory? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner works in your manufactory, and therefore knew how to manufacture like you? - A. He never manufactured any of these articles to my knowledge; he was a foreman in making hard soap.</p>

               <p>Q. As to this box, might it not have been sent out with goods? - A. No, I have made enquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. Being in your manufactory, he must have had the opportunity of seeing how these things were manufactured? - A. By chance, but it was in a different room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. These shaving cakes had your stamp? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had nothing to do with the persumery part of your business? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he making little or much? - A. It was in a pan.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Was he making or finishing wash-balls? - A. He was making them, rolling bits of soap in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before your house was searched? - A. It might be two or three weeks, for he gave me a little bit of pomatum.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was the pan? - A. It might hold two or three quarts; I did not take any particular notice, I was not long in the room.</p>

               <p>Q. This was when the officer was in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see him bring in any quantity of these things? - A. No; I keep a school, and my door is always open.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a link-boy attending Drury-lane Theatre: On the 2d of December, at night, I saw the prisoner throw the watch out of his hand, at the corner of Brydges-street; there was another link-boy before Mr. Welch, to get a coach for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140009"/>him, and I saw this man take the watch out of Mr. Welch's fob; Mr. Welch immediately laid hold of him, and I saw him drop it; I picked up the watch-case, which had fell off, and immediately it was snatched out of my hand; I cannot say by whom.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you been a link-boy? - A. A twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other occupation? - A. No; only doing any thing I can do.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it, you went before the Magistrate the next day? - A. No, I did not know till the officers came to my lodgings at eleven o'clock at night; I did not know that it was necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not go across to the watch-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with any of the officers about this transaction? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever told that this was an offence which might be a highway robbery, and there would be a reward of forty pounds? - A. No; I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear of such a thing? - A. I heard it was a highway robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear that there was a reward of forty pounds, upon conviction? - A. I cannot say that I never heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you never heard of a reward of forty pounds upon conviction? - A. I may have heard of it, but I cannot swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in custody yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were committed, and have been kept in custody ever since? - A. No; I was in custody last Sessions for three days, but not since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You were in custody three days to give evidence; you were not charged with this offence? - A. No; to give evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming from Covent-garden Theatre; it broke up about half past eleven; in my way home, I came down Russel-street, Covent-garden; there was a very great throng of coaches, and gentlemen and ladies; I crossed over to the corner of Brydges-street and Russel-street; the moment I crossed over there, Captain Welch, as he described himself, came up, and clasped me round, and said, I had got his watch; I said, recollect yourself, Sir, search me, and see if I have got it about me; a gentleman of Bow-street came up, and took me in charge; they took my watch and my purse from me; there was nothing found upon me; Thompson, the Bow-street man, said, I heard a link-boy say that he picked up a watchcase; the next day I was taken to Bow-street, and Mr. Ford said he would not send it to a Jury without this link-boy was found; he was brought on the Thursday, and then he never said one word about seeing me take the watch; but he has been well tutored by the Bow-street people; I am innocent of the charge. <rs id="t18010114-6-verdict31" type="verdictDescription">

They were loose when he pulled them out; I asked him if it was customary with him to carry gold in his coat pocket, and he said, he frequently did; a constable then came up, and I delivered him into his hands; I called a porter whom I saw, and, with the constable, we lodged them in the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this poor black the appearance of being intoxicated? - A. Not at all; he was perfectly collected and perfectly soher.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did it not take up a considerable time in the pursuit? - A. I should suppose about three minutes, in the way that I have described.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, of course, during that time, you must have lost sight of them? - A. I never lost sight of them one moment.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the foreigner being drunk, did you look at him for the purpose of ascertaining whether he was or not? - A. He did not speak such good English as he does now; he seemed to me to understand but little of the English language; he seemed to me to give a very lame account in point of language; the interpreter was sworn before the Lord-Mayor, and he gave the account.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in Court, and, I sure say, was a little surprised at his giving his account so well? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Riggins at liberty at all? - A. Yes, he was at liberty in the crowd for two or three moments; the person who had hold of him let him go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Have you any doubt that Riggins is the same man? - A. I am perfectly satisfied that he is the same man; I begged that he might not be let go, and he was not out of the crowd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Price. Q. Was not the money taken out of my pocket before the black said what he had lost, and then he said that is my money? - A. No, he said he had lost four guineas and a sixpence, before it was found in his pocket.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I belong to the India-house: On the 1st of December I came up and saw Mr. Walker, who had hold of the prisoner Price by his left arm; Price was endeavouring to get his right hand into his right hand pocket; Mr. Walker called to me to come on that side and put my hand in his pocket; I put my hand in his pocket, and felt the money, which was entangled with some soft substance; I disengaged it, and brought out four guineas and a sixpence; before that, the black man said, this man has robbed me of four guineas and a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was entangled in some soft substance; had you the curiosity to enquire what it was? - A. The constable searched, but I saw nothing found, except a pocket handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This money was taken out of his pocket loose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this soft substance was a pocket-handkerchief? - A. The constable has several things that he took out of his pocket; he can speak best to that; I did not see any thing else.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else upon him that is material? - A. No; I received the money from Mr. Bland. (Produces it.)</p>

I was at liberty, I suppose, three or four minutes, and might have run away; I was coming past the corner of Birchin-lane, and there were seven or eight black men together, all very much intoxicated, and one of them was using another very ill; and I saw the prisoner leading that black man along; he was either very ill, or else his feet very sore; I went on about my business, and Mr. Walker followed me; I never saw Price before in my life.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Price called one, and Riggins three witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am brother of the last witness: I was with my brother when he bought these pigs at Rumford, and have seen them many times since; in consequence of information, I went to Lambeth-street Police-office, and got a warrant; I went with Smith, and the two Griffiths's, to Ramshire's house, the sign of the Children in the Wood, in Whitechapel-road; as soon as we went into the kitchen, we saw the three pigs hang up in the coal-hole; the door was open; I have no doubt but they were my brother's pigs; I have seen them a number of times; the officers then sent for Ramshire, and he came down stairs; Smith and Griffiths told him they had had information of three pigs, which they believed were the same that hung up there, and they wished him to produce them the men, or tell where they could find them; he told them he was not there; he had been gone out some time, but as soon as he came in, he would shew them the man; I then told him, that from the information I had had not ten minutes before, the man was in the house; he said he was not, and he did not know what time he would come in; the officers, Smith and Griffiths, then told him they should keep him till such time as he found the man; we sat down in the kitchen, all three of us together, and in a little time the bell rung, and he wanted to go up stairs to his customers; the officers told him he could not go, he must send somebody else; he ordered his wife to go; in the mean time there came a person to the bar for some gin; the bar was adjoining the kitchen; he went into the bar to serve the gin, and I went and looked at the pigs; I took off the sheets, and found that the heads were not scalded; there were all the black hairs round the eyes, some as broad as your hand, and some half as broad, which was very remarkable; while I was in the coal-hole, I heard somebody coming down stairs; I came out, and saw some men coming down stairs; Griffiths, who stood by the bar where Ramshire was, said, are any of those he; he made no reply, till all the men were gone; there were six of them; he said one of them was the man; one of the officers went out directly, but it was so excessively dark, that he returned again; he asked Ramshire if he could tell him what the man's name was, that he might apprehend him; he said, he did not know what his name was; he had been backwards and forwards there for a fortnight; nothing more past; I went and got a coach, and put the pigs in.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt upon earth that these were your brother's pigs? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. From the appearance of the pigs, without any other circumstance? - A. From the marks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This coal-cellar, as you call it, was not it a wash-house, with a few coals deposited? - A. I dare say there were ten childrons of coals there, and butts of beer on each side.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not a room, through which there was a passage, with windows in it? - A. I cannot say, it was dark then.</p>
               <p>Q. They had had full time and opportunity to have scalded the heads, as well as the bodies? - A. Yes, they might.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you got into the house, you saw the pigs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean, as soon as you got into the house, or as soon as you got into the kitchen? - A. As soon as I got into the kitchen; as soon as you go in at the door, there is the kitchen.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street; I went in company with Smith and Hanson to the Children in the Wood, which is Ramshire's house; we went into the house, and there was the kitchen, and when we went into the kitchen, there was a place with a quantity of coals in, and in that room were three pigs hanging with cloths over them; we sent for Ramshire; he came down stairs; we then took him backwards, and shewed him the hogs; I asked him if he knew any thing of these hogs coming there, as they had been stolen; he said, a man had brought them there; we desired him to point out the man, if the man was in the house; he said the man had been there, but was gone out; I asked him how long he thought it would be before he came in, and we would wait; he said, it might be late before he came in, or it might be the morning; soon after, he went into the bar to serve a glass of gin; there were five or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140015"/>six men came down the stairs which he had come down before; we asked him then if either of there was the man; he made no answer to that, but as the prisoner Brookes had the door in his hand, going out of the passage, I pressed him again, and asked if that was the man; he nodded his head to me, and spoke slowly that that was the man; I immediately followed him out into the passage, but it was so dark, I could not find him.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had told you at once that that was the man, should you have had any difficulty in apprehending him? - A. None at all; I was close by him; I then returned in doors, told him he had behaved very ill, and we should take him into custody; Smith tied his hands; Mr. Hanson looked at the pigs, and said they were his brother's; he put them into a coach, and took them to Lambeth-street: On Sunday the 14th, the next day, in company with Smith, we apprehended Brookes in Darkhouse-lane, Billingsgate; I asked him how he came by those hogs that were at Ramshire's; he told me he had bought them of a man at Bow-bridge on the Saturday morning about four o'clock; I asked him if he knew the man; he said, no; I asked him what he was to give for the three hogs; he said he was to give three guineas and a half for each hog, that was ten guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he was to give that, or had given it? - A. Yes, was to give.</p>
               <p>Q. And that, after he had said he did not know the man? - A. Yes; I asked him, did he pay for them; he said no, he had not, that the man was to come up on Sunday evening for his money, when he had sold them; I then asked him if Ramshire was to have the three hogs; he said no, he was to have one of them for some money that he owed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you told my Lord and the Jury all that passed? - A. All that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps I may remind you; how did you get to apprehend Brookes? - A. Smith can tell you that; I cannot.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am collector of the toll at Mile-end-turnpike: On Saturday morning the 13th of December, between three and five in the morning; I cannot speak to the hour; I saw three whitish hogs come through the gate, towards London, there was only one person with them; he paid the toll, but who that person was, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Griffiths. I asked Brookes what time he came through the gate, he answered, about five in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this turnpike from Bow? - A. Two miles.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from Ramshire's? - A. About four hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hill.) Did you see any blood about the cellar or place? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise of the hogs? -- A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no signs of their having been killed there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hanson.) What observation did you make upon the manner in which they were killed? - A. They were killed in a very bad way, they had knocked them on the head, and stuck them in several places.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you suppose they were knocked on the head? - A. Because, when the head was opened, the blood was settled.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual to kill them by knocking them on the head? - A. Not pigs of that size.</p>
               <p>Brookes's defence. This man is innocent of the crime, I have nothing to say for myself.</p>
               <p>Ramshire's defence. I wish to have my witnesses called. For the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they in a place of concealment? - A. Any person going to the bar might have seen one of them, as the door opened, they could not see them all.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they covered with any thing? - A. They had a white cloth round them, it might be a sheet, my friend seemed to signify, that he should like a quarter of one of them, but he said they were not his, and he could not sell them.</p>

               <p>Q. He is a witness against you; is he not? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it happened to you, I do not impute it to you as a crime, we are all unfortunate at times, but has it happened to you to be a bankrupt? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And your property assigned over to assigness? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any dividend been made? - A. Yes, two.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your certificate yet? - A. It is not quite ready, yet it is very near; but there was a sale of my goods, at which they permitted me to re-purchase these, and other articles.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner sometimes worked for you, and sometimes for Longland? - A. He worked for Longland previous to his working for me, when my work became slack; he rented a forge in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not done some small jobs for you on his own account? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always considered him, till this, as a very honest man? - A. I had a very high opinion of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you lent him tools, in the course of your business? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know these things were taken in execution by the sheriff? - A. No; he sold them after the sale.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you been much upon your premises since your bankruptcy? - A. Yes; I have lived there ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not lent this man the very tools in question? - A. I have, but they were brought back and used; I have taken great pleasure in assisting the man, and am sorry to be under the necessity of appearing against him.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you able to say what man that was? - A. That man was the prisoner Riley; he then appeared very differently to what he does now, he was dirty, and had a very different appearance.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But notwithstanding the difference, are you able to say that he is the man? - A. I am sure that Riley opened the door first; before I had time to make any answer, the other door was opened by another man, which was this unfortunate man, Nutts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You are equally sure that it was Nutts who opened the second door? - A. Yes; the prisoner at the bar, Nutts, who also presented a pistol, he had a light-coloured great coat on.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sort of light was it? - A. I should suppose it to be a very short time before the rising of the moon, which enabled me to see them so distinctly; Nutts was the man who came up first to the horses' heads; he then came and opened the other door of the chaise, as I have described: finding myself in this unpleasant situation, and having no weapon of defence, I thought it prudent to comply with their demands; I said, have patience, do not ill-treat or abuse me, and I will give you what money I have; I immediately put my hand to my pocket, and gave him my loose money, which was three seven-shilling pieces, a half guinea, a half-crown, and some silver, I cannot say how much; among the silver I gave him a shilling, upon which were letters stamped, which I had previously by accident taken notice of, I gave it to the prisoner Riley, who was on my right hand; Riley then demanded my pocket-book, I told him I had none; Nutts said, your Bank-notes; I answered, I had none; then putting his hand upon my thigh, and feeling some papers in my pocket, he said, what is this; I answered, only papers, of no consequence to you; he said, I must see, and, taking hold of the skirt of my coat, he said, turn round, I cannot get at your pocket, at the same time making use of some vulgar expressions, which are unnecessary to state; I said, stop, sir, let me out, and then I will give you leave to search me; at the same instant Riley demanded my watch; on refusing to give it to him, he immediately jumped into the chaise; Nutts got closer to me, and began to rifle my pockets, each of them were rifling my pockets at the same time, but Riley was entirely in the chaise; the third man at this time came to the door behind Riley, he having got into the chaise, and took out a bundle of wearing-apparel that I had on the chaise-seat by my side; Riley might have taken it out, I will not swear, but it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140023"/>at that time taken out; Riley then cried out, take care of the post-boy; this third man, I believe, put his hand into my right hand breeches pocket, and took out several Bank-notes previous to his leaving the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know that man again? - A. No; being so occupied with Nutts and Riley, I should not know the other man, and he being behind Riley, I again desired they would let me out; one of them said, no, where is your pocket-book, and your watch; I told them I had neither one nor the other; they, however, continued searching me; I told them they had got every thing I had, and as they had got all my money, to go about their business quietly, and, after searching round the inside of the chaise, they got out; upon the first alarm, I had availed myself of that opportunity of taking out my watch, which I had an intention of concealing, together with the notes, which I had in my other pocket; but before I had time to do either, the doors were opened as I have described; I kept the watch in my hand the whole time; my watch, therefore was saved; when Nutts had got off the step, I observed a letter which he had taken out of my coat pocket; I recollected that, besides the money it contained, it was of the utmost importance, in my opinion, to be delivered to the person, a friend of mine, to whom it was addressed; I pressed him very much to return it to me; I assured him it was of no sort of consequence to him, but that it was very material to the nobleman to whom it was addressed, to have it that night by the mail, desiring, if he doubted what I said, he had only to look to the superscription of the letter, or open it, if he pleased, that he would then be convinced; he pulled it out of his bosom, drew back a little from the door of the chaise, and held it up, and, after satisfying himself, he returned it; I immediately turned round to the other two men, who, with the notes, had taken several papers out of my pocket, and having made much the same observations with respect to those papers, that they were of no use to them, and if they did not return them, they would probably suffer severely for it, one of them immediately came to the chaise, and, putting his hand under the seat, said, where is your portmanteau; I told him I had none; he then began to feel about the cushion, I pushed his hand away, and said, you have got my money, you have got all that I have, be gone about your business, unfortunate men, I do not with to hurt you, or to that effect; they then retired, and I went back to the Adam and Eve public-house, at Hayes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this transaction have consumed? - A. I should think not less than ten minutes, perhaps more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they make any attempt at all to conceal their faces? - A. No, they had handkerchiefs on, which were up to their chins, but Nutts, holding up the letter to look at it, I discovered his countenance perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the Adam and 
               <persName id="t18010114-22-person247">Eve</persName>
             that you were robbed? - A. From what I saw after, it must be but a very short distance, I did not notice the public-house as I passed it before, I endeavoured to get assistance; I got to the public-house within a quarter of an hour, and offered twenty guineas to persons that were there, to assist in apprehending the men; some little time passed in that way, and I went on to Uxbridge; some time elapsed there also with the same endeavours, in vain; I left Uxbridge about a mile and a half, when a boy came after me, in consequence of which I returned to the public-house, where I met a person of the name of Nibbs; the constable of the place; he took me into the tap-room, which at that time was very full; I asked were the robbers were; not being answered, I turned round, and looked at some persons that were sitting upon the circular bench near the fire; I looked round, and examined their countenances very minutely, and, fixing my eyes upon the prisoner Nutts, I said, as nearly as I can recollect, well, sir, what have you to say for yourself?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time recognize having seen him before? - A. I certainly did, as being one who stopped the carriage; he replied, say, sir, I did not speak; I said, no, sir, but I shall speak to you, you are the man who stopped the chaise, and came to me; immediately after he denied my ever having seen him before; I told him it was in vain for him to deny it, for I knew him perfectly, or words to that effect; Riley, I believe, had been smoking, or had a pipe in his hand at the time, and sat nearer the fire; he asked me if I knew him; I do not recollect that I had at that time spoke to him; I told him I knew him very well; he said, you are mistaken, sir, you never saw me in your life before, nor I never saw you; I then, to the best of my recollection, asked them what they had done with my notes and my money; they very resolutely denied knowing any thing about either one or the other, and said, they did not know what I meant; I was then brought into the adjoining room, I think, by the constable, who produced what had been taken from them, the pistols and money, and I recollected the shilling particularly; I said, this is the money I gave; I returned to the tap-room with the constable, after examining the pistols, the money, and the other things, and finding the constable had not possession of the notes, I asked the prisoners what they had done with the notes; I said, it is in vain for you to deny the charge, because I not only know you, but I can swear to the money, and the best thing you can do is to confess, and enable me to pursue the man that has got the Bank-notes, it being the only chance you can possibly have of being safe; they still denied knowing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140024"/>any thing of the matter; I then pulled out the letter, and held it over to Nutts, and desired him to read the superscription of that letter, and said, now, sir, are you satisfied that I know you perfectly; I think he said he could not read, or he had never learned to read, or something of that sort; I then said, I am sorry you are so obstinate, and I left the room with the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. When you were shewn into the tap-room, were they sitting amongst the rest of the company without any thing that could lead you to suppose they were prisoners? - A. Without any thing that could possibly lead me to suppose they were prisoners; I should add, that during the time they were round the chaise, they neither behaved violently, nor ill-treated me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I shall ask you but one question, and that is, how you spell your name, whether it is O'Kelly, or O'Kelly? - A. O'Kelly.</p>
               <p>- NIBBS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const.</p>
               <p>I am a constable at Hayes: on the 3d of December, about eight o'clock, I left a friend's house, near the Adam and Eve, with intent to go on the road about three quarters of a mile towards Uxbridge; just as I stepped out of my friend's house, a chaise and pair were going past on the road for Uxbridge; I was going likewise the same way; it was moon-light, but rather dull; the road happened to be very free from any body going backwards and forwards at that time, but in walking after the chaise, I could observe some people on the foot-path; I could not distinguish how many; I could hear the grinding of the wheels very distinctly, and all at once I found that to cease; I looked up, and saw it standing still, and some people about it; I heard the expression, I will blow your brains out; I supposed it to be a robbery committed, and it struck me, that with help, it might be in my power to apprehend them; I immediately ran back to the Adam and Eve public-house, where there were a number of people assembled; I told them what had happened, and asked for assistance; four immediately ran out, and some others, whom I begged to assist, but they stood inactive; I then followed the four that were gone, as fast as I could; in running after them, to my surprize, I found the four men pursuing the robbers, and running towards me; I could not cleverly distinguish one from the other, but the leading man had got a bundle under his left arm; there is a lane that leads from that road to a field, called the Adam and Eve field, close by the public-house; they took down that lane; when I got into the field, they were at the small distance of about twenty yards; I saw two distinct slashes from, as I supposed, two pistols; I still kept running down to them, and found Nutts in the custody of two of the four persons that went out in pursuit; Riley, the others had just pulled down, and they were struggling with him upon the ground; I begged of them to hold his arms close, to get his pistols from him; while struggling, they took a pistol from him, and that pistol, with another, was given to me; we then took them to the Adam and Eve public-house; there I searched them, and found two pounds upon Riley, in gold and silver, and upon Nutts, three pounds and sixpence; I then handcuffed them together, and lest them in charge with a young man, and got a man to go with a horse after the colonel; I thought he might stop at the White Horse at Uxbridge, and therefore I sent there; after I got into the house, there was another brace of pistols delivered to me by one of the people, I cannot say which, (produces the money and the pistols;) the money taken from Riley, consists of a half-guinea, three seven-shilling pieces, a half-crown, five shillings, and two sixpences; the other is two guineas, on half-guinea, two half-crowns, one shillings, and two sixpences.</p>
               <p>Col. O'Kelly. This is the shilling that I spoke of.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you recollect whether this shilling was marked on one side, or both? - A. I observed but one side; I took it in change for a Banknote.</p>
               <p>Nibbs. I saw one of the pistols taken from Riley.</p>

               <p>Q. Thought Col. O'Kelly did not see it, they were handcuffed at the time that he came in? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. That shilling has a mark upon it, that is very common? - A. Yes.</p>

It was rather getting dark; he had the same coat on that he has on now; he told me to deliver my money, and presented a pistol at my breast; he was so near me, that I could have touched him; I put my hand in my breeches pocket, and gave him all the silver I had, which was three shillings; he told me that was not enough, and in case I did not give him more, he would fire at me; I told him it was of no use to fire, or ill use me, I had no more but two or three halfpence, and if he chose to have them, he might have them, and I put my hand in my pocket, and gave him a handful of them; he directly turned round to a poor woman that I had in the carts and told her, if she did not deliver her mo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140026"/>ney, he would fire at her; the poor woman begged for mercy, and told him she was but a poor beggar woman, if he wanted any thing of her, he must take her matches, and that was all that I saw of him that night.</p>

               <p>Q. How long might this take up? - A. I dare say, five or six minutes, I cannot say particularly, I had never seen him before: On the 16th of December, I saw him go by my window, at Barnet, and I watched him up and down the town, he had a woman with him, they went into several shops; I spoke to

It might be five hundred yards from it, he was going from Mr. Duncan's house; I conceived him to be a suspicious man, and as I had suffered much by fire two days before, I asked him where he was going with that property; he told me, he was going with it to a public-house; I asked him the name of the person who keeps the public-house, he answered me, he could not tell; I asked him the sign, and that he could not tell me; I asked him where he brought it from, he said, from a friend of his in King Edward-street, that was where the fire was; I asked him what his friend's name was, and he could not tell me, he said, he worked in the coal trade; I then told him, as he could not give me a better account, I should take him into custody and the property; I then took hold of him by his coat, and he very willingly went with me; I then took him to Mr. Bell's a publican, the Royal-oak, in Wapping; I then called Mr. Bell, and told him, there was a trunk with property, that I had a suspicion this man had not honestly come by; the prisoner said, he would fetch the owner; I did not conceive it necessary to detain the prisoner, I put the trunk in the possession of Mr. Bell, and requested him not to deliver it without my being present.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the trunk you afterwards saw at the Magistrate's, the same that you left with Bell? A. It was; I went away, and returned to Mr. Bell's again in the evening, about half past five; Mr. Duncan had been with me in the intermediate time, and informed me that he had lost a trunk of that description; I felt sorry that I had not detained the prisoner, but Mr. Duncan and I had not been at Mr. Bell's above five minutes, when the prisoner came into the tap-room; he was brought into the parlour by Mrs. Bell, and I took him into custody; he applied to know if the trunk was taken away; he said, if he should have it, he would take it to the owner; he was then taken before a justice.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am the sister of the last witness; I had this very trunk in my arms the morning of the fire; I put these things into it myself, with my own hands, about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Bell.) Q. Do you know if the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140031"/>trunk, when it was deposited with you, contained those articles? - A. No, I did not see it opened.</p>
               <p>Davis. It was opened at Bell's house that day, and Mr. Duncan saw the contents; it was shut up again, and Perry kept the key.</p>
               <p>Perry. I have had the key ever since.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Maloney. I kept the key of the trunk, and it was not opened from the time that I locked it, till it was opened at Mr. Bell's; Mr. Duncan and my husband took the key for that purpose; I am certain all these things were my sister's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to work by the fire; I stood there about ten minutes; a man gave the trunk to me out at the one pair of stairs window, and begged some one to take it of him; it was put through the window, and I took it; he told me to take it to the first public-house in the first turning at the bottom of Gravel-lane, and I delivered it there, it is Mr. Bell's house; when I came back, the man asked me what I had done with it, and I told him I had taken it to where he ordered me, and he told me to go and bring it back again; I went, and then they would not let me have it, and then I went to work on board a ship till night, and when I went to Mr. Bell's at night, they stopped me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, who had known him seven years, and gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>(The indictment was opened by Mr. Alley.)</p> 
               <p>Mr. Knapp. May it please your Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury. It becomes my painful duty to solicit your attention to the facts that will be laid before you in evidence, in order to bring your minds to the conclusion of the guilt or innocence of the unfortunate prisoner at the bar. The crime imputed to him is as high a crime as any almost that is known to the laws of the land; indeed I might have been correct in stating it to be as high a crime as any that is spoken of by any laws human or divine, and it is aggravated in this instance (if the facts are made out), by the person committing the murder charged upon this inquisition, inasmuch as it hath been committed by him upon the person of his wife. Gentlemen, I beg not to be understood in my address to you to be attempting to lead your minds from the fair judgment that you ought to form upon the facts that will be laid before you; it only belongs to my situation to point out the magnitude of the offence, and lay those facts before you, and when that is done, sure I am the public and the prisoner will be equally satisfied with your determination.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, It becomes the more painful to me when I look at the person who is the object of accusation, that he is a person in an advanced period of life, and who has lived in the world in such a manner as never before to have a stain fall upon his character; and still more so when I reflect that a Grand Inquest of the country have passed in judgment upon the circumstances that will be laid before you, and have thought that this was not a charge sit to be submitted to your consideration; but, Gentlemen, it is my duty to inform you, that by the law of this country, wherever a death, accidental or by violence, hath happened, an inquisition is directed to be taken before the Coroner, and in this case the Coroner's Jury having thought fit to find that which is charged upon this inquisition to be "Wilful Murder," the prisoner must be amenable to your enquiry.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Having said so much, I again particularly desire you not to take any of those topics that I have been urging against the prisoner, but judge only by the evidence which will be adduced before you. I shall now state the facts, and I am sure you will draw that conclusion, which, as honest and experienced men, you ought to do.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The prosecutors of this indictment are the parish officers of that parish where the death has happened; and, I think I may state, subject to the correction of the Bench, that they have done no more than their duty (upon a death having happened in their parish), in submitting it to your consideration.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The prisoner is a man of repute and of character, and has lived to an advanced period of life; he is a <rs id="t18010114-25-deflabel141" type="occupation">farmer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t18010114-25-defend281 t18010114-25-deflabel141"/> of opulence and of respectability. On the day laid in the indictment, and previously to it, unfortunately for the prisoner, the woman, charged to have lost her life by his means, had been in the fatal practice of drinking, which had, I believe, considerably embittered the comforts that would otherwise have proceeded from such a commission. On the day laid in the indictment, he had been at some distance from home upon business, and did not return home, I think, till nine o'clock in the evening, and, upon his return home, he found his wife in that situation in which he had repeatedly found her, (I believe almost daily); that prepossession in favour of liquor having encreased upon her, he immediately enquired where she was; he was told what her situation was; she went up stairs, and the servant will tell you, that immediately upon her going up stairs into her room, the prisoner followed her; that a considerable scuffle and violence was heard; I don't know whether I am over-stating the facts, but if I am, you will correct me hereafter by your verdict; I understand violent blows were heard, and a violent resistance of the deceased in going from one bed-room to the other, in which bed-room she had been always placed by her husband when she was in that state. Nothing more passed till about one o'clock in the morning, and at that early hour the prisoner was heard to come down stairs, and was asked why he came down; he said, he came down to drink something; he appeared extremely agitated, and very much unnerved: However, nothing transpired till about five o'clock in the morning, when the prisoner came down and desired the maid to go for a Mrs. Holdship, the sister of the deceased; and upon being asked what was the matter, he said, oh Lord, and expressed himself in excessive agitation; he seemed considerably hurt from some transaction that had taken place; he said, go for her sister; and then said, she is no more. Upon this taking place, the sister came, went up stairs, and found her in the situation I am going to describe;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140032"/>she found her resting upon her arm, quite speechless and motionless; she appeared a little warm under the arm upon which she was resting; she then used all the application which a person so nearly and so dearly connected with the deceased as she was, might be naturally expected to use; she immediately made use of blankets, and all means of recovery that could be applied, but without effect; she then observed bruises upon various parts of the body; but as I wish to state every thing for as well as against the prisoner, I understand the witness will not be able to state whether they were recent bruises or bruises that had been created by former violence. There was the appearance of frothy, bloody water, running out of her mouth, and there was also the same appearance upon the floor by the bed-side.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, These are all the circumstances with which I am furnished, from whence you are to draw the conclusion, whether such a degree of violence has been used,(and that by the prisoner), as to impute the crime of murder to him, as is charged by this inquisition.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, You will require to be told whether any medical advice was called for, in order to see what was the nature of her complaint, and what was the result of their opinion, whether the immediate cause of her death was attributable to the bruises she had received, or any thing that could have proceeded from the scuffle I have slated. It so happens, that in this case there are three medical gentlemen of integrity and skill, one of whom had been in the habit of attending her before; they opened the body, and they will give their account of the situation in which they found it; their opinion I shall forbear to state to you; it will, perhaps, be stated in that correct and technical manner by them, which cannot fail of being more satisfactory to your minds than by any statement of mine, from whence you will draw your conclusion, whether the prisoner is guilty of the murder imputed to him or not.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, Thus far I ought to state, because I owe it to the prisoner, that from the result of the opinions of these medical gentlemen, it seems to be uncertain whether the death be attributable to those means which the inquisition ascribes, or whether it might not have arisen from intoxication; but it would not be sufficient for parish officers, nor for me, who am conducting the prosecution, under the direction of the learned Judges, nor you, to take it upon what I am told will be their opinion; and I should be wanting in my duty to the public, if I did not call the witnesses to give their evidence, and then it will be for you to draw the conclusion between the public and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I hope I have not said any thing that can induce any inflammation in your minds; the issues of life and death are in your hands; you have to discharge an important duty to youselves, to the public, and to the prisoner; and I am sure that duty will be performed by you conscienciously and honourably; I shall call the witnesses, and when I have so done, your verdict, I am sure, will be satisfactory evidence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did nothing pass before he abused you? - A. He said, that he was informed at Sunbury, at three o'clock, that my mistress was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in consequence of that that he abused you? - A. Yes; he then went up stairs to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to your master about it? - A. I said she was not drunk at that time; he then went up stairs, I heard him call her a drunken b-h.</p>
               <p>Q. How high up stairs? - A. One pair; after that I heard a great piece of work, a noise, and lumbering of feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else that could have occasioned the lumbering of seet, except you master and mistress? - A. No; after that I heard my mistress cry out, oh Lord! and desired a little girl, who was up stairs in the room with them, to call Betty to help her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up stairs in consequence of this desire of your mistrss? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason you did not go up stairs? - A. I was afraid, he had abused me so much below; he came down stairs in a few minutes for something to fasten the door; he asked me first, if I knew where the staple was that I had drawn before; she had been fastened into that room before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the room in which your master sleeps? - A. No, the room where she used to sleep by herself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say the staple was drawn, what do you mean? - A. I drew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion did it used to be applied? - A. He used to fasten her in when she was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the staple? - A. I told him I did not know where it was, and he did not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he look for any thing else? - A. Yes, he looked for a brass screw, and said, he would fix me from going in to her; I was just out at the shop door, and he banged the door to, and told me I might go to h-ll if I liked it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get in soon after this? - A. Yes, I believe, in about a quarter of an hour the little girl came crying out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140033"/>Q. When you got in, how did you observe things in the house? - A. I did not see him any more till the next morning, about five o'clock, I was in the wash-house, he came out and called me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his clothes on at that time? - A. He was dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. When he called to you, what did he say? - A. He desired me to go and call

               <p>Q. Did you usually leave water in your master's bed-room? - A. No; I heard him then go in and say, oh Lord, several times; I went to call Mrs. Holdship; I returned, and asked him what was the matter, and he said, she was no more.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did he express himself, like a man very much agitated and in grief? - A. He seemed to be very full of grief; it might be half an hour before she came, and I returned again and told her.</p>

               <p>Q. That is what you call not being completely drunk; she went up stairs upon your informing her that your master was coming home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master told you that he had heard that she was drunk at three o'clock, at Sunbury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And blamed you for getting the liquor with which she had been getting drunk? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it you or the little girl that he desired to tell her she should lie in the room where she generally did when she was drunk? - A. No, I did not hear that.</p>
               <p>Q. But it was customary? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon those occasions he used to put a hasp upon the door to keep you from getting to her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell these gentlemen how came you to take the hasp off that door which your master had so frequently made use of to keep you from getting to her; what did you do with it? - A. I put it away.</p>

               <p>Q. You would not let him have it? - A. I could not be in the kitchen, he was in such a passion, I could not recollect just then where I had put it.</p>
               <p>Q. This room, in which this poor unhappy woman was, she had frequently been put into by her husband when she was drunk? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You were left below? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was this before Mr. Shore went into his own room to bed? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he undressed himself in part below? - A. Yes, he had pulled off his garters as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistress, when she went up stairs, went in her usual dress? - A. Just as she had on all day.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard no more, nor saw any more of Mr. Shore till five o'clock in the morning? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am sister to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140034"/>deceased, I was called up; I went to my sister's house, I saw Mr. Shore, and said, oh, John, what is the matter; he told me to go up stairs, and he followed me; I went up into the little back room, and saw my sister lying upon the carpet by the bedside; she laid as if somebody had laid her there; she lay with her head upon her arm upon her right side.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe about her person? - A. Some bloody froth water like running from her mouth upon the side that she lay on; I helped to undress her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who helped to undress her with you? - A. Her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular about her person? - A. I saw a great many bruises upon all the upper parts of her body, and about her face.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen her that afternoon before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the appearance of those bruises when you parted with her in the afternoon? - A. Yes, in her face; I cannot say whether the others were or not, because she had got her clothes on; her husband and I laid her upon the bed, I rubbed her body, and wiped her mouth, and warmed her bed; I did every thing that I could do.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner appear at that time? - A. Very much loaded with sorrow and trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he give you every assistance in his power? - A. He did, and helped to undress her.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person appear more sorrowful for what had happened than he appeared to be? - A. No, nobody could be more sorrowful than he was; he sent for Mr. Hardiman, the publican, and told his mind to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear in the house any noise? - A. Yes, I heard a noise up stairs, like as if one person might be thrown down by another, and I heard a hammering, like fastening the door.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a surgeon, living at Hampton; I was sent to upon this occasion; I went up stairs to the deceased's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give you any information at all? - A. The only question he put to me was, whether I would like to go up and see the corpse; said, if he pleased; I went up into the room, and saw the corpse.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the observations that you made upon the corpse? - A. There were some external marks and bruises, one upon her thigh.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a considerable bruise upon her arm, upon her side, and on her face.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those bruises such as would have the effect of producing serious consequences? - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any other observations at that time? - A. I did not; I afterwards with Mr. Boone and Mr. Jones opened the body, that was the next day; immediately upon dividing what we call the internal integuments of the abdomen, there was a considerable effusion of blood, and conceiving that to be the cause of her death, I thought it proper to find the source of that effusion; after removing the abdomenal viscera, I dissected from the heart downwards, and perceived a rupture of the internal iliac artery; I thought it would be likewise satisfactory to open the head, and found the vessels very turgid, and a disposition to inflammation.</p>
               <p>Q. As you had attended the deceased before, were you acquainted with that disposition that she had to drink strong liquors? - A. I have heard it commonly reported.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe it yourself? - A. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing her to have had this failing, having opened the body and the head, can you tell us, from one cause or the other, to what is to be attributed her death? - A. The death of the deceased is to be attributed to the rupture of the blood vessel certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, attributing the death to the rupture of the blood vessel, venture to state upon your oath, from your skill in your profession, that the death was occasioned by any external violence used to the body, or a suffocation, procured in consequence of liquor? - A. I conceive it to be from external violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the deceased to have been thrown down upon the ground, might a rupture or not have taken place in consequence of a fall of that sort? - A. Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in Court during the time the other witnesses have been examined? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard them state their evidence? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether this death might have been occasioned by the means that they have stated? - A. The rupture might be given by external force; how it was given, it is impossible for me to say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140035"/>not happen to see this poor creature till she had been laid upon the bed? - A. No; the body was stripped, and lying upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen this poor creature lying upon the floor, in her clothes, near the bed, and you had observed this froth that arose from her mouth, would you not have deemed it extremely probable, that, with some little bruise, the suffocation had increased the liability of breaking the blood vessel? - A. I conceive as to that froth, that she was in the act of dying, in consequence of the rupture: it is not at all improbable that the loss of blood from the ruptured vessel to the abdomen would produce sickness, and that sickness, from a particular position of body, suffocation.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Shore? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not a man of a fair reputation? - A. I always heard him spoken of as an industrious, sober man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said that this rupture might be attributed to external violence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that it might have taken place in consequence of being thrown upon the ground? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether the same rupture might not have taken place in consequence of her falling from the bed? - A. Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. And might not such a rupture also have taken place in consequence of any struggle that might have been used between her and any other person, in endeavouring to get her into that bed-room? - A. I conceive it possible.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I attended with the last witness at the opening of the body of the deceased; I observed an effusion of blood in the abdomen, which proceeded from a rupture in the internal iliac artery, I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to form an opinion, whether the rupture in the internal iliac artery rose from an internal natural cause, or from violence? - A. Certainly it did not appear to arise from any internal cause, but evidently either from a violent effort in the individual herself, or violence from some other person; had it risen from any internal disease, the artery would not have been found, which the coats of the artery were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on examining the body, observe any external marks? - A. Many, but none that could apparently have been the cause of her death; there was a great deal of external bruises or extravasation on the right side between the ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose all those marks of violence could be occasioned by a single fall from the bed? - A. No. impossible; and I think it impossible to say exactly whether some part of these might not be simple extravasations, because I mean to say that this poor woman had been dead three or four days previous to our seeing her.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was the bed upon which she laid, from the ground? - A. It was but low.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it possible, that merely from falling off the bed, the strain of the body would occasion a rupture in the iliac artery? - A. It is a very hard question to answer, for the coats of the iliac artery are very strong, and great violence must have been used.</p>

               <p>Q. It was some time after the death before you saw the body? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it not frequently happen a few days after death? - A. Yes; but in tracing these bruises inwards, from without, the appearance of violence ceased; within a very small distance from the surface, the artery is guarded by a vast number of very strong muscles and bones.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, it will be for you to say, whether under this evidence, you are perfectly satisfied that the deceased came by her death, by means of the prisoner throwing her down upon the floor; it seems to be left upon this evidence, in an extremely doubtful state, nor is there any person who has seen a single blow given; there has been a noise like forcing her into this room, which really seemed to be the proper place for a woman in her situation, and her resistance, as the surgeon has said, might have caused, by a violent effort or exertion, this rupture of the blood-vessel, it will be for you to say whether you see it necessary to go any further or not.</p>

Yes; it was tied up in bundles; I then weighed it again, and it wanted fourteen ounces of weight; I immediately went to the prisoner, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140036"/>found her at the Old Mermaid, in Church-street, Hackney; I told her there was some property missing, and I was pretty sure she had got it; she said, if there was any missing, she was sure she knew nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after that? - A. I told her, I was positive she had got it in her possession, and that there was an officer at hand ready to be called for to search the place; she made hesitation, and then said there was a woman up stairs, Mrs. Whitely; and I went up stairs with her to Mrs. Whitely, and the prisoner opened a box, and gave me out the Bengal silk that was missing; there were fourteen ounces, which exactly made up the deficiency.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it, as far as you can guess, from colour and sample, the same silk? - A. There was not the least difference; she begged for mercy, and hoped her master would not prosecute her; I sent for an officer, he came, and took her into custody.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long had this woman been in your service? - A. I suppose, ten years.</p>

            , a hatter, in Old-street-road, came to my house, and told me there were two men at his house, offering two beehives and the honey for sale; I then called upon Armstrong, and went with him to Solomon's house, where the two prisoners were; Hanson, the youngest of the two, was leaning over the counter, the other prisoner, Baker, was in a little room by the side of the shop by the fire; there we found two beehives and a sack; the one was a common straw hive, and the other made out of a tea-chest, with glass windows, and a trap-door; we then asked Solomon what this man had brought for sale; he said, some honey, which he shewed to us, and the hives: the prisoners both acknowledged that they did bring it there for sale; I asked them how they came by it; Hanson said, he bought it in the country, that it was his property, and Baker was with him at the time that he bought it; and Baker said, he was by when he bought it, and saw him pay for it; we left Baker at the watch-house, at Shoreditch, locked up; and, going along, I asked Hanson who he bought it of, and he said, he could send for the person he bought it of; he said, before the Magistrate, that he had it from his father in Northamptonshire.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. On the 26th of December, I was at Mrs. Levy's house, in a court in Rosemary-lane, when the officers came in; the prisoner Shirley came in first, with a bundle tied in a blue apron, and then the woman came in; he put his on the counter, at the right-hand side as he came in at the door; when the woman came in, she bolted the top bolt of the street-door, with her left-hand, she had a bundle underneath her brown cloak, and then Shirley took the bundle off the counter, and came into the back-room; then there was a knock at the door, and an old gentleman opened it, and the officers came in; then he dropped the bundle immediately, and the woman slipped a parcel of leather from under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Shirley's defence. I work at the water-side, and this woman brought these things home, she picked them up; I was very uneasy about their being in the place, and I did not go home all that night, or the next day, I did not like to come home; we live in Hackney-road, and I went with her to Mrs. Levy's house, for she said she could leave them there, and then I could come home.</p>
               <p>Ewen's defence. I had occasion to go out of the road a little, and trod upon this parcel; I picked it up and brought it home, and when my companion came home, he was very angry, he went away, and would not come back till it was gone, he was afraid, and we took them to leave them at Mrs. Levy's house, that my husband might come home again, and when we got into the house, this gentleman laid hold of us.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it before Christmas? - A. I cannot justly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what day of the week it was that you went before the Justice? - A. Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the Saturday before that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Kirby). What is the date of the committal? - A. The 22d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Lawrence.) Do you serve in the shop? A. No; Mrs. Gillham and her daughter serve in the shop; it was after candle-light, I had been out, and when I went in at the shop door, I saw these two <rs id="t18010114-37-viclabel209" type="occupation">soldier</rs>s; one of them, Malone, was in the shop, and Mrs. Gillham with him, he was standing by the counter, I did not observe whether he was looking at any goods or not; then I went away, and when I came into the shop again, he was looking at some stockings; I then saw a piece of brown Holland between Malone's feet, it stood on the ground, and leaned against the counter; then I went out of an errand, and went up the town, and when I came away, Malone pulled the door as I was going to shut it, and would not let me shut it; then I stooped, and saw Bolton go up to the door, put his hands in, and take a piece of brown Holland from within the door, Malone was within-side of the shop; Bolton then went up the town with the cloth; then I saw Bolton go over the road, and lay it down behind a tree.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see them do that? - A. Yes, it was a moon-light night; then I went on about my business, I was going up the town of an errand for another person, I did not see any thing more of Malone that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see Malone have the cloth, you only saw it lying upon the floor? - A. Yes; I saw Bolton again the same night, and Malone on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had you of seeing their countenances, you only passed through the shop, you made no stop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they dressed in soldiers' clothes? - A. Yes; I knew them both again as soon as I saw them</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman, at Tottenham: I was on duty between five and six o'clock, as near as I can tell, I cannot rightly say; I saw the prisoner, Bolton, cross the road, I saw the last witness near the spot where Bolton crossed oyer, I did not see him come out of the shop, he came in a direction from the shop; I saw him lay something down, and he came back and passed me, and wished me a good night; he had then two others with him, Malone was one, it was a moonlight night; I crossed over the road and went to see what he had laid down, and waited to see who would fetch it; I found it to be a piece of cloth in a bag; I then sent a person that was going by to fetch another watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of these other two men at the tree? - A. No; they were all three soldiers; one of them had on a foraging cap, and the other a cocked-up hat, and feather in it; in about six or seven minutes one of them returned to where the bag was, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pick it up? - A. No; he came up to the place, but seeing me he would not meddle with it; he was neither of the three that I had seen before, he was out of regimentals; I took him into custody, but he was discharged; I took the bundle and the man before the Magistrate; I then went to the public-house, where I found the two prisoners; Malone was set at liberty, and sent to the cage on the Monday following; I apprehended Malone again in the ranks. (Produces the property).</p>

               <p>Q. (To Lawrence.) Do you know whose property that is? - A. I had seen such a piece of Holland as that upon the counter in the course of the day.</p>

               <p>- WYBER sworn. - I am a stageman, and keep the Kentish-town stages: I had two horses in my possession which Cooper said were his, I bought them of a man of the name of Martin, who brought them to Mr. Hall's stable at the Assembly-house, at Kentish-town, my stables adjoin them; it was on the 17th of December; I had known Martin a twelvemonth, he has been in the habit of bringing horses to Kentish-town, he has sold several there; he has got a daughter that is married there; he has been there a week or a fortnight together; he is in confinement at Lewes; about two hours after I had bought the horses, Bristow and Martin both went to town on the stage with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay for the horses? - A. Four guineas; and when I got them to Smithfield, I could not get two guineas for the best of them.</p>
               <p>Court. What! two horses that, not three quarters of a year before, had cost twenty-four guineas; I would advise you to take care how you buy such bargains again.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there anybody with him? - A. It was so dark I could not see him; when I came down, I went into the kitchen, and there sat Martin, and the prisoner at the bar with him, they asked for some warm ale; while they were drinking their ale, I said, well, Martin, what horses have you got here; he said he had got two very good ones in the stable; I asked him how he came up at that time; he said he had come up with goods; he has always before passed with us as a smuggler; that his cart was broke down in Grays-inn-lane, with eighteen tubs of Hollands in it; he asked me if I wanted to buy the horses; I told him I did not know; he said, well, come and look at them, I think they will suit you; I will sell you one, or both; upon which we took a candle and lantern, and went into the stable, the prisoner at the bar, Martin, myself, and the ostler; I took notice of the horses, but I told him they were not the kind of horses that I wanted; they were low half-bred cart horses, one four years old, and the other an aged horse, pretty near blind; then I went into the house, and so did the prisoner, and Martin; they said they must go to Grays-inn-lane,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140043"/>to get a new wheel for their cart; the prisoner said if his hand had been well, he would have made one himself; his hand was tied up; they went away, and came back again, but they were not gone long enough to have gone to Gray's-inn-lane; Wyber is a tenant of mine, and, in the evening, Martin offered him the horses for sale; the prisoner was by, but I do not think Wyber saw him; I saw Martin receive the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bristow take any part in the transatcion? - A. Nothing more that shewing me in the morning the horses that were for sale.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time Martin talked about the cart breaking down, did the prisoner say any thing? - A. Yes; he said to Martin, I hope you have taken care of our tubs; the prisoner said, yes, they are all safe; in the evening, after they had sold their horses, I asked them how they would get their cart home, and they said, they had got one big enough for that.</p>

               <p>Q. In the bed-room? - A. Yes; I saw her look at the watch; she stayed in the room about a quarter of an hour; my husband thought I had got the watch, and did not say any thing about it till the afternoon, when I asked him what it was o'clock; and he said, I had got the watch; then I said, she must have got it; I went up stairs to her apartment, and she was gone out; then my husband went to enquire after her; she came home at night, and my husband asked her if she had got it, and she said, no, and in about an hour after, she denied it, he sent for the officer, and they found the duplicate of the watch about her.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the public office, Hatton-garden: On the 7th of January, I was sent for to search the prisoner, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; I took her up into her own room and searched her in the presence of Mrs. Gorman; the first thing I found upon her was two seven-shilling pieces in her shoe, sixpence, one halfpenny, and a farthing, and this pocket-book, with four duplicates, which was in her hair, under her cap; after that, I found the duplicate of the watch inside the lining of her stays, in the bosom; the next morning I went to a pawnbroker's in the Borough, and gave them notice to attend on the Saturday; the 7th was Wednesday; I received the watch from the pawnbroker, (produces it); the pawnbroker said the watch was pawned by a man, and as he could not identify the prisoner, he did not come.</p>
               <p>Gorman. I can swear to this as being the watch that was hanging up at my fire-side; the maker's name is Davison; when I used it, there was a bit of red ribbon to it, which it has not now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The watch was taken more out of frolic than theft; my landlady and I were very intimate, and after they made a piece of work about it, I made away with it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he pay for what he had drank before he went out? - A. Yes; and about a quarter after eleven o'clock, the maid gave the alarm; I was going to bed, and she had gone up before me; and had come down, and met me as I was going up; in consequence of what she said, we both came down stairs, and my master went up, and me and the maid went up stairs, and we found the bottom fath of the garret window taken out, and put on the staircase, that is, a window that lights the staircase; half of it goes into the maid's room, and lights that; there are three panes in the top-sash, and three in the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. What size panes are they? - A. Small ones; when we went up, the door was locked; my master unlocked the door, and we saw a man's feet under the bed; my master came out of the room, and locked the door again; he sent me down to get the watchman, and the watchman went up and pulled the prisoner from under the bed; he did not say any thing till he came down stairs, and then he said he was in liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. What size was this window; was there room enough for a man to get in? - A. I should think he could not get in that way, because he might have fell over into the yard, and dashed himself to pieces; he must have got half his body in first, and so hung by his hands; my master unlocked the door, and I saw his feet; my master then said, it is all nonsense, there is nobody here, and then he locked the door again, and gave the boy a hint to fetch the watchman, and he did; the watchman came up, and pulled him from under the bed, and brought him down stairs; he said, he thought it was his quarters; he was very much in liquor; when I went to go to bed, my box was turned topsey-survey, and another box displaced that belonged to my master; there was nothing gone from the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he excessively in liquor? - A. He was not in liquor at all, though he pretended to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. He had had a good deal of liquor? - A. I drew him two pints of ale, and he drank one of them, and part of the other, but I am sure he was not in liquor.</p>

The only method he could have got in, was by getting out of the sash when it was open, and so hanging by his hands, and crawling to the other window, for there was no hole, either for his feet or knees.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140045"/>Q. Was there space enough for him to get out? - A. Not without contracting himself, there is a pane and a half in each, about ten inches by eight.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did he appear? - A. He was as sober as I am this moment, as sober as can be; he pretended to be drunk at first, but afterwards he went to the watch-house as well as any person could do; he said, he thought he was at his quarters, and I told him it must be strange quarters to get in at the window in that manner.</p>
               <p>Floyd. I saw the window in at nine o'clock, I went to fetch a pint pot that the lodger had had, which stood in that staircase window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was quite in liquor, I thought I had been at home at my quarters; I went up stairs and found the window open, I went in, and was so full of liquor, that I tumbled off the bed.</p>

No, I was at home; the next evening, Tuesday, when he returned to his duty, I charged him with having robbed me of corn and coals, and produced the coat and the bag which contained the corn; he told me he had swept the corn out of the corn-barge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise, or use any threat to induce him to say how he came by it? - A. I advised him to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it would be better for him if he told the truth? - A. No, I did not; I advised him to tell the truth, without any condition; he said he had swept it out of a corn barge, but being closely pressed, he acknowledged he had received it from Nery, the horse-keeper; they are mixed oats, and the same that I feed my horses with; the prisoner had access to the keys in the accompting-house, that he might have helped himself if she had pleased.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140047"/>(

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Is Mr. George Roebuck of age? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take stock? - A. About the beginning of May, 1800.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had that stock of sugar? - A. They were bought in 1799.</p>
               <p>Q. Like goods, of like quality and like mark, might be found in other shops? - A. There might, from our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. A considerable number of loaves, marked in the same way, have got into circulation in the trade? - A. Certainly, previous to my taking stock, but not since.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to swear that indentical loaf was not sold previous to May, 1800? - A. I have no doubt in my own mind, I will not swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he not a young man of good character? A. We know nothing of his connections, but previous to this transaction we had a very good opinion of him, or we should not have continued him in our service so long.</p>

            . This shirt and neckcloth are mine, I know them by the mark P B. I had not missed them, nor have not examined my linen since, but I know them to be mine by the mark; the prisoner had been at our house that evening that he was taken, to collect the pots from the men, about seven o'clock; the linen is kept in my mother's room; I never saw him in any room except the shop and the cutting room, which are both up stairs.</p>
               <p>John Brewer. I know this to be my shirt by the mark upon it, which I made myself with permanent ink; it is the only one I ever marked in that way, and I had missed it; I can swear to my father's shirt by the size and the mark, and my mother's stockings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Wednesday morning I was going for orders for tea as usual, at Mr. Brewer's, and there was a man sweeping Mr. Brewer's door, who asked me if I would buy these things of him; I did buy them of him, I gave him three shillings which I had for my boxing-money; I went up stairs, and got orders for the tea, with a bundle in my hand; I went home, and told the orders that I received, and I went in the evening to the same house after I had cleaned myself, with the stockings on, and one of the shirts, I did not take any notice of the marks; and one day as I was coming down stairs, the maid asked me where I got these stockings from; I said, they were not her's; she said, I must come to her mistress; I went, and Mrs. Brewer told me they were her's, and I must pull them off; I told Mrs. Brewer if these stockings were her's, I had got more things that were marked the same; she said, yes, there were some shirts, she believed; I said, yes, there were, and they took me up.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any violence done to this window, or was it merely thrown up? - A. Thrown up, there was nothing broke about it; I am perfectly sure it was down over-night; I was the first person who went into the parlour. I missed my books and a two foot rule off the table; there were eleven volume of a Biographical Dictionary, the Theological Miscellany, Salmon's Grammar, Delaranville's Dictionary, Culpepper's Herbal, and Her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140049"/>very's Meditations; I saw them two days after, at the mansion-house; I saw the prisoner in the yard the evening before, and I saw the books and the rule on the table the evening before.</p>

               <p>Q. You only guess the number? - A. No; from which parcel he gave me a one pound note, which was readily taken; I asked him his name, he said it was James Edmonds; where do you live, asked I, at No. 9, King-street, answered he; what King-street? King-street, Mile-end, New-town, answered he, which name and place of abode I put upon the back of the said note.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note? - A. That is the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mother present during the whole of this time? - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. While this was passing, had you sufficient opportunity of observing the person with whom you were dealing? - A. The case was this; it was about eleven o'clock in the evening, my father went out, and I was left in his place to serve the customers.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of light was there in your shop? - A. About twelve candles.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. To the best of my knowledge, he appears to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. This was on the Saturday night? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Saturday night, at eleven o'clock, is generally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140050"/>a very busy time? - A. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it happen to be that night? - A. There were, I think, five customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. And who were in the shop to serve them? - A. Myself, my mother, and a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you sold this beef was it, that you saw the prisoner in custody? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Four or five weeks, was not it? - A. It might be.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him before the Magistrate, I believe you did not speak to his person? - A. I was not requested to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him, did you know him again? - A. From the impression it made on my mind at the time he bought the beef, to the best of my knowledge I believed him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you could say so much as that you believed him to be the man, was he not dressed up in three or four different ways by the order of the officers? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any reason upon earth why that was done? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. What is the first name of your father? - A. Abraham.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. My husband keeps a butcher's shop in Whitechapel; about eleven o'clock on Saturday night, a man came to our shop, and purchased an haunch-bone of beef, my son agreed for the price; I was there to take the money, the man gave me a two pound note, which I refused; my son then asked him for a one pound note; he had a bundle of Bank-notes in his hand, out of which he gave me a one pound; my son then asked him what his name was; he said his name was James Edmonds; he asked him where he lived, he said, at No. 29, King-street; he asked him, what King-street, he answered, King-street, Mile-end New-town; I gave him the change, the haunch-bone of beef came to five shillings and ten-pence halfpenny; I gave him two seven shilling pieces and one penny halfpenny; then I went in and the man went away; my son wrote upon the back of the note, the man's name, and where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, is he the man who came to purchase the haunch-bone of beef? - A. Apparently, to the best of my knowledge, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoner again? - A. The first time, was the Saturday after Christmas-day, at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it the beef was bought? - A. I cannot justly say, but it was in November, and it was on a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at the office, what was your opinion of the man? - A. To the best of my knowledge, it was the same man that gave me the note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was four or five weeks between the time when the beef was sold, and the time when you saw the man at the office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had several examinations, had you not? - A. Only two.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the manner in which you expressed yourself concerning your knowledge of the prisoner at the bar, at the next examination was not his dress changed? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that done for the purpose of removing the difficulties you had upon your mind with respect to the person? - A. The first sight I had of the man, it appeared to be the same man that gave me the note, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in consequence of the doubtful manner in which you had expressed yourself, that this man's dress was changed - Was not the motive for so doing that you might be better able to speak to his being the man? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you give any directions, or express any with that any alterations should be made? - A. No, I never saw any body to say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at any time produced at the office dressed in pantaloons? - A. Yes, he had grey pantaloons on when he was in our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the colour of the pantaloons that he had on at the office? - A. They were grey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be the same sort of pantaloons? - A. I cannot say; there are many grey pantaloons, but they were of the same sort.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I am a patten-iron maker, No. 8, King-street, Mile-End New-Town; I have known the prisoner at the bar nine or ten years; he was an anvil-marker, at Wolverhampton; the prisoner was at my house the latter end of October last.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after you had first seen him there, did he make any application to you respecting Bank-notes? - A. In about five or six days the prisoner calld upon me again; there was nothing then passed about Bank-notes that I can particularly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any time make any application to you with respect to a five pound Bank-note? - A. Yes, about ten days after he first called; he then asked me if I could let him have a five pound note for small notes, I think they were all one pound notes, but I am not certain, there might be one of two pound, and three of one pound.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, in the course of you business, attempt to pay away those notes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any difficulty with respect to any one of them? - A. One was refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate that circumstance to the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it? - A. I gave it to him again, and he gave me another for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this? - A. In my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, see any others in his possession? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after that with any number of Bank-notes in his possession? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after? - A. A short time after, I cannot say exactly, it was in November.</p>
               <p>Q. As near as you can tell, how many were there? - A. There might be as many as eight or ten, I cannot tell; he said he was going to buy some things to send into the country to his wife; I asked him if they were good notes, and he said there were some good and some bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him your reason for asking him that question? - A. Yes, I did, because I had had a note refused that I had taken from him; he said, if he could pay one away a week, it would be a great thing for him, he said, he was going into business.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you gave him the note back that had been refused, did he make any difficulty in changing it for you? - A. No, he said he was soon going into the country; I saw him again after he returned from the country, which was nine or ten days after the conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to your house, and bringing a joint of meat? - A. Yes, on a Saturday night, I cannot say when.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the month of November? - A. It was late in the month of November; he brought home a haunch-bone of beef, he put it down, and said, that would do for dinner to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it? - A. Between ten and eleven, I believe it was nearer eleven than ten; I saw no more of him that night; he dined with me on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect a person, who was bricklayer, calling upon the prisoner? - A. Yes, twice; he called once, and the prisoner was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after the haunch-bone of beef was brought? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you inform the Court, how soon after he brought the beef it was that the bricklayer called the first time? - A. On the Sunday; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140052"/>next day he called again, on the Monday, in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see the prisoner then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they leave your house together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner return to his lodgings that might? - A. Not at all that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him again, did he tell you any thing that the bricklayer had communicated to him? - A. Yes; he said the bricklayer had told him there had been some people enquiring for him at the shop, and that one was an officer; he said he should not stop with me, he should go out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon his telling you this, what did you say? - A. I told him I supposed they wanted to arrest him; and he said, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. To arrest him for what? - A. For debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention any other reason for which they might want him? - A. Yes, I told him I supposed they wanted him for what they had him before at the Whitechapel-office.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that about? - A. He told me he had a kinsman in troubel about a note, and he told him he would go in the morning, and then he was liberated; that was

               <p>Q. Do you recollect what he said would be the consequence if he did not go out of town? - A. No; he said they had been seeking after him several times at the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. From that time did he ever return to your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his clothes continue there? - A. Yes; on Friday evening, teh 19th of December, he came to me, and told me he was going into the country, and desired me to bring or send his clothes to the Windsor Castle, in Holborn; he came into my shop; and there I left him for a short time.</p>
               <p>Q. The smith's shop, where the forge was? - A. Yes; I had been absent four or five minutes; when I returned, he was burning something on the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own observation, or from what he told you, what that something was? A. I suspected it to be notes, they appeared to be papers of the size of Bank-notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the poker in his hand? - A. He took tip the poker and laid it upon the bundle of papers to press them down.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that there were papers resembling Bank-notes? - A. None; he said he could not stop a moment; he said, I have seen the bricklayer, and the bricklayer tells me that the same people have been seeking for me at the shop, and I cannot stop a minute, he went away directly, and did not stop half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take his clothes with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they of a size that he could conveniently have taken them if he had had time to stop for them? - A. He might have taken them himself if they had been collected together; I carried them myself to the Windsor Castle, in Holborn; where I saw him; he said, I shall go into the country on the coach to-morrow.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you not taken up and accused of being yourself guilty of forgery? - A. When they took me they said nothing at all to me; they sent me to Cold-bath fields person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they not tell you why they sent you to Cold bath-fields? - A. Mr. Bliss found in my pocket three notes, which I had had from Wooldridge, and which he said Wooldridge had in his pocket when he was at the office before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, upon your oath, to say you did not know that you were charged yourself with a forgery at the time you were sent to Cold-bathfields prison? - A. They said nothing to me about forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, did you or not know that you were charged with a forgery? - A. I heard nothing about forgery at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations might you have attended before the Magistrates at Lambeth-street? - A. I was down three times, but was never called for but twice.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140053"/>Q. Do you mean to say, the Magistrates sent you to Cold-bath-fields before they examined you? - A. Yes; I never was examined at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you were sent to prison without calling upon you for a defence against the charge? - A. I have told you it was for three 1l. notes that were found in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always told the truth before the Magistrate when you were called upon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at the first examination, say that the notes found upon you were given you by the prisoner for a five pound note? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, when called upon by the Magistrate, say that you received them from the prisoner for a debt of four pounds twelve shillings? - A. I said no such thing; for the Magistrate even asked me where I got my five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am to understand you that you said no such thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a Mr. Tilsey? - A. Yes, a cheesemonger, at Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. The one pound note that you returned to the prisoner; and which he changed, you had offered to Mr. Tilsey, in Whitechapel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not say to Tilsey when you offered it to him, that you had received it from a different quarter? - A. Yes; I told him I believed I had received it that morning in Leadenhall-market in change for a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. And you now think fit to say you had it from the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; when I came home I recollected that I had it from the prisoner. I had changed a five pound note and received three one pound notes that morning in Leadenhall-market; but when I came home I recollected that I had wrapped up three one pound notes together, and the other was by itself: after Tilsey had refused that note, I unwrapped the others, and I thought it must be that single note, by its being wrapped up by itself: it was in the morning I had been in Leadenhall-market, and in the evening I was at Mr. Tilsey's.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you mention this at the Magistrate's at Whitechapel? - A. Yes; they asked me, and I told them so.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it happen that you employed an attorney to defend you? - A. I did not employ one; but there was one employed for me unknown to me; that was at the third examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that you were charged with forgery, and did he not recommend it to you to turn King's evidence? - A. No; he said my brother had employed him, and he was to ask me such questions as he thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, from his representations, know and believe that you would be prosecuted if you did not turn evidence? - A. He told me nothing about evidence; he said he was to attend upon me at Whitechapel office.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you were not you taken from the office into a private room, and was it not some time after you had been shut up with your attorney before you agreed to become a witness? - A. No; they said nothing to me about witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were not threatened to be prosecuted if you did not turn King's evidence? - A. Nobody threatened me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it happen that you were in irons at all? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And you have not been bailed yet? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You came in custody here? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What were you in custody for? - A. An assault; I never was found guilty in any Court of Justice at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you were in custody at that time for nothing but an assault? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were not in custody and tried for house-breaking, or any felony? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they examined by Mr. Bliss? - A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140054"/>Q. Have these notes since been returned to you? - A. No; Mr. Bliss told me they were good notes.</p>

            : I saw Francis Wooldridge on Thursday, 18th December, at a public-house in Holborn, and after I had been there about five hours the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the sign of the house? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner respecting any forged Bank-notes, and of his know ledge of their having been forged?</p>
               <p> Mr. Alley took an objection to the question, which, having been argued on both sides, Mr. Baron Thompson proceeded as follows: -</p>
               <p>The question proposed to be put to the witness seems to me to inquire after a conversation which the witness is supossed to have had with the prisoner at the bar, on the 18th of December, at the distance of about-three, weeks from the day when the note in question was uttered to Roderiques; and the effect of that conversation is something from which a knowledge of the forgery may be inferred as to the goodness or badness of certain notes then in his possession. It is supposed further, that an inference may be drawn of his knowledge and skill in discovering good notes from bad notes antecedent to the time; but it seems to me, unless the conversation goes so far as to affect the prisoner with the general knowledge of good notes and bad notes antecedent to that time, so as to connect it with the time when he really uttered this note, his then knowledge of a good note from a forged note, will not of itself be sufficient to afford the inference that at the time he uttered the note in question he necessarily knew that note to be forged, because he is speaking only of the knowledge of specific note in his possession, and the knowledge that he has of good notes from forged notes; but if the conversation goes further than that, and has any relation to notes that he has before issued, and to his knowledge of the goodness or badness of such notes before that time, in that case only, I think, is that conversation admissible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow (To Ferriday). Q. Upon your meeting with the prisoner at the bar at the Windsor Castle upon the 18th of December, did he say any thing to you with respect to forged Bank-notes? - A. After I had been some time in his company, he said his relation Frank had been taken up for a had Bank-note, and had been tried for it at the office; he said he looked so foolish with respect to Bank-notes he did not know any thing about it; that he told the Magistrate he had it of his master, and that he, Francis, had called James for ward, and that he owned to it that he had given that note to him; he said Frank was always getting into some foolish scrape or another; he said he himself had given the officer a card of his place and shop where he lived, in Nightingale-lane; he said he had had a quantity of bad Bank-notes; I asked him what he had done with them; he told me he had passed them over Blackfriars-bridge and Westminster-bridge, and round the Borough; the next day I was to see some of them; I was to meet him at six o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these notes that you were to see forged or good Bank-notes? - A. He said they were bad; he said they were at Mr. Pritchard's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Pritchard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know he lodged there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he going to do with them? - A. He said he was then going to pass them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body of this meeting that you had had with him? - A. Yes; I told Mr. Rogers, a Police officer, of on the 19th; I happened to meet him again at eight o'clock at night, and I went and found the prisoner there; he asked why I stopped so long; I told him I could not conveniently come sooner; I went there alone; he and I went together to Pritchard's; I went in without him; I did not get any thing, and I returned to the prisoner and told him Mrs. Pritchard was coming; she came, and then I left them together; the next morning he was apprehended, in consequence of the information I had given to Rogeres.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is become of Mrs. Pritchard? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. But had you the ill luck to get into jail for it? - A. Yes; I was put into the whipping-house.</p>

               <p>Q. When were you first applied to be a witness? - A. Since I have been in town.</p>
               <p>Q. As I had not the honour of travelling with you, I don't know when that was? - A. Last Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, for the first time, you were asked what you knew about Pritchard? - A. I was asked since that.</p>
               <p>Q. When, for the first time, were you applied to, to know what you could say respecting the character of Pritchard? - A. I think it was Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever know Pritchard examined as a witness? - A. Not till to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suppose he had ever been sworn? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you come to tell us you would not believe him upon his oath? - A. Yes; he bore a very good character before he left the country.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you ever know a man bear so bad a character? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. I should like to know the measure of your conscience, what sort of a bad character? - A. Pick-lock keys, and opening doors; he was taken before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any lamp near you? - A. It was very near under a lamp.</p>
               <p>- ADAMS sworn. - I am a watchman; when I was in my watch-box, I heard a cry of stop thief; I directly started from my box, and saw the prisoner running very fast, and the prosecutor in pursuit of him, and before I could get sufficiently far enough across the road, the prisoner passed me; I pursued him very closely, and called to my partner to stop him; as soon as I could stop him, the prisoner turned to the right into Church-row; I followed him through Church-row; I then called out, stop him; the prisoner then made away for Leadenhall-street or the Minories, he saw several people in front of us, and immediately started back again, he crossed backwards and forwards in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140057"/>road till he passed me again; I came up to him, and laid hold of him; he asked what he had done; I said I did not know what he had done, but should insist upon his going with me; I then took him to the watch-house, and as soon as I had got him to the watch-house, the prosecutor came in, and said, that was the man that had robbed him of his watch; the prisoner said he had no watch about him; he was searched, but we found none; I took my lanthorn, and went to search, and between where I took him and the watch-house, I found the watch about ten yards from the watch-house door, it appeared to have been run over by a carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was exactly in a line in which the prisoner had passed? - A. It was exactly in the line; I then took the prisoner to the watch-house, and the prosecutor claimed the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. How did it appear to have been opened? - A. The staple that the lock shut into was wrenched back, as it were with a chissel, or something of that sort; I missed a purse out of the chest, containing twenty-three guineas, four seven-shilling pieces, nine one pound notes, a two pound note, and a thirty pound note, a pair of silver shoebuckles, and a calico sheet; I did not get a warrant till Thursday following, I did not know how to go about the affair; on Wednesday I went to Guildhall, and could not get in, there were so many people there.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who you received the thirty pound note from? - A. I do not recollect his name, he is here; on the Thursday night I went to the prisoner's apartments with Tipper and Cartwright, he was not at home at first; I went about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140058"/>to several public-houses to find him, but could not; he came home very soon, and we began to search; we found him sitting in his own room by the fire; we all went into his room, and I told the officers that was the man; they then searched him and the room, and found a purse, which was one of my own making at Calcutta, which contained the money and notes that I had lost, they found two guineas in his wife's petticoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - A. He called me some name, I don't know what, and then the officers took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it's being your purse? - A. No; if there is such another in England, I will suffer being put in his place.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given permission that evening to any person to go into your room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner and you been upon terms of intimacy? - A. No, I have not spoke to him since I came home from the East-Indies; I knew him before I went, his wife had been several times in my room before this.</p>
               <p>Q. During the times that she had been in your room, do you know whether the chest had been opened? - A. Yes, several times.</p>

               <p>Q. What trade does he carry on? - A. I do not know any more than you; as far as I have heard, he keeps a bit of an old iron shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Curran? - A. I never had any acquaintance with him, further than meeting him and speaking to him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever drink with him? - A. On Tuesday after this happened, I was unwell in bed, and he came and sent one shilling out for something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what has become of Curran? - A. No; he has absconded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever charge Curran with committing the robbery? - A. No; he has been changing some of the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, have you never charged Curran with robbing you? - A. No; I asked him if he had been changing the notes for Coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you never charge Cockran with robbing you? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see him at your house on the Sunday night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to any public-house, during the twenty minutes that you were absent that evening. - A. I was not; I was in company with my wife at a house in the same court; my wife returned home in a few minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your room door broke open? - A. I found the lock had been wrenched, as if with a chissel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the bolt or the staple that had been forced? - A. It was the staple that was forced back, what the bolt goes into.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it an open staple or a covered one? - A. A covered one.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that it was the covered staple and not the bolt that was pushed back? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it fastened with screws or nails? - A. I never looked.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable of the city of London; on Thursday the 15th of December, I went to the prisoner's apartments with Tipper, Cartwright, and the prosecutor; the prisoner was not at home the first time I went; he came in in about three quarters of an hour; when we went into the room, there was his wife and child asleep in the bed; we all went in; Hickie, the prosecutor, said, that is your prisoner; I said, my friend, I have got a warrant to apprehend you for a felony; I shewed him the warrant: I searched him, but could find nothing about him; we searched, and finding nothing, we desired him to take his wife and children off the bed, which he did; I then took the bed off from the bedstead, and between the bed and the sacking of the bedstead I found these new things not made up, and between the bedstead and the wall, I found a purse, (produces it); when I pulled the bedstead a way it fell upon the ground; Hickie saw it, and said immediately this is my purse; I asked him what he knew it by before I let him see it, he said there was a hole at each end that a half guinea or a seven-shilling piece would tumble through; he said he made it himself on board a ship at sea, and that it was a worsted purse; I looked at it, and found it so; the prisoner said his child had had it for two or three days throwing about the room: I don't recollect that he said any thing else; we then took him to the Compter, and I went back again and searched her, and in her petticoat, in the plait sewed up in the back part, I found two guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a witness upon this indictment, and a constable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you contribute towards the expences of this prosecution? - A. The prosecutor has got some money owing to him, he could not raise money enough, Tipper laid down some money for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prosecutor ever since that repaid the money that was paid down? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell the prosecutor, or any body in your presence, that there was a forty pound reward? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What part of the money did you lay down? - A. Fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did the other constable lay down? - A. The same; and Tipper laid down the same; he got all he could himself.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he bring? - A. He brought a guinea, and some shillings afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. If it has been said that he advanced all the money for the prosecution, that is not true? - A. It is not true.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard any of the officers hint to him any thing about a reward of 40l.? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You and he were old acquaintance, I suppose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you were kind enough to advance this money to a stranger, merely upon the strength of his word? - A. We made up what money was to pay to carry on the prosecution; we knew he had that five pounds owing to him on board the ship, and he bears a very good character at the India-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found this purse, the prisoner said his child had been suffing it about the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140060"/>Q. Did he not add, that Cochran had given it to the child to throw about? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were holes in the purse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore a very likely place for a man to put seven-shilling pieces in? - A. His money was in a bag.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Before you laid down this money, you enquired what was his character at the India-house? - A. Yes; Tipper was there two or three times.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you contribute towards the expences of this prosecution, or lend him money? - A. I lent him the money; if he got the five pounds before he went to sea, he was to return it to us; if he did not, we were to stand to the loss of it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a licensed horse-boiler: On the 30th of October last, a brown mare was brought to me by the prisoner at the bar, between seven and eight in the morning, it was a brown muzzled mare, and black in the body; I never saw the prisoner before, but I knew him again immediately; he told me his name was Edwards, that he lived at Fulham, and kept an errandcart; he said, she was a kicker, and of no use but to be knocked on the head; I enquired several things of him, and, from his answers, I thought he was an honest man; I gave him a guinea for her; I did not see him again for a fortnight or three weeks, when he brought me another horse; Johnson had given me a description of his horse, and when he came again, I stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prosecutor on the 30th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he give you a description of the brown mare that he lost? - A. Yes; but I did not take particular notice of the mare as to know her again from his description.</p>
               <p>Q. It is rather a singular thing. I think, that you should not? - A. I did not know the mare from his description till I examined the skin and the foot, and then I preserved it till the man came again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you examine the skin and the foot that day? - A. Yes, almost directly, but he was gone.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. But you had Johnson's address? - A. Yes; he told me he lived at Putney.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sort of a mare was it? - A. It answered his description, I don't know that it is his mare now.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found it was his mare, why did you kill her? - A. I had killed her before Johnson came.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did find that was his mare, why did you not send him word? - A. I thought it was of no use when the mare was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what sort of a mare it was? - A. It was a brown crop mare; the leg of it was white, and the remainder black; it had a quitter, a thing that comes just in the hoof, and a bar shoe on.</p>

             sworn. - I am a journeyman smith and farrier, at Hammersmith; I cannot recollect the time, it might be two months ago when Johnson brought the horse's foot to me; I know it by having a quitter and a bar shoe, I fitted the shoe myself, (produces the hoof and the shoe); there is no mark to the shoe; I had not a bar shoe in the shop, and I took a common shoe and brought the heel round, and that took out the mark; when I shoed her, she was in Mr. Harwood's possession; she was a dark brown mare.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you never make any bar shoe for any body else? - A. Oh yes, but I know the shoe, it is my own make; I altered it, and put fresh nail-holes in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. If you had seen the shoe, without the hoof, would you have sworn to it? - A. I would not with to have done that, because the shoe is partly worn out.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Johnson.) Q. How long had you had that mare? - A. Eight or ten days; I bought her of Mr. Harwood, at Hammersmith.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am as innocent as the child unborn; I bought the horse of a man of the name of Roberts; he said he lived at Fulham; and since I have been in custody, my friends have enquired, but have not been able to find him. To my God, and to you Gentlemen of the Jury, I must trust my cause.</p>

               <p>Q. How long is it since you have been out of that employ? - A. It might be about two years; it must be two or more.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you particularly intimate with him? - A. Yes, particular friends during the time I was in the Post-office, and since that we have been upon terms of friendship.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be dismissed from the Post-office? - A. There was a little misunderstanding between the Gentlemen of the office, there was something lost as I understand, and they went to my house to search it, and at that time thre were half a dozen spoons, and they took them away.</p>
               <p>Court Q. A misunderstanding about what? - A. About a note that was lost from some letter in my walk, I believe. and on account my not giving them that answer which they wished, which was to know where I got the spoons from.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who do you mean by they? - A. The officers; I sent them there of my own will, there was no warrant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. In consequence of that you were dismissed from your employ? - A. I was suspended till I gave a satisfactory account.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A satisfactory account of what? - A. Where the spoons came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give that satisfactory account? - A. I told the Comptroller I had no objection to inform him in private, but the officers should lnot be so far satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were discharged? - A. No; I was suspended, not discharged, as Mr. Harris can prove.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the 6th of June last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner that morning? - A. Yes, at the Dolphin public-house, the corner of Cannon-street, near the new road, St. George's in the East.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning? - A. To the best of my recollection, between tell and eleven o'clock; but I am sure it must be half after ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and the prisoner at that time? - A. I called in, not by appointment,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140066"/>but by accident; the prisoner was there; he informed me that he had got something of value.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the house, or when you came out of the house? - A. When we came out of the house together, I asked him what it was, and he produced me a check, after we had walked, I may say, the fourth part of a mile down the road.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at this check?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I object to the production of this piece of paper as not being stamped.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. With respect to that, it might avail my friend, if it was produced as a note, but as a mere piece of paper to be identified as a thing shewn to the witness I contend it will not; if I were calling upon the witness to look at it as a note it might be a different thing; but I only offer this in order to connect it with the letter containing that piece of paper.</p>

               <p>Mr. Woodfall. I will not detain your Lordship a minute, only to suppose a case; a man is indicted for stealing a letter, containing a half-guinea, and that which was supposed to be half-a-guinea, proved to be a piece of lead, of course that indictment could not be sustained; then, suppose a fresh indictment is preferred for stealing the letter, and that dump were to be produced as evidence of that letter having been stolen, no reference could possibly be had to the original indictment for stealing the half-guinea, but I contend it would be good evidence of a fact to trace the allegation of the letter having been in possession of the parry who clearly had that dump in his possession. That is a case perfectly analagous to this; it is to be considered as a piece of blank paper with marks upon it, sufficient to bring it to the recollection of the witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbott. My Lord, I am very well aware of the extensive words of the Stamp-act, but we contend-that the words are no more than this; that a paper requiring a stamp, shall not be given in evidence as a good and valid instrument. My Lord, it is perfectly clear, notwithstanding the very large and extensive words of the statute, that such a piece of paper may be given in evidence for some purposes, because it may be produced in evidence, to convict the party drawing it, which, if the words of the statute were to be taken literally, could not be done. It is perfectly clear from several decided authorities, that such a piece of paper may be given in evidence in a criminal prosecution for forgery, and I apprehend it is upon this principle, that it is the nature of the crime of forgery, that the instrument should be false and counterfeit. My Lord, we do not offer this in evidence, as a good and valid draft, but one of the witnesses having informed your Lordship that he put that piece of paper into a letter; we now offer it to prove, that that piece of paper was taken out of the letter by the prisoner himself, and for that purpose, as it seems to me, it is of no sort of consequence whether this be a valid stamp or no, we only shew that this bit of paper was put into the letter, and we offer it in evidence as a medium to shew, that that letter was in his possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Myers followed on the same side, and contended that it ought to be admitted as evidence, to prove, that as it was in the possession of the prisoner, he must also have been in possession of the letter which contained it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My Lord, my objection is, that that paper-being produced, however they may with to call it waste-paper, is a thing bearing definition, that the law forbids to be given in evidence. There was one answer to this objection, which I with to get rid of immediately; that, supposing a half-guinea to be contained in a letter, and the party is indicted for stealing a letter, containing a half-guinea, which should turn out afterwards to be a mere dump, or false coin; it is said, that that piece of false coin may be produced in evidence. - To be sure it may, but it is begging the question to assume that in argument, because that dump is a thing which no law of the land forbids you to produce in evidence, that is therefore a plain begging of the question, because a dump is a thing which they might legally produce, and which it would be extremely important to produce in evidence. The witness calls this piece of paper a check, I say, they cannot produce that, unless it is legalized by having received the proper stamp which a check ought to have, and if this be the check, the witness has himself proved to your Lordships, that that is a thing not to be received in evidence, it is a thing that cannot be produced in evidence, because the law says it shall not be produced in evidence, not shall it be pleaded, nor of any avail in any Court of Justice whatever.</p>
               <p>My Lord, it has been said, that there have been decided cases in which this point has been ruled, but I rather think those cases that have been alluded to, of Hawkeswood, and other cases, were put upon the instrument itself, that it was not a valid instrument, and therefore not capable of having the effect of availing the party in law to obtain the money which the forgery was intended to defraud the party of, which, therefore, cannot be the subject of an indictment for forgery; but I don't think that any of those determinations have gone upon the question, is this admissible or not? - I am informed there was a case in the Court of Exchequer, at nist prias, where an instrument was produced, merely in order to enable the party to ascertain the fact of another transaction having taken place, and not as an acquittance for money, and there my Lord Chief Baron Eyre refused to receive it in evidence, because the law had said it shall not be offered in evidence. My learned friend, Mr. Gurney, has furnished me with the case, he was present when it was so determined, and therefore I contend, with considerable confidence, that it will not be decided against me ultimately, and perhaps your Lordships may think that there is room for after-consideration.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Graham. Are you quite sure that those are the words of the statute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The words of the Statute, 3l. Geo. III. ch. 25. sec. 13. are not that it shall not be pleaded, or given in evidence in any Court to enable the party to recover it; but that it shall not be pleaded or given in evidence in any Court, and then comes a subsequent clause, which says it shall not be good, useful, or available in law or equity. Upon these grounds I contend before your Lordships, that this statute prohibits it's being given in evidence for any purpose whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Lawrence. The question, how far a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140067"/>note unstamped may be given in evidence, has been under the consideration of all the Judges in the case of Moreton, which ruled the case of Cotin Reculist. The Judges were of opinion, and it was expressly so stated by Mr. Justice Grose in delivering the opinion of the Judges upon that case, that the note ought not to be received in any way to make it a valid instrument, but that it was evidence for collateral purposes. Now, the answer given by Mr. Knowlys, to the argument of Mr. Abbott, with respect to the penalty, I think does not hold, because it is to be construed in the most extensive way. - Look at the object of this Act of Parliament, it was a revenue law to lay a duty by means of these stamps, but not to enable persons to commit larcenies, and all sorts of crimes with impunity, that was not the object. We are of opinion that the evidence should be received; if between this and the first day of the term, any doubt should strike our minds, we will certainly take the opinion of the Judges, but at present we have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. (To Hill.) Q. He gave you that check? - A. I do not know that this was the check, it is impossible for me to swear that, I wrote nothing upon it, it was for the same sum, it answers the description; a few minutes afterwards, a letter was shown to me by the prisoner, but what became of it I do not know; I saw the prisoner tear the letter, but I cannot be certain whether it was that or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a memory of what was written upon the paper which he produced to you? - A. To the best of my recollection, it is a long time since, it was from one brother to another, with an enclosure of 200l. it began, dear brother; I do not know the date, I know it was signed Thomson, but I cannot recollect the christian name; it was directed to Mr. Thomson at Mile-end.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue together then? - A. If I staid ten minutes, it was the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did he put that first piece of paper into your hand? - A. To get it changed; the next day I went with it to Stratford- place, to the banker's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tender that piece of paper at the banker's? - A. Yes; I received a 100l. a 40l. and a 50l. Bank of England notes, and 10l. in cash.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass at the banker's shop? - A. Yes; he asked me if I received it for Mr. Thomson, and I told him, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had got these notes, where did you go? - A. To the Bank of England to change those for small notes.</p>
               <p>Q. When change did you get from the Bank - was it the same day? - A. Yes, to the best of my recollection; I got, I think, forty-five 2l. notes, and four 25l. notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you desired at the Bank to write your name upon any one of the notes? - A. Yes, upon one.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you put upon it? - A. Welch, Kensington-grove.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any letters denoting a christian name? - A. Yes, J. or P. or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner after this? - A. At the Black-horse, Fieldgate-street, Whitechapel, about seven o'clock in the evening; I told him I had changed the notes, and he wanted some of the money, but I would not give him any that night, except four or five guineas; on the Sunday morning, I called upon him at his lodgings, and gave him ten 2l. notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes did you give him, either that or the next day? - A. On Tuesday morning, I gave him ten 2l. notes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes did you give him either that or the next day? - A. On the Tuesday morning, I gave him ten more 2l. notes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did you dispose of the other notes? - A. I exchanged them at different shops.</p>
               <p>Q. For the purpose of getting rid of them? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how much the prisoner had of notes and cash? - A. Ninety pounds exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you knew the prisoner was apprehended? - A. I cannot be certain, but I think it was the Wednesday fen'night after.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pay him a visit in the Computer? - A. I called and intended to pay him a visit, but I could not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was it that you heard of yourself being enquired after? - A. I knew it the next day, I think it was; I went away on the Saturday morning, and therefore it must have been two days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you from town, before you were apprehended? - A. Five weeks, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Part of these notes were exchanged by you, were any exchanged by any other person? - A. Yes; some by Mrs. Sturgess, but she was perfectly ignorant of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how you passed the 6th and 7th of June? - A. On the 6th, I was to attend the surveyor at the chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the surveyor of excise, Mr. Hindes, in company with the prisoner, any time that day? - A. Yes, at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to the surveyor of excise, for you? - A. I sent him with a message to beg him to assist me in my duty, for I had particular business that morning, and would come to him as soon as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. What particular business was this? - A. To get the money, but I did not go that morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you send the prisoner from the Dolphin, down to Hackney? - A. I did; upon looking at the note, I discovered that it was the 6th day of the month, the note was dated the 7th; I never looked at the month, I discovered that the note was dated wrong, it was dated the 7th; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140068"/>thought it was the 7th of June, instead of that, it was over due a month.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I like to have people's own words in their accounts of transactions - while you were in the employ of the Post-office, there was what you call a little misunderstanding? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, that little misunderstanding was merely telling you that you were suspected of having stolen a ten pound note out of some letter? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What then? - A. It was a 100l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your superior in office, in this little misunderstanding, told you there was some suspicion of a one hundred pound note being missing? - A. It was a misunderstanding, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Q. This little misunderstanding produced some officers to search your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were desired to account for the possession of some silver spoons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you tell us, you were suspended but not discharged, till you could account satisfactorily to your superiers? - A. That is exactly the case.</p>
               <p>Q. You were suspended but not discharged? - A. I was not discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that you were not discharged? - A. The case was, that I got a better situation.</p>
               <p>Q. That is to say, you resigned? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Before they could determine whether they would turn you out of place or not, you resigned? - A. I never went into the employment afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the Excise-office, were you not? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not appeared to attend in your duty there since? - A. I have been in confinement ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you come from prison here? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You have at least made use of 100l. out of this 200l.? - A. Yes, and it cost me above 100l. more.</p>
               <p>Q. Running from justice, you know, is an expensive thing? - A. I should never have gone from the place, but by the persuasion of my friends; I positively meant to surrender to the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do it? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, instead of surrendering to give information, you absconded, and was pursued from place to place, for about six weeks; I dare say it was.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were called to account about this business of the Post-office, I will ask you, though you left your employment there, have you not been frequently in the Penny-post Letter-office? - A. I have been twice.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no business there? - A. No business whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever turned out of that place? - A. Never, I was ordered to go out; I was desired by Mr. Harris to walk out.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not turned out, that is, not laid hold of by the collar, and kicked out, but you were desired to go out? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Those who are in that office can reach the table of course? - A. It is impossible without the notice of letter-carriers.</p>
               <p>Q. Things are to be done sometimes, unobserved? - A. It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know, that by giving evidence against this man now at the bar, you exempt yourself from all prosecution? - A. I received a letter at the time I was taken; signifying the same.</p>
               <p>Q. And not till then did you come forward? - A. No, nor would not; then they over persuaded me in protecting a woman that knew nothing of it; the first word Mr. Parkin said to me, when I was apprehended, was, to save myself, and become an evidence.</p>

Yes; on the 5th of June, Hill requested leave of absence the next morning, the 6th. till ten o'clock; I left word at the chamber that I was going to Mr. Wright's, a wine and brandy merchant, at Hackney, with his books on survey, and he was to meet me when I had got to Church-street; I met with the prisoner between ten and eleven, and he said, Mr. Hyde, I have come from Mr. Hill to ask your leave of absence till noon, past twelve o'clock, this day; I granted the same, and I went on to Mr. Wright's, and Mr. Pooley went in along with me to the said house; I began to take the brandy stock, and in about five minutes in came Mr. Hill; I said to him, Mr. Hill, your friend has been here to ask leave of absence for you till past twelve; Mr. Pooley was close by me at the time; I proceeded on my business, and Mr. Pooley and my officer withdrew into the yard, and I went into the cellar to take the wine stock; they were both talking together; they followed me into the cellar; I proceeded on my business there, and Mr. Hill and Mr. Pooley drank a glass of white wine together; a very few minutes afterwards, he said good day to Mr. Hill, and good day to me, and went away; I saw him no more that day; the next day, on the 7th of June, at evening, past five o'clock, I saw them both together at the Black Horse Fieldgate-street, very near Whitechapel church.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say about it? - A. He said he had passed a bad note, and was taken to the office; he said he had it from James, and that he had passed many for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Remember you were examined here yesterday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you recollect was it that you had this conversation with the prisoner? - A. The 18th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. That conversation was considerably after the time that this man was supposed to have uttered this note? - A. It was after the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When this conversation took place, there was nobody present but the prisoner and you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there could be nobody to contradict you? - A. There was nobody else by.</p>

               <p>Q. And you and he and James were to go out to negociate some notes? - A. We were, but I was too late.</p>
               <p>Q. And I understand you to say, that the manner in which it was to be done, was for persons to go into the shop, carrying but a single note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you were sworn to tell the truth, and the whole truth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say one syllable of this yesterday? - A. I was not asked.</p>
               <p>Court. The witness speaks the whole truth, when he answers all the questions put to him by the Counsel who has the conduct of the cause.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Who employed you in this business? - A. Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you are not to be paid for it? - A. I never asked for any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you expect it or not, aye or no? - A. I do not look for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Has it happened to you to be accused for any felony yourself? - A. No, nor tried.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you tried for in the country? - A. I was not tried at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not sent to Bridewell, in the country? - A. That was about some pork; they swore to that property which I had bought and sold again three days before they came after it; they swore to my own property.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in prison? - A. A month; I offered five guineas to take up the man that had sold it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you discharged out of prison? - A. There was a man in prison, and he opened the place, and both came out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen to you that you were accused of any offence in town, of coining, or any thing of that sort? - A. There was a press and tools taken from me, but they were a press and tools that were not mine, they belonged to an engraver, and it was used in cutting buttons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. You never were prosecuted? - A. No.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Did he produce to you a way-bill of the 27th of November? - A.

            ? - A. No such fare is accounted for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you particularly caution and desire him to be particular as to that way-bill? - A. Particulary so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140073"/>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Are Mr. Pratt and you joint partners all the way? - A. No; I am the proprietor of the coach from London to Buckingham, and Mr. Pratt from Buckingham to Banbury; the distance between London and Banbury is agreed between me and my partner to be seventy-seven miles, my share is sixty-one miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Your share of what? - A. Of what the coach earns; suppose the coach earns seventy-seven pounds in a week, in four weeks, after the duty, the expences of the tolls, and the use of the coach are deducted from it, I should take sixty-one pounds and my partner would take sixteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you take the whole earnings of the coach? - A. The whole earnings of the coach are calculated upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Instead of proportioning upon miles, you have a certain share upon the whole earnings? - A. Yes; I have sixty-one shares out of seventy-seven.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same proportion you are answerable for loss as well as profit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Your business, like any other business, is divided into seventy-seven shares, of which you have sixty-one? - A. On that coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You, however, having so many shares, have the sixty-one miles nearest your own dwelling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All the expence of the first sixty-one miles is borne by you? - A. No; the horses have nothing to do with the nature of a stage-coach account, each person upon the ground that he horses a coach finds his own horses; the duty, the tolls, and other incidental expences are borne in an equal proportion according to the number of miles. I will state to your Lordship the manner in which we settle stage-coach accounts; we settle every four weeks, the nett is then divided by the number of miles that the coach goes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you both contribute towards the expences? - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Who hired the prisoner, you or Mr. Pratt? - A. I hired him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the sole controul over him? - A I had the greatest controul over him.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not go so far as Mr. Pratt's dwelling? - A. Not as my servant; I believe he has gone the whole way; I hired both the coachmen, and they were paid out of the joint earnings of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no other partner in your share? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mr. Pratt any body concerned with him in his share? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. The coachman driving from London to Aylesbury would not come to you with money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever account to you for any fares between London and Aylesbury on the 27th of November? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. The coachman was Mr. Fagg's servant, and not your's? - A. Both jointly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consider yourself as having a power to dismiss him? - A. Whenever I pleased.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the driver of the coach that day? - A. The prisoner at the bar; he told me the fare was nine shillings, and I paid him nine shillings, by getting change of him for a two pound Bank of England note, giving one shilling for himself; I had been travelling by the same coach before, with the same coachman.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That nine shillings you paid for the fare of the coach? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Did Mr. Fagg know of your intention? - A. Yes, he did over night.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any understanding between you, that you are to have it returned? - A. No, there was not, upon my oath.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am clerk to Messrs. Price and Aubrey, of Salisbury-square, Fleet-street, attornies: On the 6th of December I went by the Banbury coach from the Green Man and Still, to Uxbridge; I never saw Mr. Fagg till the 6th of December, nor Mr. Pratt till a day or two ago; when I saw Mr. Fagg, it was after I had been to Uxbridge and back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made Mr. Fagg acquainted with your intention of going to Uxbridge, before you set out for Uxbridge? - A. Certainly not; I had never seen them before; the prisoner at the bar drove the coach; I got down at the White Horse, at Uxbridge, from inside the coach; the prisoner charged me five shillings, which I paid him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you acquaint Mr. Fagg, upon your return on the 6th, that you had been a passenger, and what you had paid? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are a limb of the law - you are to be an attorney? - A. I believe I shall very shortly.</p>
               <p>Q. You are what is called a fagging clerk? - A. No, I do not fag much.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in their employ? - A. Six weeks; before that I was with Mr. Edmonds, of the Exchequer office of Pleas, for more than twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent you to Uxbridge? - A. Mr. Dixon, of the One Bell, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. A friend of Mr. fagg's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not he give you money too? - A. Yes, he gave me a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You expended five shillings going out, and five shillings coming home, and the rest was for your dinner? - A. Yes, and my breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. This was from a pure love of the public; you did not wish to have any reward for it? - A. No, I did not know what I was to go for; I was to take notice of what passed on the road.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who gave you the guinea? - A. Mr. Dixon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Who was there going down? - A. A lady and her son, going to Buckingham, and a gentleman, I do not know where he was going.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the skin of one of the sheep that had been in your master's field the night before? - A. Yes, it was a wether sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. There was no mark of Mr. Hulme's upon them? - A. No; he bought them with the letter S. upon them, and they remained with that mark.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you see any signs of blood? - A. Yes, in the pond; it is a small pond, the water was tinged with blood.</p>

Yes; about the middle of October, but I cannot be particular to the time, not thinking any thing would come of it; in a chest<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140079"/>in the room where Hale and Burgess slept, there was a fore quarter of mutton, a hind quarter, a leg, part of the loin, and some sat in the box.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Inside sat? - A. Yes, and a shoulder wrapped up in a coverlid under the bed; the day before that they dressed a neck, a breast, and a loin.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. I saw Hale and Kemp dressing it; they cut up part of the neck into steaks, and the breast they boiled afterwards for their dinners, which gave me a suspicion there was more meat in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the meat in the chest? - A. Yes, I took it all out; my mistress had a suspicion that there was more meat in the house, because they had such a plenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe it so as to say whether it had the appearance of being cut up by a butcher? -</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him at all? - A. Yes, I first lost sight of him in the turning going up Miles's-lane, he had a comrade with him; as soon as I came out of the shop, I saw two soldiers; the cask was carried home, and I put a mark upon it; I am sure it is the cask that was stolen. (The cask was produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Q. Who was that man? - A. The prisoner at the bar; I asked him what he had got there; he said he had nothing but his own property; I asked him to let me see it, and then he threw it off his shoulder; his great coat was off, and the lead was wrapped up in it; then I asked him how he came by it, and he said he found it; at last he said, I will tell you the truth, I got it while I was doing a job at Kew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to induce him to confess? - A. No, I did not; then I asked him whether the people where he was doing a job knew of his taking it, or whether it was his own property to take; he said, no, it was not his own, they did not know of his taking it, and he wished he had never seen it; I took him down to what we call our cage, at Brentford, and put him in, he carred the lead; I then took the lead to the beadle's house, his name is

             sworn. - I am a shoemaker, at Brentford: On Thursday the 1st of this month, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to the beadle's house for the lead.</p>
               <p>Plastine. I had the lead from the beadle's in the morning, I delivered it to Polycutt.</p>
               <p>Polycutt. I had the lead from the watchman, and carried it to Mrs. Trimmer's, in Old Brentford; I observed the appearance of the lead having been taken from the ridge of the house, it was rolled up, and I unrolled it as flat as I could, and fitted it; it appeared to fit as nearly as it could, but could not make it exactly flat, as it was so wrinkled.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that that lead had been taken from the ridge? - A. No; I weighed the lead, there were forty-eight pounds and a quarter of it; I have had the lead ever since. (Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Had you been acquainted with the house and the manner in which it was leaded? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The officer gave you every thing that was found upon the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not give you any cutting knife? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear that that lead came from Mrs. Trimmer's house? - my coat may fit many a man that it was not made for? - A. It is the same sort of lead, I cannot swear that it is the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Having smoothed it as well as you could, have you any doubt that that is the lead which came from that house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you compare the nail holes? - A. Yes, and they corresponded as near as they could.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. My mother's name is Sarah; the house from which the lead was taken was her house; I was present when the last witness fitted the lead to the ridge, it had not been cut but ripped and tore away; just at the corner of the ridge, there was a little nail-hole, which is unusual, which tallied exactly, that part was not bent out of it's proper form, the rest was.</p>
               <p>Q. From your examination of the place, and of the lead, have you any doubt that that is the lead taken from your mother's house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that lead safe the night before? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon before had you seen it - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was this one whole piece? - A. Yes; there was more lead loose, but not taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. That lead might have been loosened a month before for any thing you know? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18010114-72-verdict404" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Who is the landlord of the house? - A. His name is Dempsey, he lives in the same street; I have the back-room on the ground-floor, a young woman, who is here, lodges in the front-room, the house is let out in tenements; I go out a washing, and take in washing; I went out about nine o'clock on the 8th of January, and left my door padlocked; I came home about eleven o'clock, and found the door locked as I left it, and the prisoner sitting upon the bed-side; the window-shutters were broke open, I suppose he got in that way, the window must have been shoved up, it is an inside shutter; there is a long passage from the street-door, and my room window looks into the backyard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. No; I might have seen him, but I was not acquainted with him; the bed and bed clothes were entirely gone; I asked him how he came there, and he said, as he came through the yard, he thought it was some little out-house, where he could be till the morning, as he had no place to be in; I then called for assistance, but he got away, I did not see him again till the next night, between six and seven o'clock; I saw him just go by the door, and then I had him detained, while I sent for Rogers and Riley, two officers belonging to Shadwell-office.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of light had you in the room? - A. There was no light at all, the fire was gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you know the man then? - A. Because, when I opened the door, I had got a light from the young woman in the front room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many minutes were you in the room with him? - A. Ten minutes or not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing his person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man you saw that that night? - A. Yes, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things? - A. No, I cannot hear any thing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have been dark when you saw him the night after? - A. Yes; but I knew him by his dress.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - A. In a blue jacket and trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an uncommon dress in your part of the town? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body else here who saw him the first night? - A. Yes;

             sworn. - I live at No. 18, Denmark-street; I saw the prisoner in the young woman's room when she opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him? - A. I am sure he is the same young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What light had you? - A. I gave the young woman a candle to light her to open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you an opportunity of observing him? - A. I dare say, twenty minutes, for she asked him what business he had there, and he said, he thought it was an out-house, where he could sleep all night; the bed, blankets and bolsters were all gone.</p>

             sworn. - I live at Tottenhamhigh-cross, about three miles from Mr. Duckless; the prisoner came to my house on the 5th of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner offered me a table-spoon for sale; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140085"/>him how he came by it; he said it was his own, and I said, I doubt you stole the spoon; I asked him where he was quartered; he told me at the Cock, at Hounsfield; that is the name of the place where the prosecutor lives; Mr. Duckless keeps it; then I said, I will stop you and the spoon both; I went across the high-road for the constable, and left him in my shop, it was only just across the road, and when I had got the constable we saw him, and I gave charge of him.(The officer produced the spoon in two pieces.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told him I had bought it of a travelling man on the road, and gave 6s. for it.</p>
               <p>Hart. He said so before the Magistrate, but he said no such thing to me.(The spoon deposed to by Mrs. Duckless.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. She would not swear to the spoon before the Magistrate, till the Magistrate said he would send her to the cage if she did not, and rather than leave her children she swore to it.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the prosecutrix.) Q. Had you any doubt about the spoon. - A. None.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep barrelled oysters in your cellar? - A. No, they are always kept in the shop; they must have been taken from the cellar where the oysters are washed, and then packed and secreted; the oysters that I had in the morning were Whitstable Natives; I am sure it is my barrel; I have not opened the barrel, and the direction upon it I believe to be his own hand-writing, (opens the barrel); these are Whitstable Natives.</p>

             sworn. - I am the master of the boy and of the prisoner; I am a farmer at Hadley; Castle has been with me three years and upwards, and Leach since Michaelmas last; on Sunday morning, the 14th of December, I got up early in the morning, about six o'clock, and missed the prisoner; after making some search and enquiry after him, I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment from the box; I immediately called up my next neighbour, and we went in search of him; he was overtaken at Colney, in the road to St. Alban's, with the property upon him, which property was brought back with him, and has been in the care of the constable till now.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself? - A. He made very little excuse, scarce any; he had nothing to say against me as a matter; I met with him in the Isle of Sheppy in the greatest distress, and I took him and cloathed him; his father had deferted him, and he was without money and without friends. (James Cox, the constable, produced the property, which was deposed is by Castle.)</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. My husband keeps the White Swan, East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor and the prisoner? - A. Yes: On the 23d of Dec. In the evening, the prosecutor and the prisoner came to my house, and called for a quartern of gin, I came to the bar and served it; not long after my servant came and told me there was another quartern of gin wanted; in the course of half an hour after the girl was gone out, the prosecutor asked for a pint of five-penny.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see him at that time? - A. Yes, I was sitting in the parlour; he asked for change for a 2l. note, and put down a piece of paper; I told him I could not change it, and I dare say he had smaller change; he then gave me a half guinea, I founded it upon the table, and gave him change, with some halfpence; he then said, I won't take them, I have got halfpence in my pocket; I took my halfpence and change back, I told him to take care of his money, and put it into his pocket before I took the light away.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you give him that caution? - A. Because he laid down his note on the table, and he appeared to be in liquor; I saw no more of him till the next morning, they both came with a constable, he was in liquor then; he called for a quartern of gin, and I served it him; he asked the prisoner, will you drink with me, and the poor girl was crying, and refused a great many times to drink; he said, drink with me, and I won't hurt you; upon that I said the man speaks very good,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140090"/>drink a little, may be he won't hurt you; they stood talking some time, and then he promised her, with very sacred oaths, that if she would confess, he would not hurt her; she cried very much, and said very little, and seemed very much affected; then after that he turned upon his heel, and said to the officer, take her away, hang her; I said, I hope not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Court. Q. Your husband keeps this White Swan? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go into a room? - A. No, they sat in the tap-room.</p>

               <p>(To Bassett). Q. Did you hear this man, with sacred oaths, promise he would not hurt her? - A. Yes he did, provided she gave the watch and the note back.</p>

I am millwright to Mr. Shepley; the prisoner at the bar worked at the mill, he was at work at one of the presses in the mill on the Saturday night till nine o'clock in the evening; I can speak positively to this iron keep, but to the rest I cannot swear to; I have no doubt they are ours; I know the keep by having chopped a little off the flaunches, in consequence of an accident, that I might get the mill going as quick as I could, and it is not done in a workman-like manner; it was lying in the cake warehouse on the Saturday night; I have got the fellow to it.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I did not mean to take that cloth to sell it, to make a property of it, I meant to have made me a waistcoat, and got a coat out of pledge, because I thought my garb was so mean, that it kept me out of employ; I have a wife and four children, I have been been out of employ for four months; I hope you will consider me an object of pity more than any thing else.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This was done openly, so that you could see it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other men there? - A. The shop was full.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father is a tailor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was one of those honest men that did not strike their work? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father did strike? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father is employed instead of the prisoner? - A. Not instead of the prisoner, he is there.</p>
               <p>Q. There has been a little bit of a war between these honest men who have discharged their duty; they have been set upon by such men as your father, who have thought sit to strike? - A. I do not know any thing about that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that it is a general rule amongst those that strike, to ill treat those who do not strike upon every occasion? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there is such a thing in the trade as cabbage? - A. Yes; I have heard of such a thing as a bit of thread, or any thing of that sort.</p>

               <p>Q. The garment is to be cut out from a piece of cloth, and if a man can cut it to so much advantage as to save a little, and put it in his pocket, the master is no loser? - A. I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a description of men in the trade called dunge, and they cannot cut out with so much advantage as those that are more skilful? - A. I don't know any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When cabbage comes to be explained, it is stealing, is it not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ever understood that the cutters had a right to cabbage cloth? - A. No.</p>

Pearce: In consequence of information from Stalker, Hoare was called out, and I charged him upon suspicion of having cloth in his pocket; he was very much struck, and searched his pockets willingly himself, and then produced this remnant of scarlet cloth; he said, he hoped it would be overlooked, being a trifling matter; I told him it could not be overlooked; I told him to go into the room again, and instead of that, he went away without his hat, and did not return again, (produces the cloth); it is of the same quality with the cloth we had, and he had been cutting the same kind of cloth that day; I have no doubt of its being my master's property; I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him at the office about two days after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. - Q. If you cut out a coat from cloth that I give you, and you had such a piece as this left, would you return it to me? - A. I am no tailor.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it ever returned to the customer? - A. This is a very different business; every cutter is to cut the cloth to the best advantage; I know nothing at all about the tailoring trade.</p>
               <p>Q. You never employed a tailor yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any returned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that man's name, for I should like to employ such a tailor? - A. He is gone to sea, his name was Matthews; a man is to make as many garments as he can out of a piece of cloth, and what is left is to be used up.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am foreman to Messrs. Pearce; I received that piece of cloth from the prisoner, and gave it to Roberts; he said he saw it lying there, thought it was of no consequence, and put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When there were such pieces left, was that considered as a perquisite to the person who cut out the garment? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. In your line of business that is never permitted? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. The cloth is to be worked up as much as in can; are they allowed to take the remnants? - A. Not at Mr. Pearce's; they make a return of it in their accounts, and then it goes towards another sized garment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Were you bred a tailor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never known this done at Mr. Pearce's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But have you not known it done by tailors? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Very common, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that there has been a new rule, that the masters are to have the cabbage and the men are not to have any? - A. I don't know any thing of it; I did not understand my employers to be tailors, but army clothiers.(Nicholas Pearce proved the firm as stated in the indictment).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 13th of January I received an order to cut several coats from five foot six to six foot; I went to Strover for a piece of cloth, the length of it twenty-three yards and three quarters; there was a number of pieces for breast, facings, and different things, and that very boy, Stalker, was picking them out, and an old man said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140094"/>he would have a bit to mend his waistcoat; I said I should want them myself, most likely, and if, when I had got to the end, there was a bit left, I would give it him, and I put this in my pocket.</p>

I cannot say, for I was at Colchester three weeks of the time; I know the sheets by the make of them; the iron I know by the handle being broke, and the quilt I know; it has got a part of two old gowns of mine in it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he attempt to get away at all? - A. No, he did not: he persisted in it that he had not a guinea; the constable came, and upon my telling him that the prisoner had a guinea in his hand, he gave it him.</p>

Yes; he begged very hard that I would let him at liberty; and I said, if the master would answer for his appearance the next day, and he would drive the constable home in his coach, I should have no objection; I understand himself the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about this half-guinea? - A. He said he had taken it on Christmas-day, as a fate.</p>

I am an oyster-meter; on the 12th of January, the prisoner came on board the boat, the oysters were eighteen shillings a bushel; the prisoner gave Mr. Shrubsole nine shillings, he looked at them, and said; I think there is a rig here; he took hold of the nine shillings, handed them to me; when I looked at them, I found they were all one make; I began to rub one of them upon the oyster shovel, the prisoner said, don't rub them, give me them again, which made me more eager to rub them; I rubbed them all, and found them all to be bad; I asked him where he got them, he said, from his master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, in your hearing, say any thing about a hackney coachman? - A. No; he sadly wanted to go away; he told me, if I did not let him go, it would be worse for me; a constable was then sent for, and he was given charge of.</p>

               <p>Q. That is a drug that is used, I believe, in colouring and dying? - A. Yes, it is used but very little in London; we have sold it at seven shillings a pound to the trade; be the quantity what it will, that has been the price these two years.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a servant in your employ, of the name of Darbyshire? - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information you received from Darbyshire, did you go to the house of Marker, the defendant? - A. I did, with two constables, Wainwright and Hall, we had a search-warrant with us, on Wednesday evening the 26th of November last.</p>
               <p>Q. What business does he appear to carry on? - A. It has the appearance of a druggist's shop, there are bottles in the window, situated in Petticoat-lane, in the city of London; we went about three o'clock, Mr. Fullwood went with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the defendant a customer of yours? - A. No; I did not know there was such a person existing before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usually sold wholesale or retail? - A. What we sell to people who sell by retail, is three or four pounds at a time, and very small quantities, but what we principally sell in London is for shipping; Marker was in a littleroom adjoining the shop, he asked the officers what they wanted, and they said, to look over his house; he said, what do you want, the officers said, annatto; he said, do you want to buy any; I am not sure, but I think he said, I make it; I said, we want it, and we must see whether you have got any or not, and made towards the counter in the shop; they said, we must see what you have got in the drawers in your counter; he opened two drawers which contained nothing of that sort, they were the upper drawers of the counter; the officers said, we must see the lower drawers, he got his back against them, and was very much averse to opening them; they said, they must see into them; then, with a great deal of reluctance, he opened one a little way, and shut it up again immediately; we found a quantity of annatto in the counter, in these drawers; the officers then examined the drawers, and found a quantity of annatto in those drawers, there is about eighty pounds weight of it found in two large drawers, and some little in another place; upon looking at that, we believed it to be our property, some of it has got our original mark, we found it exactly according to the information we had from Darbyshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he continue in your service? - A. Yes, and we mean to continue him; the annatto is all marked when we manufacture it; but there is a great deal of it defaced, some totally, and some but little.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides these marks, have you any other reasons to know it to be your's? - A. Yes, the composition is such as I never saw it equalled by any body in the consistence of the colour and the quality of it; it is a particular article that I never saw made by any body; he said, as he said before, that he made annatto; we then took him before the Magistrate, and he was committed, and afterwards bailed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You first said, you believed the articles to be your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe also that you are the sole manufacturer of it? - A. Yes, of this quality.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know any body else in the city of London, or its environs, that manufactures annatto of the same quality? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that annatto of the same quality is not manufactured in the city of London, or it's environs? - A. Not to my knowledge, I never saw any.</p>
               <p>Q. He said at first when he came into the shop, that he made annatto? - A. Not at first.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might if be after? - A. In answer to the third question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he, after the annatto was put into the drawer, say, he made annatto? - A. He only said so once, I did not hear him say so a second time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I take it for granted, Marker said, as he said before, that he made annatto? - A. I stand corrected, I believe I did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the house, did you make it known to him that you had a search-warrant? - A. They told him they must look all over his house, for they had an authority.</p>
               <p>Q. Darbyshire, upon whose information all this case depends, you found had robbed you to a considerable degree? - A. I cannot say to what amount.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not robbed you to the amount of five pounds? - A. God knows what amount, I dare say a great many pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not been in the habit of robbing you for a considerable length of time? - A. I dare say he had.</p>
               <p>Q. How great a length of time did you learn, from his information, that he had been a thief to you, instead of a servant? - A. There was another man that lived with us that robbed us.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, how long Darbyshire stated to you that he had been robbing you? - A. It is impossible for me to say; he had been with me about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of that time had he been robbing you? - A. I don't suppose he robbed us at all, till that other man came into our employ, he was an extra man.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. In March last.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140102"/>Q. Soon after March, I suppose then, he commenced thief? - A. Soon after, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you any thing about the other man having robbed you, before you caught him? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. As to this extra man, as you call him, this extra thief, he never told you of it till he was detected? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell annatto by retail? - A. When people bring money, we never turn them away, but we are very seldom enquired of for it.</p>
               <p>Q. To oblige a customer, sometimes, you sell small quantities? - A. Any quantity they chuse.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a pretty good trade, I suppose? - A. Pretty well, but not so good as your's.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you could make that out-my friend stated in his opening, that it is used for colouring cheese? - A. Yes; what is used of it in London is for making picture-frames; cheese is coloured in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Cheese may be coloured with it in London? - A. Cheese is not made in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Oh yes, it is; I have eat very good cheese made in London-will not annatto in travelling easily lose its marks? - A. It may.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am in partnership with Mr. Jackson; I went with him and the officers to Marker's house, but my attention was principally paid to the drawers where the annatto was locked up; I called in the constables, and pointed to the drawers, according to the description that Darbyshire had given; Marker first of all said, he did not belong to the house; I immediately pointed to the drawers; Hall, the constable, said, he must look into those drawers; then immediately Abraham Marker came, as though he belonged to the house; there are two counters; these were the drawers in the left hand counter; Marker put himself against the drawers, and was averse to opening them; at last, with much ado, he opened two or three drawers, I cannot say how many, and there was no annatto there; Hall, the constable, insisted upon seeing the other drawers opened, he opened one of them a little way, and said, there is annatto, and shut it again immediately, and so he did several times; Hall, the constable, insisted upon having these drawers opened wide, that he might see; I desired it might be taken to the light, that I might see if it was our annatto, as I know the article so well, and I found that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. About what quantity was there? - A. About eighty pounds; as soon as ever it came to the light I knew it to have gone from our house, to be ours; he was then apprehended and carried before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Was Mr. Jackson by at the time that you heard Marker say he did not belong to the house? - A. He was in a little room, but whether he might hear that or not, I cannot say, I rather think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now and then, to oblige customers, you let small quantities go out of your house? - A. Very few want small quantities; it runs generally seven or fourteen pounds at a time, sometimes more and sometimes less.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it when they do go out in that way, they go out with other marks upon them? - A. They do; they make it a rule not to order it till it is wanted, because we can keep it better than they.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the Marshalmen of the city of London; I went with a search warrant to the house of the defendant with Wainwright and the prosecutor; the defendant's house is in the city of London; on the 26th of November last, we went through the shop into a back room, where the prisoner was then sitting with his wife; I enquired of the prisoner whether he was the master of the house; he replied what do you want; I then said again, do you belong to, or are you master of this house; he said, no; whether you are or not, says I, I am going to search the house; why, what do you want, says he, I am the master then; I told him we had come to look for some annatto; he said he had annatto, what did I want with it; I told him we must look at what he had got; he then said he made it; we then went into the room where Jackson's partner was, and I told the prisoner we must look in those drawers that were under the counter; the prisoner then opened some drawers at the top of the counter which did not contain annatto; I told him I must see the whole of the drawers opened; he then opened the drawers, and Mr. Jackson's partner said that was annatto; the prisoner said, you will spoil my goods, you will spoil my goods, and then went to shut the drawer again; I told him we must see the drawer out, which he was very loth to do; he then said it was not as he made it; Mr. Jackson and Mr. Fullwood claimed it; then we opened some more drawers, and we found some more; we did not take the whole of it away; Mr. Fullwood and Wainwright took it; we did not get the whole that is here till the next day; Marker said, I might go up stairs and see the stuff, and where it was worked; we went into his work-shop, and there was a tub with some stuff in it, that they told me was annatto; the prisoner desired us particularly to go up there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Mr. Knapp. - Q. Did you go in your present dress? - A. Yes; and Mr. Marker knew me, for he asked me how one of my partners did, that he had known many years.</p>

             sworn. - I have been in the service of Messrs. Jackson and Fullwood two years in April.</p>
               <p>Q. You are now with them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140103"/>Q. During the time you have lived there has Marker been a customer at your master's shop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of his having any annatto of your master's? - A. Yes; a fellow-servant of mine, of the name of Thomas, I think, Thomas Walton, I am not sure, had been with some annatto to Marker, and he persuaded me to go with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is that since you were persuaded to go with Thomas to Marker's? - A. I think the latter end of June or beginning of July; I am not positive; we both took some annatto.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The indictment charges the 20th of November.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you must confine yourself to some one time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. When was the last time you carried any annatto to Marker's? - A. I think Thursday, the 20th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. About what quantity did you take him then? - A. I think about four pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your master's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Marker know who you were? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know who you lived with? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he give you for that quantity? - A. One shilling a pound; he put it into a drawer under the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was it that your masters detected you in taking their goods away? - A. The Tuesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then give them any information of what you had been doing with this annatto? - A. Yes; I told them they would find it in the drawers under Mr. Marker's counter.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he known whose servant you were? - A. Ever since July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him how you came by the annatto? - A. Yes; I told him it was my masters' property; it was the annatto that we worked, and I told him that he knew how we came by it, and he said, very well, he would take it then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever say any thing to you about coming in company or alone? - A. Yes; when we both came together, he desired us not to come together again, because people would take notice of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he perfectly acquainted that you came dishonestly by it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. On the 20th of November was Walton with you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a little private transaction of your own? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you are saving yourself from prosecution by giving evidence to-day? - A. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I tell you that you do; you have had no promise from your master to remain in his service? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you do not understand now that you are to continue in his service? - A. I do not know but what I must be turned out.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave no account of this till your master detected you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, whatever Walton told you, you prosited by? - A. Yes, I followed it up, but I never profited much.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of

            ? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never sent any body to the desendant since the prosecution has been begun? - A. I never sent any body at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't know that by giving evidence to-day, you save yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought this a very honest thing, I suppose? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. However, the beaten track that was marked out for you, you followed? - A. Yes, I had been several times.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not say one word about it till you were found out? - A. No.(Wainwright produced the property.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Fullwood). Q. Point out the mark? - A. I know it as well by the quality as the mark quite; I never saw any like it before; ours are all marked with a P; most of these are obliterated; there are several with his name at one end, and my P at the other end; here is one that has A M at the one end, and my P obliterated at the other end; I have some with me that I have brought from home. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Have you also your marking-iron? - A. Yes. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Independent of that mark, is there any composition sufficient for you to swear to? - A. I would swear to it sooner from the quality than from the marks; I never saw any of such quality; besides, I know it by the peculiar smell, and the composition that keeps it from getting mouldy, and is very different in its flavour; I have tried the colours in water, and they exactly resemble one another both as to the quality of the colour, and as to the colour itself.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you tried any other experiment - there are some with only A M upon them; have you tried any of them? - A. Yes, and they correspond exactly.</p>
               <p>A. Did you go up stairs into Marker's house, where the tub was? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the contents of that tub appear to be annatto? - A. Yes; it appeared to be our annatto mixed, there were two sorts in the tub; it had got hard, and that was to soften it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ a person of the name of Weedon in your manufactory? - A. Yes; he has been eight years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. The marking-iron, with a P at the end of it, would be a very remarkable thing?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140104"/>- A. There might be a P, but I don't think any body can resemble the quality.</p>

               <p>Q. How came that? - A. I was not old enough, and my friends took me out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not run away? - A. I did all the same, because my friends took me away along with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Society know of your coming away - had you their consent? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did run away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother is dead now, is not she? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Deering. When this boy first came to me, he said it was his mother that sent him.</p>
               <p>Court. After that I think Mr. Knapp will not press it, after this boy has laid it upon the prisoner to screen his mother: you see all the circumstances that he states would be right beyond the possibility of detection; and if it had not been for this declaration of his, what in justice might have been done. <rs id="t18010114-115-verdict651" type="verdictDescription">
