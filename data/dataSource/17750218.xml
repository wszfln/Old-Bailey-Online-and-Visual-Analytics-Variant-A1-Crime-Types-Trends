               <p>Q. At what time did you first come acquainted with Mr. Priddle?</p>
               <p>Harris. He came to my father's house about a fortnight before I came to town. I came away on the 24th of August; Mrs. Priddle was in the country with him: they continued at our house a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other part of their family there?</p>

               <p>Q. How did you happen to come to town with Mr. Priddle?</p>
               <p>Harris. I went up one day into Mrs. Priddle's room, about a week before I came away, her asked me to pin some ribbands on the sleeves of her gown: further her told me, her should be very glad to have a young woman to run up and down stairs for her as a friend, and asked me if I chose to go to London. I said, I should like it very well; and I came to London with Mrs. Priddle.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your father's consent?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I had not: I had my mother's. I went with Mrs. Priddle on the 24th of August. Mr. Priddle did not accompany us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your father against your going?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, he was. I went with Mrs. Priddle in a returned chaise to Oxford, and from Oxford to London in the post coach. Mr. Priddle returned to town on the Friday after we got to London on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Court. I should be glad to know in general, how you lived in the family?</p>
               <p>Harris. I was not as a servant, I did any thing Mrs. Priddle ordered me to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she occasionnally order you to do the work of a servant?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, I generally made the beds, I never refused any thing her bid me do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever clean the house?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you dine with the servants?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I dined and supped with Mr. and Mrs. Priddle; I lived with them just as they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Priddle in town, on the night of the 17th of December?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, her went out of town on the Sunday before.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was the 17th?</p>
               <p>Harris. Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it on that night, that you was called upon to warm Priddle's bed?</p>
               <p>Harris. A little before one o'clock, Priddle asked me to warm his bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the family was up?</p>

               <p>Q. Is it next door but one to the corner?</p>
               <p>Harris. I cannot tell; I don't know any place there.</p>
               <p>Q. This was not the room where he usually lay, only when he had the gout?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the gout?</p>
               <p>Harris. He pretended to have it as bad as he had about three weeks before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep his dining room three weeks?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, he was backwards and forwards to the office even with it, he went into the country with his wife on the Sunday before this happened. When he had the gout he used to have a bed put up in this dining room. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180004"/> lay up two pair of stairs at other times; this bed had been put up about three weeks, he went into the country on Sunday with his wife, he returned on Tuesday, and left his wife behind.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Priddle asked you to warm his bed for him, did you go down stairs for the coals?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, the girl brought the pan up.</p>
               <p>Q. He called you up into his room?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not speak to you about warming his bed till you came into his room?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when he called you?</p>
               <p>Harris. Down in the kitchen which is under ground with the servant maid.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he called you?</p>
               <p>Harris. He asked me to make him a honey toast, he was then siting in a two elbow chair by the fire side, first he rung the bell, the girl answered the bell and then her came down and told me Mr. Priddle ordered me up to make him a honey toast, I went up, and made him the toest; he ate it, then he asked me to warm his bed, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You went down stairs for the coals?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I had them out of the dining room, the girl brought the pan up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bell rung for the girl?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, her was up in the room when the girl came down to order me to make the toast, her went up with me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the request to warm the bed had been usual?</p>
               <p>Harris. He always asked me to warm the bed when his wife was at home; he told the maid her might go down stairs again and go her ways to bed; I warmed his bed and asked him whether he was ready to get into bed, he said presently, I said I thought it time for him to get into bed, because I wanted to go to bed, he said he should presently, he went and locked the door directly, then he told me he insisted upon my staying in the room that night and lying with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the key?</p>
               <p>Harris. He put it in his left hand pocket; I told him I insisted upon going out of the room, he swore a great oath, that I should not go out of the room, but stay there all night, when he begin locking the door, I said, Mr. Priddle, I insist upon going out of the room; he swore I should not go out of the room that night; he said, I should stay and lie with him all night; I told him, I would not, I begged for mercy, I begged him to let me go out of the room; he pushed me backwards several times when I went to go towards the door, against the side of the table: I down'd of my knees and beged him for Christs sake not to ruin me, he swore he would force me to lie with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the word he used?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, the very word, when I tried to get forward to the door again, he knocked me down twice upon a sopha.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he strike you?</p>
               <p>Harris. Just in the pit of my stomach, then I struggled as well as I could to get up again, while I was upon the sofa he put his hands up my petticoats, then I went to take up the candle, I took one in my hand, he blowed them both out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you going to do with the candle?</p>
               <p>Harris. To try to get out at the door,</p>
               <p>Q. But he had the key in his pocket?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, and I beged to be let out; I went to light the candle at the fire place again, then he took me by my cloaths and pushed me down upon a two elbow chair that he sat in at the left hand side of the fire, he blowed the candle but again in my hand, and swore it was of no use for me to try, that he would not be said nay, that I need not cry out, for if I did, he would soon stop my crying, he pulled me round the table with as much strength as possible and forced me upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you resist?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, several times, as much as I was able to do.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do, when he had you on the bed?</p>
               <p>Harris. He pulled my cloaths up, he forced me very much and I cried out as loud as possible I could, when I cried out as loud as I could the girl servant came to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before he had lain with you?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the servant came to the door?</p>
               <p>Harris. As the girl says, I never heard her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180005"/>Harris. She told me afterwards, that she did speak, I never heard her, she tells me she knocked several times, but I did not hear her, he forced me as long as possible, still I was not able to hold up my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do then?</p>
               <p>Harris. He forced me quite, as much as possible he could, I was even almost dead.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell what he did to you.</p>
               <p>Harris. I do tell you, he forced me quite entirely, to the ruin of my body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie with you?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was so exhausted that you could not hold up your hands, was you sensible of what he did?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, as sensible as possible I could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel his private parts?</p>
               <p>Harris. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this occasion delicacy must be laid aside, because a man's life is at stake, and I hope you consider what you are about, that you are upon your oath.</p>
               <p>Harris. I wont speak a word more than is true.</p>
               <p>Q. You did feel his private parts?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, very sharp.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean by sharp pain?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, very much.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you feel in consequence of that - how long did you find it so?</p>
               <p>Harris. As much as a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. That is private parts were in your's?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sensible of any thing else?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes. I found something wet come from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel it in your inside?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you tell me the truth?</p>
               <p>Harris. Every word.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you kept upon the bed?</p>
               <p>Harris. I believe as much as two hours, he was forcing me all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie upon you all the time?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he repeat this affair with you more than once?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, but once.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lie with you only once?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At the end of two hours what became of you?</p>
               <p>Harris. He unlocked the door, and pushed me out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go?</p>
               <p>Harris. To my own bed-room, I went first to my fellow servants, the maid's room, her door was locked, I could not get in to tell her of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you lay in a room by yourself?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to get in at the maid's room?</p>
               <p>Harris. I knocked four or five times at her door.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do the next morning?</p>
               <p>Harris. I got up about eight o'clock, I went down in the kitchen and told the girl of it; I told her Mr. Priddle, had quite entirely ruined me, she desired me to send to my friends and I did.</p>
               <p>Question from the Jury. Whether you or the maid spoke first of it?</p>
               <p>Harris. The maid asked me when I came down, what the devil I had been at? I sat down in the chair; as if I was just dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find yourself?</p>
               <p>Harris. Very bad indeed, I could scarce make her any answer,</p>
               <p>Q. You sat down quite exhausted as it were?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, I told her as well as I could make an answer, that Mr. Priddle had ruined me; she desired me to send t o my friends, and I did directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any friends in town?</p>
               <p>Harris. Not a soul in the world, I sent directly after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew any thing to this maid servant?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, my linen, she washed my linen and saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks upon your linen?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What appearance?</p>
               <p>Harris. Blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Any thing besides?</p>
               <p>Harris. Not that I know of, she can tell better than I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the blood yourself upon your linen?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180006"/>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time your courses upon you?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that blood come upon your linen?</p>
               <p>Harris. By the force of Mr. Priddle.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any man ever lain with you before?</p>
               <p>Harris. Never in the world.</p>
               <p>Court. That question is not usully asked upon accasions of this kind, for though a woman might have taken liberties with other men, it does not follow from thence, that it is lawful for any man to force her; but as the mentioned she had blood through the force of this Mr. Priddle, I thought it proper in my own opinion for the counsel to ask the question of her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you write to your friends?</p>
               <p>Harris. On the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the next day?</p>
               <p>Harris. The Sunday was the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. The next day after you spoke to the maid?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Mr. Priddle, did he stay in town or go out of town?</p>
               <p>Harris. He went out of town on Tuesday, he said he was going down to Burford after Mr. Fettiplace's affairs, that was where my father lived.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you put that letter you speak of into the post?</p>
               <p>Harris. I gave it to the bell-man, at the door, and gave him a penny, on the Monday night.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner went out of town on Tuesday?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had talked with the maid in the kitchen, which was the Sunday morning about eight o'clock, you saw the prisoner and whether you said any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Harris, Yes, on Sunday morning, he rung the bell for me to come up into his room about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that it was for you?</p>
               <p>Harris. It was to make the breakfast, I always made the breakfast, I went up out of the kitchen; when the first tea was poured out, he said is this the best tea and be d - d to you, that you have for me, I said it was the same tea Mrs. Priddle drank when she was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry up the breakfast?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, the girl had set it ready.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came into the room, there the tea was.</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes. When he said that about the tea, I began crying, he said he supposed I should swear a rape against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing besides crying?</p>
               <p>Harris. Nothing at all, I told him I would if I had any friends in town; I went out of the room directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make no answer to you when you said that?</p>
               <p>Harris. Not a word?</p>
               <p>Q. He went out of town on Tuesday, was you removed from his house before he returned to town again.</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he came back.</p>
               <p>Harris. About a fortnight, his wife came a week after he was gone; she got my cloaths washed and sent me away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention it to the wife?</p>
               <p>Harris. I told her of it, she said when Mr. Priddle came home it would cause words; she told me her expectations were that it would be so.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you go the night you quitted the house.</p>
               <p>Harris. A young man I was acquainted with after Priddle left the town, came to Priddle's house to see me; Mrs. Priddle took me to the Angel Inn, in Wych-Street, and said it would be a very good thing if he would take me home to my friends.</p>
               <p>Court. What Mrs. Priddle said or did is nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to?</p>
               <p>Harris. To this mans,

               <p>Q. What became of you then?</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he put you?</p>
               <p>Harris. He took me to some Inn in Covent Garden, there I staid till Thursday morning, (the White Hart Inn) I staid there till Thursday morning, then he went and took a lodging for me; I continued there till my father came to town.</p>

               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you warmed the prisoner's bed the rest of the week.</p>

               <p>Q. During all that time, if I understand you right, you breakfasted, dined and supped with the family?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, the whole of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any difference made, whether Mr. or Mrs. Priddle were at home or not?</p>

               <p>Harris. Not at all, any further than my business.</p>
               <p>Q. The business I suppose of Mrs. Priddle</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I misunderstood one of your expressions just now, or else you contradicted yourself: you said, you always warmed the bed?</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you not warm it the second night?</p>
               <p>Harris. Because I went to bed the second night.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood you; you did not warm his bed?</p>
               <p>Harris. The first night he came home I warmed it.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it you did not warm it the second night?</p>
               <p>Harris. Because I was not very well, I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you warm it the night afterwards?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I was not up in the room, I was down in the kitchen with the servant girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ill on Thursday?</p>

               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As I understood you, that room was the room that fronts Chancery Lane?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your stair case is what they call, I believe a well stair case?</p>
               <p>Harris. I don't know what you call it.</p>
               <p>Q. That winds up to the top of the house: you can speak from the top to a person at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, it winds up.</p>
               <p>Q. His first expression to you, was, that you should stay in the room, and lie with him?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was while he was locking the door?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, while he was locking the door I desired to go out; he told me I should not go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say you should lie with him, while he was locking the door, or after?</p>
               <p>Harris. After he had locked the door.</p>

               <p>Q. No conversation passed during that time?</p>
               <p>Harris. Never a word, that I know of.</p>

               <p>Harris. No, the windows were fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean my lord and the jury should understand, that if you had cried out as loud as you could, the maid, if she had been awake, must not have heard you?</p>
               <p>Harris. I don't know: I cried out as loud as possible I could.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are sure you heard nobody at the door?</p>
               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. As I understand you was sensible during the whole of this time?</p>
               <p>Harris. Sensible enough to know whether he used me ill or not.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you some blows?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He blew out the candle, then you light one of them again that he blew out, and then proceeded to violence?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>

               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But lay upon you two hours afterwards?</p>

               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out?</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any conversation passed between you, during that two hours, after he had done the mischief?</p>
               <p>Harris. Not as I remember, at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you used to warm your master's bed, was it not usual to stay and tuck him up?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I never meddled nor made with him, his wife used to do that.</p>
               <p>Q. But when his wife was not at home?</p>
               <p>Harris. No; the curtains were always drawn; I never touched him.</p>

               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you what observation she had made the night before, or by your to ing so bad?</p>
               <p>Harris. I apprehended, by my looking so bad, for I dropped into a chair immediately as I came in.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not tell you what she had seen, or heard?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180009"/>Harris. Yes, she told me what she had heard the night before, she said, she heard me cry, Lord have mercy upon me; Mr. Priddle don't ruin me.</p>

               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you laid with the maid the night before?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, Mrs. Priddle ordered me to lie in the second floor.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not make the maid hear?</p>
               <p>Harris. I knocked at her door three or four times, and she did not hear me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could call any other person in the house?</p>
               <p>Harris. I did not meddle with any of them, I went up to the man's room, I went in, and found him asleep, and I never meddled nor made with the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice to the boy?</p>
               <p>Harris. I never went beyond.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you send to this Evans; the next day?</p>
               <p>Harris. I did not send to him at all; I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was totally unacquainted with Evans till this affair happened?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not go down stairs that night, and carry the warming pan down?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I never touched it, I laid it upon the hearth in the dining room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at home all Sunday?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes.</p>

               <p>Harris. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nobody put it in your head to go to a magistrate to complain?</p>
               <p>Harris. I told it this woman, her told me it was best to send to my friends; her did not understand the law no more than me; I never spoke a word to any body, I knew nobody in own.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bells were there in this room?</p>
               <p>H. One.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure there were not two?</p>
               <p>H. Not that I know, there was but one, by the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to light this candle at the fire place, why did not you think of ringing the bell?</p>
               <p>H. Because he kept me from that side where the bell was.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said, you light the candle; how came you to light that, and not ring the bell?</p>
               <p>H. He pushed me down two or three times while I was lighting it; I could not get nigh the bell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on Monday morning?</p>
               <p>H. Yes, I saw him in his room.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he breakfasted, or after?</p>
               <p>H. I did not stay to see him breakfast. I never breakfasted with him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go into the room for?</p>
               <p>H. To fetch some work out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he then up?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you dine with him on Monday?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not?</p>
               <p>H. Because I was never asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever stay to be asked before?</p>

               <p>Q. Those letters you spoke of, you gave with your own hands to the bell-man?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>

               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have given a very imperfect account of Mr. Priddle's health; you must be a little cautious considering the situation he stands in, I ask you whether during the whole of that week he was not exceeding infirm with the gout?</p>
               <p>H. Not at all, he went in and out of the country very well, he was very well when he used me thus.</p>

               <p>Harris. Only a little stuff done over with a feather upon his leg.</p>
               <p>Q. And you apprehend nothing was the matter with him?</p>
               <p>Harris. I fancy very little.</p>
               <p>Q. What could be the use of pretending to have the gout if he had not?</p>

               <p>Q. Where did Haines get his horse?</p>
               <p>H. I dont know.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you paid for this entertainment yourself?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of the six shillings, or out of the guinea?</p>
               <p>H. I was to stand to the guinea, to make it good again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you change the guinea?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pay out of it?</p>
               <p>H. Two pints of wine and a lemon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you nothing to eat?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Priddle's son of twelve years old, the servant, and you, had two pints of wine and a lemon?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you pay for it?</p>
               <p>H. Half a crown, and nine pence for the horses.</p>
               <p>Court. What occasion had you for the guinea?</p>
               <p>H. I gave the son some money to pay for the turnpike as we went along, he never produced any of it, he said he had lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many turnpikes did you go through?</p>
               <p>H. Two or three, I am not sure which.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you to make this guinea good when you came home?</p>
               <p>H. From the servant girl, she took her cloaths and pawned them for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that before you went out?</p>
               <p>H. Not till I came home, she did it, and I gave it to the servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Why it seems a little wonderful after you had been so terribly ill used by Mr. Priddle, that you should be so willing to spend his money?</p>
               <p>H, It was not his money, they were my cloaths the maid pawned.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what became of the change out of the half guinea?</p>
               <p>H. I had settled that, I had given it the maid to settle a bill she had paid for Priddle in the house, for victuals, tea, sugar, meat, bread, and butter, things for the family, that her had bought.</p>
               <p>Q, Then you was to be at the expence of this riding out yourself?</p>
               <p>H, Yes.</p>
               <p>Q, You did not mean to charge that to Mr. Priddle?</p>
               <p>H, No.</p>
               <p>Court, Can you tell how much you gave the boy to pay the turnpikes?</p>
               <p>H, Eighteen pence or two shillings</p>
               <p>Q, But that would not make out your six shillings?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180014"/>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you borrow the guinea?</p>
               <p>H. The son asked me if I had money enough. I did not know how much I should want, I borrowed the guinea before I knew whether I should want it or no.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home, though you might have changed this guinea, by the account you give of what you laid out, you had enough to make up this guinea?</p>
               <p>H. I had the turnpikes to pay as I came back, the boy said he had lost the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you left out of the guinea when you came home?</p>
               <p>H. About fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have called at some other place?</p>
               <p>H. I paid three shillings in London while the horses stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you set out?</p>
               <p>H. About twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had you these two pints of wine?</p>
               <p>H. About three.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no inclination to eat?</p>
               <p>H. We had nothing to eat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you dined before you set out?</p>
               <p>H. We had some sausages sent home to Priddle's.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of this wine did you drink yourself?</p>
               <p>H. I drank but one glass of it, the people of the house took part of it; the three shillings were paid for the horses at a place in Holborn, where they stood sometime before we went.</p>
               <p>Q. The horses were brought there from Bristol Causeway, were they?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had fourteen shillings in your pocket when you came home, why then did you pawn your cloaths for a guinea?</p>
               <p>H. I asked her to go and get some money to make the guinea up, her brought me a guinea, and the other fourteen shillings went towards the house keeping.</p>
               <p>Q. So you pawned your own cloaths?</p>
               <p>H. No the girl pawned her own cloaths for the guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Evans you say got a lodging for you?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what name did you go by at that lodging?</p>
               <p>H. By his name.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not married to him?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not married to him now?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live at that lodging, and go by the name of Evans?</p>
               <p>H. Three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you go by that name?</p>
               <p>H. Till my friends came to town.</p>
               <p>Q. What advantage was that to be of to you?</p>
               <p>H. I did not desire it, he desired me to go by the name of Evans.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Haines, the servant of Mr. Priddle, that went out with you?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never desire him to write a letter to Mr. Priddle, by your direction?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first told Mrs. Priddle, when she came to town, or gave her any suspicion of any thing between you and Priddle?</p>
               <p>H. Myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Alice Lee tell her you had more sweet hearts than the hair dresser?</p>
               <p>H. No; her never could say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear her say so?</p>
               <p>H. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Since some evidence has fallen from her, my counsel have no instructions about, will your lordship give me leave to ask her two or three questions?</p>

               <p>H. I never touched his leg after the Saturday night he used me ill.</p>
               <p>Here the Counsel for the Crown moved the Court, that the prisoner's witnesses might be examined separately. They were accordingly ordered out of Courts.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in company with any of these people, after Saturday night?</p>
               <p>H. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person she directed to fetch the mare, that she wanted to ride herself?</p>
               <p>H. In the first place, his son asked me if I would ride out with him: I told him, I did not care if I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you rode that mare before?</p>
               <p>H. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you send for the mare?</p>
               <p>H. His son was to go to fetch these two horses for him, and I was to ride out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he fetch them?</p>
               <p>H. No, this man came accidently while his son was out; the son was gone out with the father: when he went away, he went away from the door with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then who fetched the horses?</p>
               <p>H. This man came to the door and enquired after Mr. West, we told him Lee and I had talked of coming to the faran, he said, he would send them: that was Mr. West's man that lives at the farm.</p>
               <p>Court. Has the prisoner a farm?</p>
               <p>H. I don't know whose farm it is: it goes by the name of West's farm at present: he sent the horses next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When was the next time you saw the man, Waters?</p>
               <p>H. I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he next call at my house?</p>
               <p>H. The morrow after we had been there.</p>
               <p>"A gentleman in the gallery, informed the</p>
               <p>"court, that he observed one of Mr. Priddle's</p>
               <p>"clerks had concealed himself behind the seat of</p>
               <p>"one of the sheriffs. In consequence of which</p>
               <p>"the witnesses were again ordered out of</p>
               <p>"court."</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no conversation with him about me?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank with him?</p>
               <p>H. No, he drank a glass of rum, and Haines drank one, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether she wrote any thing to her father about me, on the second of January?</p>
               <p>H. I wrote two letters to my father: he says, he never received one, but I wrote them: Evans wrote one since.</p>
               <p>Court. You wrote both these letters before you left Priddle's house?</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was that wrote on the 2d of January?</p>
               <p>Court. She said, she was gone from your house before the 2d of January.</p>
               <p>Pris. The question I want to have asked, is, whether she wrote to her father on the 2d of January about me?</p>
               <p>Court. Was you at Priddle's on New-year's Day?</p>
               <p>H. I went the week after New Christmas Day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you left Priddle's house, was it that you sent the last letter?</p>
               <p>H. Both the letters were in December.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did you write any letter to your father, on the 2d of January?</p>
               <p>H. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180016"/>Q. You must know how many you wrote?</p>
               <p>H. I wrote two to my father.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is this letter (producing one) her own hand writing?</p>
               <p>H. No, that is no letter of mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say that is not your hand writing?</p>
               <p>H. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure that is not your hand writing?</p>
               <p>H. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at it more particularly?</p>
               <p>The witness after having carefully examined it again declared it was not her hand writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. Did any body write it for you?</p>
               <p>H. No, nobody ever wrote a letter for me in their life but Evans, he wrote the last letter.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. My Lord there is no post mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is not own hand writing.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the witness come to the table and let us see her write, do pray take the letter eg in and look at it.</p>
               <p>(She examines it again.) H. It is no letters of mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any letter at all from your father?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this affair?</p>
               <p>H. Yes, I received letters from my father, before Priddle used me as he has done, several letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any letter from your father taxing you with improper behaviour; any angry letter from your father?</p>
               <p>H. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any letter of your father's to you, that Mrs. Priddle read?</p>
               <p>H. She always read every letter of mine:</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no sort of ill will of distaste between Mrs. Priddle and you?</p>
               <p>H. No, never before this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Miss Harris you have told the court upon what day Mrs. Priddle came to town, had not you and she some words?</p>
               <p>H. Yes, the night she came home.</p>
               <p>Q. About what?</p>
               <p>H. The bill of the house, and she struck me and knocked me down several times; she beat me very much that night she came home.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before Mr. Priddle came home.</p>
               <p>H. A week before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the bills you gave your mistress: (Shewing the witness some bills wrote upon narrow slips of paper.)</p>
               <p>H. No they are not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you deliver several bills to Mrs. Priddle?</p>
               <p>H. Yes, I gave her them all.</p>
               <p>Q. How many?</p>
               <p>H. All upon one piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Are these the bills?</p>

               <p>H. No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Court. Are these your hand writing?</p>
               <p>H. No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I produce them also as her hand writing.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whose hand writing they are?</p>
               <p>H. No, they are not my hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bills you delivered to Mrs. Priddle in your own hand writing.</p>
               <p>H. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how much money the bills came to?</p>
               <p>H. About five pound seventeen shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. These come to five pounds thirteen shillings and threepence; do you remember whether you put down any thing, about the horses in that bill?</p>
               <p>H. No, I charged nothing for the horses.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is an article for horses 1 s. which seems the twenty-first of December, which is the day you rode out, there is a cross to that article, I suppose they were disallowed: do you remember your mistress making any exception to the account.</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her making any marks or crosses to the account?</p>
               <p>H. Her said there were too much things used: her did not mention one thing more than another, her never mentioned one thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Look a little at that bill again, and be very attentive to it, and say, whether it is your hand writing or not?</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Crown. You made no charge of the horses?</p>
               <p>H. No.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not likely she should charge horses, because it was a business Priddle was to know nothing of?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many sums of money and to what amount did you, Alice and Lee agreed to deduct?</p>
               <p>H. None, because I paid it every farthing, for the things that were bought.</p>

               <p>Q. No money was left in your hand?</p>

               <p>Q. What pawnbrokers did you carry them to?</p>
               <p>H. I cannot tell, the girl can.</p>

               <p>H. Her never paid me any, her never settled with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Mrs. Priddle came home and knocked you down, was it before you made it up with her?</p>
               <p>H. When I went up into the dining room to settle this bill, I told her how Mr. Priddle had used me; then her said she would fetch home the things from the pawnbrokers and send me away.</p>
               <p>Court. You told her every thing?</p>

               <p>H. I came away the Sunday he came to town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She has told your lordship of writing to her father, here are two letters, I desire to know whose hand writing they are, are they your fathers hand writing; but if your father is to be examined it is material, these are two letters to myself from her father; what I make use of them for, is to shew her father received no information from her all the time. Whether she ever told Evans, any thing of my having treated her ill.</p>
               <p>H. No never.</p>
               <p>Court. What was your reason for not telling Evans?</p>
               <p>H. Because I thought if I told him, I should have no where to be, till my father came to town</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Evans courted you for marriage.</p>
               <p>H. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the observation you first made to her in the morning?</p>
               <p>Lee. She looked very foolish, I said what have you been about, what have you been doing; she said I am ruined, I said, why did not you pull the bell; she said she was not able to get nigh the bell.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time, and when, make any observation about her linen?</p>
               <p>L, That very morning, I saw her take her cloaths up, she happened to be out of order the week before, I said are you mad or bewitched, what have you been about,</p>
               <p>Q. You meant she had her courses?</p>
               <p>L, Yes,</p>
               <p>Q, What did you observe?</p>
               <p>L, I saw blood and nature upon the cloaths, I thought it very odd she should be out of order again so soon, she said, she was quite entirely ruined, I bid her write to her friends directly,</p>
               <p>Q; Are you a married woman?</p>
               <p>L, I am a widow,</p>

               <p>Lee. I thought it had been the courses, it was so soon after her courses, that I thought a man must have had something to do with her; or else it was extraordinary their returning so soon again.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she diligent?</p>
               <p>Lee. Whatever Mrs. Priddle ordered her she did.</p>
               <p>Court: I think you say, she had been three-quarters of an hour up stairs before you came up?</p>
               <p>Lee. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you?</p>
               <p>Lee. Making my fire in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the kitchen door open or shut?</p>
               <p>Lee. Open: when we are down stairs in the kitchen, it is impossible to hear any body up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember one Evans, an hair dresser?</p>
               <p>Lee. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when the young woman came first acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Lee. That Saturday night, when she went to have her hair dressed: I believe, he was an entire stranger, till the Saturday, when she went to have her hair dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how it happened she went to have her hair dressed?</p>
               <p>Lee. Miss Harris told me she was going out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. With whom?</p>
               <p>Lee. She did not say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the reason she gave?</p>
               <p>Lee. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Evans before this Saturday night?</p>
               <p>Lee. Never, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time you saw Evans?</p>
               <p>Lee. The Thursday after.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master went out of town the Tuesday after this Saturday?</p>
               <p>Lee. Yes, the Thursday next following I saw Evans for the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, this girl kept very close at home, at Priddle's house, during the time you staid there, till this affair happened?</p>
               <p>Lee. Yes, she always did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go to plays, or any thing of that sort?</p>
               <p>Lee. Never, in my time, before this happened?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear her speak of this Evans?</p>
               <p>Lee. Never before that Saturday night, she told me she called by chance at that hair dresser's, and he dressed her as a strange person.</p>
               <p>Q. During the three months and a week that you was there, did you ever know h er ride out, either on horseback or in a coach?</p>
               <p>Lee. Never before this happened; that was the day after Priddle went out of town.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know Miss Harris sit up with Mr. Priddle?</p>
               <p>L. Priddle desired her one day, when he was very poorley with his leg.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>

               <p>L. Whether on the Thursday or Friday before that Saturday,. I cannot tell; I think it was the Thursday before the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long she sat up?</p>
               <p>L. I think till two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any offer to sit up with Mr. Priddle, in the room of Miss. Harris?</p>
               <p>L. I offered to sit up an hour with him with all my heart; Priddle was very poorly.</p>
               <p>Q. His leg was bad, at that time?</p>
               <p>L. It was rather bad, but not so bad but he could walk.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make the offer to sit up, instead of Miss Harris?</p>
               <p>L. The Thursday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the answer Miss Harris made?</p>
               <p>L. Mr. Priddle said, I need not sit up at all for Miss Harris would sit up with him.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday the 17th, what time did you go to bed?</p>
               <p>L. I was ordered to go to bed about eleven by Mr. Priddle, but I did not go to bed till one. Mr. Priddle gave us all order to go to bed at eleven; only Miss Harris.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else did he order to go to bed?</p>
               <p>L. Master Priddle was a-bed, and there was only me in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no man that lay in the house?</p>
               <p>L. Yes, William.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go to bed?</p>
               <p>L. Before me; it might be before eleven, I cannot tell to a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had any orders to go to bed?</p>
               <p>L. When the first orders were, they all went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him he was to go to bed?</p>
               <p>L. No more than what we always do, when we put out the fire; he went to bed rather before eleven, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was your room, how high?</p>
               <p>L. The two pair of stairs fore room.</p>
               <p>Q. Directly over the room Mr. Priddle was in</p>
               <p>L. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to bed about one; what time did you get to sleep?</p>
               <p>L. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Miss Harris sleep with you?</p>
               <p>L. She came up stairs, and told me she would lie in my bed, if I would go and lie there too.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>L. That morning, about four o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. You never told us that you had seen Miss Harris, till about seven in the morning?</p>
               <p>L. Not to speak to her.</p>
               <p>Q. But she spoke to you, you say, your door was not locked, was it?</p>
               <p>L. No, it was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Miss Harris come into your room?</p>
               <p>L. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She opened the door, and spoke to you?</p>
               <p>L. Yes, she asked me, if I would go up stairs into the garret; I said, I would lie there till next morning: and in the morning she told me all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose garret, Harris's, or your's?</p>
               <p>L. It was my garret: she asked me if I would get up from the bed-chamber, where I lay, and go and sleep in her garret: to which I said, I would lie where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You was a-bed, in the two pair of stairs room: was that your room?</p>
               <p>L. No, my room is in the garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Miss Harris lie with you?</p>
               <p>L. No, she lay in a bed, in another garret.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she open the door of your room?</p>
               <p>L. She came where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you sleep that Saturday night?</p>
               <p>L. In my own room: I always lay in that room when Mrs. Priddle was out of town.</p>
               <p>Court. Then, if I understand you, this door was not locked: but

               <p>L. She began to pull them off to go to bed; then she went down stairs to draw some small beer.</p>

               <p>L. No, she said, she had money of her own in the hands of Mr. Priddle. Mr. Priddle before he went out of town, told Miss Harris to pawn any of his things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Priddle say so?</p>
               <p>L. No, Miss Harris told me so. I said, no Miss, let us pawn our own things, least we should get into any hobble.</p>

               <p>Q. How much did you raise on Miss Harris's cloaths.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pawn any cloaths at any other pawnbrokers than that?</p>
               <p>L. No.</p>

               <p>A. On the Monday.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you remember any person taking a ride on the Wednesday?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing being pawned to raise a guinea?</p>
               <p>L. Yes, Miss Harris told me, she had spent some money and desired me to pawn her things for a guinea to pay Hains, the servant, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether that guinea was over and besides this half guinea and 17 s. you spoke of?</p>
               <p>L. Yes.</p>

               <p>L. It was the same evening after they came home; there was some money raised in the morning to redeem the habit that was pawned on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who sent for the horses when they rode out?</p>
               <p>L. I don't know which, for they are both fond of a jaunt.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Priddle came to town, did you say any thing to her of what happened to Miss Harris?</p>
               <p>L. I did tell Mrs. Priddle before Miss Harris herself, what had happened to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mrs. Priddle, Miss Harris had more sweet-hearts besides the hair-dresser.</p>
               <p>L. Miss Harris told me she was crossed in love, and therefore the first man that would have her, that she liked, she would marry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell Mrs. Priddle, she had more sweet-hearts besides the hair-dresser?</p>
               <p>L. I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did she go by in the lodging in Wych-street?</p>
               <p>L. Evans.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pass as man and wife there?</p>

               <p>Q. How many rooms had she?</p>
               <p>L. One.</p>
               <p>Q. How many beds?</p>
               <p>L. One to be sure, as they passed for man and wife: they did not need but one bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live at that time?</p>
               <p>L. With my friends.</p>

               <p>L. She called with the beer in her hand, I did not see her go down to fetch it.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to know before you got up to go down to finish your ironing, how long this girl was in the room with you?</p>
               <p>L. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. A quarter of an hour?</p>
               <p>L. It might be longer.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether she at that time complained of what Mr. Priddle had done to her.</p>
               <p>L. She was all of a tremble and terror, and said very little at that time.</p>

A woman came to my shop, three weeks or a month ago, in the afternoon and asked for a small diamond ring; my apprentice shewed her one, she seemed to approve of it, and said she would bring a person next day to pay for it; she went away leaving the ring. The next day in the Afternoon the prisoner came to my shop alone and asked to see the ring; the young woman had looked at before, I reached him that ring among several others in a box: it was a diamond cluster ring, the prisoner did not like the ring the woman had approved of the day before; but said, he would fetch her to fix upon another: he went and brought her and they left the shop without buying any thing; just as they went away, a great number of customers came into the shop, so being in a little hurry, I put back the rings into the shew glass from whence I had taken them: I did not then in my hurry observe, that any ring was missing; it was about a week after this before I had any occasion to look at my rings again; then I missed this ring.

            's men coming in, that man ran away. This is the ring (producing it) I have had it from that time to this. I told the prisoner on the Saturday I would advertize it; he said, he had advertized it three times himself, and desired me to give it him again. On the Friday evening I did at the prisoner's request let him have a guinea upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the ring worth?</p>
               <p>Hope. I believe it may be worth 35 guineas.</p>
               <p>Question from the prisoner. Whether you did not offer to buy it of me for 35 guineas.</p>
               <p>Hope. I never did offer to buy it, on the Saturday, I wanted, to have my guinea back and return the ring, because I thought I should get into some trouble about it; but the prisoner had not the guinea to return.</p>

            . I am brother to the prosecutor, he called me up at six in the morning, his house was robbed. I went to his house and saw an anvil there, I cannot be positive that this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Simons. Could not this man when he was in the shop, have got into the house, if he had been so minded.</p>
               <p>Simons. Yes, he could.</p>

               <p>I cannot say a great deal, I did not break open the house; where I found the anvil, there was no place but the sky, no ceiling. I think it is very hard that two poor men should have been taken up for this affair, who are quite innocent.</p>

I had just passed through a gap, when I saw a man who turned out afterwards to have a crape over his face; when I first saw him, from his face appearing black, I took him for a negro. I had no suspicion of him, but passed him; when I had gone about three or four yards through the gap, I heard a voice behind me crying, stop, stop! I turned round and saw a man with his arm extended, a crape over his face, with a brown great coat and his hat flap'd.</p>

            , Esq; A great coat, I believe wraped together about his body; he had blackish hair which seemed to hang about his ears; he said, stop! stop! your money, your money. He did not make use of any violent imprecation; he had a pistol in his hand which he presented to me. I gave him my purse which contained three guineas, or three guineas and a quarter; he kept his eyes fixed upon me, and was remarkably circumspect, looking about him and rather moving about as I imagined to observe whether any persons were within sight; he saw my watch chain hanging from under my waistcoat; he asked me for my watch; after some little conversation, I advised him not to take the watch, I said they were dangerous things; but he insisted upon having it, and I gave it him. I then asked him for my purse again, I was particularly fond of it, and he returned it me empty; he then looked about him for a short space, just took a view of the fields, and turned back again the way that I had come through the gap, and I observed as he turned he took off his hat, in the act of turning, I thought he drew up the crape; he ran with great velocity through the gap and turned upon the further side of the hedge and I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. In the motion of taking off his hat and throwing up the crape as you apprehend did you see his face.</p>

My watch is in the hands of a pawnbroker; it was produced before the justice and sworn to by Mr. Atkins. I don't know so much of the movement of the watch, but it appears like it; the plate, the name, the number, I could almost swear to, but both the gold cases are changed for silver ones; and there is a scratch for a figure of one, but it is awkwardly done. The number of my watch was 1918, it has been attempted to be made 1913.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker. I find by an extract from my books, that there was a gold watch, with two cases, capped and jeweled, sold to Mr. Boyd, on the 10th of January, 1768, the number 1913. I saw that watch at Sir John Fielding's yesterday sen-night; I believe the movement to be the same that was made for Mr. Boyd, but the cases were changed. The addition of a one, that Mr. Boyd mentions, has been very badly put to it, and the name has been taken out of the cap, where we usually put our names; that has been totally erased; but there is a roughness upon the cap that shews there had been an erasure</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name upon the watch?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Samuel and Robert Atkins, London, number 1913, both upon the cap and upper plate of the watch; that was made at the time my father and I were in partnership: that name still remains upon the inner plate of the watch.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker in White-Cross-Street. I took in this watch of the prisoner, on the nineteenth of last November, exactly in the same condition it is now in; I advanced two pounds thirteen shillings and six-pence upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of day did you receive it?</p>
               <p>Shipman. I believe in the evening. I gave him a duplicate for it.</p>

               <p>Shipman. Yes, I lent him an advanced price upon that account, otherwise I should not have lent him so much.</p>
               <p>Q. What is paid for the two pounds thirteen shillings and six-pence for three months?</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner asked any questions about it?</p>
               <p>Shipman. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Do you remember what I said to you when I brought the watch to you?</p>
               <p>Shipman. Yes, I asked him whether it was his own; he said, he had bought the movement for eighteen or twenty shillings, and that the movement was originally in gold cases, but that he purchased the movement of a young gentleman who sold the cases: he said, the young gentleman was a lawyer.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not mention his name?</p>
               <p>Shipman. No, he said, he had carried the movement to a watchmaker's, and had silver cases put to it: he said, the watchmaker lived in Beach Lane, White Cross Street. He had this watch out once, and pledged it again: it was the first time he pledged it he told me that.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he bring the watch, the last time?</p>
               <p>Shipman. On the 19th of November. The first time he brought it, was the 22d of October: it was the last time I lent him two pounds thirteen shillings and six-pence on it, the first time I lent him two guineas. I never had it before the 22d of October.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180034"/>Q. For what length of time was it pawned the first time?</p>
               <p>Shipman. The usual time, two years: it was the advanced price the last time, that induced that agreement.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never lent him any thing before this watch, but upon wearing apparel?</p>
               <p>Shipman. No, but upon Christmas-eve I lent him a guinea and half upon a watch.</p>

               <p>Heley. I referred to our list of the pawnbrokers, and by that means I found out that the watch was pawned at the person Mr. Shipley lives with. It was a proposal among the pawnbrokers to number their shops.</p>

               <p>Heley. Too many.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence:</p>
               <p>On the 10th of last September, I had been down to Deptford about some business: on my return back, I came through the Minories. Just by the sign of the Crown, a well dressed gentleman asked me to buy a watch; he had blue cloaths on, and appeared to be a sea fareing gentleman; I never saw him before: he took me into the Crown: he said, he was distressed for money and obliged to part with his watch. He asked me twenty-eight shillings for it; I asked him whether he was a watchmaker? he said no, it was his own watch, and had been his father's formerly, but he was obliged to sell part of it, and would sell the movement to me, if I would buy it. I gave him eighteen shillings for the movement. As I had never a watch, I thought it would save some expence to have a pair of cases made to it. He wound it up, and showed it, and said, it was a good watch. I carried it to Mr. Nourse in Beach Lane, he made me a pair of cases for it, for which I gave him a guinea. After he aad done it, I was rather necessitated for money and was obliged to pawn it a few days after. I took it out again, and a few days after I had got it out, I had a writ out against me from one Mr. Jarvis at Deptford, who I had contracted a debt with; I therefore pawned it again, to raise money to pay the debt. Since I have been in custody, I have sent an officer to the Crown in the Minories, there were several gentlemen in the tap-room when I was there, drinking, but I can get no inteligence about the man I drank a pint of beer with him, when I bought it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I live in New-street, near Mr. Simkins. On the 15th of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, as I was standing at my master's door, the last witness told me, she believed there was somebody in her master's house; we watched Clarke, the prisoner down Shoe-lane, through Gunpowder-alley, to the back door of the house, she gave two hems and we heard the chain of the back door rattle, then the last witness desired me to go round to the fore door, which I did, and saw the prisoner Price come out of the house: I pursued him and cried stop thief, and he was stopped and taken to the Swan in New-street.</p>

I have nothing to say for myself, but hope for the mercy of the court.</p>

               <p>Burton's Defence.</p>
               <p>The way these duplicates came to my apartment is as follows. - The night Mr. Wright was taken up, he was moved to a lodging in Bridgewater Street; his room not being large enough to hold his furniture, he desired to leave a table at my house: in that table draw were found these duplicates; that is the way I came by them: I leave the rest to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Burton called five witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

On Monday was fortnight, about six at night I was at Oliver's, the Queen's Head,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180039"/> in Vere Street, Clare Market. Crompton was there ; Oliver and he were talking about some money Crompton was to be paid; Oliver gave him a direction, he asked me to write it, it was to enquire for Proven, at the Cooper's Arms, in Saffron Street, Saffron Hill. When I gave him the direction we walked out together as far as the Hay-market; we returned again about eleven o'clock, then Crompton told Oliver, who is a shoe-maker, that he must let him have a pair of shoes for the girl he lived with, and produced a measure. As we were going home, just at the end of Drury Lane, Jealous came up with a cutlass, and stopped Crompton, and said, if he stirred he would cut his head off; and took him away. The next day I saw Jealous at the Golden Cross; I asked him what he had done with Crompton, and told him, I believed I could give him a direction where he would find some things; and gave him a direction to Proven.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the direction again?</p>

               <p>Going through Leicester Fields on the Saturday night, I found the leather by the rails. I went to Cranbone Alley, and met with Crompton; I asked him to help me to carry it to Oliver's; we carried it, and asked him if he would buy it; he said no, but he would bring a man that would buy it and a cart load more, if we had it. We went to the public house, and he came, and said, there were eighteen skins, that he had looked over six of them, and those six came to twenty-three shillings. Proven was sent for, and talked about buying it, and said, he would get in the mony that night &gt;, if he could.</p>
               <p>Crompton in his defence, said the same as Dugard had done.</p>

Newland said, he supposed he was only gone to the door to make water: I told him the man had taken two pair of shoes, and I should detain him till he was produced. Newland went to the door and called the prisoner, and he returned. I charged him with taking the shoes, he denied it and said, I might search him. I told him I did not think it was to any purpose to search him, for I supposed he had given them to some of his companions. I sent for a constable, and took them to Justice Welch's where they were searched; and they had no money, they had only a bad shilling.</p>

I went to the Spread Eagle in White Cross Street, and had a pint of beer: the prisoner was there, sitting on the twelve pounds of hemp, I knew him; he was quarreling with a woman who wanted to leave his company and go with a barge-man; she went out, and he ran after her, and desired me to take care of the hemp till he came back. He never returned; so I thought I would not take it home, but lodge it in the watch-house. Crouch met me and took it.</p>

               <p>Wm Halliburton. About the 18th of last January, the prisoner was taken up for another offence, I searched him and found this watch upon him; he said I had no occasion to take it for he had bought it in New England some years ago. I took him before Sir

            , the books were examined, and it seemed to answer the description of Mr. Davis's watch: Mr. Davis attended; the watch was produced, he said it was very much like his watch, but he could not swear to it as the name and number was altered. The prisoner was present at this time and said, he bought this watch six years before at Boston in New England. I went to Mr. Vulliamy's, he examined his books and before he took the watch to pieces, he said, if it was made by him he should find an inside mark, he took it to pieces and the inside number of the watch answered to the number in his book.</p>

            's, man shewed me the watch to see whether it was what I sold to Mr. Davis in November 1773. A day or two after Halliburton came, I said the watch had all the appearance of that I sold to Mr. Davis, but the name was filled out on the cock; at first the plate was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180041"/> very thin where the name and number were; it appears to have been filled; if so it is still thinner, and there is another name and number engraved upon the same plate; the new number 710, but the original was J. Gray, 813; I put the name of Gray because it was a second sort of watch; I don't put my name but upon the better sort; in order to be sure whether this was the same watch or not; I said, I would look upon the inside, upon which we usually scratch the number before we send it the workman. I took the watch to pieces and found the mark I made myself upon the inside the same as the number in my book; it was entered in my book by this number as sold to Mr. Davis. I am as certain as I can be of any thing that it was the watch I sold to Mr. Davis. I don't rely merely on these figures, the watch is my own making, and I know it from the work itself, watchmakers know their own work.</p>

On the 21st of January, as I was coming out of my room into the shop, I saw the prisoner going out of the shop into the passage. I took hold of his coat, and the drawer fell and the money; the fright overcame me; I never saw him afterwards, till I saw him before the justice; hearing the till fall on the step, the constable who lives opposite came and secured him; he is a neighbour's child.</p>
               <p>Wm Garden. I was sitting in a back room adjoining to the shop, I heard the half-pence fall, I went to the door and found my wife in the passage, and the prisoner my wife had fast hold of him, I brought him back into the shop, my till with the key lay in the passage; the money, lay some on the step of the door, and some in the street. I charged a constable with him.</p>

            . I am a silk-dyer, I rent a room of the prosecutor to work in; I went to my work chamber there about half after eight, there was nobody then in the house, with my own key, I unlocked the street door, I saw the kitchen door open and the two drawers taken out, as I was going up stairs to my work-room, I heard the sash in the one pair of stairs room thrown open and heard somebody jump down into the court, I turned round and saw the prisoner jump down, he fell upon the ground, I was frightened, he had time to get up, he ran by me, I pursued him, he turned about under the gate way and made a motion with his hands to sight me, upon that I having the key of the street door in my hand, said if he offered to strike me, I would knock him down, then he put his hands into his pocket as if he would take something out, not knowing but it might be a pistol or knife, I drew back, he took then to his heels again, I followed him and cried stop thief, upon which he said you lie d - n you; I asked two men at the corner to stop him, they said, d - n your eyes stop him yourself, upon their behaving in that manner, I was frightened and lost sight of him, about four or five hours afterwards I went to Justice Fieldings for a warrant, I got Dinmore the constable to attend with the warrant, he took me to several houses such people frequent, I saw the prisoner at the Marquis of Granby's-head, in Chicklane,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180044"/> I went in with Dinmore and Kippin, I told them he was the person.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you know him by his voice or person.</p>
               <p>Chennell. Chiefly his person, though I knew him too by his voice, he insisted upon it, that he was quite innocent, Dinmore then asked him where he was at eight o'clock, he said abed, Dinmore asked where he was at half after eight, he said, he was then at the Marquis of Granby's, and appealed to the landlord if he was not there, the landlord said, he did not know that he was, but he was as likely as any body to commit the robbery. I was the first person that went into the prosecutor's house, the kitchen door was broke open, the lock was bent back, and the chamber door likewise was broke open, when I opened the outside door with the key, it was locked as usual, so it is most probable the prisoner got in by a false key.</p>
               <p>Mary Pitt. I was the last person in the house, I came out about ten minutes before eight; I locked the kitchen and bed-chamber door; I did not come home again till after my husband and Chennell had both been there; as to the things they were lying in confusion ready to be packed up.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>When they first of all came into the Marquis of Granby, Dinmore challenged me and asked me what time I got up in the morning, I said, I believed about nine, I can take my oath it was nine before I rose; about three in the afternoon they came into the house, he called me on one side and asked me what time I got up, I said nine o'clock, said he are you sure you was up no sooner, I said yes, I could bring people to witness it; as soon as I had spoke the words, he said to the man do you think this is the person, he looked at me pretty hard, and said, I don't know, I think he may be the person, said Dinmore, if you think he is the person, I will lay hold of him, and secure him, he said, I think he is, Dinmore said, only say the word that he is the person and I will secure him, then he said, I say he is the person, and he took hold of me immediately. I could get the man of the house here, but a poor person cannot afford to subpenae any one and therefore I shall be wrongfully cast, I was abed with my lawful wife at the same time, who I married at Edinburgh five years ago, I expected my trial to come on last night, else I could bring a lad from the public house, who said he saw these parties run by and they were both bigger than me; the man at the public-house, said he could not do any thing in it, for he supplied the milkman with money to carry on the prosecution; if I had money to subpoena the lad, I dare say I should have got through the thing.</p>
               <p>Chennell, Dinmore and Kippin were all asked whether it was before or after Chennell challenged the prisoner, that Dinmore asked him what time he got up: they all said it was after.</p>

On the 14th of January last at night, I lost three pieces of mutton and a shirt and pair of stockings; I did not discover any thing of the persons that stole them; but on the Saturday afterwards, expecting that they would come again, I sat up for them in my shop and according to my expectation, about one in the morning, Austin came in through an air hole in the shop, and took another shoulder of mutton from the hook, I being in the shop at the time started up and struck at him with a stick and then he let fall the shoulder of mutton, I seized him and confined him till Monday, and then carried him before justice Wright; on the Friday afterwards I took M'Gragh and carried him likewise before justice Wright, he confessed he was with Austin when he took the mutton the week before and could tell many more things if he was admitted an evidence; but that was refused, Austin confessed he had pawned my shirt and stockings, and refered me to a woman and she to another woman who directed me to one Gees, there I found the shirt and stockings.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About half after eleven o'clock, on the 23d of January as I was walking backwards and forwards at my stand, which is about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Davis's shop, a man ran by me as fast as he could, wit h a black bundle under his arm: another fellow ran full against me. I saw that he had hats under his arm: he gave me a fall into the kennel upon my right knee, and threw the hats behind him. I picked them up. Mr. Davis was sought for. I and the constable went to search Leg Court. Coming by the Star and Garter, the next door but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180046"/> one to my box, the two prisoners came out, each with a pot of beer in his hand: we followed them into Leg Court; at a particular house in the court. The constable bid me get before them into the middle of the court. I did, and lifted up my lanthorn, and said, this is the man I had the hats from; that was Stanton; I had a sufficient sight of him when he ran by me, and knew him again. As to the other, I am not positive about him. I took him by the collar, and struggled with him for a minute and a half.</p>

            , an old Greenwich College man. I was at the trial; he was found guilty and received judgment of death. I am sure that prisoner is the man, he was in the goal seven or eight months: he was pardoned, on condition of transportation for fourteen years. I saw him on board the ship, and have the captain's receipt for the body, but was busy getting the irons off, and did not see him sign it.</p>

               <p>I was sent out of the land; I never received sentence of transportation. I was sent on board; I did not know for what time.</p>
               <p>Question to Stephens. Are not the prisoners informed how long they are to be transported?</p>
               <p>Stephens. We inform them. - When capital convicts are reprieved before the judge goes out of town, we are sure they will be transported: we hear no more of it till we receive the contract. - I said, Jack you go for fourteen years. He said, he did not care, America should not hold him fourteen years, nor two neither.</p>

I lost two silver table spoons on the 16th of January, I found them at one Brotherton's, a pawnbroker, who told me the prisoner pawned them; he was seen going by the door two or three days after, he was apprehended by one of the servants, he was brought into the house, and charged with stealing the spoons; the Countess came in, and the prisoner went down on his knees, and asked her pardon, and said he was very poor, and he hoped she would forgive him, she said she could not, the law must take its course. (the spoons produced.) When they were lost, they had a cypher, a coronet over the cypher, denoting they were once the spoons of the Princess Amelia, but when they were brought back from the pawnbrokers, the cypher and coronet were erased, and they were marked W. I. By observing the spoons, it is easy to see that something has been scratched out.</p>

               <p>William Hall. I am a bargeman on the 12th of January, about a quarter before ten at night, I, my master and three fellow servants, were in a lighter near the three Cranes; I heard a cry of stop thief, we got over the lighters as fast as we could to the stairs, I saw the two prisoners come out of the boat, I stopped them, Needham struggled, Wick's came up after him and secured him, and I secured Hawkins. I am sure Hawkins is one of the men that jumped out of the boat.</p>

I pursued him, and took him immediately;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180054"/> and found two pounds fourteen ounces of tobacco under his coat. I charged a constable with him, and sent him to the Compter.</p>

            . I am carman to Mrs. Lee. On the 21st of January I had twenty sacks of clover seed in my cart. As I was going along, four or five fellows came behind the cart and cut one of the sacks; I happened to go behind the cart and saw them; the prisoner had his apron full. I laid hold of two of them, and one of the others came up and knocked me down. I secured the prisoner, and he dropped the seed. I picked it up and delivered it to the constable; there were eleven pounds of it; there was a hundred and a quarter weight taken out.</p>

He asked me if I could get him admitted an evidence, I said I would if it lay in my power, but it did not, therefore I would hear no more of it.</p>
