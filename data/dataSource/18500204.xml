RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am single—I am a servant out of a situation at present, and live in lodgings—on 6th Jan. I lodged at No. 5 in the same court—I did not go home, because I did not like to leave this man, because he was intoxicated, and not able to take care of himself—he was not very drunk—we sat at No. 2 till it may be past one o'clock—then they went to bed, and we were obliged to turn out—I met with M'Kenna at six o'clock, and he never was out of my com<lb/>pany for a moment—I am on my oath—we stood outside the door, just about twelve o'clock, and Notley came up and muttered something—he was so much the worse for liquor that he muttered his words, and staggered like wise, I have not much acquaintance with drunken people—I had no bonnet on that night; I came out in my dress, without bonnet or shawl—I did not wear a bonnet any part of the evening—I stood in the court without bonnet or shawl—it was a very few minutes—I know nothing of this bonnet—it certainly is not mine; it never was mine; I never saw it before—it has been on my head; it was put on in the station-house by a policeman—I do not know how it fitted me, because it was not mine—I have not had the bonnet I have now got on, long; it is not mine—this is the first day I have worn it, and yesterday, I borrowed it to look smart to come here—I was here yester<lb/>day, but not in Court—my own bonnet is at borne—it is a Tuscan bonnet, I mean straw, trimmed with green ribbons—the lady who lent me this bonnet is not here; it was my landlady's daughter—I last lived at Mr. Wiltshire's, the City Dining-rooms, 58, Cheapside, as kitchen-maid—I lived there six months—it was a pretty good place—I left because we disagreed about wages, and have never been in a situation since.</p>

               <p>Russell has stated that he saw M'Kenna and Ryan together after twelve o'clock that night—is it true or false? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—Ryan was not in M'Kenna's company during any part of the time I was with him—I live at No. 5—the Catherine Wheel is No. 3—to go there for any errand I should not put on my bonnet or shawl—I never had my bonnet on from six—I do not know where M'Kenna lives—he does not live in the alley—I know he lives at some distance, and would have had to have gone home through the street—I know nothing about touching the policeman—I never saw him after twelve, and I had not seen him before, for I was in doors—I did not see him in the Catherine Wheel—M'Kenna was fiddling—I believe he gets his living so—I am sure I did not see Russell that night before M'Kenna was taken—Ryan was not in M'Kenna's company—I was not with them at any time that evening—a policeman could not have turned his light on us all three, and seen us altogether—if any policeman has sworn it, it is false.</p>

On 19th Jan., at a little after nine o'clock, I had a basket with me, containing the articles stated—I put it by my side as I was standing by a shop window—I took a rasher of pork, and gave it to the boy to take it in the shop to get it weighed—my basket was gone within three minutes of my seeing it—I saw the prisoner crossing the street with it in her hand—I ran and called "Stop thief!"—the prisoner ran up Three Tun-court, and as she turned, the court being dark, I lost sight of her—the basket was picked up and given to me—this is it.</p>

I live at 15, James-street, Hay market—Mrs. Ellis is the housekeeper of that house—I know her by the name of "Ellis"—I was there on 2nd Jan.—when Humphreys came there, he knocked at the door and asked for "Mrs. Ellis"—I am sure the name he asked for was "Ellis"—I showed him into the parlour where she was—he said be had got a war<lb/>rant, and if she did not give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would take her to prison, as he had a policeman outside—he said he would take her as "Mary Smith"—he said the warrant was for "Mary Smith," and he would take her in that name—she said, "You can't take me as" Mary Smith, "as you know my name is not that"—he said, "I will take you and lock you up if you don't give me 5<hi rend="italic">l."</hi>—she refused, and then he went for a policeman and took her into custody.</p>

I am an artist and cleaner of paintings—I happened to be in the house, 15, James-street, on the night of 2nd Jan.—I had business that called me there—I was in the parlour, speaking to Mrs. Ellis—the ser<lb/>vant came into the room and said there was a man in the passage who had called twice or thrice—Mrs. Ellis asked me if I would be kind enough to walk into the next room (there being folding doors)—I did so—I had just got inside when the prisoner entered the room—I did not wish to listen to their conversation, and did not know anything about it till I heard him say, "I have a Judge's warrant for a Mary Smith"—she said, "Well, and what has that to do with me?"—he said, "Why, all to do; unless you give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will swear you are that "Mary Smith," and I have got a policeman outside"—she said, "O, you villain!"—after a little hesitation he asked the servant if she would go and fetch a policeman—she refused to do so—I did not stop to see her given into custody, for I was very much terrified, and I opened the side-door and went out.</p>

About half-past ten o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing, on 9th Jan., I was in the shop, and missed a coat which I had seen safe at nine—I went into the street, and saw the two prisoners together, walking down Finsbury-street—Morris had the coat, holding it up and looking at it—Green was by his side—they were walking away slowly—I went after them, and called "Stop thief!"—they then ran into the road, and dropped the coat—I caught Morris, and took him to the shop—I sent for a constable—an apple-woman picked up the coat, and brought it in—this is it—I know it by a private mark on it, and by the button-holes—I was going to Bunhill-row, to take the charge, and I saw Green; we took hold of him, and before we had said anything, he said, "I am not the one."</p>

I saw the pigeons safe, at half-past ten o'clock—next morning, about eight, I went into the wash-house, and the pigeons were gone—the tiles were off the wash-house, so that a person could get in—the tiles are six or seven feet from the floor—at half-past ten, the night before, when I and my brother came out together, the doors were bolted, and they were bolted the next morning in the same way.</p>

In May, 1848, I had a fire at the premises which I then occupied, in Whitechapel, and where I kept my chicory—from thirty to forty tons of the chicory was saved from the fire, but it was charred exter<lb/>nally, and it was removed to premises in Glasshouse-yard—before last Christ<lb/>mas, most of it was again removed to where I now have premises, but some was left in Glasshouse-yard. On 14th Dec. I employed Styles to remove some of it from Glasshouse-yard to some premises in Spitalfields—I suppose the quantity to be removed was about ten tons—it never was weighed—it was all packed in bags—I told Styles there was from eight to ten tons, and he made an agreement to remove the whole at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—I saw him again on the Saturday before Christmas day; he said the whole was removed, and I said if he would call on me, I would pay him for removing it—he told me he had completed it—he had commenced on the previous day—he told me that he thought the quantity was larger than I had specified to him—I told him I thought there was from eight to ten tons, but whatever the quantity was, I would pay him—I paid him a sovereign, a day or two afterwards—it was at</p>

I went to the premises of Purkiss, in New Inn-yard—he showed me a small quantity of chicory, and some bags—they were the bags in which the chicory was that I told Styles to remove—there was a double cross, meaning the number, on them, and other marks of my own marking—I could swear to them—I then examined the chicory, and knew it from the quality of it—it was a foreign article, and a great number of pieces were charred by the fire—there was about a ton of it, and about thirteen bags—I then went to the station, and took an officer, and saw Styles in Moore-lane—I asked him how he became possessed of the chicory—he told me he had received instructions from a man of the name of Watson White to get it ground for him—I then went with him to Purkiss, and he stated that Styles had called upon him with a small sample of chicory, and said he had got about two tons, and wished him to purchase it, he said he could sell it very cheap, at 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton—he said he had declined to purchase it, and they had agreed that he should grind it for Styles; that he sent him half a ton for that purpose, and subsequently he sent him half a ton more, making a ton—he said that Styles said it belonged to him, and he would sell it him at 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton—I then gave Styles into custody—I afterwards went to Steward-street, St. Luke's—I there saw twelve or thirteen bags of chicory—I ex<lb/>amined the chicory, it was my property—it was charred and burnt—the bags were strange bags, they did not belong to me—they had the name of "But<lb/>terfield" on them—there was about 25 cwt. of chicory there.</p>

About Christmas, Styles came, and said he had got a sample of chicory to show me; he said he had got about three tons of it, and he could afford to sell it very cheap—he could sell it for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton, or would I grind it for him—he said it was all foreign, and came from the docks—he said he would send me half a ton—in a day or two afterwards, Finn came, and said he had brought the chicory from Mr. Styles—he brought it in a cart, with the name of "William Styles, Milton-street" on it—I ground the chicory, and Styles came and saw it after it was ground—he said be would send me half a ton more, and he sent it a day or two afterwards—Finn brought it in the same cart—some of the chicory that was sent in on the first occasion was wet, I had to dry it before I could grind it—I did not grind any of that that came the second time, but it appeared to be the same—in a few days afterwards Mr. Browne came—I showed him the chicory that Styles had come and seen when it was ground, and I showed him the bags which Finn had brought the chicory in—after that Mr. Browne came with the officer and Styles—Styles then said he had had the chicory from a man of the name of Watson White—he had not mentioned that name to me before.</p>

I accompanied Gardener to Hallum's—I asked Hallum if he had given any hay to Kiff—he first said, "Yes"—I said, "Are you sure?"—he then said, "I have not"—this was in the yard of the King's Arms—I then went to Hallum's house, and when I came up to the gate there was a truss of hay outside the gate; Richards was going to take it up, and I detected him—there was a man in the yard of Hallum's house, and he said, "All right"—I think Richards was in the house at that time—I was on the other side of the road—Richards then came out, and took hold of the truss, and I took him into custody.</p>

I have not done such a thing"—I told the officer to search—she said to him, "Officer, can I speak to my master?"—h said, "You can if I am present"—she said, "I hope you will not hurt me if I give you up the money?"—I said, "I will be as lenient as I can to you with the Court"—she gave me ten sovereigns and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave it to the officer—I saw him search the cupboard—the prisoner and her sisters were all huddled together round the cupboard—I searched the cupboard, and found in it these two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I identified, having told the officer the numbers of them before—the box had been kept in another in my bed<lb/>room, which I found still locked—somebody must have unlocked it and locked it again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, of Barnet. On 29th Jane, between two and four o'clock, Lambarth and Needham came to my shop; one of them asked for some oil of thyme, and after being served with that he asked for an acid, describing its properties, but appearing ignorant of its name, or as if he had forgotten its name—I gave them an ounce and a half of nitrous acid, in a two-ounce phial; it has a strong pungent smell, and would produce such spots as these on woollen, if it fell on the flesh, it would destroy the skin, and stain it, in the same way, and it would be very serious.</p>

On Thursday evening, 10th Jan., between nine and ten o'clock, I was in Whitechapel—I was perfectly sober, I had only had a little claret—I felt some one at my left side—from a glance I had, I think it was a woman—I felt a handkerchief, or rag, come over my face, and have no idea of anything from that time till I found myself in a room on a horrible bed, naked, except my stockings, and only covered over with a dirty rag—I was greatly confused, and in great pain all over me—there was no candle—I missed my boots, hat, a cashmere shawl, gloves, handkerchief, silver watch, hair-guard, a tooth-pick, a gold ring, two shillings, and some coppers—I had had them all the night before, the ring had been in my waistcoat pocket with my tooth-pick—my waistcoat was not gone—the room-door was fastened out<lb/>side—it was just day-break when I came to my senses, but when I got out it was light—I had no idea where I was—as soon as I came to my senses, I hallooed out, and went towards the door—I found a small key on the floor—I heard footsteps outside, pushed the key under the door, and it was opened by a pot-boy—I found I was in the back-room, first-floor—I partly went down<lb/>stairs, and then went up<lb/>stairs to a back-room, and found a man and woman there—I sent an envelope by the man to my father's office, and they came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> for me—these are the trowsers I had on—they are muddy up to the knees, as if I had been dragged along the mud—they were not so before—this hat and boots are mine—my memory was very much affected at the police-court—I am better now, but am confused, and cannot recollect very well—I had been very ill with the jaundice, this was only the fourth day I had been out—I had suffered no loss of intellect before this—the house where I found myself is about two hundred yards from where my recollection serves me last—there is a street between—Osborne-street turns out of Whitechapel, and Thrall-street out of that—I had not spoken to any females, and have not the slightest knowledge of the prisoners—I had been ill for a month.</p>

               <p>eleven years. On 10th Jan. I was living in my brother's house, in New-court, Spitalfields—I had been living there six weeks—my husband was not living with me—about ten o'clock in the morning my husband came in—he asked me if my brother was in doors—he was not, but I said he was, for I was frightened at my husband—he asked me if I would go home with him—I said I would not, I was afraid of my life—he had his right hand in his jacket pocket, and on my saying I would not go home with him, he took his right hand out of his pocket and threw a brick, and cut me on the head—my head bled wonderfully—he then went towards the fire and took the fire-shovel, and I laid hold of the poker—he made towards my face with the shovel—I lifted up my hand, and received the blow on my left arm—I had the poker in my right hand, but it fell from me—my mother and sister were there—my sister told me to run away with my life and let him kill herself—I was taken to the London Hospital.</p>

On 10th Jan. when he came to the house, he walked in quite carelessly with both his hands in his jacket pockets—he asked if ray brother was in doors—we said, "Yes, up<lb/>stairs," but he was not—he then asked his wife to go home with him—she said, "No," she was afraid of her life—he then pulled his hand out of his pocket and made a blow at her with a piece of brick—I afterwards took the brick up—this is it—I got up and found my sister's head bleeding—I took hold of the prisoner by the collar, and over my left shoulder I heard a blow with the shovel—I told my sister to save her life, to go out and let him kill me—she went out—the prisoner got from me, and he went out—I followed him, and he took a stone and swore he would have my life, or any persons is the house that he could get—I went in and closed the door—I did not go out till the man went—I held the brick and shovel till my brother came home—this is the shovel.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—Ann Donovan was brought there on 10th Jan.—I found a lacerated wound on the left side of the head—it had penetrated to the skull, about a quarter of an inch deep—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted with the edge of this brick—it must have been struck in a slanting direction—it had been bleeding very freely—it had nearly stopped when I saw it—I examined the wound on her arm—it was on the most muscular portion of the arm—it was about three inches in length—it had penetrated to some depth; I cannot say exactly how deep—as far as it went it was a serious wound, but not danger<lb/>ous—it must have required great force to have made such a wound with an instrument not sharper than this shovel.</p>

I was with Benton that evening—I saw Monk in the canal-road, coming from the Mile-end-road—he went into Beckett's shop—he had a jacket on, with something under it—I could Dot see what it was—it appeared bulky—it made his jacket stick out—he went into the shop—I went over, and looked in at the window—I saw Monk take a piece of leaden pipe from under his jacket—he gave it to Beckett, who was behind the counter—Beckett put it into the scale, and gave him Is.—Beckett then took it out of the scale, and threw it behind the counter—I then went into the shop with my brother officer, and Monk left the shop—Benton told Beckett that he wanted the piece of leaden pipe he had just bought—he said he had bought none; it was an old piece of brass tap—Benton said we were constables, and insisted on having the leaden pipe—he went behind the counter, and Beckett laid hold of him, and attempted to throw him—Benton took the pipe up, and gave it into my possession, and he went out after Monk—after he was gone, Beckett said he hoped we would look over it, that he had an afflicted wife, and he bought it—Benton brought Monk back, and he said he hoped we would look over it, it was the first time, and he had a large family and a wife at home—Beckett asked us to go into the back parlour, and settle it—he went into the parlour, and said to his son, "Make an entry of the pipe I have just bought," and his son did, on a piece of paper—Beckett took it, and put it into his pocket—I took it from him at the station—this is it—I have known Monk about two years.</p>

I was going to the Post-office is Lamb's-conduit-street, and met the male prisoner in the street—he looked very hard at me—as I was returning, he walked on the other side of the way, towards the Foundling, and when I got to my master's door, 24, Guild ford-street, he came up to me, and said, "I beg your pardon, I want to speak to you"—I asked what he had to say—he would not express himself, and I said if he did not go off the step of the door he would get me into trouble—he was dressed in a sailor's jacket—he would not go off the step, but insisted on my going up the street with him to hear what he had to say—I went, and he said he was <hi rend="italic">taken</hi> with me because I was the image of one of his sisters—he then asked me whether I was engaged—I said I was not—he then asked whether I had any objection to him—I said I had not, so far as his looks went—we then went to a public-house in Guildford-street, and had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy at his request—we came out again directly, and be said he was going to the Woodford Arms to get his great coat, and he would be back in an hour's time, as I was going out again that evening—he said he was the mate of a ship, lived in the Kent-road, and paid 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for his lodging; that his landlord was a very respectable man; he was also the mate of a ship, and had known him twelve years; the landlady was very respectable, and he was very comfortable in his apartments—he said he would send his landlady to me to prove that he was respectable, and a single man; that he was a respectable man, and not ashamed of his name, and not ashamed of earning an honest crust—we met again that evening, and he walked with me to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> office, where I went for my master—he said something about marrying me, but not anything particular—about half-past nine the next morning the female prisoner came—she asked me if my name was Elizabeth Davis—I said, "Yes"—she said she came from Mr. Williams—I stood a moment, not thinking of the name, and she said, "Charles Williams"—I said, "Oh, the sailor?"—she said yes, she was his landlady, and she brought a message from him, that he would be most happy to see me during the day, if I could get out—she said as he was in liquor the night before, he was afraid he insulted me—I said a man could not have behaved more prudently than he had done—I said I could not get out, but if he liked to came up in the evening he could speak to me at the door—he came in the evening, and asked if I could get out—I said, I could not, but I would try if I could in half an hour, and he went over to the public-house—I went at eight to the</p>

On Sunday, 23rd Dec, between two and three o'clock in the after<lb/>noon, I was out, and met the male prisoner—he asked me the way to a public-house, and I told him—after some conversation he persuaded me to go, and I went with him and had a glass of wine—he asked me to come ont in the evening—I said I could not—he said would I come out on the Mon<lb/>day evening—I said, "No," and he then said could not I come out with him on Christmas day—I said I could not, my fellow-servant was going out, and I should have to be at home; he then bid me good-bye—while I was talking to him, I took out my handkerchief, which has my name on it, and he said, "Your name is Elizabeth?"—I said, "Yes"—I asked him his name, and he said, "Charles Robinson"—he said he was a sailor; he was dressed in a sailor's coat—next morning, about eleven, the female prisoner came to the gate, and asked for Elizabeth—I said there are a great many Elizabeths, did she not know the second name—she said, "No"—I said my name was Elizabeth, and she said, "Did you not see a young man named Robinson on Sunday?"—I said, "Yes," and she gave me a note, which she said was from him, that he was at work on board a ship, and wished her to call and leave it—she said she lived in Albert-street, Minories—I read the note, and told her I knew nothing of him, he was a stranger to me; I met him accidentally on the Sunday, and asked her if she knew anything of him—she said yes he had lodged with her a long time, and he and his friends were very respectable, and she was his landlady—I said if he called on Christmas evening, about five, I should be alone, and would see him—he came next day at that time—and my sister was there, but went away a very few minutes afterwards, leaving him and me alone—he wore the same sort of coat as he did when I first saw him—I asked him in, and asked him down<lb/>stairs—he said he came out with the intention of going to Church, and went to a public-house, and that delayed him till it was too late, and he showed me a prayer-book, which he took out of his pocket, with the name of Charles Robinson in it—he said he had dined on board—between six and seven he said that he would have something to drink—I said I had some ale and some sherry—he said he did not like sherry, he would rather have port, and said he would go and fetch it—I let him out—he returned with a bottle of wine, and went to the kitchen again—after he had been there a little while, I said I must go and attend to the stove in the greenhouse, would he not come with me—he said "Yes," and came up<lb/>stairs</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185002040064"/>
               <p>—I said I would first fasten the dining and drawing-room shutters—he went into both rooms with me, and took particular notice of them—we then went to attend to the stove, and he said while I was attending to the stove he would go out at the front door, and look at the front garden—when I came back, he returned from the front door, I asked him whether he had shut the door, and he said yes, it was all right; that was between six and seven—the house is semi-detached, in a garden enclosed by a wall—the door opens with a small latch-key—I went down<lb/>stairs again with him—in a short time he said there was a noise—I said it proceeded from the next house, that we could hear very plain—about half-past nine I told him it was time for him to go, as it was late—he said he would go if I wished it—I went up<lb/>stairs with a view of letting him out, and as I passed the room-door where the cruet-stand was on the sideboard, I saw the cruets were taken out of the stand, and put on the top of the side-board—I had seen them as they ought to be, about one o'clock—the cellaret-door, which was locked after my master went out, was open—I went into the room, and the prisoner followed me—the drawers were open, and also my master's and mistress' writing-desks, and the papers taken out of them, and laying on the table; they were all right when I fastened the shutters—I asked him if he had done it, and he asked why I asked him if he had done it, and took up the poker, and said he would go up<lb/>stairs, and look through the house, and see me righted—he said he would strike the first person he came to—he took my hand, and said, "Come along," and we went up<lb/>stairs—all the wardrobe drawers were open, and the things scattered about; they were not so before he came—he said he would go for a policeman—I begged he would not leave me, but he said he would fetch one, and come back—he went out, and never came back—this plaid dress (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my mistress', there is my needle-work on it; this piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was let into it—when the family went out on Christmas-day the gown was safe in a drawer, and it was afterwards gone—this brush, collar, and combs are my mistress'—I placed two of these combs on my master's table that day—the waistcoat and jacket produced are like what the male prisoner wore.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at South-bank, in the parish of St. Marylebone. On Christmas-day, I was called home about half-past eleven o'clock—I found the cheffioneer-cupboard broken open, and my secretary also, and the papers and money gone—they were safe before I left—I locked it myself—Mrs. Cox's desk was also broken open, and the papers taken out—the clock from the dining-room chimney-piece was also gone, and many other things—the bed-room drawers were all open, and the things scattered about the room—a jewel-case was broken open, and a large quantity of jewelery taken from it, which was safe before I went out—this brush and comb were safe on the table when I went out—I can swear to the comb, having cut it myself with a pen-knife—I will not swear to the dress, but there was one of the same pattern in the drawers—there was a hole burnt in the dress, and I know the servant put a piece over it—I calculate I lost about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Lewisham, with my father, who is a carpet-manufacturer, of Watling-street—I am fifteen years old. On the evening of 15th Jan. I was at the house of Mr. Wire, at Lewisham, and left there about ten minutes before seven o'clock—I had to pass the Hope public-house to go home; I was going to the Congregational School—I had to turn back to go there, and as I turned I saw the prisoner come out of the Hope—I am quite sure he is the person; I knew him before—I turned up Silver-street, which is at the side of the Hope, and the prisoner followed me—I turned, and asked him the way to the Congregational School, as I did not know it—he made an indistinct answer—I was then within a few yards of him—I walked</p>

On the evening of 25th Jan., about six o'clock, I was in the parlour behind my shop—I heard the breaking of my window—I went into the shop, and found a pane of glass broken which had been safe just before—I ran out, and saw the prisoner running, twenty or thirty yards off—I called, and saw him stopped after some chase—he came towards me, and I took hold of him—he said, "You are wrong in your identity"—I brought him back, and missed this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was brought in afterwards by the officer; I had seen it safe in the window not five minutes before; it is mine—I saw the prisoner between eleven and twelve that morning just outside the gate of my house, five or six yards from my window, with another party, apparently making some observations about the watches in the window, and afterwards he put his hands together, and said, "That will do."</p>

I had made a communication to her—I was watching there that night from half-past six o'clock—about ten minutes to ten a van drove up into the yard—Jennings held the horse, and Hurcum went into the shop—I communicated with Mrs. Gilham—she told me to do something—I watched, and saw the van come out about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour after it had gone in—Jennings brought it out, and Hurcum walked by the side of it—Hurcum turned down York-street—I followed Jennings in the van over London-bridge into King William-street, stopped it, and told Jennings that a firkin of butter was stolen out of a cart in the Borough, and I was informed that it had been put into his van, and would he allow me to look—I told him I was a constable—he said I was quite welcome—(it was merely a trick to look into the van)—I examined the van with a lamp, and found two trusses of meadow hay—I asked him if he knew what goods he had got in his van—he said, "No, I do not, but my matter does"—I said he had got more goods than he ought, and he must return back to the Borough—I left him and the cart in Aylett's charge, returned to Mrs. Gilham's, and saw Brooks in the yard—young Mr. Gilham asked him what hay and straw he had put into Hurcum's van—he said, "Nine trusses of straw, six trusses of clover, and one truss of hay"—Mr. Gilham said, "Is that all?"—Brooks said, "Yes"—I went to another stable, and found Luckings—Mr. Gilham asked him what hay and straw he had put into Hurcum's van—he said, "Six trusses of clover;" and then, seeing me, said, "Stop, let me see, I think I put more than that; I think I put ten trusses in, but I don't know; if you ask <hi rend="italic">Dan</hi> he knows what trusses were put in"—<hi rend="italic">Dan</hi> is Brooks—Mr. Gilham desired them to cone into the shop—they did to, and Hurcum drove up in a chaise-cart, and asked Mr. Gilham if his van had been brought back—he said he had not seen it—I said it had been brought back—and he asked me, what for—I said for having more goods in it than what he had ordered—he said, "Oh, that is easily explained, for when I went up the yard, I told their men to put me in a double order"—I took Luckings and Brooks to the station, and told Hurcum he had better come there, which he did—I examined the van and found two sacks of beans, three of oats, one of bran, nine trusses of straw, and eleven of clover, and two of meadow-hay.</p>

I am not actively engaged in the business; I am not a partner—the constable called on me, and I made an appointment with him—about twenty minutes to ten o'clock Hurcum came and ordered a quarter of oats, a quarter of beans, a sack of bran, six trusses of clover, nine trusses of straw, and one truss of hay—I did not see his van,</p>

A twelve-month or two years previous to Nov. last, I had seen the prisoner at my house, but I did not know him when he came in—I had a regular customer named William Thomas, who I have known about twenty years—between six and seven o'clock on the evening of 25th Nov., the prisoner came and asked for Mr. Thomas, his uncle; I said he had not come yet, but I expected him—he said he wanted particularly to see him, for he wanted to leave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said if he liked to stop a short time his uncle would be there—he said he was very much pushed for time—I offered to take the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he could not do that unless I changed him a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, and he put the note into my hand—I did not like the feel of the paper, and handed it to my wife, as I cannot see well without my glasses—she said she thought it was good, and I gave the prisoner 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and was to give 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his nncle—when I went up for the change, I left the note with the prisoner, and when I came down I saw his name on it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is "Caleb Thomas" on the back of it—I locked it up—I was to tell his uncle that 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be sent to his daughter in the country to bring her home—I paid the note away on Wednesday the 28th, and on the Saturday following, Dec. 1st, it was brought back by Mr. Potter as a forgery.</p>

On Sunday night, I was on duty in Bermondsey New-road, and between eleven and twelve o'clock heard cries of "Police!"—I went to the place, and when I got just to the spot, I saw the prisoner come from a door or gateway of a yard where I found the prosecutor—the prisoner was coming away in great haste, and said, "There is some one</p>

               <p>shouting out for police"—I went and found the prosecutor; he gave me information and described the prisoner—I saw the prisoner again returning to the spot—the prosecutor said he was the party that robbed him—the prisoner said he was innocent—I told him I should detain him, and took him to the station—I searched him, and found on him the knife, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., two sixpenny-pieces, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece, and 3 3/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Is it a likely thing, if I had robbed the man, I should come back to the spot where the man was, with the property on me; I told the Magistrate I could produce a witness, Alexander Sweeney, who knew I had had the knife above a week.</p>
