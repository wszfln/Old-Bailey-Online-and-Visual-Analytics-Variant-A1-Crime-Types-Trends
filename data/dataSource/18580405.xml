                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old—I was brought up in the Islington workhouse—not all my life; I went there after my mother died—I cannot tell how long I was in the workhouse—I think I was ten years old when my mother died—in June last I went into the service of Mrs. Laigh, at No. 10, Park Place, Liverpool Road, Islington—she keeps a lodging house; I used to be in the kitchen—I had a fellow-servant named Ellen Morgan; she came there the week after I was there—she come from Hornsey School, the Parish School; she used to wait on the ladies and gentlemen—she attended to the door—my uncle fetched me away on the Monday before Christmas—on the Thursday before that Monday (the 17th Dec.), Mrs. Laigh did. something to me; I think it was a poker that she hit me with; I cannot recollect it now because my head is so bad—she used to beat me nearly every day, sometimes with a poker, sometimes with the brushes, and everything she could get hold of—she hit me with the poker on my head sometimes; it was on my head <hi rend="italic">a'most</hi>—I was beaten a good many times with the poker during the last week before I left; she beat me nearly every day, and with the poker—she also beat me with the chopper, the hearth-brush, the fire-tongs, and everything she could get hold of—it was the back part of the chopper that she struck me with—I was beaten sometimes because I could not wring the clothes dry, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185804050002"/>
               <p>sometimes we used not to get up early, and then mistress would beat us for that—during the last week I was beaten for not wringing the clothes property, and sometimes for not getting up—sometimes my mistress used to say, "If anybody comes, don't say nothing, and I will give you something," when they did not come; and if they did come and I did not say anything, sometimes she would give me a little bit of meat, or a potato or two, not to tell—my uncle came on the Monday as Christmas 'day came on the Friday—he saw me in the front kitchen—Mrs. Laigh was there all the time—I had a black eye, and my face was as green as a berry—my head was very bad, it was all cut—myhair was cut short; I cut one part, and my mistress cut one part, it was soaking with blood, and then I cut it and she used to cut it—when my uncle came, my mistress spoke up, and said it was my fellow-servant beat me, when she did not; she never did anything to me, she never lifted up her hand—whenmy mistress said that, I did not say anything, because I was frightened that if I said anything, when my friends were gone, she would beat me—my uncle said to me, "Is your mistress speaking the truth"—I said, "No, uncle, take me away"—he did not take me away at first, because my mistress would not let me go at first—my uncle left, he returned I should think from about ten minutes to half an hour—he then took me away—tny mistress kissed me when I was going—I was down stairs when my uncle there to take me away; my mistress came and told me that my uncle was there, she kissed me, and said, "Don't say nothing, Susan, and then I will give you your ten shillings; that was my wages—I had not been paid my wages—after she kissed me, she put me on my fellow-servant's bonnet and shawl, and then she kissed me, and said I might go, and I went—I was taken to the workhouse; and I could not move hand or foot hardly; I was in bed for a month"—I had no other fellow-servant but Ellen Morgan.</p>

               <p>the workhouse is a good step from Mrs. Laigh's; I could go it in five minutes—they always treated me kindly at the work-house—Iwas not afraid of them—I did not go to the workhouse and, complain of being ill treated, because I was always in the kitchen, and my mistress used to threaten us that they would never take us in the workhouse again after we once went out; that was the reason I did not go and complain—I did not like to go after she said they would pot iake me again—used to say that very often—I think it was the third week that she began to say that, of a night—mymistress was always out in the morning for about an hour, but she always used to leave me my work to do—I did not go then and complain, because I had no shoes to my feet, I could not get out—she did buy me one pair of shoes, but I did not have them hardly; I never hardly wore them—I think it was the second week that she bought them; before that I had a very tidy pair of shoes which they gave me at the workhouse to go out in—she bought, me another pair, because she did not like to see me in the workhouse clothes—shenever gave me any dress, only, the shoes and half a dozen pairs of old ragged stockings that she bought at a rag shop, and she charged me more than I should have to pay for them—she deducted it from my wages, and the shoes also; she bought them at the rag shop—she never gave me any dress, only one that she bought at the rag shop too; she said it was a young lady's dress—it was a thin black muslin one; it only lasted me a week—the shoes I had from the workhouse were not very good when I went there; they were good enough to walk to the workhouse in, but I did not have them, because my mistress did not like to see me in the workhouse things—when my mistress used to go out she told me I was. never to go up stairs to the door, and I did not know what I should do, if I should be doing right—she would never let the lodgers see me, because my face was all black—she often used to threaten, me, and say they would not take me in the workhouse again, and I was not to stir up stairs, I was always to be in the kitchen—I always did remain in the kitchen when my mistress was out—I was in the back and front kitchens; and I sometimes used to go and help Ellen, make the beds, then I went up stairs, but I could not get out at the door—I could not have got out if I had tried, because there would be, all, the neighbours asking me where I was going to had never been to service out of the workhouse before, and I did not know what they would do to me; if a policeman or anybody had caught me in the street I did not know what might have done to me—that was the reason, and I am always frightened of anything—I never went put while my mistress was out—I never went out at all never went out at all when she was out—I am quite sure about that—there were two lodgers in the house, Mr. Brown and Mr. Carruthers; Mr. Brown was not at home—the Rev. Mr. Bousfield was also there, but he used to be out now and then; his wife was at home now and then, but I never saw them, only once or twice—they had no family—they had the upper part of the house—they did not stop there very long—they were not there when I went, they came afterwards—there waa another lodger before Mr. Bousfield came, and there were two ladies there when I first went, then there was another lady and gentleman came after that, and then Mr. and Mrs. Bousfield came, and after a bit there was a lady and six children, but I never saw that lady or the children—Mr. Bousfield had some beer in the kitchen—he used to come down every day to draw the beer in the afternoon and at night—mymistress went out shopping mostly every morning, but not every morning, and after she returned, the tradesmen used to bring the goods, but Ellen went up to the door, I never did—Ellen never ill-treated me, she saw the assault committed on me early with the poker, but not always—she saw her beat me once or twice in the second week after I came there—I have, not seen Mr.</p>

               <p>William Hicks Here to-day; he is the relieving officer of the parish of Isling<lb/>ton—Iused te see him at the workhouse; he did not call to see me, but to see Ellen Morgan; but he saw me with a black eye, and called me near the window, and my mistress said that Ellen did it—I cannot recollect when that was—I did not say that Ellen had done it, or anything about her—I am quite sure I never said anything either about my mistress, or her either—I never said that Morgan had done it—I kaew she had never done it, it would be a falsehood if I said she did—I am quite sure that Ellen never did such a thing, and I never said it—Morgan has never struck me with a poker or a brass candlestick—my mistress never came down stairs and found that I and Morgan had been fighting; we never fought at all—my mistress did not send her little boy for a policeman; there was not a policeman come at all—Iknow a policeman's uniform; there was no policeman—(<hi rend="italic">Michael Farrell, 249 N. was coiled into Court</hi>)—I know that man; he did come; he came into the parlour—he had the police clothes on—that was a short time before I left; but I' do not recollect when—I was not bleeding when he came I cried—it was in the afternoon part—I think I had a black eye—my mistress did not say to the policeman, "My servants have been fighting in the kitchen, and one has struck the other"—I was in the kitchen, and my mistress saw a policeman go past, and I suppose she called him in because my sister came to see how I was, and my mistress would not let her see me; she wanted to see me, because she knew I was being cruelly used—I think ny mistress sent for a policeman I am not quite sure—she sent no boy; I never saw her send anybody, and we were down in the kitchen—no other policeman was sent for at all; only that one that came in the parlour—he did not ask me who had struck me—he never said a word to me—I did not answer—"the other servant"—Inever said a word about my fellow servant—Mr. Carruthers was one of the lodgers in the house; before he lodged there he used to come in the afternoon and sometimes in the morning, and my mistress used to go and sit in the parlour with him, and after a bit he came to lodge there—the policeman did not; ask the defendant if she would give the other servant into custody—Ellen Morgan did not say "Pray mistress do not; I will never do it again; she struck me first, and, in trying to take the broom out of her hand, she fell down and cut her head;" she never said a word, and she never did it; the policeman neither said or did anything to us—I have heard that my mistress and Mr. Carruthers were great friends; my mistress told me so, but nobody else; she used to come down in the kitchen and say all manner of things—I am in the workhouse now; I have not been talking to any of the people about Mr. Carruthers, only to the doctor—Mr. Catruthers did not complain that I and the other girl were always quarrelling and fighting; he has never caught us quarrel<lb/>ling and fighting, nor have any of the lodgers—my mistress never would let me see them; she said if I saw the lodgers she would box my ears—Mrs. Bousfield had left some time ago—this hurt me very dreadfully; I did not scream much, because I dare not—I represent that I went on from June to Dec., beaten every day with a chopper, or poker, or tongs; I never went a day hardly with<lb/>out being beaten with them, or brushes, or anything she could get—Mrs. Bous<lb/>field used to come into the kitchen sometimes; she never spoke to me about my being beaten, I cannot tell you what aged woman she is—I did not tell her because my mistress was there—I knew she was the wife of a clergyman—Ithought she was married to Bousfield, and sometimes she used to come down and tell mistress what to cook for her, and sometime mistress would tell me to go into the back kitchen—Mrs. Bousfield has not been in the kitchen without Mrs. Laigh, only for the beer sometimes, but only once when</p>

               <p>I was alone—Mr. Bousfield called "Ellen," and then he said "you had better come;" I said "I cannot, Sir; I must not," and then mistress came and attended on him—I did not make a complaint with a clergyman and his wife in the house, because I never saw them—there was Master James in the kitchen, and wherever I went to he would tell his mamma; I was threatened not to go out of the kitchen, because when mistress came home she would beat me—she sometimes beat me whether or no—I am not positive what she beat me for on Thursday 17th Dec., I think it was for getting up late—I am not positive whether Ellen saw her beat me on Thursday—I think it was in the morning part that, she beat me on the Thursday—before my uncle came, but I am not quite sure—I think it was the poker she beat me with, but I cannot recollect—she beat me on the Friday, I think it was with the hair brash, and I think with the chopper too; I am not quite sure—she beat me twice or three time that day; sometime she would get the poker or a fire brush, or the hair brush—she hit me with the chopper on the Thursday, I think it was in the afternoon part—I think Ellen Morgan saw her Strike me with the chopper, ahe chopped a bit out of my arm here, there is another place; both of these were done with the edge of the chopper but not both on the same day—the one here was done three days before the other, they were both done in the same week, I had a cut on my head the first morning my uncle came—this mark (<hi rend="italic">On the outside of her right arm</hi>) was done last; I cannot recollect when, or whether it was done in the week before my uncle took me away—I was washing when it was done, and had my sleeves up—thechopper had a wooden handly, she caught hold of the handle with both hands, and my hand was so on the bath in which we were washing; I was trying to ring the clothes—I cannot wring with my right hand, I never can do any thing with that—it was because I did not wring the clothes dry—my arm was resting on the bath, and she came very slyly and done it from behind—Ellen Morgan saw the Chopper used, but not when this wound was done just here—my mistress gave me the other wound inside my arm just before dinner timer; I was washing, and had just done wringing one of the clothes, and she took it up and wrung it again because it was not wrung dry enough, and then she came slyly behind me, and said, "You must try and wring the clothes dry; and I said, "I cannot"—she did the second wound two or three days after the first, I was washing then; we were always washing—she did both with the chopper, and when this place got better she hit it again with a poker and made it come worse—I think it was for not lighting the fire quick enough that she struck me with the poker—I have no wound on the other arm, but the poker has made it as hard as a stone by continually beat<lb/>ing on it, and I cannot move it—Ellen Morgan saw all these blows; I could not pull my gown off of a night, because my arm was so bad, and sometimes I had to lay in my clothes—I have a sister named Elizabeth, she came to the house about the middle of Oct. and saw me with a couple of black eyes—she did not ask me how it was done, my mistress told her that me and Ellen had been fighting—she is not married, but she is a great deal older than me—she did not ask me how it was done as my mistress told her that me and Ellen had been fighting, that was in Ellen's presence—I think my sister said that if she heard of any more fighting she would take out a warrant; my mistress said that she said so—my mistress being present prevented my telling the truth to my sister, she used to threaten to beat us, and we were both afraid to tell my sister the truth.</p>

                  </hi>. I shall be fifteen years old on the 2d of next May—I had been an inmate of Islington Workhouse five years, and was so when I went into the defendant's service—I cannot tell you where my father is, but my mother died in Islington Workhouse during the latter part of the time I was at a school at Hornsey, which is some distance from the workhouse—from there I went to Miss Daniels', in the Hornsey Road, for eight months, and a woman took me from there to Mrs. Laigh's, taking me to the workhouse first, but I did not stop at the workhouse—I do not know whether Miss Daniels gave me a character to Mrs. Laigh—I did not know the young woman Dean till she came to Mrs. Laigh, she was there before I went—there was no other servant there when I went—my duty was to attend on the lodgers upstairs—Ianswered the door of the house, and Susan Dean used to do the kitchen work—Mrs. Laigh did the cooking, I and Susan Dean did the washing, we used to wash every week—I remember her going a way, it was on Monday the 21st as Christmas Day was on Friday—within the last four or five days before that Mrs. Laigh Laigh hit her because she could not wring linen with her right hand—wewere both washing at that time in the front kitchen—I think it was a poker she hit her with—I cannot exactly say where she hit her—we then went straight on with our washing—Susan complained that she was hurt in the lower part, I think, but I cannot exactly say—on the next day, Friday I saw Mrs. Laigh strike her with a chopper, I cannot recollect what she was doing, it was after we had done washing—we had not been washing that day we had finished on the Thursday—the flat part of the chopper struck her on the back, on her shoulder—Mrs. Laigh gave no reason to me for striking her—Icannot recollect her saying anything or finding fault with her—on the Saturday night she was lifting a basin of water, and happened to upset some and Mrs. Laigh took down the chopper from the side of the fire-place where it hung, and hit her on the lower part of her body and. on her shoulders with the flat part of it—I was behind—I did not see anything more done to her that day but on Sunday morning there was some tea in the tea-pot which one of the lodgers had left, and Susan poured it out, and began drinking it; Mrs. Laigh came down stairs and said, "Who took the tea out of the tea-pot?" Susan said, "I did, ma'am;" she said, "What business have you to take the tea out of the tea-pot, because I wanted it myself?" and hit her across the mouth, with the back of her hand—I did not see her struck by Mrs. Laigh at any other time during the last week—I saw the back of her head bleeding on the Thursday or Friday, she cut her hair, and Mrs. Laigh cut some of it—I saw the blow struck that caused the bleeding—Mrs. Laigh struck that blow with a poker—shedid not wear a cap or anything on her head, because nobody used to see her—I did not notice any other appearance of violence about her only the two black eyes she had when her uncle came—she had them before her uncle came, and they continued until he came; they were going away when he came—I cannot recollect that I saw any blow struck which caused those black eyes—I remember her uncle coming—my bonnet and shawl was put upon her to go away in—she had no bonnet and shawl of her own only an old bonnet not fit to wear—as she was going away, mistress said she would give her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if she did not tell that she had beaten her—I never struck Dean</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did your mistress first begin to ill use her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three months after she was there, I can't say exactly—she never made any complaint before that, and I never saw any thing done—we used to wash once a week, beginning on Monday and ending On Thursday—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at the founds on than's arm</hi>) I never saw those before, to my recollection—she and I never quarrelled, I swear that—we never had any words all the time she was there—I never took up the poker to her or a brass candlestick—the lodgers could not say that we were alway fighting and quarrelling, because we were not; we never did fight and quarrel—mistress used to go out every morning about 11 o'clock and remain till about 12 o'clock; while she was away, sometimes we were washing, and sometimes I was up stairs doing my work, and Susan Dean was down stairs—I can't say that my mistress never ill-treated me, she did sometimes—she never used such a thing as the chopped to me, or the poker or tongs, she used to hit me with her hand sometimes—whenshe was out in the morning, we were washing, Dean used to be down stairs doing the kitchen work, I was up stairs making beds and cleaning the rooms—Dean was not very sharp—we did not like to tell the lodgers or to make any complaint—I did not like to make any complaint—I left Mrs. Daniels because she was going to take apartments, and give up her house—I used to go out often to bring in meat and other things—I remember Dean going out a short time after we had been there, and losing her way—I re<lb/>member a policeman being sent for when Dean's sister came to see her, and mistress would not let her; the sister sent the policeman in, and he went into the front parlour and spoke to mistress—I do not recollect his speaking to me—(<hi rend="italic">Farrell was here called in</hi>) that is the man that came—at that time Dean was not sitting on the stairs with her face bleeding; she was down stairs in the front kitchen—I do not recollect coming up to the policeman—I cannot recollect her accusing me of having made her face bleed—I cannot recollect her saying that I had struck her and made her bleed—I cannot recollect saying that I had done it—I cannot recollect the policeman asking my mistress if I should be given into custody for beating the other servant—I did not say, "Pray, mistress, don't, I will never do it again; indeed she struck me first, and in trying to tike the broom out of her hand, she fell down and cut her head"—Ican recollect quite well that I never said such a thing, or any thing of the kind—I cannot recollect that I ever said such a thing—I cannot recollect the policeman speaking to me, or my speaking to him—I cannot recollect saying that Dean had struck me first—I did not tell him that I had tried to take the broom out of her hand, not as far as I can reollect, nor that she fell down and cut her head—I cannot recollect that I ever said it—I do not recollect what passed when the policeman came—I only recollect that the sister sent him in, and that mistress took him into the front parlour and spoke to him—I was cleaning the window, and I went out while my mistress was there with him—I was not in the room with them—it was some time in the afternoon—Mrs. Laigh did not send her little boy for the policeman, as I recollect Dean's sister sent him in—I do not recollect that I heard Mrs. Laigh say to the policeman, "My servants have been fighting, and one has struck the other with the broom handle"—I do not recollect that Dean was then sitting on the stairs with her hand to her face, and that she took her hand away, and the policeman saw the blood; I do not recollect it at all—Icannot recollect saying that she had fallen down as I was trying to take the broom out of her hand—I was not examined before the Board of Guardians,</p>

I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 4, Nottingham Place, Upper Holloway—Susan Dean is a niece of mine—in consequence of what I heard, I went to Mrs. Laigh's on the Monday before Christmas day—I saw my niece in the kitchen; Mrs. Laigh was there—I found my niece in a very deplorable state, both in filth and braises, so much so, that I did not know her—her eyes were black, her hair was cut short, and she had wounds on her head—Mrs. Laigh said that she was a very bad girl, and laid a great many things to her charge—I then walked across the kitchen to the girl, and asked if her mistress was speaking the truth—she replied "Take me away, uncle;" upon that, Mrs. Laigh flew into a violent rage, and rushed to the fire-place; she said that the two girls had been fighting—both the girls were present—neitherof them said anything—Mrs. Laigh said that some of the bruises on the girl were from falling from a chair in the garden, and many other things she said that I cannot tax my memory with—I then went to the workhouse; and got their permission to receive her, and then I returned and fetched her away.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the medical attendant residing in Isling<lb/>ton workhouse—when Susan Dean was brought there on Monday, 21st Dec., I examined her—I found five wounds at the back of her head, each about an inch in length, and the marks of two in front just about the forehead, those had healed—I should say none of those at the back were more recent than three or four days; the skin was cut—there were several other injuries—she had an abscess on the right arm, just below the elbow, which broke the next morning; that might have been caused by a blow, or by natural causes—therewas an inflamed state of the skin covering the left blade bone; the same in the left arm above and below the elbow, and the left knee was inflamed—therewas also a bruise on the right side, and the left eye was black—the abscess on the right arm was just below the elbow—I have been in court and heard her examined (<hi rend="italic">looking at her arm</hi>); I did not notice these marks at the time, I only noticed the abscess—this mark I should say was the opening of the abscess (<hi rend="italic">this was the mark of one of the wounds spoken to by the prosecutrix</hi>)—Ishould say that is where the abscess healed from the appearance of it—thereis the trace of a slight wound on the other side of the arm—I cannot form any judgment within what time that wound had been inflicted; it was</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business with my father and brother as drapers, in Whitechapel.

               <p>12th March, I was in King William Street, London Bridge, about three minutes past 5 o'clock—I saw a van there drawn up on the near side, just after you pass Arthur Street west, close to the kerb—I saw a man on the top, and as I got near, I heard a rattle on the other side—I looked on the other side of the van, and saw that it was one of Messrs. Torr's—I went to the other side and saw a donkey cart driven by the boy, which had some bags in it, partly covered over with a wrapper, or something of that kind—I believe Stratford to be the person on the top of the van—the van went towards Gracechurch Street, and the donkey cart towards King William Street—Grahamis the boy who was in the donkey cart; I heard him say as he was leaving, "My father says he will give you a pint of beer next time he sees you"—I followed the donkey cart in the direction of the Poultry—as I was going on, I met policeman 422, and spoke to him—I believe the boy saw me, for the donkey cart then went at a sharper pace than before—I stopped him at the Mansion House, and informed him that there was something wrong, and found four bags in the cart—the boy was detained by a policeman—on the Friday after that I went to Deptford, to Mr. Torr's manufactory and selected the prisoner from, it may be, twenty men, as the man I believe to be the driver of the van—I still believe him to be the man.</p>

On 17th March, about twelve minutes past 6 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in the Hackney Road, and I saw the prisoner running as fast as he could, in a very excited state—Iran across the road and stopped him—I asked him what he had been doing, he said "Nothing, I can run if I like"—I told him I thought he had been striking somebody; he said, "No, I have not;"—I took him to Cambridge Place, and met Mr. James Williams, who said "That is one of them who his had a horse and cart taking away goods from somebody here," and that he had seen two or three of them loitering about, and the others had gone on with a horse and cart—he pointed to Mr. Matthews' door, and said, "They have been robbing or breaking into Mr. Matthews', and there is the door open"—I had the prisoner against Mr. Matthews' door at that time, and on entering the passage, I found four bags of tea ready for removal—I told Mr. Matthews, and he gave the prisoner into custody—I took him to the station, and then returned and examined the premises—an entrance to the shop had been made through a sky-light in the roof, which was either broken or taken out—on the roof of the adjoining shops, I found marks of a man's boot in the drift sand in the gutters, which I afterwards compared with another mark made by the end of it, with one of the prisoner's boots, and the impressions corresponded exactly.</p>

On 22d Feb., I was in Mrs. Sharpe's shop—she called ray attention to a bad shilling, and I was sent for a policeman—I saw the prisoners together at the Swan about twenty minutes or half an hour afterwards; I went with White after them—I walked behind, and he told me to look out—I did not see Hearn do anything, but I looked and found on the ground three counterfeit shillings between the Swan and the Mitre, just where Hearn had been walking—I took them to the station, marked them, and gave them to Sergeant Cooper—after they fell, White told me to take Hearn in charge—I heard White tell Anderson to spit it out—she never spoke—I saw a straggle between her and White; she then said, "It is no use, it is gone."</p>

I contract for cleaning blankets for the Admiralty; during the last few months I have received a large number of blankets; I can tell the number by the book—I received 356 on 17th Aug.; 137 on 21st Sept.; and 630 on 14th Oct.—I missed 101 on 23d March—they were clean—I should say some of them had been cleaned perhaps a month—they were tied up with string in tens, folded rather peculiarly for the accommodation of the persons who have to receive them—some blankets were shown to me by the policeman; I know them, they were what I lost—there were four bundles tied in tens, and the others were loose—I knew them by the folds and the string they were tied with—These are all marked "T O," and the broad arrow, and a rim; they are all the same marks, done with a stamp I sup<lb/>pose—oneblanket was peculiar, it has "W D" on it, for War Department, and three stripes of red down it—I know this string; it is the string that I used to tie the whole of the blankets up; it is made expressly for me—I saw it when it was brought by the policeman—it was tied in a knot which was peculiar—the persons are here who tied them—I also wash blankets for the Penitentiary—they were not brought in bags, I received them in bulk—this blanket is a peculiar one; it had the three stripes of red in it—it has got a mark on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not know much about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My people will know better than I do—I am a dyer, and contract for the Government; I send in my bill when it suits me—I have been the contractor about eleven months this last time, and I was contractor ten years before—I may probably have received a thousand blankets during the eleven months; they all belong to Government, except those with the stripe—they belong to the Peniten<lb/>tiary—Ihave received perhaps 200 of them within the same period—here is a dark mark on this one; it is one of the Penitentiary blankets—it has got the three stripes on it, and here is the mark "W D" on it, and the broad arrow—it is War Department; the Penitentiary get their blankets from the War Department, probably—that is their business—I have undoubtedly sent to the War Department blankets marked as this one is—I contract with the Government, and they send me these to clean.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I thought you said it was a separate contract for the Penitentiary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have, perhaps, received hundreds of blankets in the last eleven months—I received these and others from Deptford, and it is my duty to return them there again—during the whole eleven months I have been in the habit of cleaning these striped blankets; not at all times—I receive the blankets, and there may be some of them, and there may not be—I do not know that they are in the habit of selling blankets—this string is made for me—it is what I always tie up my blankets with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Johnson. I have examined these blankets, they are my employer's—I saw them safe on Saturday, 20th March, at No. 2, South Street, Whitechapel Road—that is the place of business—theywere all clean except this one before me with the red stripes, which was dirty—I had tied up a part of the blankets which were clean—when these</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185804050030"/>
               <p>blankets were brought to me I examined them, of course—I know them by the mark "T O" upon them; and these being in our possession some time, they had been tied up some time, and I find the mark of the string round the blankets—I examined the string that was brought; it is a part of the string we use in tying these up—the knot has been untied—we missed 100 blankets marked "T O," and one with red stripes—these are the marks on them—we fold them all the same way—these had been folded some time, and bear the stronger impression of the string.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you fold them all in the same way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I believe these are the identical blankets that I saw on 20th March—I will swear positively to them by the marks—if I saw these in the Dockyard amongst others I could not undertake to swear that these were on our premises on 20th March—those which are called the prison blankets have all the same marks on them, the three red stripes—if I had seen this one in the Dockyard I could not undertake to identify it amongst others—I missed 101 blankets—I saw them safe in the centre of the room at No. 2, South Street—therewere thirteen bundles tied up in tens, that was 130; and there were other blankets hanging up drying on the premises—I cannot tell how many were hanging up—I know there were thirteen bundles, because I had put them there myself and counted them—I cannot tell exactly when I had put them there—I was sent down to see that the premises were safe on Saturday night, 20th March—my fellow servant, Charles Day, was with me—I cannot say when I had tied up these bundles of blankets, it might be about last Christmas—on the Tuesday I counted, and found ten bundles were gone—I had seen this one blanket safe, or one corresponding with it, on the Saturday at the same premises—I did not count the number of blankets we had there on the Saturday; there was no occasion to count—I counted them on the Tuesday when I took stock to see how many we had lost; we then had 116—Iwrote down the number at my employer's premises—I wrote it to assist me as to what time they came—I did not copy it from anything, I wrote it out of my own head—these 116 blankets that I had on the Tuesday came into my possession on 22d Feb.; 100 came in marked "T O," and 117 prison blankets—I think they came in, in Feb., but you have taken my paper from me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you cannot recollect now, how came you to recollect then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wrote this from information—we have a book which we have to go by when they come in—I did not get my information from the book; I got it from my own memory, and from my fellow servant—I recollected their coming in on the date, and I referred to the book to see if I was correct—it was written from my own bead—117 blankets came into our possession in Feb.—I counted them myself—I swear that—We have 116 now at my employer's premises—Iam sure of that—I missed the bundles on the Tuesday about 4 o'clock—I counted the prison blankets on Wednesday morning, and found I had only 116—I received information of the loss before I looked for the bundles—my fellow servant went with some blankets to dry on the Tuesday, and he came back and informed me that the place had been broken open—I had not received information that the blankets had been found—I heard on the Friday following that the blankets had been found at Mr. Meehan's—on the Tuesday I received information, and went down, and missed the bundles—I did not miss the prison blanket then—I did not think there were any of them gone.</p>

               <p>again on the following Tuesday to take some other blankets—I had a little difficulty in opening the outer door—I went in and found the flap open, and missed the padlock—I missed several bundles of blankets—they were per<lb/>fectly safe on the Saturday night—I had tied some of the bundles—those blankets produced by the constable are the same blankets—I observed the string that was brought by the policeman—I did not examine the knot; it was untied—the string is the same sort as we use.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are these the same sort of blankets that are brought from the Dockyard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they are the same blankets that we lost—all, except one, differ in no respect from all the blankets that we have been receiv<lb/>ing from the same place for the last eleven months, and this one differs in no respect from all the prison blankets, but they are not all marked alike—I have not seen a number of others with this particular mark; I have seen a few—this one does not differ from those which have this particular mark—I remember that 117 blankets came in on 22d Feb., that was the last lot—wehad received some a few months previously—I do not know the date—weonly received one parcel of prison blankets before—my brother made the entry, but these were repeated to me several times, and we had 117—I do not know how many of them have been cleaned since—the red striped blankets which I saw exhibited at the Mansion House were not the same as this, they differed in the mark—this is marked in the corner with the broad arrow and "W D," and the blankets there exhibited were marked with the broad arrow and "B O"—we have had blankets marked "B O"—I do not know what "B O" means—I was told that "W D" means "War Department"—there were none exhibited at the Mansion House with "W D" on them—"W D" was not on all the 117; that we had only on a few—the others were marked "B O"—I do not know that the same observation applied to all the prison blankets we received during the eleven months—I do not know that any of the former lot had "W D" on them.</p>

ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did the letter contain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my recollection it was, "Sir, I send you this note to say that I am very much in want of money; I consider that I have been very much ill-used by you, as well as <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Jones and Frank, inasmuch as I have been cheated out of the share of the proceeds of the robbery which was committed on the premises of Mr. Flowers, in White Street."—That was the substance of the letter—it was to that effect—another letter was written to Williams by Jeffries on the following night Wednesday—I took the second letter to Williams and delivered it to him—Abigail was there at work in the front room—the servant opened the door to me, and asked whether I would go upstairs, or should she call Mr. Williams—I went up and tapped at the door—Abigail was there and he asked me in—I said I had a note for Mr. Williams, and I wish to see him—Idid see him, and told him I had brought him a note from <hi rend="italic">Shiney</hi>, that is the nickname of Jeffries—he asked me if I knew what the letter contained—Itold him, if he opened it he would see; and I told him it was concerning that little affair in White Street—he said, "What little affair?"—I told him he knew, it was the robbery at Mr. Flowers—when I said that, he asked me to come into the next room with him—(Abigail had been present while I was talking about this, and, I believe, he would hear what was said)—I went with Williams into the next room, and the letter was opened—Williams asked me to read it to him, which I did.</p>

I am the wife of William Sawyer—he lived with me at No. 42, Devonshire Street, New North Road—the prisoners lodged in the same house, in the back room first floor—I was not aware of any one living in the room but themselves—a woman named Perry, and her niece, lodged in the front room on the same floor—a sister of mine lived with me, and slept in the shop—on Thursday evening, 18th Feb., a policeman came to me about dusk—I went to bed about a quarter to 12 o'clock that night, I do not know whether the prisoners were in their room then or not—after I had gone to bed I heard somebody come in at the front door and go up stairs to the prisoner's room; my husband then went and bolted the front door and came to bed again—about ten minutes afterwards we heard foot<lb/>steps stealthily come down the stairs again, and some one unbolt the back door leading into the garden—upon hearing that we both got out of bed and went into the passage, and found the female prisoner and a man with<lb/>out shoes or hat—I had seen that man before in my shop—my husband asked what he wanted there—he said he lived up stairs; my husband said he was not aware of it, and asked him in what room—he said the back room; my husband turned to me, and asked if I had let the room to that man—I said I had not, but I had let it to that woman (pointing to the female pri<lb/>soner), and that on one occasion when I spoke to her about this man, she had called him her brother; she said if I spoke a word she would take my life, and she rushed at me, and seized me by the hair; and she called my hus<lb/>band a most awful name—when she caught me by the hair he passed his</p>

               <p>hand between her and me, and she said if he interfered she would kick his inside out, using a very low expression at the same time—she partly pulled me up stairs by my hair, and she commenced kicking my husband in the stomach with her feet—just at that time the male prisoner came down; he said that the man was a lodger of his, and he would have him in the room whether we liked it or not; my husband said he was no lodger of his and he would have him out of the house, he would send for the police and have him removed if he did not go quietly—the male prisoner said, "I will let you see whether I will have him in the room or not, "and he struck him in the mouth, and raised his knee and drove it right into my husband's side—my husband was then standing about the middle of the stairs, and the male prisoner was above him—he pressed his knee somewhere about the side, under the ribs, and pressed him against the wall—I screamed out, "Murder! don't murder him"—and my husband exclaimed, "Oh!" and stooped down—during all this time the female prisoner had not released her hold of my hair—she released me then, and my husband, when his hand was disengaged, stept down to the bottom of the stairs—I called "Murder!" and my sister came; I do not know at what time she came—I do not know whether the female prisoner kicked my husband after the male prisoner came, for she had my head bent down so that I could only see her feet move kicking into his side—she had pulled my head down, and I kept it down for fear of her striking my face—I saw her kick him in the side and stomach; she was then on the stairs over his head—he had done nothing to her before the male prisoner kicked him; I do not believe he touched her, I did not see him do so—apoliceman afterwards came, and the strange man was removed—the prisoners went up to their own room, swearing they would have our lives the first time they laid hands upon us—We went into our room and went to bed—nextday my husband walked with me to the Temple to his solicitors; he was not well, he complained of pain in his side; we went to Worship Street to give information, but they would not hear to it—on the Saturday he was worse—he still complained of pain in his side, and I applied a mustard poultice to it—I then sent for Mr. Simpson who attended him till his death on 9th March; he continued to complain of his side all the time.</p>

On Thursday night, 18th Feb., I was awoke by the screams of my sister—I left the shop and went through the passage, and saw the male prisoner having hold of Mr. Sawyer by the hair of his head—theprisoners were very near the top of the stairs above Mr. Sawyer—he was about the middle of the stairs against the banisters—I saw the male prisoner give him a very violent kick on the side—at that time I went out into the street, and called "Police!" and two policemen came—I saw the female prisoner—she had hold of my sister by the hair of her head, and my sister was rather in a bending position.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in City Terrace, City Road. On Saturday evening, 20th Feb., I was called to Sawyer's house, in Cavendish Street—I examined him, and found his left side very much swollen; he was also complaining of very great pain in that ride just below the left breast—Idirected the usual treatment, medicine for pleurisy, and ordered leeches—I ordered him to remain perfectly quiet, and to abstain from liquor—I saw him again on Sunday; he was much worse then—I continued to see him every day until he died—he got gradually worse, and died on the evening of 9th March, about half-past 8 o'clock—he made a statement to me about half-past 2 o'clock on the Monday—I had before that told his wife, in his presence, that I thought there was no hope of his recovery; that was intended for him to hear—he said he thought he should never get better, and he said so fre<lb/>quently during the time I attended him—when I told his wife, in his presence, that I thought there was no hope of his recovery, he made no remark imme<lb/>diately, but about two or three minutes afterwards he said he thought he should never get better—I then asked him to tell me exactly how the accident had occurred—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that this evidence was not sufficient to admit the statement as a dying declaration; Mr. Justice Byles was of opinion that it was sufficient, and would admit the statement</hi>)—as near as I can recollect the words, he said, "I was standing on the stairs when Mrs. Hutchins kicked me in the stomach; she did not hurt me, but Mr. Hutchins pressed his knee into my side, and I believe that to be my death-blow"—that was all he said—hedied about four or five hours after wards—he was in a very exhausted state at that time, but perfectly sensible—on the following Friday I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found a bruise on the left side and on the back; corresponding to that, another bruise—I also found the ribs on that side depressed in front—the expression of the face was highly painful, and a little frothy mucous was issuing from the mouth—I afterwards opened the body—Ifound the brain slightly congested, but nothing more than usual—I opened the chest—on the left side I found some slight amount of effusion, on cutting through the covering of the lungs, and on examining the lower lobe of the left lung in the pleura, under the place corresponding with the injury it was in a highly inflammable state, and the lungs also were very much inflamed—I cut through the pleura—I found nothing particular on the external surface; on the internal surface it was very much inflamed and almost in a state of gangrene from the acute inflammation, and also some amount of effusion in that cavity—thelower lobe of the left lung was also in a very inflamed state—in my opinion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185804050047"/>
               <p>the external injury was the cause of death; I mean the blow or pressure on the left side—I have not the slightest doubt of it—the pressure of a person's knee would be sufficient to cause that injury.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you discover any signs of an old injury to the ribs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he had been subject to piles—I saw no marks of any old fracture, nor did I discover any injury; he was about thirty-three years of age—he was not a healthy man—I should imagine he had taken a great amount of stimulant in early life; he was not particularly thin.</p>

I was passing through Wilton Street, and saw some people round a bakers shop, and saw Donovan inside; I asked what it was, and some boys said that a woman was passing a bad shilling—I waited till a policeman came, and spoke to him—when she was brought out, going through Vincent Square, I said to her, "What is the matter? Shall I take your baby?"—she refused, and I went to the station and waited till she came out—I am positive James is not the person, because it was me that spoke.</p>

On this Saturday after<lb/>noon, about a quarter past 4 o'clock, I saw Cox go into Mrs. Lack's, a grocer, in Isleworth, and afterwards into Mrs. Fraser's—when he came out of Mrs. Lack's, I went in—he bought 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of pudding at Mrs. Fraser's, and put a shilling on the counter, which I saw was bad; they gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I stopped him coming out, and told him he had passed a bad shilling—hesaid that I was cunning—I went to Mrs. Lack's, and asked her if he was the man that came to her—I put the shilling in my mouth and bent it—heput the change on the counter, took the bad shilling, and threatened to punch my bead—a policeman took him and took the shilling from him—I saw Dovey and Hall going towards Richmond, and as soon as they saw King coming on horseback they ran away—Dovey had a basket, first but when saw him afterwards he had not.</p>

I went to the house, No. 36, Monkwell Street, on the night of the fire—I found the last witness when I got there, three or four minutes after 9 o'clock—I went into the warehouse, and observed the hole in the floor—I looked through it, and saw a light below; I went into the cellar, and found the gas light and the pipe bent up towards the floor—the burner was on the gas pipe—the middle of the burner was out—I do not know what a fishtail burner is—this is the burner, the middle of it is out—the burner should hare been screwed on here—theflame extending from this pipe was about ten inches long; it was a large volume of flame—the nozzle of the pipe was within two or three inches of the floor, or where the flooring ought to have been, but it was burnt away—theflame came through the hole six or seven inches above the flooring—thebracket was unscrewed from the post, and was bent up to the flooring—I found these three screws, which had serewed the bracket to the post, lying at the foot of the post—the screws correspond with the holes in the post.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Has any experiment been made to see what flame this pipe would give? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was from the main—here is a piece out of the middle of this burner; something would screw in here—there has been a nipple taken out—I cannot say whether that would increase or diminish the flame—I had never seen the pipe before that night—these are the screws, I gave them to Foulger—a water pipe ran over the gas pipe—I round the remains of molten lead on this gas pipe, they were fresh, and had come from the burning of the floor above; not from the burning of the gas—the water pipe and the bracket of the gas pipe were about ten inches apart—I have not been in possession of the premises along with other persons—I was there that night till 11 o'clock—I did not see the prisoner and his family return.</p>

I went to the premises, No. 36, Monk<lb/>well Street, on the evening of 10th March—I found Bailey and other firemen there—I made this model, which accurately represents the premises—in this cellar there arc two pipes; this one represents the gas pipe—one of the pipes</p>

                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old. I was in the prisoner's service on 10th March—I was the only servant—I did not sleep in the house—I re<lb/>member my mistress leaving the house that day about half past 4 o'clock—the prisoner was there at the time; he did not say where my mistress was gone to then, but about ten minutes after 8 o'clock he said she was gone to the theatre—beforemy mistress went out, I had been sent about half past 3 o'clock to my master's mother in White Cross Street, to tell her to come down about 5 o'clock—shecame down about 5 o'clock—that was after my mistress had gone—the prisoner was not in at the time she came; he came back about 6 o'clock—he gave her some money, and took her into the show room to speak to her—I was in the kitchen—the show room is up stairs over the warehouse; it is opposite to the room I was in—they were in the show room together about ten minutes—afterthat, Mrs. Parker left the house, and took the two children with her—thatwas about 6 o'clock—the eldest child is about seven, and the youngest about five years old—after that, to the best of my knowledge, my master remained in the house—about 8 o'clock I was sent out for a pint of beer; I got it, and brought it back, and gave it to my master—I was again sent out for a pint of beer about twenty minutes past 8 o'clock—before I went out my master told me he was going to the theatre to Mrs. Parker, and he would let me in before he would go; that was all he said to me—I went and got the beer—I was away about ten minutes—as I was coming back with the beer, I met my master in Monkwell Street—he did not say anything to me—I do not know whether he saw me—I went on to the house and knocked several times, and receiving no answer, I went to borrow a latch key—I could not open the door—I stood a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes by the door—two</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I was the occupier of the house No. 36, Monkwell Street, up to July, 1857—I put up the gas bracket in the cellar; it was in this position (<hi rend="italic">Placing it against a post</hi>)—this fishtail burner was there; it would produce a flame like a small fan; it was about the width of my two fingers, but not so long as my fingers—it was lighted every day more or less for seven years; it was constantly burning, the cellar being very dark—supposing it remained in the position I left it, it was not likely to communicate to the wood; there was not the slightest probability of it.</p>

This is the claim that was made on 17th March—I had gone on the premises on 12th March—the insured spoke of the patterns which were consumed; he said, there was a large number of them hanging round the shop or warehouse, and their loss would be very serious to him; that his customers and his men thought that he got these patterns from Paris, but that was not true; his practice being, when a cus<lb/>tomer asked him for any new mantle, to tell them that he was in course of making them, and that he then went round to various manufacturers and wholesale houses, and found the mantle that his customer described, and he bought it, and made a number from that, and he wished me not to mention this, as it might prejudice him before his customers—I afterwards examined the stock remaining—the whole of the contents of the show room on the first floor was uninjured by the fire, or water, or smoke, those articles appeared in the claim—the men's clothing was in the first floor—there is in the claim a claim of 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for fixtures—I examined the fixtures, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, or at the outside 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., would fully reinstate the fixtures—the value of the entire stock to be insured would be 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was insured for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the fixtures—the stock is valued in the claim at 241<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that is the property which I considered cost the insured 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know nothing about the patterns which had been round the shop—there were the marks where they had hung—theseare the sort of things (<hi rend="italic">Producing some patterns</hi>); these were in various parts of the place—the patterns which had been round the shop were burnt—Isaw the gas burner on the morning after the fire—I have had considerable experience with gas burners in cases of fires.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are persons, on the part of the Fire Office, in possession of all that is found on the premises after the fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the salvage has been taken away by the Sheriff—I never saw this inventory of Mr. Showell's till it was left at my office—I examined the premises on the 23d—I had this claim in my hand when I examined the stock and checked it—the first claim is for fixtures—here is "Paid on commencing business, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I don't know whether that is correct—I valued the fixtures at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was what I considered it would take to reinstate them, the damage done being so small—thereis papering and men's time—here is a large cutting board, I think that is damaged slightly—one ditto ditto, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; one of them was damaged, the other was not—I have not attached a separate price to every article; I did to some articles in this claim on 23d March—I have not got that copy; it was on a copy that Mr. Arnold had with him—I was aware, on the 23d, that the prisoner was charged with setting fire to his house wilfully—I was exa<lb/>mined before the Magistrate—I have here a memorandum I made of the value of some of the articles on the premises.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you included the articles of furniture in the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have not considered the paper and the men's time, I thought that was part of the building—here are no prices on this paper—I have gone through, item by item, the articles set forth in this claim, and have cheeked them by the articles in the warehouse—I have a written memorandum of the prices I fixed to some of the articles; these are rough notes which were made after I had carefully examined the entire of the stock—Iam always employed by the Westminster Fire Office to value; I am not employed by other fire offices—there is fifty-one yards of peconia which is charged 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it is rubbish, a very common material—I valued it at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if it were worked up it would make the commonest sort of material—hereare thirty-one Milton's Berlin, they are part of the mantles; they are of third or fourth quality—I did not value the mantles separately—there was</p>

               <p>one set of modern mantles, and there was a large bundle which were last winter's mantles—I did not value them—here is 194 yards of cord, at 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I examined that, I considered that was charged about a fair price—there is some grey twill and other articles; they are about a fair price—there were tickets to most of the goods—the first item is mantles; I think they were worth about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. apiece, they were made up and were not injured—they were common; I should think that is what they would cost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am buyer of mantles to Messrs. Stagg, of Leicester Square.

                  </hi>. I am seventeen years old—I live at No. 3, John Place, Islington Green—my father is a shoemaker—I went into the prisoner's service on a Monday, about 8th March, as a warehouse boy—on the second day after I was there I went down into the cellar; it is very dark indeed; there is no other light than what can be obtained by the gas pipe—when I went down that day I lighted the gas—that was a little before dinner—Mr. Parker had shown me the gas pipe, and the place below, on the Monday, the first day, and on the Tuesday I lighted the gas—I was there three days before the fire took place—on the Tuesday I had to go down into the cellar, and before I lighted the gas I knocked my shoulder against the gas pipe—I went up stairs and got a match, and lighted the gas—I looked at the branch pipe, and saw the screws were about half an inch out of the holes—I observed the branch was fixed to the post—I put the serews in, as well as I could, with my hand—theywere so loose that I could shove them in again—on the Wednesday, the next day, I was attending to my business in the warehouse—there were no repairs being done in the warehouse; there had been on the Saturday before I came—there was lumber about the warehouse—Mr. Parker asked me on the Wednesday if I had anything to do; I said, "No," and he told me to take this lumber down into the cellar—he told me about 5 o'clock, but I did not attend to it for about half an hour afterwards; I then carried a long piece of wood, and some other pieces of wood, down into the cellar; but first I had to light the gas before I took them down—I went down twice with the lumber in that way—I had two drawers to carry down—I carried them on my arm, and on the top of my head—I was about placing them by the water butt, but when I turned I saw room in another part, and in going to that place I had to pass the gas branch, and in going I stumbled over the dust heap, and one box flew against the branch, and the other on the left side of me—I then heard my master call, and I ran up stairs directly I had put it in it's place—I did not put the gas out; my master said to me, "Look sharp for the post, or else you won't be there before 6 o'clock"—I went, and on my return I did not go down in the cellar—I had to get a truck to take some goods to Gravel Lane, Houndsditch—I did so, and I met my master in London about half past 6 o'clock—I asked him if I should pay for the truck; he said, "Yes," and</p>

               <p>of Mr. Nicholson, in Angel Street, St. Martin's-le-Grand, but he was in business in Whitecross Street—he has been a cutter twelve or fourteen years—Iwas in the habit of working for him in Monkwell Street—he was in the habit of working for Leafs, in the Old Change, Morley's, in Wood Street, and others—I have worked for my brother six or seven years—he was in the habit of collecting patterns—he had a shop of his own in Whitecross Street, where there were patterns belonging to him; he had a retail shop there—at the time of the fire the patterns were in Monkwell Street; there were some hundreds altogether—a set of patterns averages from a dozen to eighteen—theycommence from children's up to women's of different sizes—a set is an assortment of sizes—there were some hundreds of these patterns, they might average from 250 to 300 sets—a single pattern sometimes consisted of several pieces cut out to fit into each other—you have to use your judgment about them—thesepatterns are of known and recognized value in the trade—a set of patterns to a wholesale manufacturer, if they were French, would cost from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to three or four guineas the set—to a person who had collected these patterns they would be of actual value—I was not present when the inventory was made out—I do not know whether the articles which were in stock at my brother's had tickets or marks of the prices on them—on the day in question, I was in the warehouse at work with Jones and Wicks—I went out it 1 o'clock in the day—I was in the warehouse in the afternoon, I left at 3 o'clock, and did not return till about 8 o'clock, I then left—when I went out I went to the retail shop, in Whitecross Street—I attend to that a good deal, it is my particular business—when I left the warehouse at night, Jones, and Mr. Russell, and my brother were there; I did not see Wicks—I know this burner and pipe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw them the next morning, the burner went within an inch of its natural position—I noticed on that morning a piece of lead on the pipe—I noticed this piece of lead on it—I remember that before the Monday of that week some old wood had been made into a sort of counter—I was aware of the repairs being done to the counter on the Saturday—when I returned to the warehouse about 8 o'clock, I went im<lb/>mediately to Whitecross Street—I heard of the fire about 9 o'clock, I then went to the premises, the fire was out—I only knew where my brother and his wife had gone that afternoon from what they told me—I was there in the evening when they came home, about half-past 11 or quarter to 12 o'clock—mybrother, and his wife, and his mother, and the two children came—I remained in the house that night.</p>

I have been in this business for many years—I am partly acquainted with the mantle trade, as a cutter—patterns are valuable according to the circumstances under which they are required; what might be valuable to me might not be valuable to others—supposing a person obtains one pattern, it is the practice to cut from that a set of different sizes, and that set becomes valuable—with regard to mantle patterns, it is according to circumstances, and the claim that might be required—with me an article might be worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to another not worth 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it is entirely as to the trade I was carrying on—I cannot tell what is the highest value that I have known a mantle pattern; a pattern I have in my pocket (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>) cost me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; if I made a set of patterns from this it would take four or five hours cutting—the value of that set would be to me about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but perhaps not to a stranger—I cannot say that I have known a set of patterns to be worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or more—I should think the highest I have known would be about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; a set of four—I spoke of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a set of three—I do not know that a set of twelve would be required—I cannot tell what would be the price of 200 or 300 sets of patterns—it would be entirely with the manufacturer; the value lies with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cress-examined. Q.</hi> How is it that this pattern cost 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had to make a mantle from it for my own private use, and to obtain it I bought this pattern for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cutter. I have been in the employ of Parsons and Co., who are very extensive dealers—I have been there about a year and a half—patterns of mantles are undoubtedly of recognized value in the trade; they are in sets of different sizes—I cannot speak as to the highest price of a mantle pattern; it depends on the time and labour expended on it's production—supposing you get a pattern from a friend, or from Paris, you have to pay for it, and have to expend labour in making a set to work by them—I do not know what would be the value of a mantle pattern, or of a set of eight or ten, whether they would be worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; some pat<lb/>terns are more or less elaborate than others—supposing a person had collected 200 sets of patterns of different sorts, they would be of a recognized value in the trade most assuredly—I know they are always taken in stock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman cutter.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I keep the house, No. 8, Arundel Court, Haymarket. I knew the deceased, Heloise Taubin; she lodged in that house for four months before her death—I think she got her living by walking the streets and bringing gentlemen home; she was a gay woman—I believe she was thirty-two years of age—she occupied the third floor front room—on the night of 23d Feb., I was in Charles Street, Haymarket, about 10 o'clock—the deceased was also out in the street at that time, walking about—about 10 o'clock I saw the prisoner in Charles Street; he spoke to me—we were in conversation for some minutes together—I had a watch and some jewellery on that night; a chain and several rings—he came up to me and asked me if I was a French woman—I said, "No"—I then spoke to him in German; he did not answer—I afterwards showed him where I lived—Ishowed him the house with my finger; he walked up and down the Haymarket with me; that was at the same time—about half past 10 o'clock I was in Arundel Court; I had just returned home, and he was standing there talking to two women at the door of my house—they were the deceased and Madame Virginie Sylvestre—I did not see whether he left the court at that time, as I went into my room—about 11 o'clock the prisoner came to the house—I was then in the parlour with an old lady—the prisoner came and rang the bell—the servant opened the door, and he asked for Madame—heopened the door of my room, and said he had come to sleep with me—I told him that I would not allow him to sleep with me, because it was too little money, and I expected a friend—he had said in the Haymarket that he would give me 10 francs—I told him it was too early, and he said he would come later—I told him in the house that I would not go to bed at so early an hour for so little money; I said, "You think perhaps I am foolish or stupid to go to bed so early for so little money"—when he saw that I would not let him sleep with me, he was very sorry and very cross about it—I then went into my back parlour and put on my bonnet, and the prisoner remained at the door of the parlour; the two rooms are adjoining—the prisoner spoke to my servant, Ann Brown, in French—she does not understand French well, and she called me—he told her to go and fetch the little woman of the two with whom he had spoken at the door; she went—the prisoner remained in the house while she was gone—in four or five minutes she brought the deceased back to the house, and I saw her go up stairs with the prisoner; that was just 11 o'clock—I never saw her again alive—I went out after 11 o'clock—I saw the deceased in the streets that night, with a watch, a chain, and a ring on her—I did not see her body after she was dead.</p>

               <p>where they buy their dresses; they were their own—they are lodgers—a Monsieur Mouton lodged in the house, no other man; he sells jewellery; he is a merchant—he came to see Virginie, but I think he had a room somewhere else; I am not certain about that—I believe he slept in the house sometimes—I do not know that he slept there always, as I did not trouble myself with my lodgers at all, or their business—the ladies paid me for their lodging by the week—they were not in debt to me at this time, not any of them—I do not know whether Mouton was in the house at 11 o'clock, when I was there—I do not know whether Mrs. Disher was in the house—she is married, and Mr. Disher lives in the house, and works out of the house, as a tailor—I did not know of any disturbance between Mr. and Mrs. Disher that night—Juliette had been ill three weeks; she had a pain in her side; she was attended by a surgeon, after the death of the deceased, not before—she had not been altogether confined to her bed for the three weeks; she came down sometimes to see her friend, Virginie Sylvestre, and the deceased was also her friend—Juliette lived in the back garret; the deceased in the front garret; Sylvestre in the second floor front; and Disher in the second floor back—the two rooms on the first floor were occu<lb/>pied by a Belgian woman, I do not know her name; I think it was Anna, but I am not certain; she did not occupy that room a long time—I am the land<lb/>lady of the house, but my servant generally let the rooms—the Belgian woman was a gay woman, she had no man living with her—she had a lover, but he came to the house only—I think he was a Frenchman; he came from Lyons, or somewhere thereabout—I had seen him there the same night that I saw the prisoner—I did not see him on that night, it was the next night, when she was dead—I recollect now that it was on the night following, because I was very sad about this accident, and he spoke to me to console me about it—I did not see him on both nights—I do not know whether Anna, the Belgian woman was in the house that night—I did not mention her name when you asked me about the gay women who were living in the house, because I did not recollect it at the time, as she only lived a very short time there—I did not see the Frenchman in the day at all, I saw him the night after the misfortune; he came then into my parlour, and spoke to me to console me—I had never seen that Frenchman talk to Heloise; I never saw him speak to her—I saw the Belgian woman about 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, when she came into my parlour—that was the day after this—I occupied all the ground floor—my bed room is at the back—no one slept with me that night; no one came in at any part of the night—I told the prisoner I ex<lb/>pected a friend; I did expect him, but he did not come—I had no other rooms than those below, only the kitchen—I had Ann Brown as a servant, and another one, a little woman who has since left; I think her name also was Ann, but she had another name besides—she was in my service at the time the prisoner came to the house; she slept in the kitchen, and Brown slept out of the house—Brown left sometimes at 1 o'clock, and sometimes at 2 o'clock in the morning—she usually came at 10 or 11 o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing—theother girl was about twenty years of age—she went to bed about 1 o'clock that morning—she got up about 7 or 8 o'clock in the morning to to wash the stairs and the passage; that was generally the case, but that morning I was asleep when she got up, and I cannot say the precise time—shewashed the passage every day—it was her business, as servant, to do it every morning—on the evening when I saw the prisoner, I had not rings on both my hands, only on one hand—I wore four on that night; they were the same as I have on now—they are all diamond rings—theywere on two fingers of the same hand—the ring that Heloise had on was a ring with a red stone, a stone such as gentlemen wear in their pins, a garnet—I had the same watch and chain on that I have now—I did not wear the watch suspended at my waist, but in my pocket—when I showed the prisoner my house with my finger, I was about as far from it as across this court—when I say he was very cross about my not consenting to sleep with him, he did not say anything, but he looked downwards, with his eyes down.</p>

               <p>live from the produce of the work of my friend, Mr. Mouton—he was staying with me altogether at that house—he slept there on the night that the deceased met her death—he slept there every night—I knew the deceased perfectly well—I was out with her that evening—I was with her when she met the prisoner in Waterloo Place—when we came out of the house we met Madame Levy in the court—the prisoner was speaking to us in the passage of the house, but he would not stay at that time, and it was when we went out after that, that we met Madame Levy in the court just before the house—I did not hear him ask Madame Levy to sleep with him, but he said to me that if Madame Levy would not sleep with him, he would sleep with one of us—wethen left him at the corner of the passage—about three quarters of an hour afterwards we saw him in Piccadilly—that was from about a quarter to 11 to 11 o'clock—he addressed himself to Heloise, and again said, that if the other would not sleep with him he would sleep with the deceased or with me—the deceased told him to leave her alone, and said, "Go to the devil;" he then went away—a short time after that, Ann Brown, the servant of the house, came after us, and said to Heloise that there was a gentleman, and Heloise went back—I returned to the house at 1 o'clock in the morning—I occupied the second floor front room—Theophile Mouton came home with me—we had supper after we got home, about half-past 1 o'clock—the deceased was very often in the habit of having supper with us—on this night I called to her twice to come down to supper—she was then in her own room with the prisoner—the first time I called her she said she was engaged, and she was in bed and could not come—I heard the prisoner say that she was engaged, and could not come down—I said the second time, "Come down, come down; it is no matter, come down"—I then heard the prisoner say, if she wanted her supper, he offered her one—after that, she came down to supper—there was only the deceased and me at supper, Mr. Mouton was in bed—the deceased remained with me at her supper till about half-past 2 o'clock—she then went back to her room—a short time after that, I went up the staircase and called at the deceased's room door—I went to fetch a book; and the prisoner gave me the book—I saw him perfectly well when he gave it me—he had only his shirt on at the time—when I received the book, he locked the door with the key—I went down to my room—I cannot say positively what time I got up on the Wednesday, but I think it was about 12 o'clock mid-day; I had breakfast about 1 o'clock—Heloise very often came to breakfast with me, and she had told me the day before that she would do so on that very day—about 1 o'clock Mr. Mouton went to call her at her room—I heard what he said, my door was open—he obtained no answer—between 2 and 3 o'clock I went up to see the sick person, Juliette, and I tried the handle of Heloise's door several times to see if I could open it; it was locked—I tried to look through the keyhole for the purpose of seeing if the key was inside—there was no key in the lock—I could not hear anything in the room—at 8 o'clock in the evening I saw the door of the room broken open by Theophile—I went into the room with him—I first looked at the table, and saw her things all upon it; I then looked towards the bed, but I could only see something after Theophile had removed the bed clothes a little—I then saw Heloise; I did not see her face, but I recognized her—I saw the back of her head and her back—she was lying on her face; her head was between the two pillows, not one over her head, and the other under it, but between the two—her arms were turned outside in this way (<hi rend="italic">putting her hands backwards</hi>)—she remained precisely in the position in which she was found, till the doctor came; no<lb/>body touched her—I had not looked at her wrists before the doctor came—I</p>

               <p>was down stairs when the doctor came—I walked up with him, but I did not go into the room until after he had examined the body, or was about it—Isaw the deceased's face then, so the doctor must have moved her—I think the doctor came about five minutes after the door was broken open, but I cannot exactly say just the time—one of the servants went for the doctor I do not know which—Theophile stopped at the door of the room, and said nobody should enter there until the doctor came, and he shut the door—I was out with the deceased the night before, to buy some shoes, because she could not talk English—she wore a watch and a chain, two rings, and a pair of earrings that night—when I went into her room on the Wednesday I did not observe any of those articles—I did not look for them, but I begged the inspector to do so—I knew the deceased's watch perfectly well; and one of the rings I knew perfectly well; the other one I had seen, but she only pos<lb/>sessed that second one since the Sunday before—I know the earrings that she had on that night—I know that she possessed a little wooden work box which Theophile Mouton bought for her; and she had brooch, with the por<lb/>traitof a soldier on it—I think they call it a Chasseur de Vincennes—I think she placed that brooch in a drawer of a chest of drawers—the work box was bought about Christmas—I have seen the articles that have been mentioned since, several times; the first time at Vine Street police station, then at Marl<lb/>orough Street police court, and the third time before the Grand Jury.</p>

Madame Virginie Sylvestre lived in that room with me—I remember the Wednesday upon which the death of this young woman was discovered—on that evening, from 8 to half past 8 o'clock, I went up to her room with three or four other persons, ladies—I found the door locked, but the key was not there—having called several times and received no answer, I forced the door open—there was no key in the lock in the inside; I observed that immediately I went into the room—my first look was to the table and to the sofa, which were in complete disorder—the table was covered by a muff a bonnet, a cloak or mantle of velvet and lace, a pint of beer or porter, and some glasses in which was the remainder of some beer—the sofa was drawn towards the fire, and there were, I think, some petticoats and things upon it—after noticing these things, I looked towards the bed, and then I saw something black, it was the top of the deceased's hair—I went to the bed, put my hand on the bedclothes, and said, "Heloise, Heloise, do you sleep"—having made this movement towards her three or four times, I lifted the bedclothes up to the middle of the bed, as far as her lower loins—she was lying on her belly, with her face between the two pillows; she was quite dead—the arms were blue—the arm were turned outside, in this position (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>), and close to her body; the fingers were clenched just like a person who had defended herself, cramped, not closed, contracted—the arms were not blue all over, but spotted blue—I remained at the door of the room until the doctor came; I stood in the middle, just inside, holding the handle in my hand till the doctor and the police came—when I disovered the body, I covered it over again, and it remained in the same state until the doctor and the police came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an English woman. In Feb. last I lived No. 8, Arundel Court, Haymarket; I occupied the second floor back room—my husband lived with me—I remember the Wednesday, when the death of this young woman was discovered—on the night before that, I had a quarrel with my husband; in consequence of that I went and sat on the stairs—I went out of my room about 1 o'clock—I went down into the kitchen then—I came up again about half past 2 o'clock, and sat against the door of my own room—Icontinued to sit there till 7 o'clock the next morning—about that time, or a little before 7 o'clock, I heard three groans proceeding from the top of the house—that was about 7 o'clock, it might be a few minutes before—about half an hour afterwards a gentleman came down the stairs—the prisoner is the person—he said nothing to me, he never spoke to me; he came behind me all the way down, and passed me at the foot of the stairs; he followed me all the way down, and passed me on the landing to get out at the house door—I saw him quit the house—there was nobody there to open or close the door, he opened it himself and closed it himself; nobody else came down at that time—he did not carry anything in his hand—I noticed that he was very stout across the shoulders, and thought he was a stout gentleman as he passed me—he presented a stouter appearance across the breast than he does now; he had on a brownish coat, it was a loose coat with loose sleeves—it was not at all like the one he has on now, it had no hood to it—it was a coat; it had a collar, no hood; it was a big loose coat, rather longish, and loose sleeves; it was a great coat, it hung loose about him—I had an oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing his coat when he went outside the door—it was quite light—Inext saw him at Marlborough Street—I saw his face, for he turned round and looked at me when he got outside the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of No. 8, Charles Street, St. James's Square. I was called in to the house in Arundel Court on the Wed<lb/>nesday evening, between 9 o'clock and half past—I went up to the front room on the third floor, and there found the dead body of a female, lying on the face the face supported by pillows on either side—I removed the coverings so as to see the whole body—it was on a bed—the face was downwards on two pillows, and the rest of the body was corresponding with it, quite flat down<lb/>wards, flat on the belly—I should think ten or twelve hours had elapsed since the death—there was slight warmth in the chest and belly—the fact of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185804050092"/>
               <p>body being covered with clothes would keep the warmth longer than if the body had been entirely exposed—I had the body turned over on the bed—beforethat was done I noticed the position of the arms, they were turned outwards, and the hands everted, that is, the fingers from the body, so that she would have the arms in this way behind her—I did not particularly notice any discolouration of the arms before the body was turned over, but afterwards I did; in front of the arms they were livid—the general appear<lb/>ance of the body was livid, and with red patches; the eyes prominent, and the blood extravasated underneath the membrane of the eye; the pupils dilated; the right eyelid had drooped and covered the eye; the feature swere swollen and much distorted; blood and mucus was running from the nose; the tongue swollen and protruding from the mouth, so much swollen that I could not have made any mistake about it at all—at the lower and front part of the windpipe there was a dark red livid spot, about the size of a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece; the skin around that spot was excoriated externally—it was such a mark as would have been caused by either the finger or thumb of a person—therewas no mark of a ligature round the throat—the finger nails were livid, dark coloured—on Saturday, the 27th, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion of the body, assisted by another surgeon, a Mr. Power—the vital organs were quite healthy, we found no trace of disease in any part of the body—shewas apparently from thirty to thirty-three or thirty-four years of age, as Dear as I could judge—we examined externally the part of the windpipe where the livid spot appeared; there was the appearance of recent injury there—on removing the skin over the spot that I have described, it appeared much bruised; the muscles underneath were turgid, or filled with blood, charged with blood, and appeared bruised—I attribute her death to strangulation—a pressure on the spot of the windpipe which I have described, of the finger or thumb of a person, would cause death by strangulation—whether death would be speedy would depend upon the amount of force used—from our exami<lb/>nation of the windpipe we came to the conclusion that considerable force had been used—that is my opinion—it is difficult to say, but supposing a consi<lb/>derable amount of force had been used, I should say that death would have happened within half an hour, or perhaps more, or less, it would depend upon the amount of force used.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that death would have happened from such a thing by pressure for half an hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, less than that, if the pressure was sufficient—if sufficient force was used, death might ensue in ten minutes, or less than that; I mean if there was sufficient pressure kept up for ten minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whether it might be done in two minutes, did you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Scarcely in two minutes, in an adult—it is very doubtful whether that would be sufficient in an adult, who would struggle for her life.</p>

               <p>the brain have some of them been gorged with blood—that does not always follow in strangulation, but I should certainly look for it—in this case death was not caused by what is popularly called apoplexy; it is not because the vessels of the brain are loaded, that it should be called apoplexy—the vessels being gorged is one of the symptoms of apoplexy—I examined carefully the vessels of the brain in this instance—the heart was healthy, but was not in its natural state with regard to the supply of blood; the right side was full of dark black blood; that is one of the symptoms of death by strangulation—shewas not a woman of full habit; there was nothing remarkable either one way or the other—she was muscular, and comparatively in good health—she appeared to have the ordinary power that women of her size generally have—sheappeared in perfect health; I saw nothing to make me think the contrary—she did not appear over strong, not beyond the usual strength of women of her build and size—she was a woman of ordinary strength—there were some livid spots on the arms which I call extravasation or ecchymosis—Iam not aware of any difference or distinction between cadaverous lividity and ecchymosis—I am not aware that in the books there are any such dis<lb/>tinctions drawn—I do not know of marks like those I have spoken of, livid spots, coming on after death, not the same as I have described; not when parties have died a natural death; there is a general lividity on most bodies after death, but not of the same description; it is not in patches, as it was in this case—there is frequently a general lividity in persons who have died from unnatural or other causes, but I am not aware that it comes in patches, in the manner that I have described—I will not say that the lividity of a dead body would not come on in patches in some instances, but it has not come under my observation—the blue spot on the windpipe was deeper and darker than the patches on the arms—the skin was excoriated outside that spot, not to any great extent, perhaps it might be the size of a shilling or larger, I did not take particular notice—it fitted the thumb very well, for I tried it—it looked as if the pressure had been directly on the windpipe, as if the pressure had been this way with the thumb point—I gave the appearances my most careful attention, and came to the conclusion that death was caused by strangulation, by pressure on the windpipe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the excoriation that you noticed such as might have been caused by the thumb only, supposing a person's thumb to have been used for the pressure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very probably, I should think—that excoria<lb/>tion, as far as my observation went, was chiefly on one side; more on one side than the other—this was a mode of death not probable, and scarcely possible, to have been caused by the subject herself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A person using pressure upon herself in that position would lose the power, and then relief would come; the hand would drop, and the air would come—it is the want of air in these cases that causes the death—the injury on the throut would not have caused death in any short time except from the want of air—if the air had not been excluded from the lungs, no doubt the party would not have died; I mean, from the amount of injury received upon the part; she would not have died from that—when I spoke of ten and fifteen minutes, I meant a continued pressure for those times—I do not think the mere blow would have done it; the amount of injury done would not cause death—if a blow of that kind had caused death, it would have been instantaneous; if it was a Mow of suffi<lb/>cient power to cause death, there is no doubt it would be instantaneous—therewas nothing that I could see in the deceased's body at all to cause death but the pressure on the windpipe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the house surgeon to Charing Cross Hospital. On Saturday, 27th Feb., I assisted Mr. Tothill in making a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exa<lb/>mination of the body of the deceased—I had seen the body before that day, in the dead house at the hospital; the general appearance of it, when I came to examine it, was livid and ecchymosed—the lividity was general; the patches of the ecchymosis were on the upper part of the trunk and arms; principally on the shoulders and arms—the face was congested with blood—there was a spot or mark which particularly attracted my attention, on the centre of the throat, just over the windpipe—I call it an ecchymosed mark—in size it cor<lb/>responded very nearly with the top of my thumb—there was no mark of a ligature round the throat—on opening the body, we found the organs gene<lb/>rally healthy—there was no trace of disease—when I saw the body first the tongue was protruding and very much swollen—that was on the Thursday I believe—there was blood extravasated underneath the conjunctiva of both eyes, that is the external membrane of both eyes, I mean, of the eyeball—the pupils of the eyes were dilated—the nails of the hands were livid; one was slightly broken, that was the top of the nail—I cannot say for certain which band that was, or which finger, I did not attribute so very much importance to it—on removing the skull, we found the brain considerably congested, sufficient to deserve the name of congested, it was decidedly congested—lexa<lb/>mined the muscles under the spot where I observed the external mark in the throat, and found them much bruised—the lungs were considerably congested—therewas no foreign body in the throat—the heart was healthy, the right side contained black blood—judging from these appearances, I attribute the death of the deceased to strangulation, produced by pressure on the windpipe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The right side of the heart contained black blood; what caused that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The right side of the heart not being able to propel the blood to the lungs, on account of the lungs being gorged with blood—that would depend upon the deficiency of air being there, the lungs being so gorged by the deficiency of the air that the heart was not able to propel any more blood to the lungs—it is the duty of the right side of the heart to send blood to the lunge.</p>

I live two doors from William Jones—I have lived there sixteen years next August; he has lived tfiere about ten years, and nearly opposite my door for about six years previously—I have been friendly with him, and been frequently in his house night and day—oneevening, about the middle of Jan., I was in his shop, and I saw Oliver in the shop, William Jones was behind the counter—I had occasion to go to borrow his steps to clean my window, and while I was stopping, I saw Oliver come in—he said he came for a watch that was bought in the morning for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and there was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid for it, and he had brought some jewellery to deposit for the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was to be paid the next morning—he produced three brooches and a small chain, what I call a brequet chain; it</p>

               <p>was something like this one before me; I should say this was the same chain, and two or three rings—William Jones looked at them, and he said, "I don't know that I shall be doing right, but as you have brought them, and say you came to deposit them for the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I will take them, if you will take them away in the morning"—I saw no watch—soon after I had cleaned my window, I went to take the steps in, and William Jones was examining the brooches—these brooches before me are like them; this large cameo brooch I noticed particularly—I know William Jones' house has been robbed twice; the last time was about two years ago—I helped him to fix up a bar; we put a double bar on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now in service at Knight's Hill, Norwood. In July, 1855, I was in the service of Mr. Kitson, in Warwick Street, Pimlico—Ihad been in his service about five years—during that time Caroline Wal<lb/>ters had been in his service; she left in 1852—previous to her leaving, the prisoner passed a note down the area to her—I saw him from the kitchen window—I know that Caroline Walters left the service to be married—I saw her one Sunday evening after she left to be married, end on that occasion I saw the prisoner—she called one Sunday evening, and he was outside the door, at the back of the house—I heard him say to her, "Are you not coming"—hedid not address her by any name—my master was in the habit of going out of town each year, and at that he was in the habit of depositing his plate in the wine cellar—it was known to Walters where my master deposited his plate—my master was absent in July, 1855—on Sunday evening, 15th July, that year, I went to bed about 10 o'clock—I had previously fastened all the doors and windows—I was reading after I went to my room—I heard a noise afterwards—I believe it to be between 11 and 12 o'clock—the room in which I slept is on the left side of the area; the cellar where the plate was, is under the foot pavement, opposite my bed room—when I heard the noise I called out three times to my grandfather, who slept on the first floor—he was the only other person in the house—he was an old man, and was very deaf, and has since died—I called "Grandfather!" three times, and then I called three times,"Who is there?" and no one answered—I heard some one strike a match; I believe it was outside the kitchen door, and then go to a cupboard under the kitchen stairs—the candle box was there—the prisoner then rushed into my room and struck me—he had a lighted candle in one hand, and something in the other hand, which I did not see—I was in bed—I could not tell what he struck me with—he struck me more than once; I had five blows—I was deprived of my senses by those blows—I recovered consciousness the next morning, when my grandfather called me at half past 5 o'clock—after the blows I felt a violence on my throat; I thought he was grasping my neck—Iwas all over blood—when my grandfather came to the side of the bed he said, "What is the matter?"—I said some one had been hitting me—he took a rope from my neck—my neck was sore for some days afterwards—I was</p>

In 1855 I was in Warwick Street—I was called into Mr. Kitson's house on the morning of 16th July; I saw the witness Rolfe; she was lying in bed, just recovering from the collapse attending on the severe injuries she had received—she had five or six severe contused wounds on the head, penetrating to the bone—the wounds were from half an inch to two inches in length, and the bone was exposed in several places—her arms were frightfully bruised, from her endeavour to save herself as she told me, from putting up her arms to defend her head—thearms were swelled immensely, from the result of those blows—the little finger of the right hand was broken, and the thumb of the same hand was injured—she has never recovered the full power of grasping with that hand—myattention was called to her throat, on account of the story of a rope being tied round it, but there was no particular mark on it—she was removed to St. George's Hospital—I did not attend her there, but I saw her several times—herlife was in extreme danger, and, as she was quite sensible, I felt it my duty to put questions to her as to the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. I remember on 20th Feb., in the Court in Guild<lb/>hall, the case of Ingham and Primrose being tried—the prisoner was examined as a witness on the part of the plaintiff; I administered the oath to him—at the time of his examination, he had this bill in his hand—I heard the question asked of him as to the state of the bill when he first received it—hesaid it was perfect; to the best of my recollection he said he received it at the Surrey County Court, in satisfaction for a debt of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I heard him asked where he had kept the bill—he said in one of the middle pockets of a pocket book, which he produced from his pocket at the time—as far as I can recollect, this is the pocket book he produced—I heard him asked to explain how the bill had become pasted together, and he said, just before he presented it, he found it was worn into two pieces, and he took it into his office and pasted it, or joined it together; that he received it just before it became due, and I think he said something about going to Liverpool, and wanting some money—I have here the notes of the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the drawer of this bill—it has been in two pieces—I delivered this bill to the defendant—this is the County Court sum<lb/>mons—Idelivered this identical bill to the defendant—I had put this piece of gum paper on it at Mr. Davis', in Milk Street; I asked Mr. Edwards for a bit of gum paper—after it had been gummed together, I produced it to Mr. Smith, to Mr. Shepherd, and to Henry Wigg—that was before I delivered it to the defendant—the original object of its being drawn was to get it dis<lb/>counted—itwas in my possession for that purpose—Mr. Primrose accepted it for that purpose on the day it bears date, 16th March, 1857—I afterwards returned this bill to Mr. Primrose, at the latter end of March, or the fore end of April—he asked me if I had got it in my pocket—I gave it him, and as soon as I gave it him he tore it in half—that was in Lawrence Lane—one part fell on the ground; I picked it up and put it into my pocket—I said, "That won't do for me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Between the time of the bill being torn and you delivering it to King, had you any communication with Primrose on the subject of re-issuing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think I had, before I gave it to King—when I took up the bit, and had the two pieces, I said to Primrose that I would not deliver it up till he brought the other back—he had a cross bill—I do not believe he was any party to my giving the bill to King at the Southwark County Court—I am quite sure that when I gave this bill to King, it was in its present state, except this small tear—it was pasted together—I believe this is the paper that was delivered to me by Mr. Davis' clerk.</p>

               <p>let it go out of my hands to any other person—I asked Mr. Smith, a builder—Iasked Mr. Wigg, and he said it would not do, being defaced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But what attempt had you made to discount it before it was torn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was filled up in Mr. Hill's office—I never tried any one but Mr. Hill, to get it discounted, before it was destroyed—I believe Primrose was present—Iasked Mr. Hill, then and there, to discount it; and he said he would keep it a day or two, and see what he could do—he gave it me back—Primrosewas not present when he gave it me back—I think I did not try to discount it, except with Hill, till it was destroyed—I think not—I cannot bring it to my memory—I cannot tell how long after Hill refused to discount it I saw Primrose—I and he were trying to raise money—I cannot tell how soon afterwards I told him of this—I was staying in Blossoms Inn; and he came and called me out—I believe I had told him before that, that I could not get the discount—the bill was torn at the bottom of Blossoms Inn Yard, in Lawrence Lane—he tore it in two pieces; first one fell on the ground, and then the other—I took the two pieces and put them into my pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say "This is an unsafe place for two pieces of paper to be left; I will take care that they shall not come to any harm?" or did you say "I shall not give these up till you return the other bill?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might say both—Itold him I would not allow that until I had the other back—I cannot recollect whether I said a word of that when I was examined in the Court of Common Pleas—Primrose and I went up to put in a plea, in tie action by Ingham against John Primrose—I came to prove that the bill was torn—I believe I was the only witness examined for Primrose; I believe I said, when I was examined as a witness, "I picked up the pieces and put them into my pocket, saying, it was better not to leave such things in the street"—I told Primrose I would not allow the bill to be torn—I do not remember that I said in the Court of Common Pleas that I would not—I spoke to Primrose about re-issuing the bill, before I gave it to King—I saw Primrose a few days afterwards—I did not see King in the counting house; I saw him, and gave him the bill—I cannot tell how long before that I had seen Primrose; I saw him on 2d April, and gave him a 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—that was after this bill was torn by Primrose, and before I gave it to King—I am sure I cannot tell whether anything passed between me and Primrose on 2d April—I told him what I had done by paying it to King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told me this moment that it was before you paid it to King? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect what I did say—Primrose lives at No. 8, St. Martin's Lane—King served me with a writ in Sept.—I and Primrose applied to a Judge for leave to defend the action—I was served with a writ, and Mr. Primrosesaid he was—he and I went together to the Judges' Chambers for the purposeof being allowed to defend the action; he and I both made an affidavit—the action was tried in February, at Guflhall—from the time that I and Prim<lb/>rose made the affidavit, till the action, I do not recollect that I told Mr. King one syllable about tearing the bill—I gave instructions to the attorney what to put in the affidavit—I think I told him to say in the affidavit about tearing the bill; I will not be positive—I told him to put in the defence the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I will not be positive whether I told him to say one syllable about tearing the bill—I cannot say whether I said that I bad pasted this bill together without the knowledge or authority of Primrose, and issued it again without his knowledge—I cannot say whether I swore I had committed a frand—I do not think I had any additional piece of gum to use besides what was on the gum paper—the bill was folded in a square, I think, as it is now, except this little tear.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, of No. 204, Fleet Street. The prisoner was my shopman from May to Oct., 1855—I had four shopmen at that time, including the prisoner—about Christmas, 1855, and alter the prisoner had left, I missed this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is worth 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it cost 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I next saw it about Feb., this year, in the hands of an officer who had another case in hand.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). I was outside the Bank of England on this morning, about 11 o'clock or half past, and saw the prisoner and George Perryman go into the hall—I followed them and saw Oliver tender the notes, and receive ten sovereigns for the two—I can speak to this as one of the notes; I have had it in my possession ever since—the prisoner passed me and Oliver while we were talking in the passage, without, taking any notice of Oliver; he was brought back by Spittle, and I told him what Oliver had told me; he said that it was so, and that he had given the notes to Oliver to get change, having picked them up the previous afternoon in a barber's shop—I asked him why he had given, or directed to be given, a wrong name and address, showing him the address on the back of the notes; he said that that name and address was on both notes when he found them—I asked him if he had made any effort to discover the owner; he said that he had not—he first said that he lived in Gravel Lane, and had a shop facing St. Katherine's Docks, and it was there that he picked up the notes—he was then taken to the station—he also gave his address at a place in Upper East Smithfield, and I understood him to say at first that he picked up the notes there, but it may be a mistake of mine.</p>

I produce a statement of qualification, purporting to be signed by Edward Auchmuty Glover—I produce it from my office, the office of the clerk of the Journals of the House of Commons; that is the proper place for it to be kept in—I have also the qualification roll, signed by the members, but I do not know that it is properly in my custody; it is in the custody of the Clerk of the House, Sir Denis le Marchant—there is a general heading of declaration at the commencement of the roll, which I suppose is in the terms of the Statute—it begins, "I, A. B., do solemnly declare and affirm that I am truly qualified"—underneath the word "Beverley" in this roll, I find the sig<lb/>nature of "Edward Auchmuty Glover."</p>

               <p>executed; it is dated 18th Sept., 1854—a few days before it was executed, Mr. Glover came to my office in Gray's Inn, with Mr. Bruce, who introduced him to me—Mr. Glover informed me that a relative of his, a lady, was about to be married, and he came to me to prepare the settlement—I think he men<lb/>tioned her name on that occasion; the conversation was general, and a fur<lb/>ther meeting was appointed for the same evening, at Mr. Glover's residence at Maida Hill—he gave me his card, and I went there that same evening at 7 o'clock, by appointment—on arriving there, I found Mr. Glover, Miss de Burgh, and Capt.

Q.</hi> This old gentleman did not understand business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is not very old, rather more than sixty—part of the money raised went to pay off old mortgages—the money was raised to join in a speculation in which I was concerned, which speculation commenced about a year before that, I think; a year or two before 1850—it was for making steel—there were patents mixed up with it—there was one place at Manchester and another at Flint—of the Ommanney's there was myself and another one, who was managing it—he had nothing to do with the firm of solicitors; he was a cousin of mine—the patents were bought with the capital of the concern—I cannot exactly say that I recommended this speculation to the old gentleman as a good speculation—I mentioned it to him, and he said he would go into it—I do not consider that the thing was failure, but it stopped at all events about 1854 or 1855—I owe the old gentleman something, not arising from the partnership, but money lent to carry on the partnership with—I am not indebted to him for the partnership accounts, the thing is all at an end—it was managed by a relative of mine, and Mr. Toker himself was down there very often—my cousin managed it, I west down very seldom—Miss Toker'g 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. went into another concern that Mr. Toker was in before I knew him, it was a concern for making pianos—I got him out of that concern—hewas still in that speculation when Mr. Glover called with him at my office—every body thought that the other speculation would be prosperous, down to the last minute—it came to an end principally because Mr. Toker married, and Mrs. Toker interfered—Mr. Glover took some part in it, and the parties would not have anything to do with it—there would have been more money forthcoming, but they would not have anything to do with it—itwas before that, that Mr. Glover came to my office—I keep a day book, in which I make entries of the transactions that I conduct—I went down to the Oaks property many years ago, not since these moneys have been raised—adjoiningthe Oaks is a small piece of land which belongs to Miss Toker, and which is not included in her mortgages, and when I wanted to take Possession, the sheriff's officer told me that she would not go out, and if she did not he must use force—I said, "Do not use force, if you can help it; I</p>

               <p>am quite willing that she should remain, if she will give any acknowledgment that she holds as tenant"—she insisted upon being turned out, and she was put into a tent on that land—all the furniture was taken out and put on that land—she afterwards agreed to become tenant, and I was quite unwilling to turn her out—she would not go out, and they were obliged to carry her out—theaction of ejectment was commenced in 1855, and the interest was in arrear—I did not wish to press matters, and I went on till the next year,1856—it got further in arrear, and I obtained judgment, and then I did not press it till 1857, when I saw a notice in the paper, stating that Mr. Glover claimed this property, and that his assignees in Ireland were coming to take possession of it, upon which I thought it was my duty to take possession first—it was after the election that I saw him—it must have been in May—theinstructions about the tent were after the election and after the declaration—Ireceived a notice from Mr. Glover as to the lease for twenty-one years; it was handed to me by Mr. Payne the tenant, signed Edward Auchmuty Glover—I know nothing about the lease or the charge—I saw the lease at the election committee, when I was subpoenaed there as a witness—I think it was produced by Mr. Glover.</p>

Ommanney—previously to the first year of my paying it, Mr. Glover came to me for the rent, in 1854—before I paid that first rent, Captain Toker had written to me to pay Mr. Glover, but when Mr. Glover came, I told him that I could not pay him—Mr. Glover mentioned that letter, and he requested me to pay—I said that I could not do it, and I produced the notice that I had received—he said, that he could not take that—since that time, I have not had any further interference from him.</p>

                  </hi>. My maiden name was De Burgh. I consulted Mr. Wright with respect to Mr. Glover's qualification, and afterwards communicated to Mr. Glover what I heard from Mr. Wright—we consulted him frequently—weconsulted him before the election, and between the election and his taking his seat, before he made the declaration before the House of Commons—he stated that it was a perfect qualification, and that he ought to take his seat—Mr. Wright wrote to tell me, that Mr. Glover's qualification for Beverley had been disputed at the election, in consequence of which I came up from the Oaks to see Mr. Wright in London, but I first wrote to him—I consulted with him on that occasion—I am quite certain that was before Mr. Glover took his seat—I told Mr. Glover what Mr. Wright told me, which was, that his qualification was in order, and that it was a perfectly good qualification, as good as any man's in the House of Commons—he acted afterwards as the parliamentary agent in Mr. Glover's election—I believe the lease for twenty-one years was lost, an the petition to the House of Commons, before the committee; it was at that time in Wright's possession—Wright prepared all those deeds, for the purpose of giving Mr. Glover a qualification, with the exception of Captain Toker's; Mr. George Annesley prepared that—that is in the Harty—I think I know the value of those properties; I consider the Oaks worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—before Mr. Glover took his seat, or made the declaration, I had frequently told him that the Oaks was worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—wehad been offered that rent for it that year—we employed Mr. Wright to let the Oaks, and that was the value he put upon it, and we were offered it—we did not take it, because Mr. Francis Ommanney put some difficulty in the way about the mortgages—we wished to pay the mortgages off before we gave up possession—I know the property occupied by Abbott and Fox; that is not comprised in the mortgage at all, or in our lease, it is in the rent charge—ithas paid 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for some years past—the two proprietors are Abbott and Fox.</p>

Downing Bruce—Mr. Glover never saw those instructions while they were in my possession—Mr. Bruce did not live there; his daughter did—I do not know that Mr. Glover sent any papers for the purpose of the preparation of the settle<lb/>ment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, of Red Lion Market; Whitecross Street, and am the owner of a plot of ground in Benlah Road, Walthamstow, which I got in a Freehold Land Society, about a year ago. I erected a fence on the left hand side of it, dividing a piece of land, which the prisoner</p>

               <p>had, from mine—that fence was constructed of wood, and strong posts, and palings—I dug a hole, set the posts in the ground, and then rammed the earth in around them—on 31st March, I went down and found the fence had been pulled down, and the best portion of it was removed into the prisoner's ground—a portion was remaining on my land, but it was all down—I saw the prisoner, and said, "Why you have made quite a ruin of it"—he said, "If you will give my men some beer, they shall look it up together again," and away he went—I began to look around, and saw a great portion of the wood on the scaffold of the house which he was building, and even over the doors and windows inside his building—I am able to say that it was my wood—I knew it—I saw the prisoner next day, and asked him why he had taken my wood; (there was a constable with me) that it had cost me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to put up, and it was very hard to see it all pulled down, and used on his ground—he said, "I have a lawyer in my family"—he repeated that half a dozen times, and then went to the top of the scaffold, telling me that I might sue him in the County Court—the prisoner put his hand on some wood, and said, "Whose are these?"—I said, "They are mine, I can swear to them!'—the prisoner said, "No, they are mind"—this is some of the wood (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these pieces were over the windows, forming the support for the arches—some of my wood he has put into his walls, built into the brick work.</p>

                  </hi>. In Nov. 1856, I was in the messenger's office of the South Eastern Railway. I remember an accident happening on 30th Oct. at Deptford station—a few days afterwards this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was put into my hands, in consequence of which I went to No. 33, Somer Street, Tanner's Hill, Deptford, the address contained in the letter—I saw the pri<lb/>soner there, and showed her the letter, saying, that we had received it from her about her injuries—she said, "Yes; I was very much hurt"—I asked her what compensation she thought would be likely to satisfy her—she did not state any particular amount, so I suggested the amount which I paid her, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and took her receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was signed Mrs. Grist, Tanner's Hill, Deptford, stating that, she was very much hurt in the back and loins, that she could not sit to work as a tailoress, and that she would be satisfied with a small compensation being very poor</hi>)—she did not say anything about where the accident occurred, and I took it for granted that she was in the accident—I paid her the money from my belief in the truth of that letter.</p>

I live next door to the prisoner—I heard of the accident in Oct.—I saw the prisoner on the morning afterwards, and she asked me if I had heard of the accident, I said that I had not—she said that it was a very serious one, and happened in Church Street on the railway, and she knew a person in King Street who was injured, that Dr. Downing, who was attending him, told him that he was not to take any money that the railway company offered him—she said nothing about being injured herself, she appeared in her usual health—she did not tell me at what time the accident happened—Isaw her in the day before that conversation several times in the morning and at night, but there was no appearance of suffering about her—about a month after that conversation we had a little disagreement, and she shook her pocket at me, and said that she could produce more sovereigns than I could farthings—I said that if she could, I supposed she had got it by cheat<lb/>ing some railway company, or some way that she ought not—I had not known from her about any application she had made to any railway company—shesaid that she had not cheated any one, she was not ashamed to show her purse anywhere.</p>

In Oct. 1856, we lived at Wellington Terrace, Wells Boad, Sydenham, a four roomed house—theprisoner lodged with us for six months, and occupied the front room up stairs—other persons lodged with us, but they were all absent from the house—on 7th Oct., 1856, he left to go to work at 8 o'clock in the morning—I had 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the house in two different purses; 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in one, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the other—they were both kept in a tea caddy, which was locked, and I had the key—I had seen them that morning—the prisoner was not at home when I left home, and I never saw him again till last Tuesday at Greenwich; he had given notice to leave—he worked at the new reservoir at Sydenham—next morning I went to my caddy and found it broken open, and the money gone; and the two purses—it belonged to my husband—I gave information to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and am the daughter of the last witness. The prisoner lodged with my mother—on the day he left, he did not go to his work—he sent me for half a quartern of gin in the course of the day, and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of walnuts, telling me to go down to the Fox, or I should not get it good; that is quarter of a mile off—it was then about half past 12 o'clock—there was another lodger in the house, but he was out—I left the prisoner alone in the house—on my return from the Fox, I met the prisoner a little way from my mother's house, he told me that he would be back in half an hour to drink the gin, and eat the walnuts—left my mother's bed room door shut, but not locked—the prisoner never returned.</p>

I received information of this robbery on the morning of 8th Oct., and searched for the prisoner, who I knew was living about Sydenham, but found he had left the neighbourhood—hewas taken by a constable on the morning of the 6th, at St. Alban's Gaol when his time had expired there, and brought up to London—I told him the charge, he said, that he never lived in Sydenbam, and knew nothing about it—andwhen the prosecutrix said that he lodged with her, he said, that he never lodged with her, and never was in Sydenham in his life.</p>

I am master wheeler in the Royal Arsenal carriage department, at Woolwich—the prisoner was employed there as a wheelwright since last Nov.—on 18th March, I found this metal plane secreted under the prisoner's work bench—it was suspended under the board which projects below the bench—the prisoner, the next day, was reported to Colonel Tulloch—thisplane was found on Thursday, and it was produced and shown to the prisoner, when he was taken before Colonel Tulloch, on the Monday morning—theprisoner acknowledged making it, but said it was for the use of the shop—I engaged the prisoner myself—I engage all the men, and the engage<lb/>ment is that they should find their own tools—they are not allowed to make tools out of Government property to work with—nothing was said to him about finding his own tools—it is not said directly to every man, but it is a standing rule in the place—a man cannot go to work till he brings his tools—theprisoner was told to come to work—I cannot swear that he was told to bring his tools—it is the practice of the wheelers when they come to work to bring their tools—the prisoner brought his tools with him—he had no right to use the Government property to make a plane to work with—this plane is worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the metal is worth about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after the inquiry the prisoner was suspended from his work—he then packed up three planes, and was going to take them out—he would have taken them out if I had allowed him to pass the gate—on examining them I found the mouth of the planes were bushed with brass, which, is a piece of metal let into the edge—I detained the pri<lb/>soner on account of the brass being in the mouth of the planes—I told him so—I do not think he said anything—the pieces of metal were taken out of the planes; these are them—they are gun metal; such metal as is in use in the department—he had no right to have this metal in his planes—these chisel handles are of a kind of wood which is used for the greater part of the wheels of carriages fitted out for China—the prisoner had no right to have this.</p>

I swear I stated to him on Saturday, when he asked me how I got on with Mrs. Spurway, that the money was to be paid within eight days, and you were to get a Judge's order, and receive the money on that day week—you did not, when you received the money, come over and tell me.</p>

On Mon<lb/>day,15th Feb., or Tuesday, the prisoner came about a debt that was owing by my late husband to Mr. Nichols—he said he called for the debt—I said he had sent two or three men before, and I had been so recently left I could not pay then, that he must wait; I said also, he sent in his bill and demanded it while my husband lay dead and uncoffined, and threatened he would take pro<lb/>ceedings, and that if he were cruel, enough to do so he must have the trouble, for I had been left without auything—there were two persons who came before the prisoner—I saw the prisoner on the following Thursday, I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I afterwards paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he read to me a Judge's order, with Mr. Nichols' name signed at the bottom—I do not know his handwriting—the prisoner told me he had signed it—he did not say proceedings were begun, but they would be—I did not authorize anybody to give my con<lb/>sent to a Judge's order; I did not know what it meant—except that piece of paper, I was not served with any proceedings—I never made a pro<lb/>posal to pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in fourteen days, and the rest at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I expressed a wish to have the proceedings stopped, and would settle if they would take less—I never mentioned any terms.</p>
