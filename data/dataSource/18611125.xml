               <p>order things by letter, and sometimes otherwise; sometimes through the traveller, and sometimes by callingâ€”I do not call it a quarrel that we hadâ€”I had two travellers out in the country at the time Mr. Josslyn left my serviceâ€”we have had two out constantly between 1858 and 1861â€”he has given commissions to other people who are not strictly travellers; commis<lb/>sion travellers; I suppose about four or perhaps five, besides my regular travellersâ€”the commission travellers transmitted orders as well as moneyâ€”it was the duty of the travellers in the country to write letters from day to day as to what orders they had received, as well as what money they had receivedâ€”it was the duty of Mr. Josslyn to open all the letters that came to my warehouse at Gresham-street, to see what orders were in them, and to see what monies were paid and transmittedâ€”it is quite possible that he would find an order in one letter for so many different sorts of needlesâ€”it would be his duty to give the order out to be put up by other personsâ€”at one time it would have been Miss Cawthorue's duty, at another time Miss Hill's dutyâ€”it would have been his duty to see that the orders were executedâ€”I cannot say how many petty orders might come on an average in a day from the country for him to look to their being executedâ€”if the traveller transmitted monies or cheques, the prisoner would have to account for them in his bookâ€”the travellers would send up what sums they had in hand, and he would credit themâ€”they would send it up by cheque, or notes, or any way that would be convenient to themâ€”the traveller might send up a bill of exchange sometimes if he chose; there would be no reason why he should notâ€”if he had a bill sent by the customer he would, send it upâ€”credit would be given to our customersâ€”if they accept bills they come into the ordinary cash-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing one of your customers could not pay, and he said, "I will accept a bill for, we will say, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at three months or so on," would that be sent up to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The proper course would be for it to be drawn at the warehouse; it would not be sent upâ€”it would be drawn at the ware-house, sent down for acceptance, and then returned to the warehouseâ€”that was also the manager's duty; it was a very light one, probably two or three hills a week to drawâ€”they would not average two or three a weekâ€”when 1 say two or three a week I put it at the utmost limitâ€”it would be his duty also to exercise his judgment as to whether he could give that credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say sometimes the traveller would write and say, "I will have a cheque for you at Thompson and Company's," or something of that sort; "Miss Tomkins has directed her banker, Barclay's, to pay you 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you will find a cheque there?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That might occur, but it would be a very rare thingâ€”I gave him no power to indorse chequesâ€”I have given a power of a limited character, which I can explainâ€”the power is this; he is to sign cheques by procuration to pay in, but not to indorseâ€”I wrote to my banker, in all probability, at the early part of the engagement, when he came inâ€”my bankers are Puget, Bainbridge's, and Companyâ€”one of their clerks is here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is a clerk who knows how often he has signed your name by pro<lb/>curation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The clerk has come for another purposeâ€”unless this clerk knows how often from 1858 to 1861 he signed my name by procuration, I cannot tell youâ€”the cheques to which I allow him to sign my name by pro<lb/>curation are cheques to be paid in, country chequesâ€”the course of business is this: a country customer writes to Gresham-street and says, "Call at Barclay's," or some other house, "for so much money;" a person is sent to Barclay's country office, and inquires for a cheque, the name of H. Walker,</p>

               <p>of the amount stated, from the town the party writes from; that is the first step; then the cheque comes back to the warehouse, and the thing is signed by procuration for H. Walker, by Josslynâ€”his duty, on receiving such a letter from a country customer, was to send for the cheque, not to go for itâ€”I do not know that over and over again he went and signed the cheque by procurationâ€”I am not certain about itâ€”he would send some person, and that person would get a cheque from Barclay's, filled all but the signature, and then he would have to sign itâ€”post-office orders used to come up some<lb/>timesâ€”he would sign them, and pay them in to my bankersâ€”sometimes country bank notes used to come upâ€”there were commission travellers, regular travellers, and private customers writing from the country every day, with reference to orders and to payments; that is the ordinary course of businessâ€”I have no London travellers out at the present timeâ€”between 1858 and 1861 there were probably four.</p>

Josslyn Dear sir, I in close herewith the returns which I think you will find by the day-book are correct. I am sorry to find the sum is much deficient of what I expected to reach; my undertaking, therefore, if strictly carried out, falls to the ground. There are, however, with diminished sales, some indications of better prospects. The returns are made at no greater relative expenses and I am inclined to believe there are less bad debts in the last six months trading, than in the corresponding period. The greater of course the returns, the less relative expense there ought to be; and the fewer bad debts, the less there is to be added to expenses in the shape of loss. Viewing all things, I am still inclined to do in part what I weald have preferred doing entire, if the trade had come up to the amount I therefore inclose herein a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be disposed of thus:â€”of the amount, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for yourself, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Miss Cawthorne, and the same for Miss Hill. There are many matters in the stock-books that will need great attention, more particularly all the larger articles in muslin; these are, or have been, helps to the amount of returns, but your trade for them is gone; the reason must be found out. If it can be altered here or by you, so much the better; but if not, we shall want something to make up for what will be future deficiency if not considered at once. The older articles, and in fact, every article in needles must be considered. The fancy box-trade is lost; the ridged eyes will be or should be extras. I have a heavy stock yet of all other goods, from six to eight millions of drilled eyed sharps; they are nothing in the needle trade. Sixteen millions were ordered one day recently in one order, I am told, at Redditch. Large orders produce quick cask returns; small orders the contrary. In the one case many profits are made in a year with the same capital; bat with me I only turn capital once a year This is the old style of trading and wants your greatest consideration with a view to alter it I have some articles you sell regularly which can be only made about once in five years, you sell so few; yet they are sold regu<lb/>larly, tons weight at a time. Hoping you will all feel satisfied with this inclosure, and wishing we may succeed better in the next six months, I remain, Yours very truly, H. Walker.

               <p>violent; he would not go in irons, and aid the whole ship could not put him in ironsâ€”he was a black manâ€”the prisoner was on the mainyard at the time, blacking the topsail sheetsâ€”he had left about two or three feet undoneâ€”the mate told him to go on with it, he said he would not and he could notâ€”I then told him I would not ask him to do anything I could not do myself and I went up to the mainyard outside of him, took the brash and blacked the chain; I then came down, and told him to go on with his work, which he did, swearing, and he upset a bucket of tar upon a new mainsailâ€”directly after this I sent the mate forward to bring Pratt to me, that I might look at his fingerâ€”while Pratt was being put in irons the prisoner came down off the mainyard, saying, "Don't go in irons, Jack; don't go in irons for the b----"â€”I was on the poop at that timeâ€”he used strong language besides thisâ€”I ordered him to go to his workâ€”he used all kinds of expressionsâ€”"Go to h----and be d----d," and instead of going to his work he went into the forecastleâ€”I waited until the others came up from below, from putting Pratt in irons, and we then went forward to the forecastleâ€”I told the prisoner to come out and go to his work; he said he would not, and told us to come and take him out; and the first man that came in he would have his lifeâ€”he kept singing out, "Come and take me you b----, come and take meâ€”I talked to him and told him to go to his work, and I called the crew and told them that man would not go to his work, and that he was armed with a knife, which the second mate called outâ€”I told him the consequences if he did not go to his work, and told him the mate was going to arrest him with the second mate and my brother, and if he used a knife I would shoot him. at that momentâ€”I went to the forward window of the forecastle with my revolver, which was loaded with shotâ€”they went into the forecastle, and the first I heard was some one singing out, "I am stabbed"â€”they ran out of the forecastle door, I came aft and saw that my brother was stabbed in the right hipâ€”I then went forward to the window to try and see where the prisoner was, and he threw a large quart glass bottle at me, full of palm oilâ€”it struck me on the nose and face, and cut me very badlyâ€”he threw numerous bottles after that, whenever we went past the passageâ€”I then fired two or three times through the windowâ€”I could not hit him from where I wasâ€”I did not try to do soâ€”I did it to try and frighten himâ€”I could not have hit him if I had tried to do soâ€”I did not hit himâ€”finding I could not get him out, I had to batten him up in the forecastle till we got to Cuba; and I had to put a small foolish boy that I had on board, in the passage while it was doneâ€”if the carpenter had tried to batten him up without that, he would have thrown bottles at him, but I knew he would not throw at the foolish boy, so I stood him in the passage, and then battened up the forecastleâ€”when we got to Cuba he was taken out by the authoritiesâ€”I saw my brother's hipâ€”there was a wound nearly four, inches long, and I think the doctor said an inch and three-quarters deepâ€”the doctor is not hereâ€”he was examined in Cubaâ€”it was a very bad wound; it bled very considerably.</p>

Hall's warehouse in Seething-laneâ€”Bennett was employed there as foremanâ€”I saw him on the premises there and said, "I belong to the police; have you delivered any bales of rags since yesterday morning from the warehouse?"â€”he hesitated and said, "No"â€”a minute or more afterwards he said, "I delivered two bales of rags from the warehouse yesterday morning to a man of the name of Smith, a marine store dealer in Rosemary-lane; he gave me an order for them, but the order was not signed"â€”I said, "Where is that order?"â€”he said, "I gave it back to Smith again"â€”I then said, "You will consider yourself in my custody for stealing a quantity of rags"â€”I took him into custody, and on taking him past Smith's premises in Rosemary-lane, he said, "That is where Smith lives, who I sold the rags to"â€”that is all he said.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith's Defence.</hi> A man came one morning to my shop and asked me if I would buy some cloth cuttings. I asked him how many he had got. He said about half a hundredweightâ€”I said I would give him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. I weighed them; there was just half a hundredweight. I paid him; he did not want the bag back in which they were. About 3 o'clock he brought another half hundredweight. I asked him whose they were; he said his master's. I asked him where he lived; he said in Seething-lane. I asked him his name; he said Bennett. I asked him how he came by them; he said there had been a sale. I bought them for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and sold them for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. At night he came and asked me if I was a buyer of rags; I said I would buy them of him, and he told me to hire a cart and send it round.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186111250092"/>
               <p>I hired one, and went with them and showed them where Seething-lane was, I left them and went home, and in about half an hour afterwards the bale of rags came. I unloaded them and sent the cart home. I had to take the rags out of the bales, because the bales were too big to come in. I did that in the street. Next morning I had another bale; it was not so good as the the first, I said I could only give 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt. for it. When we got the first bale in the cart, he said, "You might as well take the two, this all I have got," and I did so. I told him I could not pay him then, I did not know the worth of them. I tried to sell them at a place, and they offered 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt which I did not think enough, and I said he had better let me have them a day or two, and I would try and get as much as I could for them. The man told me they were his own property. If I had been aware they were stolen goods, I should not have sold them to my next door neigh<lb/>bour. I know there are very often sales in Seething-lane and in Mark-lane. I can take my solemn oath that I did not know they were stolen.</p>

Best, 5, Rochester-terraceâ€”on the following morning the prisoner told me that his name was Thomas Henry Tapley, and that he was married to Elisa, October, 1853; and the reason he gave the name of Jackson, was that he had taken the house in Wyndham-road in that nameâ€”I do not know of my own knowledge whether any of the tickets relate to the property.</p>

I am a professor of music, living at Camberwellâ€”on the afternoon of 31st October, just before 3 o'clock, I was getting off an omnibus at the corner of Rye-lane, and saw the deceased standing with his back against the shoe shop, and the prisoner sparring at him, and pressing him against the windowâ€”the prisoner's back was turned towards me, and partially hid Allen, so that I could not see everything; but I saw blows exchanged, and they went against a windowâ€”the prisoner took hold of the deceased's hair, held it upright, and cast him down on the groundâ€”the deceased was then retreating, and the prisoner pushing him against the window, he went down like a stickâ€”the prisoner threw him down by holding his hair; and putting his legs between the deceased's, they came down to the ground together; but the prisoner somehow escaped a fall; and the moment the deceased's head touched the ground he let go of himâ€”the deceased was as rigid as a poker, perfectly stillâ€”the blow might be heard across the road.</p>
