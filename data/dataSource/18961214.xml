               <p>we looked round, but could find nothing—Pickering then went up the steps to the leads at the back, turned on his light, and said, "Here they are"—I saw Hawkins, and I saw Howard jump down off the leads; I sang out to Pickering, "Look after that one; I will look after this"—I fell over a dog-kennel, and Hawkins struck me with this spike of a wheel; it cut both my knuckles; I got hold of his coat with my right hand, and held it, and he got another spike from the wall and hit me on the head with it; he gave a jerk, and two more spikes fell off—I heard a jump, as if he had fallen; I then left him, and went in search of the other—next morning I went to the station, and saw Howard among others, and picked him out as the man that had made his escape—I don't think he had a hat on when he fell over the wall, but I could not swear it.</p>

On the early morning of the 14th I received information, in consequence of which I went, with Sergeant Hunt, to 13, Little Orford Street, Chelsea—I had known that address before; I knew that Hawkins lived there; I got there about half-past five in the morning—I knocked at the door; Hawkins's step-father came to the door; I knew him by sight—I went upstairs, and saw a brother of Hawkins' in bed; I saw no one else in the room—I searched the room, and under the bed I found Howard, undressed—I brought him out, and said we should take him into custody, charged, with another man detained at the station, for attempted burglary at 28, Hans Place, and violently assaulting a policeman—up to that time nothing had been said about the man having received injuries—he replied, "Is the man dead? has his dying deposition been taken? If he had not kicked me in the ribs I should not have hit him"—I then searched the room for his clothes—I found his trousers hanging up behind the room door, all in rags—they were put on—I also found his waistcoat and overcoat—in his waistcoat pocket I found this skeleton key, a pair of links, and a stud—I looked round the room for his hat; I could not find one—this straw hat was hanging on the door; it was perfectly dry, and covered with dust—it had been ruining in torrents all the night—I fitted the hat to his head; I found it did not fit—I called his step-father, and asked him if that was the prisoner's hat—he said, "No"—I then asked him if the prisoner was a lodger, and he said, "No"; he had not seen him before that night—the prisoner said, "It is mine"—the father said, "It belongs to Jim"; that is the other prisoner—I asked Hawkins whether Howard was a lodger of his—he said, "No"; he had never seen him before that night—on the way to the station Howard asked me whether Lynes was there—I</p>

On November 13th, between six and seven, I met the prisoner Hawkins in Sloane Square, and was drinking in his company at various public-houses between nine and twelve, and during that time it was that two policemen saw me wearing a hard hat. On going over Vauxhall Bridge, a man shoving a bundle ran up against me, as if to cut Die on the eye; I had some words with him, and we started fighting, and he kicked me severely; I lost my hat. I got up, and we started fighting again. I gave him a kick, and left him, as I thought, insensible. A man came up and told me that he had been taken to the hospital. I went to see if I could find him, but could not. I went down to Hawkins' house, but did not see him or his father—his brother, seeing the condition I was in, asked me to stop, which I did. In the morning they told me a policeman was there—thinking I was in for an assault on a civilian, I got under the bed, where I was found and taken to the station. Seeing me without a hat, and a bandage round my head, they thought I must be the man they wanted.</p>

On the early morning of 14th I was called to 28, Hans Place, in company with Shrimpton—we went through the premises; we found two men on the leads, who were afterwards identified as the prisoner and Howard—the prisoner was climbing up the lattice-work—I tried to hit him with my truncheon; he turned round and struck me with an iron instrument—I fell backwards, and whilst I was holding him he struck me several times in the face with it; I became un<lb/>conscious; when I came to I heard a police whistle and someone shout<lb/>ing, and I got up and wandered into the garden, and found three men holding Hawkins—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there three weeks—I could not see the instrument with which I was struck—I heard afterwards that a chisel was found in the garden.</p>

I am a gentleman's servant, of 39, Claverton Street, S.W.—before 1891 the firm of John Robinson and Henley, of Warnford Court, acted as my stockbrokers; there was a change of partnership, and the firm continued to do business for me—in 1891 I lost some securities, and mentioned it to the elder defendant, who suggested that he should keep my securities in his Stock Exchange safe—in September, 1891, this list of my securities was made out, and on it is six bonds of Spanish four per cent, Nos. 47539-47543 to 48 and 19353, making £436 9s. 5d.—the</p>

               <p>last on the list is £200 Havana Railway stock, also a certificate of ten New York Central Railroad—the last entry in the list, as it originally stood, is the Havana Railway bonds, but I gave instructions subsequently, and other bonds were bought—this bought note was sent to me, showing the bonds and expenses, £205—I did not get the securities; they took care of everything after I bought them—I first received the interest, which was payable quarterly, from Morgan and Co., the London agents. of the company; that continued up to January, 1895, after which I received it from the firm by their cheque—it struck me as a strange thing, but I made no inquiry about the securities till after the failure, when I inquired of Messrs. Morgan, and then went to the defendants' office—I saw them both, and asked them how it was I had been receiving the dividend from them, when I had it previously from Messrs. Morgan—they both said that they did not know, and could not understand it—I did not tell them I had been to Messrs. Morgan's office—they said that every thing would be right, and they should pay over 20s. in the pound—the older defendant said that they could not hand the bonds over to me, because the keys had been taken away—I never gave either of them authority to sell or dispose of my shares—this is a certificate in my name of ten New York Central shares; the front of it bears the words, "Cancelled by London Register." (<hi rend="italic">On the back of this was a transfer of ten shares to the witness, signed "J. Kean" in the presence of H. R. Tatham, Tokenhouse Buildings.</hi>) I never signed that; it is not at all like my writing; I usually sign my full name to official documents—I cannot write like that—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing, and this is my usual signature, "J. Kean" (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 10)—in March, 1895, I gave notice to the defendants' firm to sell £119 worth of my Four per Cent. Spanish stock at 17 £, and got this sold note as the value of it—in January, 1896, I got this memorandum, in the elder defendant's writing, of the securities, which they still held, and these Spanish bonds are in it—in August, 1892, I instructed the defendants' firm to purchase twenty Pennsylvania Railway shares for £226 Os. 6d.—they were purchased, and I got this letter, giving the par<lb/>ticulars, and in December, 1893, I gave instructions by this letter for four more to be purchased—in January, 1895, I gave instructions to sell ten of the Pennsylania shares; that would leave me fourteen—in January, 1895, I got this letter, enclosing a cheque for the dividends, and, among others, on the remaining fourteen Pennsylvania shares—after the failure I removed some of my securities. through the Official Receiver, but I did not get back the Hanoverian or the Spanish bonds, or the ten New York Central, or the fourteen Penn<lb/>sylvanias—the value of the securities not returned to me is about £770, and there were some dividends also, amounting to about £40—they were bonds and securities entrusted to the defendants' firm for safe custody and collection of dividends.</p>

E. Tatham is the attesting witness; the name and address are both written by him—in the signature the "e" and the "a" look like Henry Tatham's writing—I do not know Mr. Kearie's writing—there was an American Share Register in the office, and on March 15th, 1895, I have got three entries on the register, two of which are in one writing; the single one is Mr. Gerald's; that shows that the certificates 168 and 112 of Mr. Keane's were taken from the box to transfer to Mr. Burke—the other two are in my writing—I should copy the particulars from the docu<lb/>ments.</p>

E. Tatham and Co., enclosed in this letter—the cheque is endorsed "H. E. Tatham and Co.," and has been paid by my bank—I had had previous transactions with the firm, and it was their practice on my instructions to lodge securities coming into their hands on my behalf with the Union Bank, Fenchurch Street, and dividends on such securities were paid to my credit at the bank—I wrote this letter.</p>

               <p>there for something like fifty years—my own memory goes back to 1880—it was a very large stockbroker's business, with a large turn-over for a thoroughly good investment business, which it was—it would not be a large turn-over for a speculative business—it was an account that was invariably in credit; I should say that, as a rule, the average balance was over £2,000—it is ridiculous to suppose that we should not have cashed his cheque for £200 at once—I should not be surprised to hear that in March, 1895, his balance was £10,000—I know he had a partner, Robinson—we understood from the elder prisoner that he got rid of his partner, Robinson, in 1892, in consequence of Robinson having embarked in large speculations, and we heard rumours that Robinson had intro<lb/>duced business by which large debts had been incurred—Mr. Bertram Currie, in consequence of rumors as to the solvency of the firm, sent for the elder prisoner, who explained matters, and from that time Mr. Robinson was out of the firm—I was not present at the conversation, but that is what I understood.</p>

The younger prisoner came to the bank from time to time, bringing securities on the loan account—it is a constant practice for stockbrokers to have loan accounts and deposit securities as against loans; there is nothing unusual in the transaction, supposing the securities belong to the firm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I think the elder prisoner's interview with Mr. Currie was in 1892—the interview was sought for the purpose of ascertaining something about the firm's solvency—the interview was satisfactory—the account went on just the same after the interview—if it had been represented to us in 1892 that the firm was insolvent, we should probably have taken some other action.</p>

Those other books were kept by a clerk—I believe the younger prisoner joined at one time as a salaried partner; I have not examined the books so far back as that—I have seen balance-sheets as far back as 1887, I think, but I have not examined them thoroughly—I have not seen an entry of his salary—I believe Robin<lb/>son retired in 1892-93—so far as I have seen, the younger prisoner brought no money into the business, but he was debited on his entering into part<lb/>nership with about £4,000—I have not discovered any deed of partnership—the debit was treated as an advance by the younger prisoner to the busi<lb/>ness, and I believe compound interest was charged upon the advance in his capital account, and at the time of the failure the debit of his capital account had amounted to some £12,000—the books are very complicated, and are not clear; it would be impossible for any other than a skilled per<lb/>son</p>

               <p>to unravel them in some respects—an entry appears in the books of a large private loan to the elder prisoner by his brother, starting in 1863—the principal eventually reached £61,000—it was a private affair between the elder prisoner and his brother—this loan has been a disputed point in the estate; the firm were jointly and severally liable—there was no docu<lb/>ment showing under what circumstances the money, was originally advanced—it went into the business, and was used by Mr. Tatham in the business—it appears in the books from 1863, I believe—the first personal knowledge of the transaction I have is in 1887, when there is a balance of £29,000 to the credit of Mr. Charles Tatham—when Robinson failed his losses were added to the deficiencies of the firm—I believe there were articles of partnership with Robinson—Mr. Henry was a partner at one time; he went out in 1887, I think; there were articles of partnership with him—there is nothing in the books to identify an advance of £1,000 by the younger prisoner, by way of legacy; I have not come across anything to identify his drawing out as against that £1,000—I have looked for it—his drawings in 1893 amount to £1,538—on June 16th, 1893, I find £300 drawn out, and on July 17th £250—there is no ear-marking of the legacy in the books—in 1894 his drawings amount to £1,270—on May 27th and 28th I find £105 and £100 drawn out—there is no ear-marking of those sums as against the legacy—his drawings in 1895 amounted to £1,076—on April 25th he drew £200; there is no ear-marking of that as against a legacy—after the—bankruptcy the younger prisoner's estate was realised; he had a house and a few shares—he had no creditors', and we have the money, a surplus of over £2,000, I think, in hand—it was hypothecated to the creditors of the business—there was no letter-book containing copies of letters written to customers—I found some letters written by customers—I am told it was the custom of the firm never to copy a letter, and that made investigation into the accounts more difficult—I have seen a few cheques, and most of them were drawn by Henry Tatham; I do not remember to have seen one signed by Gerald Tatham; the same applies to the endorse<lb/>ments on the few cheques I have seen in Court as received by the firm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The receipt of advances on securities belonging to clients would be entered in a separate cash-book kept for the purpose—I have examined it—there is no entry in it of dividends received on Keane's New York shares after March, 1895—the book would not give details of how the amount was made up, but you would see by referring to the ledger account; as the money came in on one day, it would be credited to a client—each item of dividend, as it came in during the day, would be entered in the cash book in detail, showing the name of the client, but not the security—this book, by the help of the ledger, would show that no dividend was received on behalf, of Keane after March, 1895, and that would apply to other bonds, as to which dividends were paid after the bonds had been parted with—the cash books were very carefully kept, and you could trace everything as regards the cash.</p>

I nave had since January to ascertain the condition of the prisoner's estate—I find on the books a very large amount of bad debts—there is an indebtedness to the firm by Robinson, the late partner, which, I believe, is assigned to Charles Tatham's estate with other debts and securities—Robinson's liability to the firm was</p>

               <p>about £20,000, I believe—I should think the bad debts due to the firm in respect of transactions they had carried out amounted to, approxi<lb/>mately, £100,000, or not so much as that—they had been incurred before Robinson left the firm, and had been running on for years—up to the time of the failure money was being paid in respect of some of those debts by the debtors—I thought the names of the debtors were good, but the debts were bad—one debtor owes £7,000—in 1887 a large number of debts were written of—since then they have been carried on as if there was some possibility of them being recovered—some were made within the last three or four years—both those, before and after 1887, were treated as assets—if they amounted to over £100,000, and had been paid, it would have made the firm practically solvent, I should think—I recognise some of the names—I have not been round to see the people and try and get them to pay—there is no question that they are real debts incurred over real transactions—I have not compromised any of them.</p>

A balance-sheet was made up every month, showing the position of the firm; there was no annual or biennial balance-sheet; these were the only ones—I believe the exact financial state of the business was taken every month—all debts not written off would appear, and they are treated as good debts, worth 20s. in the £—it showed a much better position than the facts would warrant—this month's balance-sheet shows that Mr. H. E. Tatham's balance in May, 1895, was £7,000; that is, after crediting him with the £60,000 borrowed from his brother—those figures would show to anyone who did not understand the posi<lb/>tion a solvent balance-sheet—the £60,000 does not appear; it had been dealt with previously.</p>

               <p>clients—my father had no key of the strong room or of the office safe; that I know of—when securities were taken to the bank I or my brother had to get them out of the strong room—the safe was open during the day, and anyone could go to it—no distinction was made as to which were kept in the strong room and which in the office—clients' securities were mostly kept in the strong room—I did not know whether I was taking clients' securities or not to the bank; I was told to go and fetch certain<lb/>bonds, and I did so, and brought them into the office—I do not remember the particular case of September, 1895, when my brother went to Arm<lb/>strong and Co. with a bundle of securities—I was told to fetch such and such bonds—I was not often down there—when I did go and fetch securities I had directions from in my father or brother—I have, on some occasions, taken securities to the bank—I cannot say if they were taken out of the Stock Exchange strong room—clients' securities never came into my department—a record of them may have been, kept as they were deposited for safe custody; I don't think there was—generally they were tied up, and labelled, to indicate to whom they be<lb/>longed, I won't say always, and when they were brought out of the strong room into the office the label would be on them—I cannot say if the—label was taken off before they were taken to the bank—I never examined the securities taken to the bank—the label was an ordinary square slip, with the name of the firm and the client's name, slipped in—I cannot say if I ever took securities to the bank with the label still attached; the security was handed to me, and I took it to the bank, and never examined it—a long blue book was kept in the office to record the securities deposited at the bank against loans—I believe it contained a record of all securities deposited with the bankers, but I had no connection with it—I cannot say if the bankers would advance money on a security which had a label, showing it belonged to a client—a client might want money, and we might take the securities and deposit them, and leave the ticket on, and borrow the money—I knew the firm was borrowing money for a long time before the failure—I thought our difficulties were only temporary—I had been thinking that for two years—I must have been with the firm when a new loan account was opened at Armstrong's, but I don't know anything about it—I think it was known generally in the office that the firm was it temporary difficulties—we knew in the office that they were carrying over stocks which clients had paid for; none of us liked to know it; I thought it was so—there was a client Allen; I don't know what the particular case was—I knew some South-Western Deferred stock was being carried over all through 1895; I did not know whose it was—in the ordinary course of book work it would be brought to my notice each account day that such an item was being carried over from account to account, and differences settled on it—probably every other clerk in the office knew it too—Gerald Tatham did the buying and selling on the Stock Exchange—the entry of March 15th, 1895, of New York Central shares is the only one in his writing on that day, the others are in Keene's writing—the account day would be about the middle of the month—if those ten shares of Kean's had been sold by his direction, Gerald Tatham would have been the person to sell them on the Stock Exchange—he has his, own book for the purpose of doing business on the Stock Exchange—if he made such a sale he might enter it in his book, or he might bear it in mind, and</p>

               <p>enter it in the book in the office when he came in—his usual practice was to enter everything in his own book—when he came into the office there would be an entry in the jobbing book, with the name of the jobber with whom the bargain was made—all the entries in his book are copied into the jobbers' book—that entry being made in the American Share Register, it would not be anybody's duty to post it in any other book; it is an in-dependent record—I did not know in November, 1895, of this sale of India Three per Cent, stock for Keble College; I don't remember anything about it—my brother would sell it—the jobber's cheque for the stock de<lb/>livered would be received in the office—the signature of the bought note is my brother's—that would not indicate that he carried the matter through; he generally signed the contracts—this entry in the cash book of the jobber's cheque, including Webber and Dorling's cheque for £5,000, is the largest amount on that page; it is a striking item to anyone who looks at the book—the book was open to the clerks or partners to look at, if they wanted to know if the jobber had paid that cheque—the entry is in my brother's writing—I knew some shares were bought for Colonel Burke which had not been taken up, and I knew some were being carried over; I presumed they were part of his—I had admittance to the house; I was not always there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Mr. Gerald was in the house in order to know what was going on—if securities were to be taken, to the bank, my father or my brother might have given directions—if there is a bought transaction and a sold transaction with regard to the same stock, we should enter it—I know a cheque was signed for the amount of this India stock, because an envelope was found after the failure—this is the cheque in my brother's writing.

I do not know whether the South-Western Railway stock had been paid for—the account day was December 30th—throughout the two years my father considered himself solvent; he said nothing about his financial position to me, or in my hearing—I knew nothing about his private means apart from his business; he said nothing about them to me or in my hearing—I always understood he was well off, apart from his business—I have had my own establishment since 1893—I never spoke to my father about money matters; I was only a clerk in the office, and did not like to ask any questions.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Ramsay Road, Forest Gate—from 1881 to 1895 I was a clerk to H. E. Tatham and Co.—at present I am employed by Messrs. Hirsch and Co., of Warnford Court—I became thoroughly acquainted with the method of business in the prisoners' office—the part of the business connected with seeing the clients was principally conducted by H. E. Tatham—Gerald Tatham was principally in the house doing the business, and occasionally assisting in the office work—he took shares to the bank for loans, and things of that sort—I never took</p>

               <p>securities to the bank—I knew the firm had securities of their own apart from securities of their clients—I knew, from the books, that the firm had a large quantity of Spanish stock—the special ledger, No. 2, would show it—those securities were kept either in the safe in the office, or the safe in the house, in the same places as clients' securities were kept—the American Share Register was kept generally by Mr. Keene, and some times by Mr. Lionel Tatham—any clerk might have made an entry in it with regard to a transaction in American shares—I recognise Gerald Tat<lb/>hara's writing under the head of New York Central; the entries above and below are in the writing of Keene and Gerald Tatham, and I think some are by another clerk, Buckley, but I am not certain about that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am aware that Lionel Tatham said that all those entries on that day were written by Keene, with the exception of the one relating to the New York shares; I am not prepared to dispute that—this book is not posted from or into any other book—whoever makes the entry must get the information from somewhere; I think it would come from the sold note; I am not sure about it—any person making the entry in the book would have the sold note before him—I do not know that it is a record of a non-existing transaction—I kept the day book, or journal, and made out contracts, and assisted the book-keeper in posting from the journal into the ledger—I could not say positively that there is no entry in the ledger of Keane's account of the transfer of his shares—I have never looked to see—I did not know for some time before the actual failure that the firm was in difficulties—I heard no rumour of it at all—I only knew that business was very quiet—I left at the end of March, 1895—clients' securities were always labelled with the client's name before being put in the safe—either Lionel Tatham or Keene would do that; I might have to do so on emergency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. If Gerald Tatham had been handed a transfer from Mr. Keene into the name of Mr. Burke, it would, or might, be his duty to make such an entry in the American register, and that entry would be perfectly regular unless the document was forged—there are various handwritings through the book—I recognise two or three hands; mostly Mr. Keene's.</p>

I had nothing to do with the securities—I had no entry to the house—I did not put them in the office safe—my duty was limited to occasionally putting labels on clients' securities; that was very seldom, only on an emergency—I have seen in the Spanish ledger, in an account called Spanish stock, the fact of the prisoners having Spanish securities of their own—T have seen Tatham's name attached in connec<lb/>tion with the entries in the book as proprietor of them—the amounts were very large; I cannot say what—ledger No. 2 was used for keeping an account of the stock as it was bought and sold; Mr. Tatham's stock, prin<lb/>cipally—I think there was other stock besides the Spanish which was Mr. Tatham's property, to a very large amount, and a valuable asset—it was Spanish Government stock, which could be easily converted into money—I think it was sold principally to clients of the firm—that was the purpose for which it was retained—Gerald Tatham kept the cash book.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was kept in his belt—I had not been in the cattle<lb/>men's bunk that morning—the men did not take off all their clothes at night; the prisoner had his trousers on when I saw him—I don't know what he did with his knife—I wear a sheath knife attached to my belt; I take it off when I go into my bunk—I did not see the prisoner put the knife into its sheath; I merely saw him take up the knife from the bunk—I would not swear it was not in the sheath, I don't think it was—there was a very dull light there—he allowed me to take his band off quite peaceably—I never had anything to do with him before—I would not swear that he did not touch the prisoner with the stick that morning; I did not see him do so; I saw him make a point at him with it, I suppose because he was asleep—there were two rows of bunks, one above the other; it held nine men; the prisoner was in the top one—I cannot say that Evans made a rush at the prisoner—I heard him say, "I have a good mind to go for him," and immediately after that he did make a go at him.</p>

I live at Liverpool—I am master of the screw steamer <hi rend="italic">Queensland</hi>—on October 18th, about half-past five, I was called to the port side of the deck, and saw Evans lying on the deck, bleeding freely from a wound in his left thigh—I first tried to stop the bleeding he was afterwards moved to the other side of the deck—there was no doctor on board—I saw a very Urge wound in his hip—I sewed it up, and stopped the bleeding, and then I saw another wound—the wound on the <hi rend="italic">hip</hi> was about three inches long, and it appeared to go right to the bone—it would have required tremendous force to cause that wound—it was quite on the hip, and round to the back—it was a blow from a man facing him, and done with the right hand—I could not stop the bleeding with plaster, and so I sewed it up; he had another wound, a small one on the chest, about three-quarters of an inch long—it cut the flesh, but I could not see that it penetrated—it was done with a knife; nothing else could have done it—I ordered the prisoner on deck, and put on handcuffs, which I took from my pocket—he lifted up his shirt, and took the knife from under it—the sheath, which ought to have had the knife in it, was empty—he threw the knife overboard—before he was handcuffed he pointed to his chin—I did not look at it at that time; I did shortly after-wards, and saw a slightish wound; but that was an old wound it was not a mark that would be caused by a fist; there was no other mark—he remained in handcuffs in a cabin—I took them off occasionally for him to wash himself—Evans died about half-past ten on the night of the 18th.</p>

I was at Bow Street on December 2nd, the day the case was concluded—Zucchi began to make a statement to the Magistrate in answer to the usual caution, and he added, "If I had known the note was a false one, why should I have gone to a place where I was well known?"—I have ex<lb/>amined the handwriting of all the three letters, and I say, undoubtedly, they are all written by one person—I have made translations of the second and third.</p>

I am a constable of the Metropolitan Police, special branch—on November 24th, about half-past twelve, I was on duty in the Strand, and saw the two prisoners together, close to Somerset House—they were walking towards Charing Cross—I followed them to the corner of King William Street, about 150 yards from Mr. Hand's office, 16, Strand—they parted; Raymond went up King William Street, as if to Mr. Hand's office, which he entered—I followed him, and remained outside—I saw a constable called in subsequently—I saw Mr. Hands, and in consequence of what he said I went to his office, and seized Zucchi—I said to him, "I am a police officer, and you will be detained at Scotland Yard pending inquiries"—he said, "Well, if the note is a bad one, it has nothing to do with me; I got it from my friend Raymond on leaving him at Ludgate Hill, about three hours ago"—he was taken to Scotland Yard—I left him there, and went to Caledonian Crescent about half-past five—I saw Raymond, and said, "Your friend Zucchi is detained at Scotland Yard for being in possession of foreign forged notes; you will have to accompany me there"—he said, "Yes, I gave it to him this morning at the General Post Office, Cheapside"—I then conveyed him to Scotland Yard.</p>

I said, "Yes "—I was charged at Worship Street with stealing it, but I was discharged—I did not leave the Court very indignant, but I felt revengeful with Magnus—I did not say that I would be revenged</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, New Tyson Street, Bethnal Green, and am carman to Pickford and Co.—on October 19th I had instructions to go to Fresh Wharf for goods, and saw the prisoner Svdney, the delivery foreman—besides the goods I called for I received twenty boxer of sultanas, which I had no delivery note for and no receipt—he said, "Take these twenty boxes, and deliver them to Magnus, as the carrier has lodged an order, and he could not wait"—I told him that we should collect any goods, and take them to the White Swan Yard to our depot, and our clerk, Mr. Pinket, made a note of it on October 22nd—I received two half-boxes a few days afterwards, but I do not know the date—I did not hand any delivery order for them; Sydney asked me to take them and deliver them; I had no receipt for them; I took them to White Swan Yard, and never saw them again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know either of the Magnus's at all—I have not delivered goods at their place—I have taken goods from Fresh Wharf before, and sent them to the Magnus's—I do not go past their plane—the middle of this year was the first time I had orders, and sent goods to Magnus—I did not take any from Fresh Wharf to the depot, last year to be booked to Magnus—the two seasons were twenty-eight months—my first season was the beginning of last year—I go there twice a day all the year—I know Frank Day—I never told him that if he would let me have some stuff I knew where to dispose of it—Sydney helped to load the van twice out of three times—he has four or five men, and sometimes fifteen, under him—he has a desk—the man did not see him give me the raisins, because the man was taking</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have been six years in Messrs. Pickford's employ—this conversation with Day took place outside the wharf; I was going to have a drink; he said that he was out of employment—I said, "Will you have a glass?"—he said, "Yes," and then he told me he had car<lb/>ried a bundle of anchovies away, and the people at the wharf were silly—Mrs. Sydney spoke to me on the steps of the Mansion House on the day of the remand—I was called as a witness—Sydney was represented by Counsel, Mr. Morris, on the remand—I was not cross-examined by him—this is the first time I have heard this suggested conversation—I have never taken goods from Fresh Wharf, except from an official—Sydney was the foreman, and he delivered them to me; he did not shout out.</p>

               <p>Co., of Fresh Wharf—Sydney was my foreman on the first floor and base<lb/>ment—in consequence of something which came to my knowledge early in November I searched the register and missed twenty boxes of sul<lb/>tanas and two boxes and a-half of raisins—I could not find any delivery note for them, or any carman's receipt—they should always take a de<lb/>livery note—I did not speak to Sydney, but gave information to the police—the goods should have gone out of the basement, that is his floor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Sydney sixteen or seventeen years, first as a temporary clerk, and afterwards for twelve or thirteen years; we had constantly employed him at the British and Foreign Steam Wharf, and afterwards at the General Steam Navigation Com<lb/>pany—he left to come to us at our request—his character is good—if any goods were missing he would be responsible—he had six or seven men under him, sometimes more—he would have a sub-foreman under him, and a sub-gang when there was pressure—there was pressure at this time, and it was greatest on Saturday nights—Sydney had a desk on his floor—there is a half floor, so that he had three floors under him—when goods are brought in they are verified, and then sent on—it is possible that the goods in this order might be on three floors; one order may have three or four consignments in it, and Sydney could not be on all three floors—goods might be brought up from three floors at the same time—the breaker out gets the goods, and takes them to the gang, who loads the van, and the foreman supervises the whole business—it is possible for a man to hand out goods without the foreman knowing that such a thing has passed.</p>

Joseph," and accepted by Hart, Barnard and Co., and the other by Theophite Regan.</hi>) The signature "Joseph," and the making of the note on the face of the bill, and the endorsement are the prisoner's writing, I have no doubt—he said that the endorser was a substantial firm in the printing trade—the acceptance, in my opinion, in each case, is the prisoner's writing, and the body of each bill is certainly his—I said that I would see if I could get them discounted, and Mr. Pocock ad<lb/>vanced £19 by three cheques, two of which I gave to Joseph, and one I got cashed and gave him the cash and the two cheques—one of them has been paid, and the other is cancelled, but payment has been made to the holder of it—I think I wired to the bank to stop payment, but it was too late—on January 13th the bill purporting to be accepted by Hart, Barnard and Co. became due; I presented it at the National Provincial Bank of Eng<lb/>land, and received it back, marked "No account"—he did not come to see me, and, in consequence, he was arrested and taken to Clerkenwell Police Court, and the case was remanded to January 22nd—I had commu<lb/>nicated with the various people who had purported to draw these bills—during the remand the prisoner's wife came to me and made a proposition, and handed me £9 and one of the cheques which had not been negotiated—I said, "I can enter into no negotiations with you; if you like to pay the money do so"—I instructed Counsel—Mr. Pocock was the only prosecutor, and the Counsel laid the facts before the Magistrate, and asked him to allow the charge to be withdrawn—I gave more information to the police, and left them to take the matter up.</p>

I am assistant to Peter Robinson and Co.—Mr. Becker brought the two female prisoners to me, and there was some conversation, which was interpreted to me, and I fetched some lace, and, among other pieces, showed them this piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was in stock and under my control before they came in—they measured six metres, but I was not aware of the length at that time—the selling price was £6 the piece—the female prisoners were left alone at the counter where the lace was exposed, while Mr. Becker and I went away—the prisoners gave some orders, and about ten minutes after they left I commenced putting the lace together which had been shown to them, and missed this piece, which was the only piece of the kind we had, nor had I any piece like it under my control—none of the other goods were paid for—I mentioned the loss to the proper person—I recollect showing this particular piece to the women—on November 9th the police took me to Messrs. Attenborough's, in Shaftesbury Avenue, at a little after twelve in the day; the female prisoners were just passing out—by directions, I did not speak to them going into the shop; the assistant showed me this piece of lace, which I recognised at once.</p>

I am lace buyer for Peter Robinson and Co.—in December, 1895, I ordered from Mr. De Cock six pieces of lace from a pattern he showed me—I received other pieces of him in February, 1896, in the ordinary course, and put it into our stock—when lace of that price is sold it comes to my knowledge, and I put it into my book—this is the piece of lace made in execution of the order given by me in February—it has not been sold—on November 5th I had a conversation with Mr. Becker and Miss Graveley, and ordered them to go to the agents, and on that day I heard from the assistants of the loss of a piece of lace—I informed the managing director—I was shown this lace on the 9th, but could not say the length which was lost, and was not sufficiently certain to swear to it; but now, having seen the pattern, I have no doubt this was the piece which was put into stock.</p>

I was employed in this matter all through—I was communicated with on November 5th—on November 9th I was in Shaftesbury Avenue, and saw the prisoner Ettore coming out of Mr. Attenborough's shop with a small brown paper parcel—he walked down towards where the other three prisoners were standing, about twenty yards from the shop, and walked by them, apparently taking no notice—I went up to him, and asked him in French what he had there, pointing to the parcel—he made a reply I did not understand—I then asked him, "How much?"—he turned to the other prisoners, and there was a conversation, and the prisoner Emma motioned me into a shop, and, through an interpreter, I asked her how much she would take for the lace—she said, "£15"—I asked if she would take £7—she said, "No"—I asked if it belonged, to her, as Ettore still had it—she said, "Yes"—I said that I was a police officer, and should take them in custody on suspicion of stealing lace last week—they all smiled, and said what I understood to be "Certainly"—up to that time there was no evidence against Paolo, but I beckoned to him to follow, and I took the four in a cab to the station—Christina the Countess, and Ettore were identified as having been at Peter Robinson's; they were then charged with stealing the lace, and Paolo was charged with unlawful possession of an opera glass</p>

               <p>and, other things; they appeared before a Magistrate next morning at Marlborough Street, and were remanded for a week—I found on Ettore these blank forms for washing, with figures on the back; and on Paolo this duplicate of Mr. Button's for two for two furs—on December 4th, after the prisoners' committal, I went to the Boston Hotel, and received from Miss Whittaker two parcels, one done up in the <hi rend="italic">Evening News</hi> of December 9th, the ten o'clock edition, and containing Marshall and Snelgrove's lace, and in the other nine packages of lace, five in one packet, two in another, and the rest were single pieces—I also found a fur necklet and a broken fan with diamonds, worth £30—there are three pieces of lace which we have not found any owner for—some pieces of lace were torn off and pinned to these blank washing bills, with figures of the same character as that found on Ettore.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant, Scotland Yard</hi>). On December 3rd I apprehended the prisoner at Liverpool on a warrant—I said, "Is your name Ernest Daboust?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I am an officer of the Metropolitan Police; I hold a warrant for your arrest"—I read the warrant to him, and said, "You will be further charged with stealing a bank book of the National Penny Bank, forging a receipt, and obtaining £10"—he said, "All right; I do not know whether it was I who signed the book or not"—I brought him in the train to London—in the train he said, in French, which I speak (the conversation was partly in French and partly in English), this, which I have written down: "I wish to explain the affair to you. I wish to speak French, so that I make no mistake. Her friend, Charlotte, borrowed from me £1, with her consent, and she gave me a receipt. She promised to pay it, but she only gave me 4s. 6d. I was very badly off and unhappy there, and had rendered a lot of service to her, and she never paid me. Under these circumstances, the woman who lives in the first floor said to me I was a fool not to pay myself, seeing that she owed me so much, and on that evening she gave me £2 to take to the bank. I kept them for myself. The woman, whose name is Marie, followed me, and said, 'Give me the book, and I will go and get some money.' I accompanied her to the bank, with the intention of paying the £2 in; but she, nevertheless, took the book and asked for £10, which she received and signed for in the ledger of the bank. After<lb/>wards she left me, taking away the £10 and the bank book. I was then afraid to return to the house. I took the train to Manchester, where I remained a day; after that I went to Liverpool, where I have remained since. I only took £2, as, with respect to the other £10, the woman Marie kept it. She lived at that time in the same house; I do not know whether she is still there. I am very pleased somebody has come to search for me to lock me up"—I took him to the Tottenham Court Road Police Station, and charged him—he made no further statement.</p>

I am clerk to Mr. B. rack ton Hicks, Coroner for the London South-Western District—on September 4th last an inquest was held on the body of Sophia Louisa Holliday, and continued by various adjournments until October 28th, when a verdict of the Jury was given—the defendant was summoned as a witness, and was in attend<lb/>ance on various days—on October 14th he was sworn, and gave evidence, and again on October 22nd and 28th—I took down his evidence in answer to the questions put to him, in the presence of the Coroner and Jury—he was represented sometimes by a solicitor, sometimes by counsel, and some<lb/>times by both—on the 28th Mr. Abinger appeared as counsel for him; he put a number of questions to him; the Coroner allowed him to do so—I took down his answers; the general rule is for the Coroner to put the questions, but at his request he allowed his counsel to do so—I produce my original notes of the evidence given by the defendant on all the days when he was examined.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">These were put in and read, in which the defendant described himself as John Ferdinand, a duly qualified medical practitioner, an M.D., U.S.A., of twenty-five years' experience; that he had attended Sophia Louisa Holliday for cancer down to the end of June in the name of Alfred Woodland, and gave the certificate of her death in that name.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The inquiry before the Coroner was as to the cause of the death of Sophia Louisa Holliday, and witnesses were called as to that matter, amongst others three medical men—they did not all concur as to the cause of death—the defendant was called first on October 13th; he made a statement; he said he wished to be called—he was asked if he was a British subject—he said that, under the advice of his counsel, he declined to answer the question—he was asked if he was an American subject; he declined to answer—he said, "I decline to state to what nation I belong"—I have no recollection of his saying, "You are making a prisoner of me"—later on the Coroner asked him if he had a diploma—he said, "Yes"—the Coroner asked him if he had it there—he said, "No, I did not think it would be wanted; this is not a question of diploma, it is the cause of the woman's death"—the Coroner asked if he could fetch it, and he said, "I will send for it, and produce it on the next occasion; it is with a friend; I refuse to say his name"—the Coroner said, "If you on't produce the certificate to-day I shall send you to prison for contempt</p>

               <p>of Court," and he adjourned the Court for two days—I believe he was in Court on the 22nd; I fancy in custody; not for contempt of Court—he was released on the second day, on sureties; afterwards, refusing to find sureties, he was re-committed to prison on the 22nd till the 28th.</p>

I am a baker, of Walton, near Bridgwater, near the village of Ashcot, Somerset—from 1864 to 1870 I was in the employ of young Mr. Puddy—at that time I knew a young fellow named Albert Woodland, a plumber and glazier; he was a young fellow about twenty, and lived with his father and mother about one hundred yards from Mr. Puddy—I used to see him frequently, and talked to him—I never went about with him; I frequently saw him—I have been in the house; I used to see him in the village street—I continued working for Mr. Puddy till 1870—Albert Woodland was then in the village—I have a particular reason for recollecting him in January, 1870—he then started at quack<lb/>doctoring; he had pamphlets printed, and professed to cure particular complaints—I have not seen him since till I saw him in Court—I left Ashcot in 1870—he never told me that he had been in America; he never showed me this diploma, or told me that he had been at the Eclectic—he was never absent from Ashcot for three years, or any part of that time—I was at the South-Western Police Court at one of the adjournments; I was brought there by Inspector Reynolds, and I there saw the prisoner, and recognised him as Albert Woodland—I have no doubt of it.</p>

               <p>to Mr. James's place by the prisoner—I saw Mr. James hold it up and examine it, and I heard him say, "You have been endeavouring to clean this out yourself, to take the name out"—when Mr. James held it up I could see it quite distinctly; there was no name there, but there were tracings of a name having been there—I saw the name "J. Adolphus. Ferdinand" put in there—Mr. James put it in at the time I was there it was sent for—I do not know who came for it; it was while the matter was under inquiry—there were other diplomas in the place at the time waiting; the person who came for it paid 5s. for the work that was done—Mr. James took the other diplomas away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was employed by Mr. James for about eighteen month s—I knew the sort of business he was doing; he is a respectable lithographer—other diplomas were brought; the messenger asked if the diplomas were there—they were to be filled up for doctors—I am a toucher-up of diplomas—that is not my speciality; it may be Mr. James's speciality, it is not mine; he is a lithographer—he has diplomas brought him to fill in by the persons who brought them to be filled in—I never filled them in—I did not know the seriousness of filling in these diplomas—I am still with Mr. James—it seems to me now that he has done wrong—besides touching up the name, he filled another name in—he must have done more than touch up the name—I have heard that he swore before the Coroner that all he did was to touch up the name—there was no name visible before he touched it; there were little marks badly taken out of an original name—I saw the diploma on the bench—I did hot take it in my hand; I examined it—I should say it was two days in the room—Mr. James took out the old names; the slight signs of a name—there are still marks of a name having been there previously—I don't think Mr. James is here; I don't know.</p>

I practise as an expert in handwriting at 59, Holborn Viaduct—the diploma produced has been submitted to me for examination by the Treasury Solicitor—I have examined it—it is appa<lb/>rently printed on parchment—the names "Adrian, Albert, John, Adolphus, Ferdinand," have been written in—Ferdinand and Adrian have been written on the clean parchment, and the other names over an erasure—the six lines at the bottom, headed "Faculty," commencing with the name of "John Buchanan," and which appear to be signatures of persons with their qualifications, in my opinion, are written by the same hand, as well as the signatures of the persons describing themselves as "secretary" and "president"—on the seal of the college is "Eclectic Medical College of Pennsylvania, incorporated 1850," and inside are the subjects, including Thompsonnia, Allopathy, Homoeopathy, and Hydro<lb/>pathy (I cannot see them all), and in the centre is "Eclectic," and the rest of the signature.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 69, South Lambeth Road—the prisoner married my daughter Fanny in December, 1893—at that time we were living in Clarence Street, Clapham—the prisoner came</p>

               <p>there as A lodger—the house belonged to myself and daughter—after that we went to live in Goldhawk Road, and after that at Brixton—part of the furniture in the house was on the hire system, not all, a part that was hired on the prisoner's account, not mine—in July, 1394, the pri<lb/>soner was arrested, and was sentenced to three years' penal servitude—after he was sent away the furniture on the hire system was taken away—after that we went to live at different places, until we went to live at 14, Linom Road—before going there we lived in Bonham Road—my daughter used to write to the prisoner while he was in prison, but not for the last six months—on October 31st he came to Limon Road, after being released from prison—I opened the door to him—at first I did not know him—he said, "Don't you know me?"and then I knew his voice—my daughter came in in about a quarter of an hour; she was rather upset—the prisoner stayed at the house after that—he was very civil and kind—he did not talk much—I never knew him talk much—he moved some of the furniture from downstairs upstairs to his wife's work-room; she worked as a dressmaker—I remember the pri<lb/>soner saying to me, "Do chemists sell poisons without a label?"—I said I thought not—nothing more was said on the subject—he never said any<lb/>thing to me about borrowing money on the furniture—he said he should sell the chairs in the front room next week—I said, "Henry, I can't see how you can sell them; I have been the landlady eighteen months; I think you are in my debt"—he said, "I shall see next week;" that was all that was said upon the furniture—I never saw this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in the prisoner's writing—I know nothing about his inquiry for other houses—on November 8th, the day before this assault, I do not remember anything being said about his going out for a walk with his wife—he was very quiet that day. nothing at all unusual; he was looking at the paper; his wife asked him to take a little walk with her, and they went out for half or three-quarters of an hour; they went out to<lb/>gether, and came in together—he and his wife slept in the back room, first floor, and I slept in the front—on the Sunday night I went to bed first, as I generally did; I left them downstairs—in the night someone jumped out of bed very heavily in their room; it shook the floor; I don't know which it was, him or her—in the morning my daughter came into my room; she always came in to me the first thing—she went down to get breakfast, and then brought me a cup of tea, and when she came up the second time she said to me, "Mother, I have had something in my tea, the same as you had last week"—she looked dreadful; I drank some of my tea, and I felt the same—she said, "I must go downstairs; I shall be sick," and she went down—I was sick—that was about twenty minutes or a quarter to eight in the morning—I got up, and went down<lb/>stairs—before I got to the bottom flight I heard my daughter screaming dreadfully, and I could hear the blows—I got downstairs into the passage—I looked into the cellar, and there I saw the prisoner beating my daughter—I did not know what to do, if I went down I could not get back—in the meantime the prisoner came up the steps and floored me down at the top of the cellar, in the passage—I put up my hand to save myself, and he beat me down, and I lost my finger—he beat me in the head, and I was in the hospital for three weeks—there was a coal hammer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189612140085"/>
               <p>in the cellar—he had in his hand this hammer, which is a different one to that in the cellar, which was a larger one—at this time he was afraid of somebody coming to take him away—on one occasion he said he was going to give himself up to the police, and he went out to do so, but he returned again—he once came in with a large bundle of old newspapers—I don't remember telling him to go and lie down, as he looked so very queer; his wife may have said so—I said nothing to him—about that time I had arranged to go and visit some friends at Derby—my daughter asked me to stop with her, but I could not; I had packed up my things—I did not notice that he was more than usual in ill-health—I think he remains in the house more than usual—I think he said he had taken another place—he was released from prison on the last occasion on October 31st—he had written to say that he was coming home, and we expected him—then was no ill-feeling when he came that I was aware of; he was very quiet in his manner—he seemed anxious, as he said, to make a fresh start—on Sunday, "November 8th, he had nothing to do; he was looking at the paper—he took no notice of anything all the evening—he had the paper before him on the table; he was spoken to, but never answered—his wife asked him to go out for a walk, and they went out together—when she came back she said nothing about his behaviour. while they were out; she got him some supper, and he ate it—I gave evidence before the Coroner; what I said there was true—at supper he sat by himself in a part of the room; neither his mother nor I took any supper, only him—I don't know that he refused to come and sit by the fire; she put a chair for him—when he jumped out of bed it was in the dead of the night; it made a tremendous noise—I heard nothing after that; all was quiet till my daughter came to my room—the next I saw of the prisoner was when he rushed upstairs and struck me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I remember his being convicted at Wakefield; he was not married then—he came back and lived with me and my daughter—I fancy there were more convictions against him, but I never heard of it—I don't remember it—when he was living with us in Goldhawk Road he was afraid someone would come and take him away, to arrest him; we did not know what it was for at the time—I remember the last time he was convicted; it was for stealing a pony and trap—that must have been six or seven months before he was convicted—he was not convicted till June or July, and he had stolen the pony and trap at the beginning of May—we were then living in Goldhawk Road—the police came there for him, and he escaped away—when he came back he did not say anything about his licence; he was not particularly anxious—he said he must try a fresh start, and he must be very careful how he acted, and what he did—I don't know what he did with the bundle of newspapers that he brought, home—when I first knew him he represented himself as a traveller—when he came home, this last time he said the furniture looked very nice, that we had a very nice home; he was very pleased to see such a comfort-able home—I told him his wife had worked very hard indeed to help keep such a home, and I kept things together myself.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> From what I saw of the injuries to Mrs. Brown, great violence must have been used; great and repeated violence—I have studied the question of insanity professionally—if there has been insanity in a father there might be predisposition to it in the son—if other members of the family had suffered the tendency would be increased; it might remain latent for a long time—it might be produced by various causes—mental worry is a recognised exciting cause of insanity—probably the same causes as brought it about in the father would bring it out in the son—it is common for insane people to have delusions—it is not unusual for the patient to imagine he has been treated improperly—it is a common symptom of some forms of insanity to fancy things have been put in the food, that people are grinning at them, or following them—the presence of such symptoms would cause one to suppose that the person was developing insanity—change of manner is a symptom also—refusing to speak when spoken to—pains in the head or sleeplessness might be but not necessarily—a symptom of predisposition after an accident would be noted—there is insanity of the mind and of the will, and sometimes both com-bined—impulsive insanity is a recognised form—I know Dr. Luff's name—I studied under Dr. Clouston—Dr. Luff, the author of the text-book of "Forensic Medicine and Toxicology," is a recognised authority—he is described as a physician, a lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology in St. Mary's Hospital, and Examiner in Forensic Medicine in the University of London and in the Victoria University, and Official Analyst to the Home Office—I agree with what he says in his book: "The term impulsive insanity is applied to a mental disorder in which the patient is driven by a morbid and uncontrollable impulse to the com<lb/>mission of acts of violence, the reason being for the time overpowered "; and "The states of morbid impulse may be momentary or constant"—a man may have insanity of the will one moment, and be perfectly sane shortly afterwards, within a minute—the impulse is frequently directed to those dearest to the affected person—it is possible for the insane to have no recollection of his violence; that he had committed a murder—it is not uncommon to find homicidal mania accompanied by a suicidal tendency.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him first on November 26th—there may have been insanity on November 8th—I know Dr. Luff's well recognised work on insanity—I agree that not infrequently the acts of impulsive insanity are directed towards people with regard to whom in their right mind the patient would have feelings of affection—I was in Court when Dr. Barrie gave his evidence—I agree with it—I agree that," in endeavouring to estimate the responsibility of such a person for an act of violence, a care<lb/>ful inquiry must be made into the past history of the person, and also into that of his relatives. The act itself, and the manner of its commission, must also be taken into consideration "—in considering the act itself, one first considers whether there was motive or not; also the way the act was done, and whether it was done in such a way as would ensure detection, and considerations of that kind—also the fact whether unnecessary or outrageous violence was used—having the considerations you have referred to in my mind, I kept the prisoner under careful observation whenever he spoke of his life, with a view to find out anything that would throw light on or explain the crime for which there appeared to have been no motive—what he told me was told voluntarily—he told me he believed his father died in an asylum, but he was uncertain as to the date—as far as his recollection went, he thought his father had shown violence at the time, especially when worried about business matters—he told me his father's insanity had been brought about by worry and anxiety of mind, that his father had been confined at Colney Hatch, and that he had taken his father from there—he believed his father had died in an asylum—he had no definite recollection of the mental condition of his other relatives. (<hi rend="italic">Read from the witness report:</hi> "Mother not very good health, but no mental affection.") He could not give any statement as to that—after the prisoner's statement, I believe inquiries were made at Colney Hatch—I am told that a person of the same name as his father was confined at Colney Hatch; that efforts had been made to find the asylum in which his father died, but it is very difficult to get information as to far back dates—I heard this morning that the prisoner's father died at the Cater<lb/>liam Asylum—as far as I can test them, his statements made in my report</p>

               <p>are accurate—the prisoner said the first accident he met with was to his back, but that was trifling—the first serious accident was in Wakefield Prison in April, 1893, when he told me he had some liquid caustic painted over his stomach, and that since then he had never been the name man—he said it caused him pains all over; not that it made blood run from his ears, but that he had a weakness of the eyes, and perspired in the morning when he rose—he did not tell me about people grinning and jeering at him while he was in prison—I wrote to the doctor of Wake<lb/>field Prison, under whose charge the prisoner had been—it was then brought to my knowledge that on April 20th, 1893, the prisoner had been treated with a blistering fluid on his stomach, and that on one occasion he complained of his food having disagreed with him, and I believe he was put under observation for a short time at Wakefield Prison—there was some foundation for his statement—if there had been none it would have been more likely to have been a delusion—people of unsound mind not infrequently misrepresent medical treatment—the prisoner said he thought people had watched and followed him, and he carried a revolver; that people were going to come into his house and take him away; that he started out one morning between six and seven, expecting to be taken up by the police without knowing what for; that he wandered to the City, and bought a lot of old newspapers, and took them home; and that this condition of affairs lasted for about a week, and was due to loss of property, and not to drink, as he was a temperate man—he said he had complained, when he returned from Borstall Prison in October, 1896, that he had pains from time to time—he said people followed him while he was out walking; that when he got home his friends sat near the fire, and he sat on the other side of the room; and that in the middle of the night, after Sunday, the 8th, he had violent pains in his side; that he got up and walked about till breakfast time, and that after breakfast he found himself lying on the floor in pain, with a constable standing over him, in his own bedroom.</p>
