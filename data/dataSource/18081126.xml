               <p>Q. Was that in the trunk in which you had put the pocket book - A. It was; she looked at the shawl, and said she thought she could wash it very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take it out of the trunk - A. No, I took it out of the trunk, and I put it in again, and she sat down and supped a little mutton broth with me; the other young woman came and said she should sleep with her that night; accordingly she went down stairs to fetch some things, as she pretended, to sleep in. I suspected nothing till the next morning. A young woman came for me to pay her a pound note; I opened my trunk and said, Oh dear, my money is gone. I missed my pocket book, my notes, and seven shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner - A. I saw the prisoner that day, and I thought she behaved awkward. I saw her in the room where Black lived. She bought a great many fine things, and was dressed out like a lady.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was she apprehended - A. I applied at Worship street office for a search warrant, and on Friday the 7th of October she was taken to the justice in Worship street; and then they chose that I should look in again on the Monday, and there they convicted her to come to the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your pocket book again - A. Yes, Mr. Armstrong has it; she confessed having it.</p>

Yes, Mrs. Waylett called to me about half after seven o'clock to come into her room; the prisoner was with her. Mrs. Waylett asked me if it was convenient for her to lodge with me; I said I did not know it was, but I would let her be there; then the young body said she would come in about half an hour; and she came back at the watch going ten; I never saw the young woman before; I was in bed. The next morning the young woman dressed herself, and I did not see the wearing apparel she had on; I had no candle; I did not see there was any alteration, no further than she was smart. On Friday the pocket book was found in the old lady's hamper, with some rags; Mr. Armstrong found it. The hamper was up in my room, with some rags belonging to Mrs. Waylett.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time in the day was it - A. I cannot pretend exactly to say; it was between two and three o'clock I believe; he came alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. No; he called for a glass of ale; I served him with a glass of ale. I threw the shilling on the table which he gave me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Did you throw it on the table to sound it - A. Not particularly to sound it. I gave him his change, a sixpence and four pennyworth of halfpence, and then I took the shilling up and went towards the light to see whether it was a good one; I found it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Are you quite sure the shilling you look up, after having throwed it down, was the shilling you took from him - A. Yes; it was a smooth shilling, it looked very well; when I rubbed it I found what it was directly; as soon as ever I pronounced it was a bad one Mr.

            . Q. I believe you are an officer of Worship street office - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany Ray on this day - A. I did; I with him to the house of Mr. Hargrave; Mr. Hargrave gave me a shilling. I was sitting in the back parlour, I heard a voice call for a glass of ale; sometime after that I heard the landlord say it was a bad shilling; the landlord was in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say it was a bad shilling to - A. To the person that tendered it, as I considered it, that induced me to come out of the parlour; I saw the prisoner and I knew him; at that time Mr. Ray had got hold of him by the arm; we took him into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get possession of that shilling - A. Immediately I took him into the parlour; Mr. Hargrave held the shilling in his hand; I desired Mr. Hargrave to mark the shilling, and then when he had marked it, Ray proceeded to search him in my presence. I saw him find nineteen counterfeit shillings up. on him, seven good sixpences, he counted, he found upon him likewise, and four shillings and twopence in copper, he found upon him; which he took out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.What did Mr. Hargrave do with the shilling he marked - A. He gave it to me. I then went to search the prisoner again; in his right hand waistcoat pocket<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260005"/>I found a shilling, which I believe to be a good one. Here is the shilling which Mr. Hargrave gave to me after he had marked it; I have had that shilling ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. Yes, I have known him this five or six years before.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hargrave. Just look at that shilling and see whether that is the shilling you marked and gave to Kennedy - A. Yes, that is the one I had of the prisoner; I marked it and gave it to Kennedy.</p>
               <p>MR. NICHOLLS. - Q. You are one of the moniers of his Majesty's Mint - the shilling that Mr. Hargrave gave to Kennedy, I put into your hand - A. It is a counterfeit.</p>
               <p>COURT. It has the resemblance of a shilling, I suppose - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But it is a counterfeit - A. Yes. The other ten are also counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Look at the others - A. The nine are also counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they appear fresh - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where are the good one's - A. The one that Kennedy speaks of, I rather think it is a bad one; it is silver; it never was a shilling. Here is one sixpence is good, and the others I believe are silver; they are passable; they have a better appearance than the others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I put the shilling down on the table, I did not mean to give it him at all; I was putting my hand into my pocket to take some halfpence out to give him for the glass of ale; before I could get my hand in my pocket Mr. Ray and Kennedy seized both my hands; the landlord never moved it from where it was, at the other end of the table, till they had searched me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean to say it laid on the table all the time - A. Yes, it never was moved till they moved it to him; nor was I ever moved from there into the parlour; I was searched upon the very spot, and when he offered me the change of this shilling, they took it out of his hand back again; I did not, receive it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hargrave. We have understood from your evidence that he gave the shilling into your hand, that you threw it down on the table - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you are very confident that he gave you the shilling in payment of the ale, and you returned him the sixpence and the fourpence - A. Yes; he afterwards dropped the sixpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you on the 1st of October, in consequence of what your son told you, go after the prisoner - A. Yes, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I overlook him in St. John's square, Clerkenwell, about four or five hundred yards from my house; I brought him back to my own house; as soon as he got into the premises he made a run to the place where he had put his coat on to the lower shop; there he attempted to deliver the piece of bolt copper; I saw him take it out of his breeches; he attempted to throw it down; I caught his hand, in the scuffle it fell to the ground; but I felt it in his hands and saw it; I took it up myself; this is the piece of copper; I can swear to it being mine. Here it a nick in it here, and being half sawed off, and then broken off, I know it by that; I am sure it is my property. I had it of the copper company the day before; I had two hundred weight and a half to be worked up, for the company.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed these marks the day before - A. No; I observed it when he took it out of his breeches.</p>

            , fifteen years of age, was servant to Mr. Frost, who had missed a piece of copper as he supposed; he on that day stopped me and had me searched by a constable in his own house; nothing was found upon me; upon which I was permitted to go home as far as St. John's square; when one of the prosecutor's sons came and fetched me back, and brought me into his house, where I underwent a second search; I saw a piece of copper, which I thought was similiar to what the prosecutor lost, and seeing the copper laying there; I picked it up; I then stooped to pick up another piece; when I had so done the prosecutor's son said, oh! you pulled that out of your pocket; whereas I never saw it till I picked it up, thinking it was the piece that was lost; therefore I must have put it into my pocket, after I was brought back, to have taken it out after I came there which inconsistency I beg to lay before your lordship and the court.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Frost. That boy says in his defence, that you having missed some copper you suspected him, and that you had him searched by a constable; that after being searched nothing was found upon him; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260006"/>permitted to go home, he went as far as St. John's square, and was fetched back by your son; - on the 1st of October had he been searched by any constable - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He says that after being searched by a constable, he was allowed to go as far as St. John's square - A. He was allowed to go as far as St. John's square; the constable came afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought back, he thought some pieces of copper were laying there like that which you lost, and he picked it up - was that the case - A. No; there were no pieces of copper in that room, except that piece of copper I caught in his hand as it was tumbling down.</p>
               <p>Q. to Frost, junior. On the 1st of October, the day you have been speaking of, had the prisoner been searched by any constable before he went out - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the lower shop at the time he was brought in with this piece of copper - A. I was in the yard, just behind my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your father take the copper from him - A. Yes, I was just in the entry of the door way of the lower shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where the piece of copper came from, immediately before your father took it from him - A. I saw it in his hand: my father make a snap at it; it fell down on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it come out of his breeches - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him stoop to pick up any thing off the ground before your father made a snatch at it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any copper in the place where your father took the copper from him; was there any copper lying on the ground for him to pick up - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a constable sent for afterwards - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a journeyman to Mr. Price, in umbrella making. On the 23d of September, about seven in evening, or a little after, I was going up to Mr. Price's for work, and the prisoner was standing looking in at the window; the shopman was preparing to light the candles; when I got up to the shop door, he walked in before, he asked the shopman to look at an umbrella; another gentleman came in the shop; the umbrella was shewn him before the other gentleman came in; the gentleman bought an umbrella, and gave the shopman the money; he went back for change; I went backwards in the warehouse; the warehouse is beyond the shop, at the back of a parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the gentleman buy an umbrella - A. No, but the shopman came backwards for change of Mrs. Price, saying that the gentleman had bought an umbrella.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the prisoner at his going out - A. No; I came in the shop before the gentleman that had bought the umbrella had left it, when the shopman came forward with the change.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the shop then - A. No, he was gone; the gentleman was there that had bought the other umbrella; the gentleman asked if the prisoner came in with an umbrella in his hand; I knowing that he did not, I said no. Mrs. Price asked me to go after the prisoner. I went down Temple bar and through Fleet street; the gentleman said he went that way; and when I came to Water lane in Fleet street, I saw the prisoner going with an umbrella in his hand, he was walking; I stopped him, and told him he must come back along with me; he said I was mistaken in his person; when I told him where he had got the umbrella, he came with me back as far as Temple lane, and there he ran away from me; I followed him and catched him again; he had the umbrella with him when I caught him. I brought him back to the shop, he brought the umbrella in the shop and laid it on the back of the counter. Mr. Price took it up and the prisoner was secured; we called a coach and took him to Bow street directly.</p>
               <p>Q. to Price You have got an umbrella in your hand, were you in the shop when the prisoner was brought back - A. I was. When he came in he had this umbrella; I took him in the warehouse, he laid it down, I took it up, it has never been out of my possession since.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether that umbrella had been in the shop any part of that day - A. It had been in the shop window for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mix the umbrella which the prisoner brought in with the other umbrellas - A. No; it is a silk umbrella; I valued it at ten shillings; it is worth double. When the prisoner was brought in with the umbrella he begged for mercy, and wished to serve his majesty, which I was anxious he should, but the magistrate thought proper to bind me over.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith. You are very sure that the man that you met with the umbrella was the man that came in the shop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have known him had you overtaken him without an umbrella in his hand - A. I particularly observed him when I got up to him, before I went into the shop.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did he live with you - A. Nearly ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the course of his employ - A. Looking out goods and sending them out in the country to the various customers; that was part of his employ; he had also the paying of workmen that were employed out of doors, and the porters and other servants.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he to receive money - A. He was to receive money in the retail way in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that account - whose hand writing is that - A. The prisoner's; he kept a weekly account in a book.</p>
               <p>Q. To what amount did he debit himself in the week preceding the 26th of December last - A. He debited himself with having received thirty six pound seventeen shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. To what amount did he state to have paid - A. Thirty pound twelve shillings and two pence; leaving a balance of six pound five shillings and four pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the sums stated there do you see two items, money paid to Mr. Crawford - A. I do, to Mr. Crawford eleven shillings and six pence, and to Mr. Brookes two pound thirteen shillings; he accounted for these sums in his own hand writing; these are the hand writing of the prisoner, and they correspond with the book delivered in on Monday morning to one of the shopkeepers, as vouchers for the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the voucher for Mr. Crawford and Mr. Brookes - A. It is; both are in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. What week is this you are talking of - A. On Monday the 26th of September.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Then he represented to you that he paid Mr. Crawford eleven shillings and sixpence - A. He did, and to Mr. Brookes two pound thirteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. And by means of this representation to you, you took from him a sum of only six pound and a fraction, whereas you ought to have the sum of seven pound and a fraction, you thereby obtained of him a less sum than you ought - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you always pay him money in advance - A. He always had money; we generally advanced on Monday or Tuesday fifteen or twenty pound.</p>
               <p>Q. He lived with you near ten years - A. Yes; he always behaved extremely well.</p>

            . On Sunday morning the 2nd of October at six o'clock I was in the Minories, accompanied with Forrester and another; I saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the Minories, he was going down, I was coming up, he had got a bag with him, it appeared full; this is the bag, the three bottles were in it; he had the bag across his shoulder, walking on; I crossed over the way, and before I got up to him he stopped himself almost; I asked him what he had, he said he had got some castor oil, he was going home, and he had bought it of a man a month ago; I asked him if he knew the man, he said he did not; I asked him where he brought it from, he could give no answer to that; I took him to the watchhouse and found the contents of it; the bag contained three bottles of castor oil, four cakes of bees' wax, three pieces of camphire, one paper of valerian; one bottle of quicksilver I saw my partner find in his pocket at the watchhouse; about six pounds he dropped out where he worked. We sent to Mr. Hardle.</p>
               <p>Q. He was going down the Minories when you saw him, he told you he was going home - where did he live - A. At No. 22, St. Thomas Apostle; he was going from home. The property has been in my care ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you such articles resembling every one of these in your shop - A. We had the whole of them.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place, is there any thing particular in that valerian - A. Nothing further than it appears mouldy from dampness, not a good article; we had valerian exactly like that; these three bottles of castor oil I have no doubt but they are ours, and the bag we have some like it; the castor oil has been decanted.</p>
               <p>Q. After it is decanted you cement the cork - A. We do, with wax, rosin, and oil.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got some of the remainder of these bottles here - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you compared the cement of the one with the other, does it correspond - A. I have not the least doubt but they are part of the same quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the Compter to see the prisoner - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promise at all - A. He would not say any thing in the presence of the officer; he desired the officer to walk out; he went of one side. He then said he hoped I would not be severe, or something to that effect, and that it was the first time; he observed there were no marks on them; I told him if he would attone for his crime by a confession of his accomplice, I would be lenient; he replied he would.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then we must not hear what he said after that.</p>
               <p>- LEE. I am an apprentice to the prosecutors.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go with the officer to search his lodgings - A. Yes; one of his boxes smelled strongly of camphire.</p>

            . I am a constable of the ward of Farringdon Without. On the 19th of September I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner. I immediately came to the prisoner; the prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner for robbing him of a silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - I stand at the bar completely innocent of the charge alledged against me. On the evening it is said the robbery was committed, I was going to spend the evening with my sister, who is a servant to a respectable tradesman at Charing Cross. The prosecutor said I had robbed him; at the same instant I was walking along a gentleman kicked his foot against the handkerchief; the gentleman seeing a mob walked on; the prosecutor claimed the handkerchief; and although I know myself innocent, I was dragged to the watch-house.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260009"/>I am indicted in London, which I am told is wrong, the robbery was done in Middlesex. Gentleman I am a poor young man, a hatter by trade, now a private in the London Militia; and for some time I have been the only support of an aged father; but I now am at a loss for money and friends to assist me; I therefore hope and flatter myself that this real statement of my case will have every possible weight upon your minds to prove my innocence.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You say your pocket was picked before you got through the bar - A. Yes, it was done under the bar; I had got through the bear when I discovered that I had lost the handkerchief; I saw the handkerchief in the prisoner's hand.</p>

After he had tried these clothes on, as he was putting on the great coat again. I took the liberty of feeling the pockets, in which I discovered two bottles of wine; I said, Richard, what have you got here; nothing, sir, he said; I said that must be a mistake, and if you please we will see what it is; I then took the two bottles out of his pocket; I held one in each hand, I said Richard, what is this; he said, sir, it is sherry wine that he had been bottling, and begged for mercy; I called up a person into the room where he was; I told him I found the prisoner robbing me, and desired him to remain in the room, to see that he did not make his escape; I locked them both in; I went and got an officer; I gave the prisoner in charge of the officer, and when he was taken to the watch-house they there found two more bottles in his breeches, which I had not discovered; I then proceeded with the officer to his lodgings; where after a little objection from his wife, he searched his house; he found three bottles of red port, part of a bottle of rum, and a bottle of brandy.</p>

On Thursday morning we had information that the prisoner had some property about him; I sent for a constable; he searched him and found three pieces of fur; when he went about searching him, he threw one piece from his waistcoat pocket, and the other two pieces were in his breeches; when the constable was searching him, he threw them down behind him; I desired the constable to take notice of the pieces, and to take the man in custody.</p>

            . I am a constable; I took the prisoner in custody, and began to search him; he pulled out a piece of fur from one of his pockets; I took it. from him, and with his other hand he pulled out two more pieces from his breeches left side, as I supposed. These are the three pieces of fur.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at it; are these pieces your fur - A. It was of that description that he was working on that morning; it is impossible to swear to fur that is not marked; I have no doubt but they are mine.</p>

I went to the bar directly and gave them a glass of gin apiece; then I went home with the prisoner to her apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from this public house - A. It was a very few doors. I went into her apartment with her, I agreed to sleep with her all night; I did; I asked her if she chused to have any thing more to drink before she went to bed; she said she would take a little drop more liquor; after I had been in bed an hour I awoke, I heard a noise below, I found the person that was by the side of me gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the prisoner gone - A. Yes; I directly found my watch gone, a one pound note and three shillings in silver; they had been in my breeches under my pillow.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you put your breeches there when you went to rest - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She got away without disturbing you - A. Yes. When I missed these things I immediately got up and dressed myself; I put my hand into my coat pocket to feel for my silk handkerchief, that was gone and half a crowns worth of halfpence that was tied up in an old silk handkerchief; the old silk handkerchief was left behind; the silk handkerchief that I had about my neck was gone; I went down and saw a watchman in the street, I asked him who kept that house; he said he would go in and see.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I was not intoxicated in liquor but so as I knew what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before you went to bed had you seen your money in your pocket - A. Before I went into bed the woman was undressing herself in the room; at the same time my watch was in my breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a light in the room when you found the prisoner gone - A. No, but the watchman came up with me, and with his light I locked over the bed and the room; the watchman advised me to go home. I went down Broad street to go home; the first person that I met was the prisoner in company with a young woman and a young man; the man flew away from the prisoner; I laid hold of the prisoner, the other young woman tried to shove me off; I called the watchman immediately and he came up: I told him of the prisoner; he took her and searched her.</p>

I did; I found that he had two young women in his arms; I said who is the person that robbed you; he said the one next the shutters; I took her by the arm and pulled her into the middle of the road, I then secured her arme and kept her till another watchman came; from thence we took her to the watchhouse; the beadle was going to search her, she put her hand in her pocket and gave him the watch; Crawford was by, he claimed the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260011"/>watch.

               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch, I will swear to it.</p>

This was the watch that she delivered from her person to me; I found upon her three shillings in a housewife; the bank note I believe she swallowed; she spoke thick when she came in the watchhouse; we searched her mouth as soon as we could, but we could not find it. The prosecutor described the maker's name, it fully answered to the description; Emery is the maker's name.</p>

When this young man came up to me, he said he had not much money; he said he would go home with me; he said never mind, I have some property to leave with you till the morning. I wanted something to drink; I went down, and when I went down he followed me and stopped me. The beadle said if I had any thing to give it him; I gave him the watch.</p>
               <p>Jenkins. Before Mr. Conant, she said she took the watch from him for fear any body should rob him; she denied having the watch when she was taken.</p>

He pushed very much against me; I felt his hand against my waistcoat, he unbuttoned it all the way down; then after that I went and sat in the window in the passage. I sat there for almost an hour, then I went in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say any thing to him for feeling your waistcoat - A. No; I went out then to avoid him, then I went in again.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you sit down there that time - A. Why, the house was very full, I was very hot; then I went in again. Then he asked me what o'clock it was, he pushed very much against me again; I said I did not know rightly, I believed it was about ten; he says I want to know very particular, for I left my watch at home; then he pushed very much against me, as if in the crowd; I found his hand in my right hand breeches pocket; he pulled his hand out, jumped down, and said let be come by, I want to go out; he pushed by me. I found he had turned my pocket inside out; I jumped down after him, he run down stairs, I halloed out stop stief; they shut the check door and stopped him, I followed him instantly; the check keeper stopped him; they got Tredway the officer, he laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say what money you had in your pocket - A. Yes, I had three guineas in gold, two seven shilling pieces and some silver; I could not say exactly how much, it was in my right hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you known that money was in your pocket - A. About two minutes before I left him pushing and feeling about me; I felt my money in my pocket after I came from sitting in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you by chance speak to any of that money - A. I spoke to the officer what there was; there were three guineas, two seven shilling pieces and some silver shewed me; I had mentioned to the officer what money I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the money shewn you was there any piece that you could identify - A. Yes, a seven shilling piece.

               <p>Q. Where was he when he chucked it - A. He was upon the flight of stairs above the check taker; he threw it into one of the corners of the seat of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was money at that time - A. I heard it rattle like money.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him after he chucked the money as you described it - A. He walked down the other flight of stairs to where the check taker was, and the gate was fast. The officer was sent for and he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told any body the place where you saw him chuck the money - A. Yes, I told the money taker I saw him chuck something like money, it rattled; I told him where he had chucked it, and I told Mr. Tredway; he took up the money from the same place where the prisoner had chucked it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that the prisoner is the person that you saw chuck that money - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>HENRY TREDWAY. I am a constable of Bow street I attend Drury lane playhouse, I was there on Monday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260012"/>the 17th of this month; the prisoner was given into my charge.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information you received from the witness Saunders, did you look for any money - A. I did; I searched the prisoner first, and then I took up the lamp and went up with the boy to the window, there I found the money; I found three guineas, two seven shilling pieces, five shillings and a six pence; I have kept the money ever since. I produce it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the seven shilling piece; I know it by being a crooked one.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say positively that this is your seven shilling piece, only that one of your seven shilling pieces was crooked - A. Yes, but I had the same number of guineas, three guineas and two seven shilling pieces and some loose silver; I cannot exactly say how much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - with respect to the charge that is now preferred against me, I am totally ignorant and innocent of the circumstances altogether; and however plausible the story may be, I feel inward satisfaction that my fate is to be decided by a British jury; I shall now therefore throw myself on the mercy of the court.</p>

             having hold of the prisoner by the arm, a mob soon arose and separated Hart from her; she got away, Hart was kept there by the mob, and I ran after her; I kept sight of her; she went into a strange house, to the second floor, where I never was before, I followed her up two pair of stairs, as she was entering the two pair of stairs door I just got hold of her gown, an Irishman that lived there in the room, he said by Jesus you have no business here man, and they shut the door against me with great violence; I sung out there was a thief in the room; I had no answer; I stopped there about two minutes and then went down for fear of being in danger, being in such a place; I stopped in the street, just over the way, two hours, while Hart went for an officer; Hrrt then came with two officers; before the officers came they throwed a stone near as big as my fist, it struck me very hard on my thigh, whether it came from the house door or window, being dusk, I cannot say. The officers and Hart went and searched the house, I went with them; we went into the room where I saw the prisoner go in; she had gone from thence, the Irishman remained there.</p>

I was awaked in the morning by my dog about four o'clock; he was barking; I ran down stairs, I did not give myself time to put my clothes on, I thought something was amiss by the dog barking; when I came down I found the stable door broken to pieces, and the horse gone; I immediately ran up stairs again and dressed myself; I live about thirty yards from the road. I ran up the road to get intelligence if I could; I met three men going angling in the country; I enquired of them; they told me they had met a man with a large horse, he was trotting him as hard as he could, they could not see the colour of him, he had two white legs behind; I run on further about a quarter of a mile towards town; I met

               <p>Q. Was Cook on horseback - A. No, on foot. He turned back with me, and I went on till I got to Hammersmith, and at the Plough and Harrow I ran by the horse; I jumped off the pathway into the road, and told him to stop, he had got my property; he said what did I mean by that, it was not mine, he would let me know that I was wrong, and that I had no business with it; I told him that I would have him and told him to get off; he would not get off; I told him I would have him, he had got my property that was delivered into my charge; I jumped up and catched him by the collar, and pulled him off; Cook was just at the back of me, he took hold of the horse just when I pulled him off.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that horse that you found him upon was the same horse that had been in your stable the night before - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had observed his marks - A. I could swear to him by one mark at his nose; the near side of his nostrils is cut through, by what I do not know; I am certain sure of the horse, if only by the foot and nothing else; it had the canker in the foot; I am in the habit of curing the canker. I took the man, and held him till the watchman came up, and then I helped to put him into the round house, and then I took the horse and put him into my stable again.</p>

Going from Brentford I stopped drinking till after twelve o'clock; I asked the landlord of the Running Horse public house if I could have a bed there, as I was forward in liquor; the landlord said he would go to his mistress and ask her if he had a bed vacant; he came back and said his beds were all full; I proceeded on the high road for London; I was so very drunk I fell asleep on the road; I had these clothes that I released out of the pawnbrokers, in a large bundle along with me; I slept till rather after three o'clock in the morning; I got up and was coming along the road; a man had this horse with him, he said I seemed to be in liquor; I said I was; he asked me what part of London I was going to, I told him I was going as far as the beginning of Holborn, where I worked; he said he was coming very handy to there, if I would pay him I should ride; I told him I would pay him for riding to London; he put me upon the horse and carried my bundle. I was not in custody of the horse above ten minutes, when these people pursued me; the man who gave me the horse he got away from me; I never missed him, being in liquor; he took my clothes along with him. When the man came up to me and asked me what business I had with the horse, I told him that I had paid for riding the horse to London.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him it was not his property, and he had no business with it - A. No, I told him no such thing.</p>

            . I live in Upper Rathbone place, I am a silversmith. On the 5th of October, about half past eight in the evening, I was passing up Charlotte street, Fitzroy square, I observed the prisoner and another man look into Mr. Browning's shop; there was a lamp in the shop; the prisoner got his foot on the threshold, the other man was standing near him, and as I saw no one in the shop, I had suspicion that he was going to rob it; I walked a few doors higher up and watched him. I saw the prisoner go in; in about half a minute he came out and ran across the way and gave the geese to the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see how many he had - A. I did not know how many he had, he gave him all he had, it appeared to me to be two; it being very dark, and I stood at a great distance from him, I could distinguish it was a goose or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him when he came out of the shop to have any thing - A. I observed him have these two geese in his right hand, they both ran across the way, I followed them up Windmill street; they stopped in this street at a door and laughed very much; after stooping down for a short time they walked away again and went up Tottenham court road; I kept the opposite side; they walked to the corner of Bedford street, there was a watchbox at the corner and a watchman in it; I told the watchman two men had just passed who had robbed a shop in Charlotte street, and asked him to come with me; he instantly did, and we followed them up Bedford street, they turned into Bedford square, crossed and was in deep conversation; when they saw the watchman with his lanthorn and me coming, they parted; the watchman seized one of them instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that he seized - A. The one that got away; I told him the prisoner was the other, he took him into custody; the man that got away dropped the geese the moment we came up to him, I picked them up. I am certain the prisoner is the man which I saw go into the shop and bring out the geese; I never lost sight of him from the time I first observed him. I carried the geese to the watchhouse and the watchman took the prisoner; I sent to inform Mr. Browning instantly afterwards. When the geese were dropped they then were tied up in an apron, I opened it at the watchhouse, I saw it contained two geese; when they stooped in Windmill street it was for the purpose as I suppose of tying them up in the apron; they were not tied up in an apron when they came out of the shop.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SYKES. I am a watchman at the corner of Bedford street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, Mr. Jones, the last witness applying to you - A. Yes; about a minute before I saw two men go by, in passing they wiped my box, one of them had a white bundle on his back, the other had nothing; they walked close together; Mr. Jones asked me whether I saw two men go by; I said, yes; he said come along directly, they have been stealing some geese. I went with him directly, I saw them again before they crossed into the square; he shewed me the two men and said these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they the same two men that had passed you - A. Yes; I got him by the collar that had the bundle on his back, he let the bundle drop, and he gave a sudden jerk from me and ran away; Mr. Jones picked up the the geese and said do not run after him, this is the man that went into the shop; I laid hold then of the prisoner and took him to the watchhouse. The geese were delivered to the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. to Browning. You went to the watchhouse and saw the geese - A. Yes, the constable of the night had them in his possession, I had the geese afterwards; I described the mark to the constable before it was shewn me; I have no doubt at all of their being my property.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Tottenham court road, I met two men at the corner of Windmill street, one of them had a bundle, he asked me the way to Holborn; I told him I was going that away and if he would go along with me I would shew him; one of the men walked on before at a good distance, I walked along with the man with the bundle into Bedford square. The watchman laid hold of the man with the bundle; the man rescued himself away from him; so I stood by all the while with several other persons; the gentleman picked up the bundle; he said to the watchman, pointing out me, lay hold of that man, he is one of them; he laid hold of me and took me to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

She said a man had promised her marriage; she changed a guinea, for the two rings; after we had bought these things I bought her two water tubs, which she had taken home to my house; the shoes, hat, and stockings I took care of; the rings she put on her; I took them to my house first, then I sent my girl with them to Mrs. Appleby's; she gave me thirteen guineas, to take care of, as she had no pockets. Mr. Brown asked me what I had got; I told him directly. I put the thirteen guineas in a box because they should not be lost.</p>

On the 26th of last September, near one o'clock, passing by the corner of Arundel street, I saw a person in a blue coat give the pocket book to the prisoner, and the prisoner put it into his right hand coat pocket and ran away; the moment it was delivered to him the other walked away.</p>
               <p>Q. When the person in the blue coat gave the pocket book to the prisoner, were they both standing still together, or did the one walk on to the other - A. They were standing still together; I pursued after the prisoner, he quickened his pace to make off, he ran very fast, he ran down Arundel street and then towards Essex street into Devereaux court; I came up to him; there I called out stop thief and two gentlemen stopped him; he said he had got the pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him about the pocket book - A. I said he had got a pocket book belonging to somebody; he said he had got a pocket book; the constable searched him at the public office, Bow street, I saw the pocket book taken from him; the prisoner then said he picked the pocked book up; I told him that I saw a person in a blue coat give it him; he said I did not, he picked it up.</p>

I was walking from the Golden Cross in Charing Cross; I had been to see after a situation; there were some waiters there that I knew at that time; I walked from there and was going to the Temple, I happened to see the packet book fall from somebody, I picked it up and stood and looked round me, and could not see any person that I knew who it belonged to: I looked at the picture shop with the pocket book in my hand; I walked down Arundel street and looked at the clock. I was to meet my father at one o'clock, I ran, seeing it was near one o'clock; I heard somebody cry out stop thief, I asked what was the matter, they said it was something about a pocket book; I took the pocket book out of my pocket at Bow street.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the other note - A. I know it; I received it on the forenoon of the 17th of September. I took it home and laid it on the desk with other notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I am a labouring man, and all the summer I had very good employment; I had a good situation while the fleets were in; I had one pound, two shillings, and sixpence a week, I worked but eight hours in a day, at the West India Docks. I had it in my power to save half a guinea a week, and sometimes seven shillings. When I could not get no more employ in the docks, I applied to the board of ordinance. I wanted to save a few pounds to go to my mother's, and on my being informed I could not work above another week at the ordinance, I applied to Mr. Piper. On the Friday morning I came to his yard; I was not in his house, only when I came to ask for employment. On the beginning of the week I did call, and was sent down to the yard; it is two streets beyond Mr. Pipe's dwelling house; I came in my shirt sleeves from the Tower. Mr. Piper told me I might go to work immediately; I went back to the Tower and worked till dinner time; I told my foreman I had got work of my former master; he told me I might go and he would pay me; after dinner time I went to Mr. Piper's and was set to work, and in unloading of stones I hurt my back, and worked no more that day. - I was not near the premises since. On the Saturday I went to the Tower to my old shopmates; I had a little porter with them. I went home to my old lodgings, to one of Mr. Piper's men; I came to the Seven Stars, Pepper alley: Sculley came, I said I should like to have some beer as it is Saturday night; I called for a pot of beer and did not pay for it; I went to the chandler's shop at the corner for some bread and cheese, and when I came back Sculley was gone. Coming up Fenchurch street on Sunday I found a five pounds note: I changed it, and had three one pound notes part in change. I saw Mr. Piper's man, he told me Mr. Piper had been enquiring for me; I was going to Bear Quay. The rest of the money was my own.</p>

            . Q. What are you - A. I am shopman to Mr. Potter. On Friday the 16th of September, between the hours of five and six in the evening, Collins suspected a woman in the shop; a few minutes afterwards I went into the front shop and waited upon the prisoner myself; I sold her a towel for eight pence; she gave me a shilling and I gave her four-pence in change; she seemed very much confused and scarce knew what she was doing; she went out of the shop and I followed her; when she was out in the street I tapped her on the shoulder and desired her to step back; I thought she had got something she had not paid for; she immediately came into the shop, and between the pile of goods which stood in the shop and the counter, she let the goods fall from under her clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the goods - A. A piece of gingham, twenty eight yards, and a length of muslin, about four yards; I asked her if she knew any thing about them; she denied it; I immediately sent for a constable.</p>

            . Q. Did the last witness bring you the parcel to your master's waggon - A. Yes, he brought it and put it in the waggon in Wood street; I took the parcel and put it farther in the waggon; I am waggoner; I placed it as I thought it could not fall out; the waggon is wood at the bottom and rails at the side. I looked for the parcel when the last witness came back; it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when he went with the parcel - A. I turned the waggon round; and stood by it till he came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the parcel again - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time of the day was it - A. It was after dark, it might be half after six, or a little after seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the parcel since - A. I have seen it at Guildhall, I thought it was the same parcel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Can you read or write - A. I can. I am not much of a scholar.</p>
               <p>Q. The waggon was standing in an open street - A. Yes, in Wood street.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that he was gone, and before he returned again, had you been talking to any body during the time - A. No, I do not know that I spoke to any body; I did not perceive any body come to the waggon; I stood towards the hind part of the waggon; it was so dark that a person might have taken it out of the waggon without my seeing it.</p>

            . Q. You are a watchmaker living in Wood street - A. I am. I received the parcel from the last witness a little after six, it was not seven; I just cast the string from one end, I copied the address of Messrs. Simpson and Pitfold, and then I sent the child to inform them I particularly wanted to see them; the child says, there is a man looking in at the window; I said ask him what he wants; he opened the door and then vanished; either him or another came in a minute, when he began in a pitiful tone of voice, half crying, stooping his head, as though the light offended his sight; I had a large candle in my hand; I did not tell him that I saw the parcel, or knew any thing of it. I asked him the description of the parcel, begging him to come farther in the passage, I would get the parcel if it was there; he did not give me a satisfactory answer to that and several questions I put to him; I bid the girl shut the door; he stood with his feet in such a position that the child could not shut the door; he said, he hoped for God's sake I would give him the parcel, he should lose his place, and he employed it for the sake of his wife and family. Upon several questions which I put to him he could not describe the parcel which I had seen, when I peremptorily told the child to shut the door; at that moment he made a run from the door, I shoved the child back and pushed out, and with the candle in my hand I pursued him and cried stop thief; he took down Wood street, turned down Love lane, made a small turn to the right, and then to the left into Love lane again, where he was taken; I never lost sight of him; I once laid hold of his coat. I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe to his lordship what is the situation of your yard and the height of the wall - A. The side of my house is a common thoroughfare, next a small passage; my wall may be eight or nine, or ten feet, it is a common passage to Staining lane, Falcon square; it immediately leads from Wood street to Oat lane; it is called Bull Head passage.</p>

            . I live at Furnival's cellar and chop house. On the 12th of October, a little before eleven at night, I heard a call out of stop thief; I immediately ran up stairs; finding one door open on the stairs, that had no lock, and the other door which had a lock and chain round it broken and open also, on looking in I missed a rump of beef and two fowls; I immediately crossed the way, hearing a noise, towards Dyer's buildings; I met the prisoner in the possession of a gentleman, I immediately catched hold of the prisoner also, and brought him back to the foot of my stairs; the prisoner cried out I am not the man; presently the gentleman said you are the man, and you have broken my mouth, see whether he has not got something about him; I called my boy to see whether there was any fowl down on the ground; I looked and saw no fowl on the ground; that minute a fowl was picked up just by the prisoner's feet by the witness who catched the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260020"/>prisoner, and he hit him across the face with it; I immediately got the watchman and gave him in charge; I asked the witness to stop with him while I went down to get my hat; I walked slowly down behind them; I was about twenty yards from the watchhouse door when they let the prisoner go, I heard a voice say stop thief by two or three; I immediately ran into the road to see which way he had taken, he ran by me up Holborn, I turned and ran after him, he turned up Hatton Garden; I made a spring and hit him on the head with my fist, he tumbled; the watchman was running down, hearing the rattle spring; he tumbled over him, knocked me down; as I fell I turned round on my side and catched hold of the prisoner's leg till the watchman got up; we took him in custody again to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same man that you saw at your cellar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the minute before you looked and saw no fowl at all - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. You had not seen this man down in the cellar at all - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been out this day - A. I had been to market. I always take the meat out myself upon all occasion, except I am out, then I cut steaks and leave in the lobby till I am at home. I had seen the beef five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the man was brought back was there a number of persons about him - A. There was one of one side of him and one of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore from which the fowl dropped you cannot tell - A. My witness will tell.</p>
               <p>Q. This man, when he was before the magistrate was sent on board the tender, yet you have preferred your indictment - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker. I was coming down Holborn about a quarter before eleven on the 12th of October, I perceived six or seven, or more, men in a cluster, they were a little divided; I paused for a little while whether I should go on, thinking I was beset; I perceived a man go down the steps and put his hand into the larder, he took two fowls up by the two legs extremely leisurely and participated into the street rather sneakingly.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the beef - A. There were enough to take the beef, the beef was gone before. He took the fowls rather sneakingly and went into the street; when I advanced forward and asked him what he and with the man's fowls; he made no answer but run; his partner made a blow at me and cut me here; when I turned round after the man I returned the compliment; I ran after the prisoner, he took across Holborn and up Dyer's buildings; he returned back, there being no avenue up the buildings; on seeing him return down again I made a stop; at that moment as he was just at the point of my fingers I felt a violent blow from another man whom I did not see till the moment, which brought me to the ground; at that time there were several people assembled and he was got just round the corner of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the same man - A. I am positive, I had sufficient view of him through the side of the larder; I took him across the way with the assistance of a person, I was met by the person who gave his evidence last.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the cellar with him - A. I did, and there I picked up a fowl from between his legs, which I judged he had dropped: he had thrown a fowl prior to that at me.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not see him drop it - A. No, I felt something by my feet.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not drop it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had thrown one fowl at you - A. Yes; that was at my first start before he was got to the watch-house: there was a set of them who made the watchman fall, who rescued him; the man that particularly rescued him, I took, and had the watchmen done their duty more of them would have been taken. One of the watchmen on seeing me so bloody, said, I had enough of it, he had no notion of being cut.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. It was in the night time when you was coming down Holborn; you saw several persons - A. Yes; they were all ragamuffins like himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when the man went down stairs his back was towards you - A, No; he went down as crabs walk, side ways; if he had tried to make his face conspicuous he could not have done it more, the light shined fully upon it.</p>
               <p>COURT. What became of the fowl - A. After I had picked it up I gave it to the prosecutor.</p>

On the evening that I am charged with the robbery I had been in Chancery lane spending the evening with a few friends; I passed through Chancery lane into Dyer's buildings, and when I came to the end of Dyer's buildings the gentleman dragged me over the way; that gentleman swore that I was the person and that he saw me at the larder; I told him he was wrong; when the watchman had got me in his possession, his mouth was bleeding, and several people said at the watchhouse I was not the person and they pushed me away.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the sentence passed upon him - A. Sentence of death, but by the indulgence of his Majesty he was ordered to be transported for life; he went away in January, 1807; he went down to Woolwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the bar - A. I did, at the same place where he stands now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. After I was convicted at this bar my friends petitioned to colonel Frazier for my pardon; colonel Frazier got me a free pardon, it was not a conditional pardon. I after that went into the loyal York rangers, that afterwards went to Trinidad in the West Indies; I had liberty to go on shore at Portsmouth to see some of my comrades, but staying on shore too long I was afraid of being punished by the regiment, and by his Majesty's proclamation every deserter was to be accepted on board as a deserter; captain Read of Woolwich, can prove I had his Majesty's free pardon.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a housekeeper - A. I have a house at four shillings a week; a room below and room above; I live in the under room myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the owner of the house - A. Mr. Parker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hire it of him - A. Yes; my brother pays part of the rent to me, he has his own bed and furniture; I pay the rent all together. Mr. Parker is a pawnbroker in Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your way of life - A. I sold cakes and oysters while I was able. I laid up eight dollars, four half crowns, a seven shilling piece, and half a guinea; in all three pounds seven shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you put this money and when had you seen it last - A. The week that she come to me, I put it in a mattress that was upon my bed; she came upon a Monday and asked me for a lodging; I said I had no lodging; she said it was only for a night or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known her before - A. I had known her for about a month, she used to buy one little thing or other of me; the first night she came to me I was taken very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know where your money was put - A. She made the bed while I was ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she in making the bed discover the money - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it that she must know that the money was there - A. It was in that purse, and I sewed the purse to the mattress that it should not go astray from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then any body in tumbling this mattress about would have found that this money was there - A. Yes. On Wednesday following the Monday she came, she went and got a letter from the dispensary for me; then on Wednesday I was getting better and she sat up and gave me the medicines, and by the means of making my bed and going to the dispensary on the Monday following; she then asked leave to stop in my place while I went to the dispensary; that was the opportunity she took the money; then when I came back there was a jacket left by a baker for me to mend; she told me of it and asked my leave to lay on the bed; I went out a quarter after ten and was home at a quarter after eleven, and she lay till five o'clock; at four o'clock I go out with my cakes; I awaked her, she went out along with me between four and five; I was home in an hour's time, and as soon as I came home I saw the bed towzled and undone; I went and put the bed away then; there was the mattress and an empty purse to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the bed was tumbled when you went out at half after four - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you search then to see if any thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260022"/>thing was missing - A. I made no search at half past four. She had a bundle in her apron, and I thought she had been looking for it. When I came home I searched and missed my money she did not return that night; at eight o'clock the next morning she came in and sat down; I said to her Mrs. Glover give me the money you took from under my bed; she said I am deaf, I am hard of hearing; I said if you are deaf I will send for an officer; Ray came and made her hear; she said she did not know any thing about it; I said who have you let in to rob me while I was out; I got up in a passion out of the chair, she pulled me down in the chair again, put her hand into her pocket and took out two shillings and threepence and put it in my lap; says she that is all I have, I will pay you by the week or month when I get in place; she wanted me to make a debt of the robbery; I said I would not make a debt of it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention the sum you had lost - A. I did, three pounds seven shillings and sixpence; I mentioned what dollars I had lost; a seven shilling piece and half a guinea. Then Mr. Ray came; before he came she opened her box and put on velvet shoes, and dressed herself very fine, I never saw a stitch of them before; while I was at the dispensary she went to the pawnbrokers and got these things in.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship street, Shoreditch; I was sent to take this prisoner in custody upon Tuesday; when I went to the prosecutrixs house I found the prisoner there; she begged for mercy, and stated that she had robbed her, and the moment she got in service she would return the money to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the old woman by then - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the old woman state what she had lost - A. Yes, eight dollars, a seven shilling piece, and a half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in answer to that statement of the old woman, that she had this loss, that this answer was given - that she would make it up when she got in service - A. It was; I examined what they call the ticking, which the old woman has got here, where the hole has been cut.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is the hole she cut; I never made my bed without feeling it; it was there that morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say further, than if I was dying this moment before the gentlemen, her brother had a key, and wished God would strike her dead for the report; and I said if I was in place I would take pity upon her, but I could not; here is a pair of shoes I bought at Mr. Lindo's, they are lasting shoes, not what she says.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know her husband's name is James - A. I never heard her mention her husband's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree about the lodging - A. Yes; she asked me if she could see the apartment; I shewed her the two pair of stairs back room, she approved of it very much, and asked the price; I told her five shillings a week; she agreed to pay the price for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What furniture was in the room - A. There was a carpet on the floor, bed and bed furniture, sheets and counterpane; she came down into the shop, she said then she had no money in her pocket: I had not asked her for earnest, I asked her where I could go for her character; she told me that she came to town that night, and slept at a public house in Holborn; by her appearance I took her in without a character, as she was well dressed; she pulled a silver spoon from her pocket and gave it me for earnest; she said she was very cold, she had a little girl with her at the time; my wife asked her if she would have some porter and some bread and cheese; she sat the best part of an hour, then she asked what time she was to come to the room; she went away, and said she was going to her husband to get some money; in about two hours she come back again; then she asked for the key of the room, it was given to her; she went up stairs, staid about half an hour, and then came down to know where the water but was, and went up into her apartment again. I did not see any more of her that night; that was about four o'clock; this was on the fourteenth; she took the lodgings on the next day, Thursday, in the morning; she came down two or three times with a round basket, with a cover on it; when she came to take possession she brought nothing but the basket and the little girl; she came down two or three times with the hand basket that day; she did not return that night; I did not see any more of her till she was taken by the constable; she was only there one night. On Saturday morning about nine o'clock I went up stairs, the door was locked and the key taken out; I had a recollection that I had a key that would open the door; I tried it and opened it with that key, and missed the property mentioned in the indictment; the bed furniture had been nailed, and the nails laid on the mahogany table in the room; a pair of sheets and a counterpane was gone; a pawnbroker's duplicate laid on the carpet of the sheet and a counterpane pawned at Mr. Merritt's the corner of Marybone street; I went there the same day. I found the counterpane and one sheet; I never found the bed furniture and the other sheet. I know the counterpane and sheet to be mine, they are here; I am certain of her person.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. I never saw her till the 24th of September last, she was in custody.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>- CROCKER. I am a constable of the parish of St. Pancras. I apprehended the prisoner on the 24th of September last: I took her to Mr. Carpenter's, they said this was the woman that had robbed them.</p>

On the 18th of August I let her a lodging, a two pair of stairs back room; she said she worked at the upholstery work; we agreed that she was to have the room at four shillings and sixpence a week; she came to take possession on the 19th, and lived in the room three weeks and a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what day she was missing - A. Some day in September, I cannot exactly say when; my husband opened the door of the room, we missed all the articles in the indictment. I have seen all the things again but the glass and the bolster.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BIRKBECK. Q. After the prisoner was gone did you go in the room that she lodged in - A. Yes; I had another key. I have seen some of the things that were missing. I saw the prisoner in about a week or ten days after she absconded, in Smart's buildings, Holborn; I asked her what she had done with the things; she said she had sold them, she said she could tell me to whom she had sold them, but she wished to make it up with her, as she had got in work; I asked her what she had done with the glass; I prized the the glass very much and should like to have it again; she told me where she had sold it; the person whom she sold it to said they had sold it.</p>

Mr. Smith, the man, and me, found the cart standing standing at the man's door; his name is Humphry, he lives in Gray's inn lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of grains had been put in it before you left it and went away to inform Mr. Smith - A. About a couple of sacks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Whether there were grains in the cart when they first began to shovel them, you do not know - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. My question is whether you were present when these grains were put in the cart - A. No; we have them from Gifford's; I pay for them three shillings a quarter; eight bushels makes a quarter. Humphry is run away. The horse and cart are in the yard; one claimed the horse and another the cart; the magistrate thought it not proper to give them up.</p>

I was, at eight o'clock at night, or a little after; I had been drinking some beer, I was quite sober; I had two bundles with me, they were laying on the tap room table; I brought one bundle out of the city and the other out of the City road; the bundle contained things for my wife to wash; the bundle that I lost was two shirts, two waistcoats, and a pair of nankeen trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there - A. The prisoner was in the house drinking there; she was sitting at the same side of the house as I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you much acquainted with her - A. No otherwise than she lived in the same parish in Islington. I cannot say where she lived then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she sit by the side of you - A. I cannot exactly say; she went out several times during the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What stay had you yourself made in the house before you got up to go away - A. I might be there an hour or two; it was about dusk when I came in, and it was a little after eight when I got up to come away; the prisoner was not there then.</p>
               <p>Q. On missing this bundle what steps did you take - A. I made but little enquiry that evening; the next morning I went after her and found her in Dyot street with part of the property wrapped up in her apron. I had no information that led me there; but going round to the pawnbrokers, I stopped the prisoner and asked her where the remainder of the property was. I found upon her a shirt and a pair of nankeen trowsers; I took them from her; she said the remainder was in pawn. She went to Mr. Hinckesman with me, and there I found the remainder of the property - two waistcoats and a shirt.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in company with the prosecutor, drinking with him at the Bluecoat Boy. I left my prosecutor and went out; I was met by a young man in Holborn with this bundle; he asked me to go and pledge the things, which I did; part of the property which I had on me he left me; when the prosecutor met me I gave it to him; he asked me where the other part of the property was, and I told him.</p>

I went to both Lower and Upper Thames street, I could not find any one; on the Wednesday I took him before the lord mayor, he was committed till the Saturday, and the coat was ordered to be advertised by his lordship; Mr. Nowlan came forward and proved his property before the lord mayor.</p>

            . I am a butcher, I live in Swallow street, Piccadilly; she stole a piece of mutton on the 10th of October, between six and seven in the evening; as she past the shop she took it up and put it under her arm; I ran after her, fetched her back, and took it from her. I called my master, he came in and sent her about her business; then she turned the corner into Glasshouse street and cut off a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. That you have nothing to do with - how came you to prosecute her after your master told her to go about her business - A. After he found she stole the handkerchief then he prosecuted her; the mutton was worth about one and nine pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this butcher' shop to buy a piece of meat, I smelled at it to see whether it was sweet; it was not sweet; he took the meat out of my hand and turned me out, and I jawed him; a gentleman and lady were in the shop; I do not think he would have done it else. I stood with my barrow at the corner of Glasshouse street; he was obliged to broil the meat to take it down to Marlborough street, because it was not sweet. I only took it up and smelled at it: he said go along, you Irish faggot.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was a parcel of people about their door; I stood by my barrow; my barrow was at the corner; I run over; this young woman knows me, I suppose; she says, you Irish faggot, it is you; she pitched upon me; I went down with them to the watchhouse and there they kept me, and that is all I know, so help me God. I left all my fruit there to a wide world, a bushel of walnuts and a bushel of pears. Mr. Brooks was obliged to come behind her and tell her what to say. I know nothing of that handkerchief; may I drop down dead if I had a knife or scissars about me.</p>

            . I am nurse to Mr. Hutson; when I came down stairs I missed the tub from the bench in the washhouse, it was between nine and ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the washhouse - backwards or forwards - A. Forwards, right facing the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. So that any body going by might see the washing tub - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed it between nine and ten - when had you seen it before - A. About half after eight; I went down with Mr. Ladkoe to Mrs. Lomax and there I saw the tub and owned it; it was exposed to sale out of doors; I can swear to the tub being Mr. Hutson's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I go out charing; I was going across Clerkenwell Green to clean an empty house down, a genteel woman in the street, asked me to go and sell this tub: she would give me sixpence if I would go to that shop, and she stopped on the opposite side of the way; I went, and when I returned to her, I told her the broker's husband was not at home; she asked me to go into the public house and have part of a pint of beer; I did, and went out again for some bread and cheese; when I came back she was gone; I asked the servant, where the woman was; I could not learn; I came out again and went down to the broker's to see whether the broker's husband was come back or not; the woman told me the tub was stolen; I told her I was innocent of stealing the tub; I know no more than what I have told you. My husband is on board a man of war; I made all the enquiry I could about that woman, I could not find her.</p>

            ; the other I never saw before last Thursday week. Brown lived in Catherine Wheel alley; I lived in the Mint in the Bosough when I first knew him; I have known him these three years. I had not seen him for a year and a half before.</p>
               <p>Q. You were going to say something about last Thursday - A. Yes. On Thursday the 20th, between ten and eleven o'clock, I saw Brown and Puplett at my house, they came together; Brown asked me to go and pledge him a waistcoat; I made answer, I would not go to the pawnbrokers for myself, neither would I go for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Brown had not been with you before he came with Puplett - A. No. Upon my refusing to pawn the waistcoat, he said he would sell it outright; I said to him he never could keep any thing tidy upon his back.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him so well as to tell him that - A. Yes; he lodged with us when I lived the other side of the water; a young man was sitting in my house that came from over the water; he asked him to buy it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260034"/>he did, and gave him four shillings for it. Puplett said he would sell the handkerchief off his neck; the young man said he did not want to buy it; then they both went out of my place together; it was near eleven o'clock when they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more of them - A. Not till seven o'clock in the evening, then Brown and Puplett came in together; Brown asked me to go and take a glass of gin; I refused; he persuaded me at last; I went with him; they both came out of my place, and I went with Brown as far as the Bee Hive.</p>
               <p>Q. Your errand that you went with these two men, was to go and have some gin, was it - A. Yes. I went out of the house with them and left only my three children in the house; they were just put to bed; the oldest is about thirteen years old.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you leave your door - A. I shut the door and latched it with an iron latch; I fastened the latch, I did not lock it. As I was going to drink the gin with them at the corner of the dock, the Bee Hive, I missed Puplett.</p>
               <p>Q. How far may the Bee Hive be from your house - A. About a hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss either of the men as you went along to the Bee Hive - A. I missed Puplett; I said, Robert where is the young man; Brown said, making use of a bad expression, there was more gin for him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say it was the outer door you latched - A. Yes. Brown and I proceeded to get this gin at the house; Brown called for a quartern of gin, I poured out the first glass and gave it him; he drank it; and then I missed him. I did not see him go out. Then I drank my own gin and came out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that take - A. I was absent from my own place and returned to it in twenty minutes; after having drank my liquor I returned to my own home; it then was between light and dark. I had lit a candle before I came out.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know what time it was - A. It was seven o'clock when I came out, and it was twenty minutes after seven when I came home; I cannot speak to a minute; it was twenty minutes after seven when I looked at Mrs. Allen's clock, a woman close by, and when I missed my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not call by the way any where - A. No, the moment I got inside my door, I missed a feather bed, a bolster, a pillow, a pair of sheets, two cotton shirts, and a coat belonging to my husband; I have never seen any of them since; they were all taken off the bedstead in my room below. I have a room below and a room above, where my children sleep.</p>

            's, in the same alley. On Thursday the 20th of this month, about ten or twenty minutes past seven in the evening, the candles and the lamps were lit at the time; I had a candle lighted, and so had the opposite neighbour.</p>
               <p>Q. How light was it out of doors - could you distinguish a person's face without the lamps - A. No, not without the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q.What lamps were there in the alley - A. There was one at one end and one at the other.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the length of the alley - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. But you live in that alley, and your house is about fifty yards in the alley from Mrs. Lindo's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there many houses from your house - A. No, because there is a yard between; a gentleman keeps beasts there.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the alley did you observe any thing - A. I was coming out of my own alley; I met the two prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by your own alley - A. My door stands up a little court; there are two or three little places in Swan alley; I was going to the chandler's shop, the prisoners were coming out of Swan alley to go into East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that in a direction to Lindo's house. - A. No, coming from it; I did not see them come out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them before - A. No, I never saw either of them before. I am sure it is the two prisoners, the short man had a brown coat on; their faces were towards me; I swear positively to the two prisoners at the bar. The tall man had a light drab coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them any thing with them - A.John Puplett, the short one, had something tied up in a bundle on his head; they walked a breast up the alley leading into East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not speak to them, nor they to you - A. No, I only noticed them as they passed me; I saw Puplett the next day at Lambeth street office, he was in custody; I saw Brown some days after at the office; I pointed them out; when I went in I saw

            , I said that was the man that I saw with the bundle the over night; I pointed out Brown; I saw them when they were locked up with other men; I pointed them out without any person saying any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Brown. I wish to know how she could know me from another man in a drab coat - A. I was not three yards from the lamp, and there was a light in the window of a woman that had fruit in the window to sell.</p>
               <p>Puplett. She swore to me that I had a blue coat with white buttons - A. No; I said in candle light I could not be certain, because at candle light it varies; it was either a blue coat or a brown.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you say what time it was - A. Just before Spital fields bell struck out eight; I heard Robert Brown, or Briggs, which is all one, say, make haste, it is all clear; then I saw a man come out of Brown's house, with a bed on his back, as I supposed by the bulk; the bundle was tied up in a flowered counterpane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that other man was - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Brown and the other man - A. They went down into Whitechapel, they walked pretty fast;

             I know by living in the court; Puplett I do not know; the other man was a short man in a brown coat; Brown had the same coloured coat on he has now.</p>

               <p>COURT. If I understand you, you do not speak at all to Puplett, but on the contrary you think it was a stouter man than him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Brown. She says it only came out of my house; I am only a lodger, whether it came out of my room or their room.</p>
               <p>Witness. Brown lives in the lower room; I see it come out of the door of the house where he lodges; I did not see what room it came out of.</p>
               <p>ROBERT COMBES. I am one of the officers of Lambeth street office. On Thursday night the 20th of this month, the prosecutrix came to me about ten o'clock at night, and told me that she had been robbed of a bed; I immediately went with her into Sugar Loaf court, where the prisoner Brown lived, I knew he lived there; there I found Puplett along with two women; he was in Brown's room; the ground room of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Brown there at that time - A. He was not. The prosecutrix declared to me that was the man that was along with Brown at her house that evening; I searched him in the room and found eight shillings and six pence in money upon him, which I returned him; he told me that he had been playing at skittles, at the Catherine Wheel, the whole of the afternoon untill it was dark; I then took him over to the Catherine Wheel and asked the people of the house if he had been playing at skittles; they declared they had not seen him; he said he had, though they might not have seen him; the woman then said there had been no skittle playing the whole of that afternoon. I secured him. Smith, my brother officer, took

            . Q. You are an officer of Lambeth street - A. I am, I apprehended the prisoner Brown on the 21st. In consequence of information Miller and me went to Catherine Wheel alley; I went into the Catherine Wheel and desired Miller to go into Brown's to see if he was there; it is a few yards from the door of the Catherine Wheel where he lives,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Miller return - A. Yes, in about half a minute they returned and I took him from Miller, he was secured; he would not go with Miller; Miller threatened to shoot him, so I took him in custody; I searched him, I found nothing on him but a few halfpence and a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. In what condition was this bed of yours - how long had you had it - A. Between five and six years; my mother told me, when she gave it me, she gave five guineas for it; I know no more than she told me so; the sheets were worth about seven shillings, I had them about a twelve month; one of the cotton shirts was new, I gave four shillings and sixpence for it, the other was old; my husband's coat was worth about four or five shillings.</p>
               <p>Puplett's Defence. I went to the prosecutor's house on Thursday the 20th, and this Brown offered his waistcoat for sale; they could not agree, they offered him four shillings for it; he would not take it; he came out and I came out with him; I did not go in any more; afterwards he went in and left the waistcoat, and brought out the money; I then went home to Brown's place; I dined there, and we set drinking there till twenty minutes after four o'clock, when I went into the Catherine Wheel public house, and Brown with me. Brown left me about six o'clock, and I sat drinking there till about a quarter before seven; I then crossed over the way to Brown's house, and there I sat till the officer came in and apprehended me; I saw no more of Brown that night, nor he of me.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. Pease you my lord, I was in the habit of going to the prosecutrix very often, and she has been inveterate against me ever since I would not live with her. Please your lordship, she ran away from her husband, and came to me; on which I hid her for one week; she and her child, a girl she has got; I cannot but say my lord, I was very fond of the woman at that time; she took a lodging, a two pair of stairs room at a public house, the front chamber; and the reason that I left her was upon account of this baby; one day she was at the door, I goes to the child, it past for my own; I said come in miss; she stood and stamped and said you are not my daddy, I will go home to my daddy; my prosecutrix is the mother belonging to the child. I said to her, Nance, I will not be with you any more; she said why will not you, Robert; I told her I was never so much ashamed in my life as when the child stamped in the street, and said I was not the father of it; and I passed for the child's father; I had four shillings to pay for the week's rent; I gave it to Mrs. Lindo, upon that, to pay for it; it was a ready furnished lodgings; then I left her. I was some time after happening to go by the same public house in Bermondsey street, Tooley street, the woman of the public house says, halloa master, you run away without paying your rent; I said no, I have not. I told her I left the money with my wife; she said she understood it was not my wife, it was another man's wife, and her husband was a carman. That is the last time ever I had any connection with her, except when I went to sell the waistcoat and taking a drop of gin with her. I should like to know how long she has taken to washing and left off her own trade.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. You say you wash - A. Yes, and I go out cleaning; I used to follow rabbit skin cutting, for the hatters; my husband did not approve of my going so far from where I live. I was never away from my husband one night in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You have got you say three children - is there any truth in his saying that the child passed for his - A. No, I never lived with him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think of drinking gin with him - A. He intruded upon me, and I told him before I went out my husband would be angry with me; I dare say he asked me a dozen times before I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you refuse at last - A. I did, but he almost forced me; I had not seen him for a great while but the Sunday before; he came to our house, we drank together.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had seen him the Sunday before - A. Yes, but he did not stop at my place above five minutes; no longer than while the gin was fetched.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time in the beginning of this month lose any half boot - A. I missed it on Tuesday the 4th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that half boot before you missed it - A. It laid in the shop under the cutting board, about four feet from the door. On the Wednesday I was down in my cellar of the adjoining house cutting my bottom stuff, I saw the prisoner go on the street with it on his leg; he has but one leg, the other is a wooden leg; I ran up stairs and stepped before him; I said my man pray where did you come by that half boot; he hesitated for a moment and coloured, and then he said he bought it of a man in Newgate market, that came with a waggon twice a week; I asked him if he knew the man; he said, yes; I wished him to take the boot off his leg, he did; I fetched the fellow to it, they happened to be companions; then I hesitated a few moments and fetched Mr. Ekelsoe, the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect who the prisoner said he had this boot of - A. Yes, he said it was from a country person that came up twice a week with a waggon to Newgate market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he should know him - A. Yes. I went with him on the Saturday morning following; he said that was one of the days the man came up. After looking over Newgate market, he could not find any person that he could describe; then he told me he should not know the man if he was to see him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Newgate market on Tuesday morning; a countryman in a smock frock says<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260037"/>to me, my friend I have got an odd half boot, I bought a pair, and by moving my things I have lost one; he asked me seven shillings for it; I told him I would give him five shillings and sixpence for it; he said I should have it; I gave him six shillings, and he gave me a six pence; I brought it home with me and put it on, after I had my breakfast. On the Wednesday evening I was going for a pail of grains, the prosecutor asked me where I got the boot; I told him; I was not afraid to go back with him, I had bought it innocently; he brought the boot forward he has now, and then he sent to Hatton garden office for an officer, and took me in custody.</p>

            , Old Compton street; I live at 38, Boswell court, Red Lion square. On Monday morning the 3d of October, about half past six, I met a man coming down Greek street with a copper on his shoulder. I did not take particular notice of him, but I went on to my work; - going along Soho square I met the prisoner, he was standing by the rails of 27, Soho square; there was another man shutting the door of 27. After the man had shut the door, he spoke to the prisoner and pretended as if he had something in his hand to shew the prisoner; they walked in company together and went down Bateman's buildings; I goes a little further towards my work, I met a young man who is here; we pursued the man with the copper, and they met us again in Greek street, the corner of King street; the man that had the copper on his shoulder, he went down Greek street into Litchfield street; the prisoner and the other man followed in the same direction with the man with the copper; one went of one side of the way and the other on the other; - the man with the copper knocked at a door in Litchfield street, one Mr. Sholey lives there, he is a brass founder; the door was opened to him immediately; I was about half a dozen doors off; at that time the prisoner and his companion stood about two doors off; I went up to the door as fast as I could; directly I went up to the door the man was coming out of the house, he had left the copper in the house; I directly catched hold of him by the collar, and said he was my prisoner; he asked me what for; I told him for taking the copper, for he had stolen it; he up with his fist and struck me on my right side, gave himself a wrench, and got away from me; these other two men walked into Grafton street, we ran after them, and the man run in between his companion and the prisoner; he whispered something to them; I called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they attempt to stop him - A. No, they did not; he ran off, I pursued him, he went down West street, Seven Dials, there are a great many alleys there. I lost him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your companion, the young man that gave you some information - A. He was running after him, I believe; I was going back to lay a detainer upon the copper; I met the prisoner close up against the brass founder's door; he was making that way, at least directly he saw me, before I could speak to him, he ran off as hard as he could down Porter street and into Newport market; I pursued him and cried out stop thief; he was stopped in Newport market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he still keep running when he heard you cry stop thief - A. I catched him in Newport market; some butcher stopped him; I asked him what he ran away for when he saw me, he said he understood me I would put him in the watchhouse for not stopping the other man; I took him to the watchhouse. I then went to Mr. Sholey's to look after the copper, I saw nobody but his son, he was not dressed.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find the copper that the man left there - A. Yes, I did; there were two other coppers there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man put down the copper - A. I did not; I saw him come along the passage from the shop, I found the copper in the shop; I put a mark on the copper, and left it there till eleven o'clock; when we went up to the magistrate I fetched it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the copper to No. 27, and put it to the place where you supposed it to be taken from - A. I did; it fitted exactly; it had been raised up from the place; the mortar at the top was a little broken; I made a lid for it about six months ago; I am sure it was affixed there; I knew the man that came out of the house to be a suspicious character, the man that came out while the prisoner was standing by the side of the rails.</p>
               <p>Q. What would be the worth of such a copper as that - A. I am sure it would be worth twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You never saw the prisoner join company with the man that had the copper - A. No; only when the man that had the copper run in between these two.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean to swear to this copper - A. Yes, I do; the others were not quite so fresh.</p>
               <p>JAMES HATHAWAY. I am a carpenter; I work for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260038"/>Mr. Offer in Litchfield street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the last witness - A. Yes; I was in the square first; I saw two men standing at the corner of Greek street, leaning against the rails of No. 27, Soho square; the prisoner is one that was leaning against the rails; these two men walked up and down; one went to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the prisoner or the other man - A. The other man; another man was coming by, and he came away from the door while the man was coming.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person bring a copper out of the house - A. Yes; this man went to the door again and the door was opened to him, he went in; the prisoner at the bar was left outside; I run down Sutton street, the other side of the square, to acquaint our workmen that they were robbing the house; they would not assist; I turned back again, and the man that I saw go in, he came out with a copper on his shoulder and another man after him; the man that came out with the copper went down Greek street, the other man that came out after had a conversation with the prisoner, and they went down Bateman's buildings; I ran to the other witness and told him what I had seen; we followed them; the man with the copper went into Litchfield street; he went into Sholey's, No. 27, a brass founder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether the prisoner and the other man followed the man with the copper; I turned my head round to see where the other men were; the man that had the copper came out; the other men were in Grafton street, he ran through them. I could not observe whether he spoke to them or not; we cried out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they attempt to stop him - A. No, we did not succeed in catching the man with the copper; coming back we saw the prisoner near Mr. Sholey's; he saw us, he run down Porter street into Newport market; we halloaed out stop thief; the butchers stopped him.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming through Soho square, I lit of the man they have mentioned; he asked me about my brother; I told him he was in the country; he asked me which way I was going; I told him I was going to Covent Garden; he said if you will stop a few minutes I will go along with you, I am going that road; he said I am going into that house there, that was the corner of Soho square; he went in and stopped a few minutes: he came back to me, and he and I walked down Bateman's buildings towards Covent Garden; at that time I left him and bid him good bye; I saw the two men come by; they halloaed out stop him, but I did not stop him; with that they came up to me; I understood they said stop him, because I did not stop the other man; I ran.</p>

               <p>Q. Did that turn out to be the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body lodge with the prisoner - A. They said a man lodged with him; the prisoner did not say any thing: I asked him what he did with the rest of them, there was one in the house and no more; he said he did not know any thing about them; it was tied up in an apron the fowl was; that apron appeared to be the prisoner's apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whose apron it was - A. The prisoner is a carpenter; he said his apron was at the washerwoman's; I asked the washerwoman, she said this apron was his.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you know at that time that Covent garden theatre was on fire - A. I saw it was on fire, and heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop him - A. No, I did not take any notice of him first of all; he had passed me thirty yards before I took any notice; I should not have taken any notice then if he had not let the box fall on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that appear to you to be by accident or design - A. It was an accident; the box fell down, and the side was broken in, and the money fell out; he took up the box and put it on his shoulder again. I followed him up Wells street.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260041"/>Q. Did you hear the money jingle on the pavement - A. Yes; he did not stop to pick it up; the working men picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask the working men for the money that picked it up - A. No, he set off and left it, in the direction of Castle street, towards the market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run or walk - A. He walked pretty sharp, he did not run, and by holding the box on his shoulder the bundle got loose; a gown, petticoat, and a blue jacket, were hanging down under his arm; I went up to him and said, my friend, I think you have been to the fire at Covent Garden; he said what was that to me, or something of that sort; then I looked at at him and took him by the collar, I saw he had a very fine shirt, and a black silk handkerchief in his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean besides the shirt he wore - A. Yes, and a black silk handkerchief besides. I asked him where he was going to with the box; he said to No. 3, in Margaret court, Cavendish square; I told him there was no court of that name near Cavendish square, I have known Cavendish square well, near forty years; there is one of that name at the corner of Oxford market. I believe I told him then, as he seemed to be so saucy, I would take him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him there was no such court as Margaret court near Cavendish square, what did he say, did he correct himself, and say I mean Margaret court, near the market - A. I will not be positive whether he did or not explain it at Oxford market. When I told him he should go the watchhouse with me, he threw down the box and said, then you shall carry it; I took him by the collar, and called my partner, Hughes, to carry the box; Hughes carried the box. I took him to Marylebone watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing as he was going along - A. No, nothing particular past then. I delivered him up to the constable, and left him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the shirt and with the black handkerchief - A. They are in the box, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. You have not told us all - A. I have told you all.</p>
               <p>Q. I know you have not told us all, because he told you that he brought the things from the fire - A. He told me that he brought the things from the fire! he never told me so.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said to him, I think you have been to the fire at Covent Garden, you said, he said what is that to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In your deposition you said he said they had been given him by some person at the fire - A. I never said so, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You have not only said it but swore it - I have just another question to ask you - He was very drunk, was not he - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your attention called to him by his staggering about - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he, as he passed you, appear to be a drunken man - A. No; I did not observe it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. He let the box fall, and the end of the box was broke by the fall, and several shillings fell out, and he did not take any notice to stop and pick them up - you saw him pick up the box and not the shillings - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then when he took up the box, down fell the bundle - A. I do not think he was quite sober, but he was not so drunk but that he could carry the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sober now - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. Are you a watchman - A. Yes; my station was at the corner of Titchfield street. On the morning of the fire at Covent Garden, I was calling half past five going down Castle street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far down Castle street does your beat extend - A. To the corner of Adam and Eve court, not quite so far as Well street. I saw the prisoner come with a box on his shoulder, and the watchman after him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoner had your partner hold of him - A. No, he was following of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the last witness - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw him with the box did he appear to you to be in a state of drunkenness - A. He walked sturdy enough to carry the box, but he did not appear to be quite sober. When he came from the opposite side of the street, my partner laid hold of him and told him he should go with him to the watch-house; he said if he was to go to the watchhouse he should carry the box, and he hove the box down; my partner collared him and then called me to carry the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account while you were by where he got the box from - A. Not while I was by; I put the box on my shoulder and carried it to the watchhouse and there left the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he reel at all - A. Not before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Did he walk straight - A. He walked so straight that he carried the box.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not an answer - A. He did not appear to me to be sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he walk straight - A. He did walk straight so far as the corner of Castle street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he walk straight all the time you saw him - A. He did, from the corner of Adam and Eve court to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I dare say you had made him sober then - from the first time that you saw him, to the time that you took him to the watchhouse, did he walk straight - A. He did not come five yards before my partner laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for those five yards did he appear to walk straight - A. He did appear to walk straight.</p>

            . I am watchhouse keeper to St. Marylebone. I searched the prisoner; I found upon him a habit shirt and a bit of a silver spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any black silk handkerchief - A. No, that was in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the habit shirt - A. That was in his pocket and the spoon too, I believe; when I pulled the habit shirt out the spoon dropped down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be sensible - A. Yes; he was sensible; he was rather in liquor; he said they were given him at Mr. Salter's, Covent Garden; he wanted me to go in the morning and let Mr. Salter know, and likewise for to go to Margaret's court, Oxford market; he said the people that lived there were relations.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you who he was and where he lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260042"/>- A. He told me to go to his wife in Stanhope street, Clare market, in a court there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was not he like a person, though very improper, that had been sitting up all night drinking - A. Why he seemed stupid from liquor, and for want of sleep.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the house drinking gin and water at the same time the alarm of fire began; I cannot saw whether it was her or another that put the box down by the side of the glass, and shoved the glass down; I was dozing, and their shoving the glass down awoke me. Mrs. Graham was in the house, she said for God's sake take this box and bundle and go off with the servant; I was so drunk I could not tell what I did; I took as much care of the box as I could in my druken state, and gave answer where I lived, and desired them to send down to Mr. Salter's immediately.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it - A. Five weeks yesterday. The prisoner said when he went the hour of four o'clock the gentleman's hat and shoes were on, and when he had done calling the hour of four o'clock the hat and shoes were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. to Crocker. Do you know the prosecutor - A. I know him by sight; he is not here.</p>
               <p>MR. BIRCH. I passed by the Roebuck public house kept by Mr. Stanwell, in Tottenham Court road; I heard a watchman say there was a man genteely dressed on the pavement: I went over, I saw him laying without his hat and shoes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you suffer her to take the pot - A. Yes. I asked her in what part of the house she was going to take the pot to; she told me in the next room to Mrs. Diner; she left my house, and I saw her take the pot out of the house; that was on Saturday evening she had the pot. On Sunday morning the man called for the pot, the pot was not to be found. A man came and asked me if I had lost any pots; I told him I had lost one; he told me if I would go to Hatton garden office I should see them.

               <p>Q. Did you ask Hayes where she lived, and how she got her living - A. Yes; she first said that she lived in Drury lane; I wanted to know the number, I told her if she did not give an account of herself I would send her to prison. I have kept the pots ever since.</p>

Yes; I stood at the street door; there was a mob round the door, I heard the young one, Cline, say, they had not found any thing upon the prisoner Hayes, they might as well let her go; the publican's son said then, there was another woman; he went to see her; I said, by her discourse I think she is a companion with her; he and I took her into the back parlour, and we took these five quart pots away from her clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say when they were charged as being companions - A. The old one said pray let my daughter go and keep me.</p>

I told him I did not like to buy a coat without seeing it.

               <p>Q. Did you lose any fowls at any time - A. Yes. On Wednesday, the 26th of October, about twenty minutes before ten, I was going to bed; the fowls roost in a little shed adjoining this ground; as I was going to bed, I let a friend out who had been at my house; there was some paving by my house; my son came out of door and looked over these stones, and said, father, the fowl house is broken open; the fowl house door was open; I had set two pieces of timber against it; I went down to the door; as soon as I got into the ground, it lies below the street, I saw the door open; I told my son to call a watchman; the prisoner rushed out, he says d - n your eyes, if you pretend to stop me I will do for you; he had a kind of a chisel in his hand, which I believe we can produce. I asked him what business he had there; he had got a bundle in his hand, which, I believe, was the fowls; I got a little bit out of his reach that he might not strike me, and turned him the way the watchman was; I followed him, he stumbled and I stumbled; he got the advantage of me, and got up first; he was at last stopped by

               <p>Q. You have got the weapon in your hand - A. Yes, this is it; it is a mortice chisel. My son catched him, he struck my son; as soon as I came up I knocked him down, and going along I found the old cock in a little shed, where he just popped in and turned out again.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the same sort of a thing in his hand when he threatened you - A. Yes. After we took him to the watchhouse we went back to the fowl shed, we missed two cock fowls, and three hen fowls; then we traced the path along which he had run; my son and Mr. Butler pointed out the garden where he jumped, and there the four fowls were found tied up in a black handkerchief, with their neck's wrung; they were dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they warm at that time - A. I do not recollect. The fifth fowl I found before I went to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in the garden, and in the course he had taken, you found all the five fowls - A. Yes; I have got them here.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose handkerchief was that - A. We took it to be the prisoner's; he had a neckcloth stiffner, but no neckcloth to fit the stiffner.</p>
               <p>Q. That induced you to believe that handkerchief to be his, his neck being without one - A. Yes; my son went into this shed where this man turned in; he found this chisel, which we supposed he threw in. He told me going to the watchhouse, that he was a married man and had three children; I asked him how he could do such a thing to bring his family to distress; he said he did not care, he might as well go any where as to stay here and be starved.</p>

Yes; he ran through a pond first, and I followed after him; he hesitated for a minute and then he ran over some pales into the garden ground; directly he got over I got over after him; after we had secured him I went into the garden and found a black silk handkerchief with four fowls tied in it.</p>

            . I am a cordwainer; I live in Selby's mews, Upper Portman square. On Wednesday the 26th of October, between the hours of nine and ten o'clock, I came by Mr. Hall's house, his son was at the door; I heard the father call out William, there is somebody in the fowl house; call out for the watchman; I saw a man with a bundle in his hand passing Mr. Hall as fast as he could; that man was the prisoner; Mr. Hall got to him and sell, and I past him. I ran about a hundred yards, and came up to him; he put his hand to his coat, he instantly struck at me with the chisel, and struck me on my head; I could not recover my ground for the space of half a minute; then I made my way to him again; he said keep off or else I will do for you; I saw him get over the place where he was apprehended; I saw him go up to a shed, which I suppose was to hide the chissel and the fowls; the chisel and the fowls were found there. Then William Hall was getting over the fence; I went round to the front of the house, a smith's shop, he instantly came to me and says there he is; I said you are the man; William Hall junr. and he had a struggle, and Mr. Hall senr. came up and assisted in taking him.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. The fowls were alive the last time you had seen them - A. Yes; I had fed them twice that day.</p>

I was eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260045"/>years at sea, and the last part of the time in the East India service.</p>

In consequence of information I examined the gutters of the five houses, and found the lead cut away from the two sides of the gutter, about fifty pounds weight from one house; it had the appearance of being fresh cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. Yes, they were both my workmen.</p>
               <p>Q. When the lead was missing, did you say any thing to these men about it - A. I said little, till I saw the evidence which I thought was sufficient, then did, his name is Charles Gates, he was a workman of mine; I then got an officer and had them apprehended.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any lead taken away - A. Yes, it was cut with a knife from under the tiles.</p>
               <p>Q. Who cut it - A. I cannot say who cut it most; they were all concerned in it except the two labourers, they knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much lead did you take in all - A. I cannot say; I suppose it was taken from five, if not six houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you got as much as fifty pounds weight of it - A. Yes. The lead was sold to an old iron shop, for three halfpence a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Who received the money for it - A. Sometimes one and sometimes another; it was all spent in beer and gin.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make the discovery first - A. No; when Mr. Cummings came to our house I told him of it.</p>

            . I am one of the patrols belonging to Bow street. Leeson came to the office on Monday last, and said he had been robbed of a pair of boots; I and Blackman apprehended the prisoners; he pointed out Scoton first and said she was the person that took the boots; I took her into the house, the prisoner Hart was there; he begged my pardon, and said Hart was the person that robbed him; we took both the prisoners to the pawnbroker; when the pawnbroker saw them, he said he believed it was Scoton that pawned the boots.</p>

            . Q. Were you an officer in the excise in November, 1797, stationed at Barestead near Maidstone - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, I remember seeing him on the 6th of November, about ten at night, I stood within the door of my lodgings, I saw a cart go past, and a person in the cart, and this prisoner riding behind upon a horse; I suspected that it was a smugling cart; I went into my stable and took my horse and followed them; I overtook them a little way beyond the Bell at Farnham, about half a quarter of a mile; I asked the prisoner what he had got in the cart; he said it was no concern of mine, or words to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it appear to you that it was in the cart - A. I cannot be certain what was in the cart; they appeared to be hogsheads of some sort; I thought it was tobacco at the time. I went to endeavour to stop the cart; I called out to the man in the cart to stop the cart, but he made no answer: I told him if he did not stop I would fire, and I fired at the horse in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you fired at the horse had you any opportunity<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260047"/>of seeing what was the contents in the cart - A I endeavoured to put my hand into the cart to feel what it was, but was prevented by the prisoner; then I fired at the horse; the man in the cart said to Waddle, now at him; after that expression Waddle then rode up and struck me over the head with a large stick, what they call a bludgeon, such as smugglers use - He struck me over my head, which knocked my hat off, and cut my head open; and he kept after me, attempting to strike me, at some distance; he followed me; the other man was in the cart behind; - I then pulled up my horse, and took out my other pistol, and told him I would shoot; he said will you shoot - I fired at his horse; he then came to me with his stick, and I defended myself with my hanger in the best manner I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You still being a horseback at that time - A. Yes. He then hit my horse over the left ear, the horse fell and I fell with him; then he jumped upon me and secured me - he took my arms, my hanger, and my pistols; on the other man coming up to me, they took my belt that I had got about my body, and pinioned my arms back with the strap, and I laid in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did both of them do it to you - A. Yes; I laid on my back; the man that drove the cart came and looked at me; he took the stick and hit me on the collar; - it was a very bright moonlight night, I could observe Waddle and the other man whispering together in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of all these blows, with respect to your person - A. My head was cut, I think in four different places.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you bleed very freely - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was very much hurt was you - A. Yes, very much hurt; when I observed them whispering together in the road, the other man turned the cart round and went back on the road that they came. Waddle came up and untied my hands, and delivered up to me my pistols and my hanger; I then got up and went to Hearndon's house; it might be about thirty or forty yards; I went into the house and the woman brought me some water; I had my wounds washed, and she tied my head up.</p>
               <p>Q. You were bleeding then - A. Yes; Hearndon and his wife were both there at the time. Waddle said to Hearndon, that he would give half a guinea if he would go and fetch his horse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did Waddle come along with you to Hearndon's house - A. Yes. Hearndon went after the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you together with Waddle in that house at Hearndon's - A. Upon my word I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Half an hour or more - A. I should think more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a light at Hearndon's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that Waddle was the person that treated you in the manner as you have described - A. I never had any doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have mentioned Hearndon and his wife being there, do you remember a person of the name of Jones being there - A. While Mr. Hearndon was gone for the horse, I heard a horse come past the door, I holloaed out, I went to the door and I saw it was Mr. Jones; Mr. Jones got off his horse and came into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Mr. Jones before - A. Yes, he was a gentleman farmer at Farnham; - he came in and asked me what was the matter. Waddle told Mr. Jones that I wanted to rob him; then I told Mr. 
               <persName id="t18081126-76-person656">Jones</persName>
             the circumstance that I have been repeating to day; Mr. Jones told Waddle that he ought to be secured; Mr. Jones asked him what his name was, and where he lived; he said his name was Kingsworth, and that he lived at Lenham, or near Lenham, which is not a great way from Farnham; it is about six or seven miles. Mr. Jones was assisting the woman in tying up my head, and Waddle went out of the house, and I saw no more of him that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was his horse found - A. Mr. Hearndon brought my horse instead of his.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Upon the prisoner saying that he lived at Lenham, did Mr. Jones say any thing to Waddle about it - A. Mr. Jones shook his head, and said he did not recollect any such person living in that neighbourhood; then Waddle went out of the house and we never saw him till some time afterwards at Hyde fair.</p>
               <p>Q. You have mentioned Mr. Jones, and Mr. and Mrs. Hearndon - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They attended when you attended afterwards when you preferred the bill of indictment, and they attended afterwards when the trial was expected to come on - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of them - A. They are dead all of them now.</p>
               <p>COURT. When did the last of them die - A. Mr. Jones died, and was buried in April last; Hearndon was buried upon the 15th of May last; and Mrs. Hearndon, October 4th, 1803.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not see Waddle again until you saw him at Hyde fair, when is Hyde fair day - A. I am not positive, I think it was the 10th or 11th of December; the month after I saw Waddle there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt at all that the person you saw at Hyde fair, was the person that treated you in the way you have described, and was the person that was at Hearndon's house - A. I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not apprehend him at that time - A. No.</p>
