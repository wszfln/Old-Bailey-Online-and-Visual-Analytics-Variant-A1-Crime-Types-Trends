            . I am a Police-officer, at Marlborough-street. On the 2d of July I was employed by Mr. Pollard to examined this house, which I did; I saw the cabinet in the drawing-room - the property must have been taken out by means of a false key; the lid appeared as if a chisel had been used, but had not succeeded - I opened it with the key in her ladyship's presence; I afterwards went down in the wine-cellar, and found the door of that had been forced open; I then went to No. 4, Johnstone's-place, Marylebone, and inquired if they could tell me where Mr. McNamara's servant was, as I had a parcel for her to take into the country - upon that Ann Delany came down stairs; I asked her for Bridget - she said she would take me to her daughter's lodging in Kendal-mews; she did so- I did not find Bridget there; I then asked where she thought she was; she said very probably she was gone to her sister's, which was four or five miles from town, but she did not know where it was - in about half an hour I went back to Kendal-mews alone, and found the two prisoners in the room with a young man named Phillips; I called Phillips on one side, having understood he was in Mr. McNamara's service - I afterwards told Bridget that in the absence of her Ladyship her cabinet had been opened, and a watch and other jewellery taken away - this was in the hearing of Ann; she said she knew nothing of it - I immediately afterwards observed her whispering to her mother; I could not hear what was said, and I said they must come with me to Mr. McNamara's immediately - on coming out I locked the door, and put the key into my pocket;

             walked away without saying any thing - I took Bridget and Phillips to Mr. Pollard's; I left Bridget in the custody of Pollard while I took Phillips to the watch-house - I soon returned to Pollard's, and from information I afterwards received, I asked Bridget to return with me to her lodging, and asked her what she had done with the box which contained the jewellery; she said she would take me to Kendal-mews, and give it me - I neither threatened nor promised her; this was on the road there - when we got there, she showed me a key; she said that was the key of the box, but she dare say her mother had taken the box away, as she could not find it, for she had whispered to her mother, and told her to taken it away; I said "Was that what you told your mother when you whispered?" she said Yes; I left her at the lodging with Mr. McNamara, who had gone with me, and I went to Johnstone's-place in search of Ann Delany - she was not there; I got information, went back to Kendal-mews, and found her there with her daughter - she was looking over several things; I asked her where the box was; she then said to her daughter."What! you have not been telling any body about it - don't mention any thing about the young man;" at the same time holding her fist up to her daughter; the daughter said, "Let them have the box," she fell on her knees, and implored her mother to give the box up - the mother said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160004"/>very well, she would go and get it, telling me at the same time to stop behind; I told her No, she was in my custody, and I must go with her - she took me to Johnstone's-place, up two pairs of stairs, and reached down a key which hung over the fire-place - she took me down stairs into the yard, unscrewed the staple of the wash-house door, and behind that door was another small door, which she unlocked with a key she had taken from up stairs; I said, "What, are the things here?" and was going to stoop down to search for them - she pushed me aside, and said,"No, I hid them, and I can find them;" she then searched among the rubbish, and gave me this box, which contains a gold seal, a topaz brooch, a gold chain, a locket, a pair of gold ear-rings, and two other brooches - the neck-chain and locket were in a small pill-box, on the lid of which is written, "Lady Charles Bentinck;" I saw her endeavouring to conceal something - I asked her what it was; she said Nothing: I then took from her, out of a leathern apron, which she was in the act of throwing away, this box, containing a pair of buckles; I asked her who they belonged to - she said to her daughter - that her daughter had them given to her by Dr. Hill, who she had lived servant with three or four years ago; I then took the things in my possession, and took her to Kendal-mews; on the road I asked her how long it was since she had concealed the two boxes in Johnstone's-place; she said, "Three or four days ago;" when I arrived at Kendal-mews, I took her and her daughter on to Marlbourough-street Office, and on the road there I asked Bridget, in the hearing of her mother, if the box was in the room when I first got there - she knew I had found it then; she said that when I first came the box was on the table under the window, and that when she whispered to her mother, she told her to take it away, and that her mother returned when she left me, put the window up, and took the things away; the mother then said, that when I went away with Bridget and Phillips she had returned, pushed the window up, and took the things away to Johnstone's-place - I took Phillips to the office, and afterwards returned to Kendal-mews with Ballard, and on searching the room found several pairs of drawers, pantaloons, and waistcoats, on several of which was the name of the late Lord Bentinck; they were remanded till Friday - I took Ann to the New Prison myself, and on the road there I asked how long ago it was since she had received these things of her daughter - she said six or seven weeks ago, two days before Mr. McNamara came to live in her ladyship's house; she said she had been very uncomfortable ever since she had had them, and was afraid to offer them to pledge, or to dispose of them, for fear of being found out - Bridget told me at the second examination, that she had done it all herself, and she had been very uncomfortable; she seemed in great trouble - she said Phillips saw the things lying about, called her up stairs, and said, "Take these things, for her ladyship will never miss them, and if I were you I would take them;" she said they were lying about the room; Phillips is committed for re-examination to-morrow - we have been able to trace nothing to him, except what she had said, and that she has contradicted since.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Thompson, a salesman, of the Borough skin-market. Last Saturday week, between one and two o'clock, twenty skins were brought for sale by Lancashire Jack (Flitcroft) - I understand he goes by that name; they were sold, and he received the money for them - they were marked on the head or down the neck, and across the loin, with red ochre; I cannot say whether they were all marked the same way -I only turned one over, and saw it; they were sold to Corderoy, a fellmonger, of Bermondsey - I should know them again: I went to Corderoy's afterwards, to look for them - they were among five hundred more; the fellmonger picked them out, but I recognized them; they are here(looking at two) - these are the same skins I received from Flitcroft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.They were pulled out by Corderoy, and shown to you? A. Yes - he did not say they were what he bought of me - he pulled out a good many more, and these were picked out from them; a red ochre mark is very common - there were no letters to my knowledge: Lancashire Jack received 7s. 8d. for them, which was more than he ought to have had; they were sold for 5 1/2d. each, and are not worth more; the general price was 6d. - we sold them in the public market; I never saw Flitcroft before, but have no doubt he is the man.</p>

            . I am a carcase-butcher, of Whitechapel-market. I saw Flitcroft on the Saturday, coming from Newgate-market, about half-past six or seven o'clock, with a porter's cart, which he had hired, and on the Saturday afternoon, the two prisoners were going by my shop, and were secured; Henderson was taken first - before he was handcuffed Wilson passed, and was taken.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Farringdon within. I was in Pocklington's shop on the Saturday, about twelve o'clock - I was speaking to Mr. Pocklington about stopping the account, when Henderson came in, and asked for the account in my presence: I asked him who he had brought the sheep from - he told me from a person named Brown; he did not know where he lived, but he could find the man if I went with him, and I went with him - he said he was to meet him at the end of the Minories, to receive the account of the sheep; I went there with him, but met no person - we went into a public-house, three doors beyond the Minories, and looked round there, thinking he might be waiting there, as it rained very hard, but could not find him; he said he should be sure to find him at the Ten Bells, Spitalfields - we went there, and saw the landlord, the servant, and the pot-boy, but no such person as Brown was known: he said he was a master butcher, and had employed him as a porter; I brought him back to Mr. Pocklington, in Newgate-market, and saw Mr. Pocklington's nephew, who had refused him the account in the morning, and had directed me to his uncle, in Smithfield; I went there, and he told Mr. Pocklington that he was merely employed as a porter, and that he could bring Brown forward on Monday morning, and I suffered him to go, but took him into custody again about an hour after; White's-row, Spitalfields, is in the county of Middlesex.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH STONE. On the 4th, I apprehended Flitcroft. I got two skins which I have produced, from Corderoy, the fellmonger, of Bermondsey: Owen was present.</p>

            . These are the skins of two sheep, I sold to Mr. Vigne; they have my mark on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you in the habit of selling sheep? A. Yes; the mark is not initials - I marked them in this way; I have sold others with the same mark, and so may a good many graziers in Essex - there is another mark on them, which would not be noticed; they had been shorn very badly, which disfigured them very much, and I ran the shears over them, and in doing so I found a small spot of paint, by which I know them: I saw eighteen of the skins, and on both these two there was a small piece of paint when they were found - I pulled it off - it is not visible now, for after skins have been in the pit the wood comes off very easily; I have no hesitation in swearing to these two skins, from the state they were in when I took them out of the pit, and here is the ochre mark, which I swear is the mark I put on them; there was a spot of a mixture called paint, which sheep are dotted with - it was on these two skins, but came off on my touching them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It was on them when you first found them? A. Yes, at Corderoy's - I identified them as they came out of the pit; three or four hundred were pulled out - I saw that private mark on five or six of them, but being in water the least thing will make it come off; I had seen that mark on most of them when I sold them to Mr. Vigne - it was not my own mark, I found it there when I marked them; I bought them of a Mr. Tye, a sheep-salesman, in Smithfield - he is not here.</p>

            . I was in custody on this charge, and have been admitted a witness for the Crown. On Thursday afternoon, the 2d of July, I was coming up Whitechapel-market, and met the two prisoners in company; Henderson asked me if I was willing to go and earn 1l., for he had bought some sheep in the country - I said Yes, I was very poor, and much in need of it; we went through Clapton, and beyond Lee-bridge, all three together - we went to a field - Henderson opened the gate, and said those were his sheep: I do not know how he opened the gate, for he was before us - I do not see what he did to the gate; Wilson and I went in, and brought out twenty sheep - we brought them through Stratford, up the Mile-end-road; I took them to No. 9, White's-row - Henderson left us before we got there, and came to meet us again a little before we got to White's-row; we stopped to have a drop of beer, near the Globe, but Henderson had left us as soon as we came out of the field. The sheep were slaughtered at No. 9, White's-row that day, and taken to market; Henderson, I, and Wilson slaughtered them; I got to White's-row, about three o'clock: after they were slaughtered, six sheep were taken to Leadenhall-market, five to Mr. Challis, and one to Mr. Cross - four were sent to Mr. Mason's, of Newgate-market, and four to Mr. Boyce: Henderson told me he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160006"/>delivered them at Boyce's - five went to Mr. Pocklington's; I delivered them there, and told Henderson I had done so- I did not go for the account: the other one was cut into pieces - one of the sheep at Pocklington's was without a leg: the skins were taken by me to Mr. Thompson's, Borough-market, for sale - I took twenty there; I laid them down at Thompson's to be sold by commission - I received 7s. 8d. for them; 8d. being the commission at 5 1/2d. each, that would be 8s. 4d.: I left the carcases for sale in the name of Brown, of Spitalfields - I do not know such a person; Henderson told me to leave them in that name. I go by the name of Lancashire Jack.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Why are you called so? A. Because I came from Lancashire - there is no other reason that I know of; I had not the slightest idea the sheep were stolen: Henderson was a very few minutes before us, and when we got there the gate was open - Henderson stood there, and said those were his sheep; I saw the gate, but observed no chain to it: I have heard the witnesses state where the sheep were disposed of - I heard there was a warrant out against me; I came into the neighbourhood directly, to be taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you it would be best to give yourself up? A.Why, I should look better with clean linen, and went to my lodging to change myself; I was taken at my own lodging before I had shifted my linen - I was in custody about ten minutes before I told this story; I was not afraid for myself - it was for the sake of justice; it was more to my credit to state it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you suspect they were stolen? A. On Saturday evening; I was taken on Sunday morning -I did not give myself up on Saturday, as I did not wish to be in prison a night more than I need; I have heard of many sheep stealing cases in Lancashire, but was never charged with being concerned, that I swear - if I ever said so I told a lie, for I never was concerned: I have heard of many a forgery in Lancashire - I was accused of being concerned in a forgery in Lancashire, but not of sheep stealing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you abscond? A.Necessity compelled me to go, for want of work; it was not to avoid being taken up- my friends compromised the case; I paid the man the money for the bill myself: there never was a warrant out against me for forgery; I have been accused of something else - I am not obliged to tell for what; I was accused at Guildhall respecting some fat, the property of Lemington and Co. - it was beef fat; I was not accused of stealing - cwt. from the man the fat was sold to - I do not know Back; I was never accused of stealing - cwt. from any body.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, were you not accused of stealing - cwt.? A. I am not obliged to answer that; I do not know where Back's is - I never was accused of stealing a - cwt. to my knowledge; I do not recollect it - I never was charged with it in my life; I have mentioned every thing I have been accused of to the best of my knowledge - I have been in town about seven years, and am married; I do not know where my wife is - I saw her last, four or five months ago in Somerset-street; I have now come from Giltspur-street - I have not been in Newgate; I do not know that my wife is in prison: I remember a - cwt. being put into the fat sack to make it weigh heavier - I was not accused of stealing it; I did not put it into the fat.</p>
               <p>Q.You did not know it was there? A.That has been already tried; I went and sold the skins by Henderson s order - he hired me; I had known him about three months - we started from Whitechapel to fetch the sheep between five and six o'clock in the evening; it was morning when we got the sheep out - I never did such a thing before, but Henderson said they were his; we went a long way beyond Lee-bridge for them - it might be eight, nine, or ten miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course Henderson paid you the pound? A. I received money for it; he authorised me to take the mo-money from Cross - I got 1l. 5s. 6d., which I kept - I received the money for the skins, and made 25s. of the sheep that was cut up: I had to account to him for the balance: Cross did not ask if I knew Brown - I acted as Henderson's servant; I have been out of service some time - I have jobbed about the market, and been haymaking when the weather admitted; I was last in the service of Mr. Brown, a carcase-butcher, of Whitechapel - he turned me away for neglecting his work, and getting drunk; he never charged me with theft to my knowledge- I give evidence for the sake of public justice, and to save myself certainly; I expect if they are convicted, I shall get off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wilson. Q.Were you not aware that I was engaged to go for the sheep, and did you not see me paid? A.He told me he was engaged, and I saw him receive 10s. from Henderson's hands.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was that paid in your presence? A. It was; Wilson asked him for some money - he said if he would go to the Queen's Head, White's-row, he would give him some; we went there together - he gave him 10s., and said was that sufficient, and was he satisfied for his labour - Wilson said Yes; I have seen Wilson before, but was not much acquainted with him - he was present when Henderson asked if I would earn 1l., and heard what was said; I did not know where the sheep were to go to - he said he should go before us, and prepare a place, and meet us in Osborne-street, near Whitechapel; he went on alone to the field before us to open the gate: I do not think Wilson was present when he told me to deliver the carcases in the name of Brown - I did not see Wilson after he received the 10s., till he was in custody; I never knew Henderson deal in sheep before - he was a butcher, and I have been a butcher: I had known Henderson for three or four months.</p>
               <p>Henderson's Defence. Three parts of what Flitcroft has said is false: I never employed him, nor went to get the sheep.</p>
               <p>Wilson's Defence. I met Henderson on Thursday morning, about eleven or twelve o'clock; he asked if I had any thing to do - I said No; he said he had some sheep he was going into the country with, for a man, and was ordered to engage a man - if I would go I should have a few shillings for my trouble; I went and helped to lay them down to slaughter - they were done up, and I went to the public-house, received 10s., and saw no more of him.</p>

On the 25th of June I was in my garden; I told Miss Gonin, who lives in the house, to bring me some seed - she came to me in the garden, returned to the house, called to me, and said a thief had entered and taken the silver, which was kept in the cupboard, on the left-hand side of the fire-place; I went out, and saw some men on Muswell-hill - they directed me after three men in a cart, who had gone down the hill, and at the bottom of the hill I met Mr. Smeeton; I went on in his cart, and in three or four minutes saw a cart on Mount Pleasant: before we got up to it, some men got out of it - they were about two hundred yards off; there were three men by the cart, but I had only seen two in it; one of them went down a lane on the left - the third, who was by the cart, went to the right, and one remained in the road; we drove up, and both jumped out of the cart -Smeeton collared the prisoner: our horse was very restive at being driven so hard, and I held it by the head; the prisoner, seeing this, struck Smeeton - he appeared to be loitering about the cart; when we got up he was about three yards from it - he got from Smeeton, and at that instant two men came up; one took the horse reins, while I followed the prisoner - he got through the hedge, and was secured by a man; I knew him to be one of the men I had seen in the cart - on searching the cart I found a plated knife, in a basket of willow-shavings; it was mine: the prisoner, as he ran, threw some lemons from his pocket - I have found nothing more; I could not see whether the other man took any thing away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How far were you from the cart when he got out? A.About two hundred yards; he did not run till after I had seized him - the other two ran into the fields.</p>

I said, "If you want water-cresses here are plenty for you;" he said, "Give me my cresses and let me go;" he bought some; I have seen him pass my house several times on Sundays, and have noticed him looking over my curtain - I thought he was looking at the birds.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of June, about six o'clock in the evening, I met the two prisoners near Hornsey-wood, in a field - Bonnick had a bag; they were in company - I stopped them, and asked what they had in the bag; Davis said Nothing; Bonnick said, "Some dirty linen:" I asked where they got it- they said from their aunt's, at Winchmore-hill, and they were going to take it to their aunt's, in Gray's Inn-lane: I said, "Perhaps you are going to take it to your uncle's." I took it, and found these articles in it, quite wet -I said, "You have stolen these from some washerwoman's line;" they said No; I handcuffed and took them to the cage - I found they had been taken about a mile from where I met them; they had been in company together some time.</p>

A.On the 16th of June; I did not know of her pawning these things -there were two table-cloths which I found at the pawnbroker's, on which I had received 4s. 6d., but I have not charged her with stealing them; the two table-cloths which are down are two common kitchen ones - I certainly did offer to repay her the 4s. 6d. if I got my property; I have another lodger in the house, an elderly gentleman, who has been with me twelve months - I never knew of her pawning these articles; I missed them, and spoke to her about them: no such word ever escaped my lips as that I did not care what things were pawned for the temporary use of my lodgers, so long as they were returned when they left the lodgings - I will swear I had not sold these sheets for 18s., nor any of these articles: I had not agreed to receive payment from her by instalments, except for those cloths on which I received the 4s. 6d.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My landlady has repeatedly told me when I was in want of money, that she did not care what I did with the property, so long as it was returned- I have remarked that I have been obliged to pawn, and she never asked what it was; I was to pay 18s. for the sheets, and 4s. for the table-cloths - I have pawned some things which she says some gentleman gave her at the'Change, in consequence of her distress; the tea-spoons she lent me - they were not let with the apartment: the shirts were given me to iron, and I pawned them; I am not aware of the books being hers - she has often had the money for which I pawned the things.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and went to Walton's with Smith; I found this property -I searched Bright's drawer and found this gauze in it; she had not left the house - she denied that it belonged to Mr. Simpson; she had no box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find any thing else in her drawer? A. No; I found this other piece of gauze at her sister's in Crown-street.</p>
               <p>MRS. SIMPSON. These are my husband's; this gauze alone is of very little value, but it belonged to a dress, and was taken out and cut into a tippet - I heard her tell Walton so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What is the value of this bit of gauze? A. Not much; the dress would be worth 2l. - I do not know whether the officer was there when Bright said she cut it up to make a tippet; I think he was gone up stairs - she told me she took it out of the drawing-room; I was not asked before the Magistrate what the prisoner said; Bright confessed that she had taken a shawl and other things - I know this pink dress; I have the dress-maker here who made the two dresses into one; it is different from any other in London; the gauze has no mark upon it -Bright has been in our service for about two months; I had a good character with her.</p>

Yes, and showed it to Mr. Moate - he did not say he could not swear to it; Crockett, a person in his service, appeared as a witness, who has been since discharged - he was not in custody: he was not bound over at all - I have since ascertained that at this very time, that man had the keys of the place where the hay was kept; I have heard from the neighbours that Hooper is a respectable person, and that he keeps a horse and cart, but I do not know that he worked at the factory - Hooper told me that it was for a horse that had worked on the factory, and he showed me the horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know when Crockett was discharged? A. I believe the day this affair occured.</p>

Haydon was in my employ, for about ten years; he had been discharged once for a few months - I know nothing of Hooper; no horse belonging to the factory was kept in Hooper's-court, and no horse that I fed there - Hooper was not employed in any way in my service; Haydon was out early, as he was going to Bromley, and it was necessary to set out soon - he ought not to have taken more than one sixth part of a truss of hay; I saw the hay at the office, and I believe from the quality that it was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON, Q.Will you swear it was your hay? A. I can only speak to the resemblance of it - to the best of my knowledge I believe it was mine; Haydon was my <rs id="t18290716-22-deflabel128" type="occupation">carter</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Did not Crockett and Haydon sleep next to each other? A.Crockett lived near the premises, but not Haydon - Crockett must have gone to the place; I have my hay from my brother's farm, and his servants bring it to me - the key of the hay was in Crockett's care; there were none of the doors broken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you authorise either of the prisoners to take your hay, for any horse in Hooper's-court? A. No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Miller has been in the habit of sending me to pawn other people's property, which came to be washed; she has let me stand for weeks without one farthing of money - her husband knows he has taken me round in a cart before now, and I have gone to the persons they wash for, and told lies to cover their crimes.</p>
               <p>SEPTIMUS MILLER re-examined. Q.Why is not your wife here? A. I do not know; the Magistrate did not tell her to come; the very week the prisoner took this shirt she had 18s. of me - I owe her now 5s. 8d., but I have missed several other articles, and have been at great expence to make them good; I have not been in distress so as to pawn other people's property.</p>

On the 18th of May, I received a letter, stating that the things had not been received - I have since found seven shirts and some other things, which were part of the property.</p>

            . I am brother to John Larke. I was left in charge of the shop on Sunday, the 5th of July; I had suspicion something would happen, and placed myself in the kitchen with Mr. Archer - my brother had fastened the shop door before he went out; I heard a voice in the parlour say, "It is all right; bolt the door;" I ran into the parlour, and the first person I met was Smith - I collared him, and took the canvas bag with the money out of his hand; I do not know where the bag was taken from - I had not seen it; I held Smith, and led him to the door - the street-keeper then came; we took him to the watch-house, with the bag, which was examined there, and the copper found in it; Smith had also a paper in his hand, with money in it - I had not seen that paper before; I took it to the watch-house with the bag; I did not see any body else in the parlour, but I saw a man running through the shop - Archer ran after him; when I collared Smith, he tried to put his hand into his pocket - he made several attempts to get from me; I examined, and found in his pocket four skeleton-keys - I tried one of them to the shop door, and it opened it; when I got Smith out he tried to get out of my hands, but finding me the strongest, he became quiet; I did not see the face of the one who ran through the shop - three more skeleton keys were taken from Smith's pocket at the watch-house.</p>

            . On Sunday, the 5th of July, I was left in care of the shop; I was in the kitchen with Thomas Larke: I went into the parlour, and saw Smith there - I had heard him say, "Bolt the door;" I immediately went into the shop, and saw Saunders up close to the door, looking towards me - he was inside the shop, about two feet from the door; as soon as he saw me he turned round, opened the door, and run out - I followed him for more than half a mile; I did not overtake him myself - he was taken; I lost sight of him six or seven times when he was turning the corners, and when I turned I saw him still running; the shop shutters were closed, but there was a fan-light over the door - I had an opportunity of seeing his face when it was turned towards me, and have no doubt of his person whatever; I was very near him when he was taken - he turned the corner of a street which was no thoroughfare, and when I saw him again he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.From the time you first saw him till he ran out, how long might it be? A. About a minute; I did not see him till I got into the parlour - he was not more than a minute in my view in the shop, and during part of that minute I was looking at Larke and Smith; there was a light from the fan-light, which is about two feet by three - it has no bars to darken it; there was also a light from the parlour into the shop - I do not think I saw him for more than a minute; my attention was directed to the shop immediately I came out of the kitchen door - I did not meet many persons as I pursued - there were a great many people in Whitechapel-road, but not in the back streets; none of them joined in the pursuit, till at last I cried Stop thief! and about half a dozen persons followed - some were behind me, and some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160022"/>before; they ran before me, and two of them caught him - he was searched at the watch-house, and two common small knives were found on him.</p>

             was among them; when he got opposite my door, my wife cried out to him, "There is no thoroughfare;" he then turned the corner of Buttress-street, and did not go any further in that direction - he seemed very much exhausted, and threw himself against the wall, and at that time threw down this crow-bar into the kennel; I picked it up, and have had it ever since, except for half an hour, when the officer came to me - I am positive it is the same; he then delivered himself to two men, and was taken away - Archer followed him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What do you mean by delivering himself? A.He threw himself against a wall completely exhausted, and when he saw the two men he went in between them, and gave himself up: I might be fifty or sixty yards off - I live about half a mile from Larke's; he was coming apparently in a direction from there - there might be twenty persons running; ours is a populous street - I had been at my door, in and out, some time; I did not go inside from the time I heard the cry of Stop thief! till I saw him deliver himself up - I took particular notice of a mark at the end of the instrument.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did Archer come by your house? A. No; he was in Underwood-street when I saw him; he would lose sight of him at the place he was taken - I could see that place from my door, but Archer could not; he was running about forty yards behind.</p>

             re-examined. When I went out in the afternoon, I locked the shop door; the shop window was quite secure - there was no other means of getting to the shop without opening the door; the door had been unlocked two Sundays before, and that caused my suspicion; I fastened the shop window on the Saturday night - all the back of the house was well secured: I had fastened it myself - besides the money in the bag, I had some money in a paper - it turned out to be 6 1/2d. at the watch-house; when I saw it opened I knew it to be the same paper - it was left in the same cupboard with the bag; it was produced to me by my brother, with the bag, and was safe in the cupboard on the Saturday.PTHOMAS LARKE. The bag with the copper in it, and the paper, I produced to my brother, is the same as I took from Smith.</p>

            . I was at the hotel, and remember the prisoner coming there; I followed him up stairs when he went to brush his shoes - he went to the place where the shoes are cleaned; I staid with him there - I did not observe whether he went into any other room; he only went into the place, looked round, and found there were no brushes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160023"/>and went out of the place: Bassett came up stairs, and I left him in conversation with her at the top of the stairs - I went down into the kitchen, and left them; she came down stairs, and met me in the kitchen - I expected she had let him out, but I went up stairs, and found him standing at Mr. Beaumont's bed-room door, which I think was open: I could not tell whether he had been in, but he seemed confessed - I did not like his manner; he stood with his hands placed before him, as if there was something in them - I kept an eye on him; Bassett came up stairs - he directed his discourse to her; I told him to look at me, and not to look at her so much - he still kept his back towards me; I touched his arm, gave it a sudden jerk, and the pin dropped out of his hand - I am certain he dropped it from his hand; he let me pick it up very easily, he did not resist in the least; I then said, "You have taken some things from Mr. Beaumont's room;" he said, What? I did not know the pin at the time, but suspected it was so - I said, "You have come into this house to see this girl, for her sake and mine do not take any thing out of the house;" he said he had not got any thing - I saw him place his hand in his coat pocket; Bassett immediately went into Beaumont's room, looked on the table, missed a box, and said, "Don't say you have not taken any thing, you have got a small box with a steel and flint;" he ten took the box out of his left side pocket and placed it in her hand, and begged of us not to tell, for it was the first thing he had ever done; he cried - I promised him I would not if he would give me up every thing; he said he had not got any thing more if he never breathed again - I asked if he knew the consequence of what he was saying; he said he did - that it was not that we lived now, but that we lived hereafter. I had been into Mr. Beaumont's room about three-quarters of an hour before but had not noticed the watch; I went into the room after he was gone, but did not see the watch there - I had been in the habit of seeing it there; I do not know whether there was a chain on it, as I had not particularly noticed it; this is the box he put into Bassett's hand, and this is the pin I picked up.</p>

            . I live at No. 42, Monmouth-street, and am servant to Mr. Emanuel, a clothes salesman. One night, the latter end of May, about ten o'clock, the prisoner brought a gold chain into my master's shop; I cannot say whether it was after the 26th - he produced a gold watch, and had the chain round his neck; I saw him take his hat off, and take the chain off his neck - the watch hung in his bosom fastened to the chain; Emanuel was at home - he is not here; he would not swear to him before the Justice; I know him to be the man - he staid there about a quarter of an hour, and my master gave the watch to him again; he wanted 18l. for it - my master would not buy it, and he went away; I am quite sure he is the man - I cannot recollect the day; my master was closing the shop up when he came, and told him to come next morning; but he did not.</p>

On Saturday night, the 27th of June, about ten o'clock, or a little later, I went up stairs to my bed-room; I had locked the bed-room door, and left the room quite safe about half an hour before - I fastened the window of that room with a drop-key at the side: it is a sash window, and opens into a lane at the side of the house - when I went up I put the key into the lock, and could not turn it one way or the other; I pushed against the door twice, and the second time it opened a little and sprang back in my face again - I found there was some one inside; I caught hold of the knob of the door, held it, and called out for my husband (the door opens inside the room); it was dark - I had left a candle in the room when I locked it; my husband came up, and just as he got on the landing the door was forced from my hold, and four men came out - I caught the first, and held him as long as my strength would permit, and then he escaped; my husband caught two of them, who are the prisoners - he kept them - I went into the bed-room, and found the light still there; I examined, and found one chest of drawers had been opened and the things, which had been in the drawers, tied up in bundles - two boxes were pulled from under the bed; I missed a small necklace from a second drawer - I had seen it that morning; the door appeared to me to have been opened by a chisel; I could tell by the marks that it had been broken open from the stair-case, and not inside - the room window was a little open at the bottom; it is one story high - the prisoners were taken away; I did not take notice of them myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Who had the key of the door? A. I kept it in my pocket; I was a good deal alarmed - there is a club-room on the same floor; it is seven or eight yards from the bed-room door - there was company in that room; I am sure four persons came out of the bed-room together - I have not stated that two came out first; some people came out of the club-room when the alarm was given, but not till after I had cried to my husband; I caught the knob of the door, and held it- the men forced the door from my hand just as my husband got up close to the door; it was before they came out of the room - they might have got out of the window if they had tried.</p>

Yes; I cannot say whether the prisoners were members of the club, or whether they had been in the club-room that night - I had seen them drinking in a room down stairs about an hour before I went up; I should not know the man who I caught hold of.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in Whitechapel, in the parish of St. Mary; I do not know any other name for it. On Saturday, the 27th of June, about ten o'clock, I was serving in the bar; several customers were before the bar - my wife went up stairs to fetch the candle down, which she had left on the stove when she put the children to bed; she had not been up half a minute before she called to me, and said she was sure there were thieves in the room - I immediately took a candle which stood at the end of the counter, and ran up stairs; when I got to the top she was struggling with one man just in the door way - I placed my candle on a shelf at the top of the banisters as I saw her struggling, and I saw the next one come out; that was the prisoner Grainger - I saw him come out of the room; I saw him in the room, and as he came out, there is a step of about six inches, and he fell forward; as he fell I struck him on the nose - the next that came out was Spencer; I saw him come out, and as he came out he struck at me, and I struck at him - he tumbled over the other prisoner; they were both down together - another person came out of the room directly after, and made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q.After the two prisoners were on the floor did you call for assistance? A. I called. and a young man, Henry, who lives in the house, and occasionally waits in the tap-room, came - I secured Grainger, and he secured Spencer; the candle went out during the scuffle - I cannot say whether it was before I knocked the man down or not, for a gas-light in the bar showed a light on the stairs - the light was burning when I saw the two prisoners come out of the room; I lost a gold seal from a bureau in the room - I had seen it safe two or three days before, about Wednesday; I delivered the prisoners to Brown the officer, who came - on Sunday morning, as soon as I opened the house, a man brought in a bunch of keys and a chisel; I knew him as a customer, but do not know his name - he is not here; I had not seen the prisoners in the house - neither of them were members of the club to my knowledge; I examined the door - it had been broken from the outside by a chisel or something, by the marks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You have a club-room on the same floor? A. It is not exactly level, there is a difference of two steps - the door of one room can be seen from the other; Henry attended the club-room - he might go there every ten or five minutes; there are none of the club here - I placed the candle on a shelf at the head of the stairs - it would not cause a shadow to pass on the door; when the noise was heard the people in the club-room opened the door - I swear the prisoners did not come out of the club-room; I saw them come out of the bed-room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.You are sure you saw four men come out of the bed-room? A. Yes; my wife caught the first - I took the prisoners, and the fourth escaped down stairs; I had got them both - the waiter came and took Spencer from me, and took him down stairs; I saw him in his custody all the time, till he was given to the constable - he was not out of my sight at all.</p>

On the morning of Sunday, the 21st of June, about ten minutes past four o'clock, I was alarmed by the watchman; I went to the window, and the watchman told me to come down immediately - as soon as I came down I found the parlour window shutters down; they are outside shutters - the upper sash of the window was pulled down, the lower sash remained as it was left; I had secured the windows myself the night before, and had fastened the shutters and doors myself - I went to bed about three-quarters past twelve; I examined the shutters - some instrument had been forced between the shutters which slide up and down - by pressing some instrument against the shutters the inner shutter fell down; all the wood work was torn away by some iron instrument; I opened the door immediately, and the watchman asked what I had lost - I went to the till, and missed eight or ten shillings in half-pence; the parlour door leads to the bar without any passage between - there was a quantity of farthings among the copper, and one twopenny piece, which is not a common thing; I have taken three since I have been in the house, and threw them into the back of the till - there was a pint pot on the counter with some cider in it; it was about two-thirds full - that pint pot was not there the night before - the iron handle of the outside door was wrenched off; that was safe the night before; about one o'clock at noon I missed about two-thirds of a bottle of sherry from the sideboard in the bar - it was a common black wine bottle: I had about two hundred sail needles, which I had had about sixteen years - I had brought them from Malta; I should know them again - they were in a drawer next to the till; I had seen them a day or two before - they were wrapped in a paper; I have known the prisoner about eighteen months - he used to come to my house after a servant of mine; I have frequently seen him there - I discharged that servant about five weeks before this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Had you any reason to suspect my honesty? A.None, though I knew he had been in the Refuge for the Destitute.</p>

On the Sunday morning in question I saw the prisoner, when I was at the top of Saunder's-gardens, at a quarter before four o'clock - I was near my box; I had not seen him before - he was sitting on the step of the Weavers' Arms, Saunder's-gardens, almost two hundred yards from Marks'; he was counting some copper - there were 5s. or 6s. worth, I suppose; he put them into his side-pocket as he counted them, and he had a black wine bottle by the side of him, with some liquor in it - he was in liquor; I asked him where he got the halfpence - he said he took them for his wages; I asked him to go to the watch-house - he said he would; he said he worked over in the Borough - that he got the liquor to go fishing with; the officer of the night took down where he said he worked - he said he earned 35s. a-week; he was dismissed from the watch-house that night, and I apprehended him again at a quarter before six o'clock - I took him to the watch-house, and delivered him to Smith, the constable of the night; he was then rather more in liquor - I have no doubt of his being the same man.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Old-street-road - my beat is near Marks'; my box is within five or six yards of his house - it stands in his yard. On Sunday morning, about twenty minutes to four o'clock, this happened - I was then gone down to the watch-house; I had seen the prisoner, about ten minutes before two o'clock, at the top of a court on my beat, about fifty yards from the house - I have seen him about the street before; he spoke to me, and said he had lost a handkerchief down the court; he asked me to go with him - I went into a house in the court, where he said he had lost it; they produced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160026"/>several handkerchiefs, which he did not own; he called out for Kirby in the house - she is the girl who had lived with the prosecutor; I know her - he asked her if she had seen the handkerchief; she said No, she had seen none but what he had got; she asked if he had lost any thing else - if he had lost any money; he said, "No, I have got none" - I am sure he said he had got none; he was turned out of that house by the man who kept it - I brought him out of the court, and turned him off my beat; he went away past Shoreditch church, and in about ten minutes I saw him come back to the same court again - I went back again, and sent him away; I asked where he lived - he said No. 24, Hoxton; I gave him a shove, and told him to go off my beat - I saw him again about three o'clock; he came past me by the church again, and went round by the church; he was going away from Marks' then - I saw him a fourth time about a quarter before four o'clock, going up towards the watch-house with Oxley, who had got a glass bottle in his hand; I did not know of the robbery at that time - he had no glass bottle the three first times that I saw him; he was not intoxicated the first time I saw him, but the fourth time I thought he was - he had been drinking; about ten minutes before four o'clock I saw Marks' window shutters broken open, and the handle of the door wrenched off - I alarmed him; I had passed his house about three quarters of an hour before - the shutters and door were secure then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.What did I tell you I had lost? A. A handkerchief, nothing else; I heard you playing a flute in the house - you did not say you lost a flute.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have been examined before the Magistrate - did he not say he had lost a flute? A. He did not say so at first, he did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you to go down with me to find it, and you beat me away? A. I went to the house - there were several Irish people, who all took off their hats; it was full three-quarters of an hour from the time I saw him till the time the house was broken open - I saw him come down Shoreditch; the fourth time was when I saw him with the bottle - I was about twenty yards from him when I saw him with Oxley, and could see that he was more intoxicated.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday morning the prisoner was brought to the watch-house. about three o'clock the first time - Oxley brought him again a second time; the first time he brought him was about a quarter before three - he had a bottle then.</p>
               <p>Q.What time was it that he was finally taken into custody? A. I found him at the watch-house between five and six o'clock; he had no bottle then, but he had it the first time, which was a little before three, to the best of my recollection - that was the time that Oxley brought him, he said in his presence he had seen him on the steps counting some farthings and halfpence, and a bottle by his side, and did not think it was all right; the prisoner said he lived with Richard Austin, No. 101, Kent-street, Borough, and he received it as his wages - which were 1l. 16s. per week; I asked what was in the bottle - he said it was liquor; that he generally got it as he was going a fishing - I said, "You could not get liquor at this time in the morning"; he said Yes, he had got it from Mr. Percel's - a man of that name keeps a house, I find; I tasted the liquor - it consisted of different sorts of spirits; there appeared to be wine and rum; I examined him the second time he was brought, and found 2s. 2d. in halfpence, eleven penny pieces, one twopenny piece, thirty-three farthings, one half-crown, two sixpences in silver, one knife, one key and one bundle of needles; I said, "What do you call these?" he said, "Oh, they are one or two bodkins;" the needles were in this paper - I went afterwards to Mr. Marks'.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not ask me the first time to treat you in the watch-house with something to drink? A. After I said you might go, the houseman, said, "You have no objection for us to taste your liquor" - you said, "No, you may taste it all round."</p>

            . This packet of needles is my property - I know it well; they were rusty, and a few weeks before I observed the papers they were in, were loose, and I tied them up in this piece of newspaper, which they are in now; this twopenny piece I know by being bright - I believe it to be mine; I had a great many farthings, more than thirty-three, in the till - I do not think there was any silver in the till - there might be one sixpence; I am certain I lost no half-crown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Oxley saw me the first time at a quarter to two o'clock; I had been down where he was three times - he beat me away; I must have broken open the house, gone there three times, took the property, and got to the watch-house in less than an hour, which is a thing impossible for any body to do - I had the property put on me at the place I lost my handkerchief in; I could say so if I stood before a higher tribunal than this - if I had been guilty, should I have staid two hours near the place to be taken? Smith has been to the house, and found the flute which I lost.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter. On the 6th of June my father went out for about ten minutes, leaving me alone in the shop - and almost immediately he went out three men came in; they were all dressed in blue jackets and trousers - two of them had white stockings and shoes on; the other had lace-up boots: one of them asked if my father was at home - I said he was not, but he would be in a few minutes; he said he wanted to be measured for a pair of morine trousers; I asked if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160027"/>would wait - one of them stood with his back against the counter, and another sat down in the shop; the third walked about, and was talking to the baby which I had in my arms; my mother called me - she was at the parlour window, in my sight; I went out of the shop to her: I came back directly, and the men were all gone - the shop door, which was closed before, was open; I went and looked out, but could not see them - my father came back while I was looking out; nobody had been in the shop but those three men after he went out: I told him what had happened, for as soon as I came back to the shop I missed a roll of black cloth off the counter - I did not know any of the men; I am certain the prisoner was one of them: there was something particularly vulgar about him and the others looked genteel; he talked to the baby: I am sure of him - I described him to Norris, and saw him in custody in about a fortnight, dressed the same as he was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you quite sure it was not because you saw him in a sailor's dress, that you thought him the man? A. I am sure of him - they were all three dressed alike, except one wearing laced-up boots; I should know the others again - I never saw them before: they came in directly my father went out - he turned to the right; they seemed to come from the left; they had not been in the shop above two minutes when my mother called me, and when I returned they were gone; I can swear more particularly to the prisoner - I am sure I should know the others: I was not looking at the prisoner all the time, I suppose about half a minute; I told the officer the other two were of a dark complexion - they had hats on; I am thirteen years old: we had nothing but light goods hanging in the window.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.There was light enough for you to see the prisoner? A. Yes; I am sure of him; his face was broken out - I saw him at Lambeth-street, with another man, and knew him.</p>

             described the men as mates or sailors - that one had a red face, with pimples on it, and the other two were about the same size; I took the prisoner and another man to the Cherry Tree public-house, but not from her description; both were dressed as sailors: Norris and his daughter came to the office - she went into the lock-up room, where there were several, and picked him out from the rest - he was not pointed out to her; I had seen the prisoner several time before, but not since the robbery; she did not know the other man - she was positive of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it made you first suppose him to be dangerously ill? A. I cannot tell - he never spoke to me in the night; one of the lodgers awoke me about three o'clock, and said he was dying - the fight was on the Saturday before the Inquest was held; the prisoner and my husband were coming up the street, and heard a woman cry out Murder! it was five or six women beating each other - my husband fetched a constable: and on Sunday morning the prisoner and the rest of his comrades came out of Rending's house, and struck my husband three times - he ran into the back yard; the prisoner followed, knocked him down, and kicked him while he was down: several men came and kicked him - my husband had struck him once or twice before he was knocked down; the prisoner struck the first blow - I did not see any blows on my husband's head; he had a black eye and a scratch on the side of his face. On the Monday my husband got a warrant against him, and we staid at Deptford till the following Friday; my husband kept his bed until Thursday - he did not look ill on Thursday: we left Deptford on the Friday, and walked to Wandsworth; we staid there till Tuesday morning, and walked from there to Brentford, but not in one day - we were obliged to sleep out of doors one night, as we could not get a lodging; he first complained of his head on the Tuesday morning, as we left Wandsworth.</p>

What shall I do? it will break my poor father's heart; bad company has brought me to it - I did it to extricate myself from a little trouble;" he then asked what he must say before the Justice - I said he must act for himself; he was remanded - he asked me if Ward and Brittle had sworn to any of the property; I said they had - he then said, "Recollect, the nap coating don't belong to them - I bought the coating and my wife bought the cotton."</p>

I was in Coleman-street between ten and eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner and another person - I suspected, and followed them through White Rose-court into Basinghall-street, they went towards London-wall - I missed the prisoner for a short time, and his companion was standing opposite the prosecutors' - when he moved I saw the prisoner with the cloth on his shoulder about ten yards from the prosecutor's door; I could not see him come out of the door as the street turns there; I let him walk on, the other crossed over to him, and I caught hold of both - the prisoner threw the cloth down: the other man said, "You don't want me, Sir, let me go;" he struck me in the face, and got away; I kept hold of the prisoner, got assistance, and took him before the Alderman; Mr. Jardine got there almost as soon as I, and claimed it.</p>

            . I live in Lower West-street, Smithfield, and am a whipmaker - I have not worked in London, but at Bristol; I have been here about two months - I have known the prisoners two months; one of them lives with her mother, but I cannot say in what part of London - I have heard the mother say so; I have heard she is her mother - I have seen the prisoners in the street where I live; they do not lodge in the same house as me- I have seen one with her mother in different parts of the street many times; I have come to certify that I have seen the prosecutor make up what damage there was.</p>


               <p>Q. How did you know they were taken up? A. A friend of theirs met me, and asked me to have a drop of porter the day before yesterday - I did not know they were in custody before the young man told me; he said a friend of his was charged with robbing a man of 6s. - I believe he is a plasterer or bricklayer; I have seen him with his fellow-tradesmen, plasterers - I was not very intimate with him; I have many a time treated him with a pot of beer, but not in the prisoners' presence - the last time I saw the prisoners was in Holborn in the street; I have seen them at the Horse Shoe and Magpie, Saffron-hill, with their mothers - I forget their names; I might know them, and not their names - I saw the prosecutor at the Three Tuns, Brooke-street, Holborn; we went there together, for this girl's friend brought me into his company (pointing to Sullivan) - I do not know where he is, or his name: I saw him this morning, but not since - the prosecutor lives in a street leading out of Holborn to the left: the young girl's friend brought him to the house, and asked how much he had lost by the girl - the man said he did not know that the girl had taken anything; the friend said so - and he said he had lost 6s.; he mentioned 6s., neither more nor less, to the best of my opinion - the young man said he was very sorry for it, and if he would be satisfied to take it, and what expense he was at afterwards, he would pay him; I heard this.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to be wanted on this occasion? A. The young man asked me to drink, and I did not know what it was upon; I did not think what it could be about till I got into the house - then it was talked over; I said nothing, only that it was an unfortunate job that it happened - he had told me it was for picking a man's pocket; I was present at the time the money was offered - the man got 15s., and said he should be satisfied with it, and he took the 15s.; this young woman's friend gave it him - I do not know where he is; he did not send me here.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here? A. I was walking about the yard as other people - I had no business to bring me here; her mother told me the trial was coming on to-day; she was in the street: on my oath the prosecutor stretched out his hand, and took the 15s. in the public-house himself, and shook hands with the party when he left - it was not thrust into his pocket; Saunders was present at the time; the money was reached to the prosecutor, and he took it - it was not put into his pocket in my presence; I saw him receive the money - I swear it was not put into his pocket; when this was done I parted with him.</p>
               <p>Q.You knew what was to be done, that the prosecutor was to have his money returned? A. When I came into the house I did; he did not exactly say he was going to make it up; he had 13s., and another person lent him 2s. - that was the man who came in here with me (Boyd;) I knew the prisoners, one as much as the other - I have been at several houses with them; the Horse Shoe and Magpie - I was never in a private house with them; I do not know where they lived - I was never in their mothers' house; I only know them by meeting them in public-houses.</p>

Why, yesterday morning I saw it up on the gate, and he showed it to me on the gate outside the yard; I do not now know whether it was her name - he asked the man if he wished to come to any terms, and not prosecute his friend; May was sitting alongside in the same seat at the time - the man said he did not know himself what to do; he did not wish himself to do any harm, but he would speak to the watchman first - he went down to Greystoke-place, and inquired after the man; we went altogether, and then returned to another house - I went out a bit, and when I came back the watchman was there: I have seen Sheen outside the Court, but not for this hour and a half. After the watchman came in they began talking, and he asked what expences he was at; he said 15s. - he said, "Will that satisfy you?" he pulled out his money, and said, "All I have is 12s." - he happened to find two sixpences more; I lent him one for about an hour, and his brother, I believe, gave him the other.</p>
               <p>Q.Then four of you were raising the money to prevent the prosecution? A.He asked me for the money; I knew what it was for, but I was sure of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the man took the money. or was it put into his pocket? A.Sheen sat at one end of the table - he handed it down, and this gentleman took it up, whether he put it into his pocket I do not know, but it was said it was better to put it into the landlord's hands till the following evening.</p>

            . I attend the cutting-room. The prisoner came and asked me to cut a pair of patent leaders, and then got me to change two pieces which he had had before - he said I need not tell the master; I said No- they are about the same price; he then wanted two strips of harness leather - I took a hide from behind me, and run out these two strips; he rolled them up separately - I took one of them, and marked 7s. on it, as it is my place to mark on it what I think it is worth; the customer goes down and pays the master; he took them down with him - this third piece I did not sell him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Will you swear this third piece is your master's? A. I cannot, with a clear conscience; it is a great deal like my cutting - there were between forty and fifty of them there; there are other leathersellers not far off - he ordered these two pieces of me; he might have carried them off without my detecting him as he took them down stairs - if my master had asked me I should have accounted to him for two pieces.</p>
               <p>MR. GIBLETT. The prisoner produced to me one piece and said it was 3s.; I said, "Let me see the mark" - he became alarmed, and said, "I will go up;" my brother sent a man up with him, and the man who saw him put one piece into his pocket, saw him take this piece from his hat - I asked him if he had any more; he said, with an oath, he had not - to the best of my belief, this piece, which was in his pocket, belongs to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You did not cut it? A. No - I will not swear that I should have known it if it was off my premises.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you search Johnson's fob? A. I did not; he was asked whether he had any money to pay for the shoes, and he made no answer - he was about two yards from South; I had perhaps shown him half a dozen pairs - sometimes people buy small shoes to make their feet look smaller; he was not long trying them, for I saw I had not a light pair to fit him - the shoes in the shop are my own property.</p>

            . I am an officer. A young man came to me in Golden-lane, and said a man had been robbed of his watch; I went to the Crown and Sceptre to ask what sort of girl it was - she had left her bonnet there; by her bonnet I thought I knew her, and I went and found the prisoner in Golden-lane - she at first denied having any watch: I took her into a house, and found it in her bosom.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I can be upon my Sacrament oath, that I never denied having the watch. Witness. Yes, you did, and in going along, she said, "For God's sake don't tell the man; you may keep the watch;" the prosecutor appeared to have his faculties about him.</p>
               <p> - BABY. I was at the public-house, and saw the prosecutor there - he was a little in liquor; he said,"Take this watch, and get a pot of beer;" the prisoner took it, and went away - he did not give it her; she went out without her bonnet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell my friends that you saw the man give me the watch? A. No, I never said a word about it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Regent-street, and saw two lads and a girl close to Mr. Lee; the prisoner was one - he put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, took it out immediately, and turned into a court; I ran, caught him by the collar, and asked what he had taken from the gentleman's pocket - he said Nothing; I saw the box in his hand, and said, "What is that in your hand?" he put his hand down to his apron - I said, "Come after the gentleman;" I took him along, and he threw down the box - I took him and the box to the prosecutor.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence The watchman called after me when I was half way up the court, and this box came right past my feet; the watchman said I took it from the gentleman - I had just left my work; I was in a hurry, and turned into the court.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Rolls Court. I saw the prisoner go into the Court with this old hat; within half an hour he came out - I went, and said that was not the hat he had on when he went in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever make a mistake in your life? A. I may; the prisoner did tell me where to find his hat - he said it had laid on one side where the others had been; he did not say he took it by mistake.</p>

I told him it was for stealing a skull; a young man with me said it was a skull stolen from Mr. Jones' room, in Leicester-square - he said he did not know any thing about it; I took him to the Mansion-house - we went to Bow-street next day, and then the prisoner said he had had a skull and sold it to Mr. Neate; he had had it three weeks, and bought it of a man in Mr. Robins' rooms, but he did not know his name; Mr. Halls put it off from Wednesday till Saturday, but he did not produce him - he was remanded till Wednesday again, and then Mr. Neate came; the prisoner declined saying any thing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He was not accused of stealing a skull from the auction room? A. Yes, he was, but he said he had not done it; I then went to Mr. Neate's, and found this in front of his window.</p>

               <p>Q. I will give you a second opportunity of considering that answer; what was the reason you left it five weeks before you took him? A. His sister came and cried to me - then he came and insulted me; I did take money of his sister - this receipt is not my writing; I think it is my wife's; I did not take the money myself, but I understood we got it; I think it is my wife's writing, but I never saw it before - my wife is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the insult you speak of? A. He came and demanded wages of me - there were a good many people standing at the door and the back garden.</p>

No - a person did come and offer me the entire of the money; I was told not to take it - I will swear that I never received one fraction from any body since his apprehension; I had received 2s. of him, and he was paying me off as he could - I have not received any money from any body else since he left my service, to my knowledge; I think I can swear that he had paid me 12s., but I had not discharged him, and then he paid me 2s - then my wife got 13s. from his sister; I think I can swear I never received any money from any body else on his account, but it is a long time ago.</p>

            , who then carried on business in Oxford-street. I employed Avis, the officer; a person was to call and buy some goods on the Saturday, with marked money; Avis marked that money, and he was to send the person - I saw the person who brought the money - she laid out 10s. 6d.; Inches put only 9s. 1d. into the till - I went to the person's house to inquire what she had paid; what the prisoner put in was only 9s. 1d. - I always gave a cheque; the cheque is not here- it was only for 9s. 1d.; the prisoner was afterwards searched by Avis, and some marked money was found on him; the prisoner then wished to speak to me privately, but the officer would not allow him - he said he hoped I would look over it, as it was necessity that compelled him to do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The prisoner had no salary? A. No; I know that his friends are respectable - his father is a reduced officer in the army; he had been with my brother from fifteen to eighteen months; I have reason to believe he had no means of clothing himself - my brother advanced him, I think, 5s. about three weeks before the robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he no compensation for his services? A. No; none whatever - he was to serve us two years to learn the trade; we searched the till, and there was more money in it than what I have alluded to - we have no other means of knowing what was put in except by the cheque; he was sometimes employed until eleven o'clock at night.</p>

No; I never gave any body leave to take any thing out of my house; I suspected her because a little girl gave me information - I deny telling her if I was absent from my walk for two hours, that she was to suspect I was in trouble, and to take charge of my property; I have a sister living near me, who I should have given such a job to if I had been in trouble - I owe money to a person, but is a friend, and I was not afraid of him.</p>

My master left me that morning on the walk, which he never did before - I walked all over the walk, but could not find him; I then went to the house, put my hand to the door, and it opened - he often put his back to the door, and it opened; I washed the pails, put them down, and stopped there till eleven o'clock - master being in debt, I thought he was taken up; this sort of thing happened about eight years ago, and then his sister and mother took his things; I thought the same thing had happened to him, and took them to my place - I put the door ajar, and the chairs to it; on my return I found the place as I had left it, and said to myself, "What would I not pay to a body to assist me?" I gave a girl a penny to take care of some chairs, while I ran with the rest of the things; I met a man going to market, and asked him to assist me to take them as far as Spitalfields-market - I then got him to help me to the turnpike; I there took master's blue coat and pawned it for 1s. to pay the man, and that was my day's wages; I piled the things up in my room, and said, "If master comes to night, all his property is here, and to-morrow I will try and find his sister," as I did not know where she lived then; I tried to keep the walk as well as I could when he was in trouble before, for five months; I have a young family, who have no support but from me, and they are now about the streets - he has been a kind master to me, and I thought to do it for a good purpose; he owes Mr. Gunn 25l., and they told me last Saturday, if he did not settle it they would take him up.</p>

            . I never permitted her to take any property away; I certainly did go away once, having married a woman, which caused a few words - I left London for two years - that was about eight years ago; I am in no more difficulty now than other tradesmen - I do not say I could pay at this moment every farthing I owe; I had no apprehension whatever of my goods being seized.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you drunk over night? A. No, quite sober; it is Campbell's house- I used to trade in pigs and potatoes in Gloucestershire: I left there about three months ago - I had saved this money: the prisoner had seen me with it; the prisoner and I have been working at Mr. Maines, at Hanworth-park - I had 14s. a week; I carried this money about, because I thought it the safest way.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How long had you had the money? A. The twenty-six sovereigns had been in my pocket for three months.</p>

On the morning of the 29th of June, the prosecutor applied to me, and said he had been robbed of twenty-six sovereigns, ten shillings, and his watch; the Magistrate granted a warrant - I went to Hanworth with him about two days afterwards, and traced out where the prisoner came from - I went to the place, but he was gone; I left instructions with the constable of the district, who brought the prisoner to me with part of the property.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he meant to tell the truth, must he not have known that he laid on the floor in the office? A. He certainly must know that - I did not bring the women one by one into the street - I sent them out as he could not identify them.</p>

I took a woman named Potter to the work-house, and placed her by the side of two women - the prosecutor was told to look at them; he immediately laid hold of Wood and said, "That is the one who laid hold of the cuff of my coat and tore it; and that is the other who held my arm - she held me down while a third took my money;" I told him over and over again to be cautious - he said positively they were the women; the master said it was impossible Wood could be - I took Potter to the office, and he said there, she was not the woman, she was too thin; and at the work-house gate, he said he was mistaken in Wood - be had declared several times she was one of them - Higgley had said it was impossible.</p>

On the morning of the 12th of April, I got up at four o'clock, and found a pannel had been taken out of the counting-house door by some instrument - the pannel is here; these two holes were in it, and the marks at the side - I saw corresponding marks in the door; I missed this property; I think I should know the tumblers again - one of the same pattern was left behind; I had been in the habit of washing them - one of them had two small marks at the bottom; one of the marks was larger than the other; the tumblers were used the day before - my fellow-servant put them away that night; I fastened the street door, and my fellow-servant fastened the others - this tumbler (looking at it) is one that was left behind - I had seen the spoons the day before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is your master here? A. No: I know he has no other Christian name; I have seen two tumblers produced - they are a very common pattern (looking at one produced by David James) this is the same pattern; I certainly do not wish to swear to it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Look at the one you say is marked? A. Here are two marks at the bottom - they had similar marks to these, but I should not like to swear to them - one is a brown mark.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it not common to find these marks in glass? A. Yes; there is a brown mark, and an air bubble - they are like the marks.</p>

On the night before the robbery, I fastened all the doors and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160047"/>windows except the street-door and garden-gate; at four o'clock in the morning, the watchman rang the bell - I informed master, and came down with him; the pannel was taken out of the counting-house door, and stood outside - these circular marks were on the end of it then; the articles stated were missing; I had been in the habit of washing the tumblers - I put them on the side board in the parlour that afternoon; there are two marks on this tumbler by which I know it - one is a bubble in the glass, and the other a brown spot; I had noticed these marks, and it is the same pattern exactly: I cannot swear it is the same tumbler - the place under the sideboard was broken open, and the sugar basin, tongs, and spoons taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What business is your master? A. A rope manufacturer, and resides in a house on the ground - the counting-house is in his dwelling-house; these are common cheap tumblers.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How long have you been in the habit of washing the tumblers? A. I have been there a year and a half, and was there some time before - this tumbler was there all that time; only two were left out of a dozen- only one in the dozen had these marks.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 27th of May, I apprehended Brown at a lodging-house in George-street; I do not know who keeps it - both the prisoners were in the same room; I had seen them both in bed together in that room about a month before - I have seen them in the house several times, but do not think I have seen them in that room together above twice; I always considered that Brown lived there- I found two duplicates on the mantel-piece, which I gave up to the witness - when I took Brown he was nearly undressed, sitting by the fire; the female prisoner was in the room; I found this small chisel in a table drawer in the room - I went next day to the prosecutor's, and compared it with two holes in the pannel of the counting-house, and one hole which had been made in the street door - it fitted that hole, and fits the two holes in this pannel - I did not take the female prisoner for two or three days after - she was then in the same room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you believe that pannel has been extracted by means of a centre-bit? A. No; it has been marked with a centre-bit all round the edge, but I consider that an instrument has been used to pull it out after it was worked with the centre-bit; I do not swear the holes have been made with the chisel - the female prisoner is an unfortunate girl.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often has the chisel been tried to these holes? A. About half a dozen times; Miller, our chief officer, who has been a carpenter, was sent for to give his opinion on it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it uncommon to find strangers with the female prisoner? A. No; I have been over the house before - there may be two or three persons living there; I have seen the male prisoner in her company a good many times - I have been to the house five or six times, and always found her there, but only found the man there once, except when I apprehended him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did other girls live in this house? A. One or two girls of the town - I do not think there are more than three or four rooms in the house; I returned to the room immediately I had locked the man up- the woman was still there.</p>

On the night of the 21st of April my house was broken into - I had examined all the doors and windows before I went to bed, and they were secure - I was the last person up; I was alarmed about two o'clock in the morning - I got up, and found the trunks in my daughter's bed-room rummaged, and all the things out of their places; the greater part of the things were scattered about, and some were taken away - my daughter had alarmed me; there was a watch missing from her bedroom - I gave an alarm; two officers got over into my yard, and after that I went down stairs and found the pannel of my back door had been removed by a centre-bit; it was quite safe the night before - the hole was sufficiently large for a man to come through, but the door was open when I got down; I missed a hat, which I had worn the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160048"/>day before - I had had it in common wear for about three months, and bought it at Kirkness; it hung up in my passage the night before: I had come home about nine o'clock, and hung it up - I am not positive as to the exact time. I went with the officers in two or three days, and saw a hat in the George, George-yard, Whitechapel, on the prisoner's head - he was in a back room of the house, playing at cards; when I saw him there, I said to the officer, "That is my hat," but not loud enough to be heard by the prisoner - I looked at it while it was on his head, and as soon as I looked at it I made that observation; the hat was then moved from his head - I looked inside it, and perceived the lining had been changed, and that it had a different lining in it when it was stolen; I looked at it, but did not take it into my hands - it was returned to the prisoner: from what I observed of it I felt convinced it was mine, as I do now - he was not apprehended then; I did not let him know that I believed it to be mine - an old hat, a fur cap, a stick, and a small crow-bar were left on my premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do I understand you did not wish to excite the prisoner's suspicion? A. Yes; the officer taking his hat off might have done so. but I understand something passed after, which lulled his suspicion; he was not then asked how he came by it - I did not say it was mine loud enough for him to hear; I did not see him again till he was apprehended, which was four, five, or six weeks after the robbery. I know Morgan - the hat has not been traced to his possession; he is a hatter - I have seen him on the subject of this hat: he swore the lining now in it was once his.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you see the hat after he was apprehended? A. It was brought to my house by the officer the day he was apprehended.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. Three or four evenings after this robbery I went with Mr. Newton to the the George, George-yard, Whitechapel, with Shellswell - the prisoner was in a room, playing at cards; Mr. Newton went into the room, and directly he saw the prisoner I heard him say, "That is my hat that is on his head;" he said so to us - the prisoner could not hear it; Shellswell took it off the prisoner's head - Newton looked at it, and said he had no doubt of it, but it had got a fresh lining; that was not loud enough for the prisoner to hear - the bat was returned to him. I apprehended him on the 27th of May, in a room in George-street, not fifty yards from this public-house - he was sitting by the fire, nearly undressed - he dressed himself, and put on a hat, which was on the table; I told him I took him on a charge of robbery - I did not mention this particular charge: here is the hat which he put on - when we got to the office, but not before the Magistrate, I asked him where he got that hat; I had not then informed him of this particular charge - he said,"I don't know where I got it - it has been looked at before;" when he came up on the second examination, (he had been examined on this charge then) I told him Mr. Newton claimed the hat which he had on his head; I asked him where he got it - he said he bought it of a hawker at Crawley, near Brighton, Sussex.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear he said he did not know where he got the hat? A. He said in a careless sort of way, "I don't know where I got it;" those were his words; after his examination I interrogated him again - that was not for the purpose of making a case out against him particularly; it was not to extort a contradiction - I did not caution him, or tell him what he said would be stated in Court; he was taken about a month after he was at the George - the hat was returned to him at the George; I did not intend him to know I had any charge against him when I was at the George; we whispered together, out of his hearing - one Morgan was examined before the Magistrate; I told him to come there by the Magistrate's order - what he said was not taken down; he was examined in the prisoner's presence, and identified the hat lining.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I accompanied Lea to the George at eight or nine o'clock in the evening, a few days after Mr. Newton's robbery - I found the prisoner sitting in a room; after looking at him for a minute or two. Newton said, "That is my hat; I think that is my hat;" he said it to me, not loud - he spoke to me first, Lea was standing at the door, I was inside the parlour - I then took the hat off the prisoner's head; Newton looked at it, and said, "It looks like my hat, I think it is my hat, but if it is there is a different lining in it;" we came out of the room, consulted together, and did not take Brown that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what Newton said about the lining said in the prisoner's hearing? A. I do not think the prisoner did hear it - I returned the hat to the prisoner; I do not recollect saying any thing to him - he said to me, "Well, are you satisfied;" I said, "For the present;" that was all I said - I was present on the 27th of May when he was apprehended - he had a hat on when he came away; Lea took it from him at the lock-up house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had a consultation about the hat outside the door? A. Yes; Newton said that it was his hat; my reason for not taking him then was, because I have a hat and cap in my possession which was left on the premises, and the moment I saw the cap, and the description of the party who had been seen about the premises the evening before, I said I knew the cap to belong to

            , and believe the hat to be Brown's, having seen him wear a similar one; I thought it best to let him be till we could get them both at once - we have taken Latham, he is committed for trial at Surrey; Morgan came voluntarily before the Magistrate, having been desired to come by me or Lea - I might have told him myself; we certainly went to his house, for Latham's sister lived there; he was brought to the office, and gave an account how the lining went out of the house - I believe he was sworn, but cannot say whether; what he said was taken down - the clerk was there; I might be four or five yards from him, or only a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160049"/>few inches, as we shift about - he did not, to my knowledge, state that another person brought him the hat; the prosecutor had sworn he positively believes the hat to be his; he did say if it was his it was a different lining.</p>

            . I am a hatter. I supply Newton with hats; I sold him one the beginning of this year of this description, texture, and size; I purchase my hats, I do not manufacture them - I have been twenty-seven years in the business, and this hat has been shown to the manufacturer; I only have this particular sort of hats from one manufacturer - I can only swear I sold the prosecutor one of this description, and that this is the manufacture of the person of whom I purchase, and I am satisfied this is not the original lining of this hat; here is some paper put in to prevent the colour of the hat coming through the lining, and in re-lining they have taken part of it out but not the whole - it was fastened with a little bit of paste; the lining is not mine - it is inferior to the lining I put into such hats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to state this part of the lining was not there originally? A. I speak generally of the lining - this under the leather is the lining; it is a fine hat 6 1/2 diameter - when it was finished the size was chalked in it; I do not mark the size in ink; it is a common size, but not so common as seven inches - I cannot tell how many hundreds of this description I have had - I have not bought thousands; I believe the maker supplies most of the respectable houses in the City - he would be as likely to know it as me; the texture, size, and description are all common.</p>
               <p>MR. NEWTON. This is my hat; there are two or three circumstances connected with it which induces me to say so - in consequence of my head not being very well I ordered a light one, and the general shape of the hat was neither liked by myself or family; in the next place, I observed that the beaver was worn off it just here near the leather, and it fits me - and from these circumstances I conclude it is mine; I have tried it on several times - it is the hat I saw on the prisoner's head three or four days after the robbery; I looked then at the mark, near the piece of leather - I did not hold it in my hand to feel the weight of it, I only looked at this mark; except when I saw it on his head, from the general appearance of it, I was convinced it was mine - the leather lining is not the same I had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Put it on; I suppose you are not acquainted with the hat trade? A. No; it is a light hat, my family did not like the shape - it may be as common a shape as is worn.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a better reason now for believing it is yours than before? A. I certainly have - for I have examined it closer than I did at the George; it was not in my hands there, but in the officer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state if it was your's it had a different lining? A. I think I said it was my hat, but it had a different lining - I have no doubt I am correct about it; I will venture to swear it is my hat from its general appearance, the dislike to the shape, and the particular wear near the leather - it is not the shape I usually wear, it is too narrow in the brim.</p>

My beat is within twenty or thirty yards of Mr. Newton's house - I recollect the night his house was broken open; on the night before the robbery I saw two persons passing very near Mr. Newton's; they looked rather suspicious - I looked at them and they went on; it was the night of the robbery, rather before twelve o'clock - there was a gas-light near them, I could see their faces, and should know one again better than the other, having frequently seen him passing my beat before - it was the prisoner; they passed by, and stopped by the lamp for a short time - I was five or six yards from them then; I was relieved by another watchman soon after one o'clock, and communicated what I had seen to him, and gave him a description of the persons I had seen - the other man was nearly a head saller than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first hear of this house being robbed? A. In the morning, as soon as I got up - I went and told Newton what I had seen; I was not taken to see the prisoner till he was at Lambeth-street; I did not tell

Yes; I saw them before they got to the gaslight - I saw the short one better than the taller; I heard no disturbance till Newton alarmed me - I was not in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160050"/>box; I was twenty yards from Newton's - I had been pretty near the house all the time; I had been my round.</p>

            . I heard the alarm. I am superintendant of the parish; I ran to assist - I was the first person by the prosecutor's gates; he was at his window; I climbed over the gates, with a watchman's lantern, and on going to the back door, I stumbled over a cloak, and some boots outside the house - I then found a pannel out of the door; I showed the cloak and boots to Mr. Newton - I found a hat, cap, and a small crow-bar on the premises; the crow-bar was in the kitchen - I examined the premises, and found the trunks open, and linen spread in different places; a watch dog was killed in the yard - it was not quite dead when I got over; it had been knocked on the head, I believe; I saw no marks of its having been stabbed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How did you know it was knocked on the head? A. I apprehend so - it died shortly after; I never saw it after it was skinned - I was subpoened here this morning, I believe by Lea, but I did not see the person - I went before the Magistrate, but my deposition was not taken.</p>
               <p>MR. NEWTON. The great coat and boots shown to me by Larkins, were my property; I had a watch dog - he died about six o'clock in the morning, and was quite well when I saw him at nine the night before; I saw the skin after he had been skinned, and there appeared to be a settlement of blood about the neck.</p>

            . Q.Do not you know that many hatters do mark the dimensions of a hat with ink? A. Very probably - I do not think it is common for a hatter lining a hat which he did not make, to mark the dimensions - this lining is marked 6 1/2 in ink; it is not my mark, nor the manufacturer's - I mark my hats on the paper, outside; no maker would mark it as this is done - this leather has been put in by a hat liner.</p>

            . I am a hat seller, and occasionally line hats. I was examined before the Magistrate; I went there voluntarily - Lea, the officer, told me to come- I was sworn; I believe Lea and Shellswell heard what I said - they were in and out; I believe what I said was taken down - I did not take notice; I signed no examination; I do not know the prisoner - I know the lining of this hat; I cannot say that I lined it, but to the best of my belief, I did - the leather is mine; it bears my private mark - it is not my own writing but I know the hand; I do not manufacture hats - I know the leather, but I cannot speak to the other part of the lining; I do not recollect lining a hat, but I have an entry in my book of a job having been done on the 26th of April, which might be for lining.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Are you able to say on your oath, you never sold that hat? A. I swear I did not; I have no recollection of lining it, but many things are done in my shop which I do not know of; I was asked before the Magistrate if I had lined it for the prisoner, and said I did not.</p>

            . I was with Sole at the Lion, Edmonton - I knew a woman who was acquainted with Sole; I went out with her that evening, and did not see Sole again till a quarter-past six o'clock, when he found me at the cow-house, and told me five men had been robbing him- he had been drinking, but knew what he was about; his waistcoat hung all over his shoulder, where it was torn, and his breeches pocket was turned out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he come to you to complain? A. No; he came after the girl; I was sober - the woman was drinking with Marn and Camplin; Sole was not drinking with her - I saw no gin and water; Sole was on one side of her.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by hustling you? A.Shaking me about to fatigue me; rolling me about - as I was singing out for mercy louder, the one, who had gone a few paces, called out, "Poole, cut his bl - y throat;" I had seen Poole's person before, but not to know who he was - there was sufficient light for me to be certain of him; I knew his features, and was certain at the time that I had seen him before - I am certain he is the man who stood over me; after the other had left, and called out to him, seeing the watchman coming, the other sang out to him again: and Poole thrust his hand again into my pocket - he thrust the whole of it in a second time; I had, when I left the house, 14s., some halfpence, and a blue handkerchief, with a small piece of roast pork, and a piece of Berwick pork in it, that went from me at the same time with my money - I had half a crown, some shillings, and sixpences; I am certain I had half a crown - they were loose in my waistcoat pocket; they did not con<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160052"/>tinue with me above three or four minutes - I was more frightened than hurt; they went away on the watchman's coming up - I am positive of Poole by his features; I never saw the other man's features, and cannot speak to him - I saw Poole at the watch-house on Monday morning, and knew him; I have not seen my property since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say you were not drunk? A. I do; I told the watchman I had lost my hat - I did not say I had been robbed of all my money: I found I had left my hat at home - I always do so, unless I am going some distance; I went to the watch-house almost directly - I said the man, who wore the straw hat, was the tallest; I had been at three public-houses that evening, and drank at them - I had a glass of water at the watch-house; I drank nothing but water after the robbery.</p>

            . I was ten years old last November, and live at the Needle-makers' Arms. I was looking out of the window, about a quarter-past twelve o'clock - I had seen Poole in the tap-room; before I went up stairs he came to the bar - I had not seen Lindsey; Poole came to the bar about half-past eleven o'clock at night, just before the bar was shut - I went up, was at the window, and about ten yards from the house I saw a man down on the ground, and two men leaning over him; I did not know any of them - one man was taller than the other, and the tallest one had a dark straw hat on; I did not take much notice, for I thought it was a man named Collins, who I had seen in our house, and who was rather intoxicated; but it was not him.</p>

            . I am servant at the Needle-makers' Arms. Salmon was at our house that night, and had a straw hat on; I saw him and Poole leave the house together, about twenty minutes before twelve o'clock - I did not see Lindsey there; I heard a noise, as if people were quarrelling, in two or three minutes - I did not go out of the house, as my master would not let me; Salmon's hat was an old straw one, and it appeared to me as if it had been painted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know Salmon before? A. No; I am sure he had a straw hat on - It was a very dark colour; I saw it was straw, for it was not painted under the brim - the scuffle appeared to be just outside the door; they were not knocking at our door to get in again.</p>

I left the house at four o'clock on Monday afternoon, the 6th of July - all was safe then; we have a porter lives in the house- my father had not been in town that day; I returned on Tuesday morning, and had information from the porter - I examined, and found a strange key in the warehouse door, which is connected with the hall; it cannot be got at without entering at the street door - it is an inner door; I afterwards saw the real key in possession of the porter - I missed ten pieces of silk from the warehouse; they are valued at 80l., which is considerably under the value; I had seen them safe when I left the house - I have seen nine of them since, and am certain of them; (the prisoner is an entire stranger to me) he was then in custody at Worship-street; the warehouse is part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Your father does not sleep there? A. No, he has not for six years - the servant sleeps in the lower warehouse, from which the goods were taken; they had been sent from Colchester, in a basket, two days before the robbery; my brother put tickets on them, with the length and quality, and those tickets were on them when I saw them at the office; some of them have come off since, as they have been handled about. I think I can identify them without the tickets, but will not say till I see them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Comber; I have slept there these twelve months as his servant. I went to bed on Monday night, about nine o'clock; the house was all safe then - I was not disturbed in the night; I got up between six and seven - the warehouse door was secure, as I had left it at night; I had left the key in the door: after I got up I went into the upper warehouse, where I have a little room - I remained there till between seven and eight o'clock; when I came down I unlocked the warehouse door, put the things right, came out at eight, double-locked the warehouse door, and took the key up stairs with me - all was safe then, and the street door also; I came down about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, and had to go about eight doors off - I was gone two or three minutes, and as I came back I found the warehouse door ajar, and a strange key in the key-hole; I stepped into the warehouse, and saw a letter lying on the floor - it belonged to the gentleman who had sent the silk up, and should have been in the basket - I was then certain the basket which contained thirty-one pieces of silk, had been opened; I found only twenty-one pieces left - I had left the street door ajar, and found it still so: some person belonging to Mr. Smith's family, who live up stairs, had opened the street door; I saw the silks at Worship-street last Saturday, and the prisoner in custody - the silks were wrapped round with square pieces of paper, attached to each piece, but at Worship-street the paper had been taken away, and was loose in the bag, but the tickets were on the silk; I am certain of its being the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are the prosecutor's servant? A. I have charge of the warehouse, and sleep there; I pay no rent, and have not less wages on account of sleeping there - the property was taken from the lower warehouse; I saw it safe that morning - I am certain it was safe at eight o'clock, for I am sure nobody had been in the warehouse then: I went to No. 10, at twenty minutes to nine - the warehouse was broken open between eight and the forty minutes I was up stairs; I am quite sure I locked the door.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. A little after nine o'clock, on the 7th of July, I went to Whitton's house- the street door was open; I found the prisoner's wife in the room - I asked her if she had any thing there that did not belong to her; the prisoner was not present - I searched under the bed, and found a black bag, containing nine pieces of silk, which were afterwards claimed by Mr. Comber; I took the woman to the office, with the silk, returned to the house, and in a little while saw him go in in company with another man - I followed, and took them both into custody in the passage; I asked the prisoner if any property had been brought in there, for I took him for some silks - he said he knew nothing of any silks at all, for no bag of silks had been brought in before he went out; I took them to the office - the other man was discharged; Mrs. Whitton lives in the lower part of the house: I found in the room two skeleton-keys on the top of the drawers, and four other keys - I tried one of the skeleton-keys to the warehouse door, it would open it with difficulty;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160054"/>I saw the key which was in the warehouse door - that was a skeleton-key; some of the silks had papers round them, and the paper of the others were loose in the bag - there were nine papers in all, and tickets to the silks - some were loose in the bag; here are five papers which were loose in the bag - the tickets have all come off since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you kept them ever since? A. Yes; I found only his wife at the lodgings at first - the prisoner made no resistance; I handcuffed them - the wife did not refuse to go with me; she told me there was nothing there, and when I found it she said it was brought in by somebody who she did not know, while her husband was asleep.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Tuesday morning, the 7th, about eleven clock, I was seat for to Mr. Comber's warehouse; I examined the premises, and found the skeleton key in the door - I took it out, and tried it; I at first could not unlock it, as the key was bent a little; I got a locksmith, took off the lock, and found it would unlock it, but it had been strained in unlocking it; when I got back to the office I found the prisoner in custody with the bag, and the silk - I saw the silk in it; Mr. Comber swore to it, and described the tickets before he saw them - they corresponded with his description.</p>
               <p>MR. COMBER. I know the hand-writing on the tickets to be my brother's - I am positive of the silk; I know nothing of the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You know the silk by the tickets? A. That is a very strong corroborative circumstance; the goods are manufactured at Colchester - there is a particular make about the Colchester goods; I could not identify it by the fabric by this light, but I saw it by day-light at the office. and have no doubt of it; we are the only manufacturers at Colchester - we make for wholesale business - retail dealers would have such goods no doubt; I think I can identify them without the tickets, which were on the goods at the office, and I know them by the peculiar manner my brother folds them.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at Uxbridge. Six or seven months ago I was in a public-house, and Biggs, who was there, said he had been to Ryslip, and had been raffling with six others for these knives and forks at 1s. a piece, and he had got them for 1s., - he offered them round, and I asked what he wanted for them - he said 5s., and I bought them; there are knives and forks of the same appearance sold about, at that price - I did not know he was in Mr. Benham's service, but as soon as I heard that Mr. Benham had been robbed, I went and asked if these were his - he said they were.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How came you to go to Mr. Benham? A.Because Drinkwater said he bought this powder-horn and shot-belt, which were Mr. Benham's.</p>

On the 12th of April, 1819, Elizabeth Briggs, the prisoner, was in our service - I knew all the rest of her family, but not her father, who is the other prisoner; I had another servant at the time - on that day, we were at dinner about four o'clock, and I heard Elizabeth scream on the stairs; we all ran out, and saw her screaming, and very much terrified - I asked what was the matter; she said there were thieves at the top of the house - we ran up stairs, and found the wardrobe open, and every thing in the bed-room in disorder; I eventually missed all the property stated: I have found a black square veil, a brooch, a spice-box, and a pair, of black ear-rings, which are now in Court - they were found on the 30th of June last; I had left my articles all safe at two o'clock on the day they were stolen - I had been very unwell, and had not left my bed-room till that time: I had no suspicion at all of Elizabeth Briggs - she remained in my service from six to nine months afterwards - I never discovered who the thieves were; I lost a 30l. note and some medals in a mahogany case.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mile-end Old-town. I have known Thomas Briggs about six months - he is the father of the other prisoner - he came to me on Monday, the 29th of June, respecting a warrant which he wanted against his son George for striking him- I said he must apply to the office; he then said he wished to speak to me respecting a robbery which took place ten years ago; I told him to go to the watch-house, and said I should be there presently - he went to the Hay Field public-house, and I found him there; he told me his daughter had committed a robbery on a Mr. Taylor, of Fleet-street, and among the other property was a 30l. note; he said that note had been changed at Mr. Manning's, a linen-draper, at Aldgate, and with the produce of it he had built a cottage in Pocock's-gardens, Bethnal-green - he said there were a number of medals which he had pawned at a pawnbrokers's, in Church-street, Mile-end, New-town, and that the property was brought away in a mahogany box, and the box was sawed up for fear of a discovery; I went to Mrs. Taylor's, and found the robbery had been committed at the time; I found Elizabeth Briggs by the direction which her father gave me in writing, at No. 34, Union-street, Well-street, Oxford-street, where she was living with her uncle, who is a shoe-maker - I said I wished to speak to her; I went upstairs with her and Mrs. Taylor - I asked her if she knew any thing of the robbery - she burst into tears, and said she did; I asked if she knew any thing of the mahogany box - she said she did; she at first said she found it on the stairs, but afterwards said she did not, and admitted that she took it home to her father and mother, then living in St. John-street, Clerkenwell, but could not recollect how she took it - I asked if she knew the contents - she said she did not, it was not opened in her presence; I searched her box, and found this lace square, and after her examination she told me I should find these other articles at her brother's - I went there, and found two boxes which were sealed and brought away - these things were in them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ask how she came to do this? A. Yes, and she stated that her friends were in great distress, through her father's miscorduct and drunkeness, and she had never had a day's health since; she was in great distress - I had her in my arms for nearly two hours at the office; she said she had many times thought of going to divulge it to her mistress - I have heard a very good character of her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am the pot-boy. On Sunday evening the prisoner told me to get up soon in the morning - I got up at a quarter before six o'clock and said to her,"Shall I go now?" she said, "It is too soon;" I said,"I will go, and get some of my pots in;" and at ten minutes before eight I said, "Shall I go now?" she said Yes - she went into the bar-parlour, and brought out a tin box, took a watch out of it, and told me to go and pawn it at the corner of the street for 1l., which I gave her; there was one five shilling piece, six half-crowns, and the duplicate wrapped in a little bit of paper - she gave me 1s.; I did not tell of this as soon as I heard it was lost - I heard of the watch being lost, but did not know it was the same; I told this to my father on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who do you think ought to be standing at the bar now? A. It is not a tobacco-box that she took it from; it is a little oval box - I will swear it was ten minutes before eight o'clock; after I pawned it I said to her, "What has that young man lost up stairs?" she said, "A watch;" she went in directly - I was almost out of my mind; I did not know what I was about - it never struck me that it was the same watch; she said she had had it ten years, ever since her mother's death -I did leave the house without giving notice.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>EDWARD HAMILTON. I am an officer of Surrey.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Do you think a person in my circumstances could afford to make you a present of a turbot? A. Certainly not: I knew nothing of its being stolen -Benn brought me my handkerchief the same morning; I did not see you at the Surrey theatre on Tuesday night, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can assure you I was at this time, in a state of intoxication - these men made a tool of me: I had no occasion to do such a thing - my friends could afford to keep me, if I had no situation; I did not attempt to conceal it - I ran about the market like a drunken fool; there were a hundred persons in the public-house, and if they had acted like friends, they would have returned it to the man, and there would have been an end of it; but they kept it till they were obliged to give it up, and then come against me - if I am detained in prison, I shall be obliged to resort to what I have now done in a drunken frolic, to get a living.</p>

            . We gave the warrant to Nicholls to bring up twenty bags of sugar for Robert Smith and Co.; the prisoner brought them to the warehouse about five o'clock that afternoon; we were weighing, to send five of them into the country, and we found two of that pile deficient in weight; one was 1 qr. 6 lb., and the other 1 qr. 13 lbs. deficient - the two bags had evidently been cut open and sewn up again, but I could not judge whether that had been done recently; they were very dirty - the prisoner was gone before we discovered it.</p>
