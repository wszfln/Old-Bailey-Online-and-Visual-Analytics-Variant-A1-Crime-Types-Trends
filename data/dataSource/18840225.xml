I live at Sussex Lodge, Lee, Kent—I am now a traveller in the hop trade—I was formerly a hop-merchant—I had know the prisoner for some years before 1881 and had had many transactions with him—I had sold him large quantities of hops—in the middle of 1881 he owed me about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I almost constantly asked him for payment—I don't know that he was doing anything at that time, he had been a broker in the Baltic—I had seen Mr. Miller two or three times with him-about July, 1881, Hales said, "Mr. Miller is about putting 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and my father is to advance 2.000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and we are going to start a broker's business together, but Miller has only just come of age, so haa not yet come into his money; but to assist me he will give me two acceptances of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you will draw upon him'—I said "I cannot consent to do so until I know his status; if he has no banking account how can I find out?"—he said "We will go to Somerset House and see his father's will, he also comes into property through his uncle"—we went together but could not find the will or wills—after that he gave me another date of the probate of the will—I did not find it at that time—I sent a messenger down to Horley—I then discovered the date and went to Somerset House a third time and saw two wills—I was satisfied he was a man of considerable property, and consented to draw the bill—I drew two bills, one for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the other for 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the subscription room at the Corn Exchange, Mark Lane—Hales was with me then—I handed them to him and he promised to return them with Miller's acceptance to them the next day—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them; it is in the same state now as when I drew it, except the "payable at"—two or three days elapsed before I saw him again—I said to him</p>

               <p>"You have not yet brought me back those acceptances"—he said "My Miller has been away from home, but I am going to dine with him to-morrow night and I will bring them up the following morning"—he did so and handed them to me—I noticed the writing across the bill I and said, "Why did you not let Mr. Miller accept the bill without your writing on it?"—he said "Mr. Miller is not used to accepting bills, so I put those words 'Accepted payable at' and he signed his name"—I "Accepted payable at" is in his writing—I have never seen Mil Miller's signature if that is not it—nothing more passed then—I took I the bill for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to my bankers, the Central Bank—I told them Mr. Miller had no banking account, but they could find out his status by inquiry at his mother's bankers, the London and County Bank, at Reigate—I left the bill at the Central Bank four days for them to make inquiries—I then went to the Bank—they would not discount it—after I had discounted it with Hales I told him the bank would not take it because he had no banking account—I took it to Mr. Daniels and said that he had no banking account, but he could find out at the Central Bank—that is where he offered it for discount—I had discounted bills for Mr. Daniels before, thousands of pounds—on 29th August I received from him this cheque for 236<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and as I left the office I received I this memorandum from his clerk, who said, "If you are in a hurry I will fill it up"—I signed it and it was filled up afterwards. (<hi rend="italic">This was a memorandum for </hi>250<hi rend="italic">l. </hi>5<hi rend="italic">s., and stated that the bill was only drawn to the acceptor thereof, and had been discounted on the faith of that representation.</hi>) I afterwards saw Hales again—he wanted me to give him first, half the proceeds of the second acceptance and then a smaller amount, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think was mentioned—I said "No, you will never have another shilling out of me, you have had too much already; I cannot discount the other I bill except at large interest, and I had rather hand it you back and wait till your affairs are arranged, when you promised to pay me in full"—I returned the bill to him next day and have not seen it since—on 10th September I filed my petition in bank<lb/>ruptcy; and in October, about two months before the bill was due, Mr. Daniels came over and had a conversation with me—as we were talking in the street Hales came along—I called him over to us and said, "Now, Mr. Daniels, tell Mr. Hales what you have told me"—he hesitated, and I said, "Then I will tell him," and I told Hales that Mr. Daniels said that Mr. Miller repudiated the bill being his signature, that it was forged; and that he (<hi rend="italic">Hales</hi>) was the former—he said, "Let him prove it"—Hales said also that nothing could be done till the bill matured—there was some more conversation—we went and had a glass of sherry, and Hales said that he knew a bill discounter who did not object to forged bills, as they were generally paid—Mr. Daniels said, Yes, they are generally taken up at maturity or beforehand" three or four weeks after that I met Hales again in the street and said "Hales, tell me straight, is this a genuine acceptance or is it not? Don't add to your other injuries of me that of passing a forged bill on me"—he said, "That is all right, I have got the very blotting-paper it was I written on, I have taken care of myself"—I saw him again three or four I weeks before the bill matured, and he asked me if I thought Mr. Danie's would renew 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the bill—I said, "I never asked him to do such a thing, and I certainly should not with regard to this bill; there has been</p>

               <p>a doubt thrown upon its genuineness, and it must go through and the matter be cleared up"—I think that was in November, 1881, and the next time I saw him was at the Mansion House on this charge—on the day the bill came due I was at Mr. Daniels's office waiting to see the I result—after that Mr. Daniels prosecuted me on this memorandum—I was tried before His Lordship in the other Court in August, 1882, and I acquitted—I then brought an action against Mr. Daniels for malicious I prosecution, which was tried before Mr. Justice Gave last April, and I got a Verdict for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am now a hop merchant at 14, Southwick Street, by myself—my last transaction in hops with Hales was within four years ago—I sold him the hops but never got the money—he owed me for money borrowed—I did not deliver the hops, but I made a loss on them and I considered he owed me the balance—it is nine or ten years since I sold and delivered goods to him—I lost about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the last hops, and it was a trade debt existing at the time of my bankruptcy—in July and August, 1881, I was employed by Mountain, Horsley, and Co. on commission—I had an agreement; I don't know where it is, I have not seen it for two years—I had no salary, I was paid half the profits—I owed Mountain and Co. about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in July, 1881—I was not being I prettied for payment—I had Six months previously arranged with all my creditors to pay them 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—in September, 1881, I failed for 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and went into liquidation by the advice of my creditors—there were no assets because I had already handed them everything—this account is correct—my furniture and fixtures are put down at 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my trade books were seized by the sheriff at 87, High Street, Borough, and taken away with all the furniture—Mr. Chapman, who was then my solicitor, had all the books and papers we could find; some of them were given to my trustee, but not the principal ones—I do not think any of them referred to the business—I tried my utmost to get them; I sent a clerk and a traveler to the sheriffs office—I did not go till afterwards—it is somewhere near the Elephant and Castle—I never got them—I did not put down Mr. Hales in my statement of affairs because he had gone into liquidation and the debt was worth nothing—I thought he had gone into liquidation before November—I put him down as a debtor to me for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; if you call Mr. Lovering he will prove it—if Hales did not go into liquidation till two months afterwards he had been trying to go into liquidation without a penny of assets—I told my creditors at the meeting what the debt was worth, and the question was asked in the Queen's Bench, and Mr. Lovering got into the box and explained it—I did not, put Hales into the list of creditors because I knew he had not got anything; he had been living on me for two years—I did not put Mr. Daniels in the statement of accounts because I knew it was perfectly good and certain to be paid—I have writing to show that Mr. Daniels owed me money; I think my solicitor has it, and I have an acknowledgment of Mr. Hales owing me money—when I mentioned Hales owing me money my creditors laughed—I pressed Hales for payment in 1881 through a solicitor, Mr. Rice, who saw Hales, and reported to me that Hales did not owe me any money, but that I owed him money—that is Mr. Rice—he did not say that Hales owed me no money, but that he did not owe so much as I claimed—he did not tell me that Hales said that I owed him money—I did not instruct Mr. Rice to</p>

               <p>press him again, because Hales came to me and asked me to give him time for the sake of his wife and family, and when he went into liquidation he put me down as a creditor for over 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him a cheque in 1881, which he professed to get the money for, but never did—I think my bank book for 1881 is with the trustees, I mean Mr. Lovering—I have had no notice to produce it—I cannot tell you without the bank-book whether I paid Hales 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 16th July—he borrowed money of me—I had been pressing him for money for two years, and yet I lent him money; he got it out of me as a temporary loan—he told me Mr. Miller was going to put 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the business—he told me that Miller owed him I think 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which had something to do with racing—he did not tell me that Mr. Miller would accept a bill for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he asked me to draw on Miller for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and credit Miller's account with 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and credit him with the balance—it is not true that he asked me to draw for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he only; he asked me to draw for 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making up 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not say anything before Mr. Justice Cave about the drawing for 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because he had returned the other—I went with Hales to Somerset House to find the probate of the will—I did not find it the first time; we afterwards found his uncle's and his father's; one was sworn under 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other under 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the probate of a will which I took for Mr. Russell Miller's father's, dated in 1872, from which I considered that Mr. Russell Miller was worth 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the two wills I saw roved that—Mr. Hales and I were not in the habit of accepting bills for each other—after he owed me this large sum I told him I was short of money; he said "I shall get my affairs settled in two months; if you will discount a bill, I will give you the proceeds"—I had discounted several bills with him to the amount of 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell you whether there were 22—all those bills were met at maturity—the whole of the original writing in the bill is by me, and it was written when I handed it to Mr. Hales, and at that time not one word of this acceptance was written—I swear that the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the figures at the top of the bill were written by me before any word of the acceptance was written, and that the drawing by me included the name of the person on whom it was drawn, that is my writing too—when Mr. Hale had had it a few days he brought it back with the acceptance on it with the other one—I had two acceptances, which I believed to be genuine, of Mr. Miller, and I made inquiries and was satisfied that he could pay them both—I was pressed for money at that time—the Sheriff was in possession of my goods two months before, in June, but certainly not in August, when the bill was drawn—I am not sure whether he was in possession in September—my books were seized previous to October—I said in my statement of 10th September that my goods had been seized by the Sheriff—I do not think they were seized in August, it was previous to the bill being drawn—I cannot tell you the date when the execution was paid out—I am not certain whether they were seized again in August and taken away and sold, but I was not pressed for money—I owed Mountain l,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and they agreed to give me any amount of time—Clittock had got a judgment against me, it was a dispute about some stores which I sold to him; he got a judgment behind my back, and my creditors said "Go into liquidation"—I had sold Clittock the business for between 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was to take the book debts and the goodwill of the business—he afterwards said that the business was not worth it, and</p>

               <p>Some of the book-debts he had never got the money for, and he brought I an action against me, and got judgment in my absence for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we I referred it to Mr. Dawson, of Fenchurch Street—the debt was proved I because he had judgment; my solicitor objected, he wanted 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I could not afford it—I undertook to pay my creditors half my income, and I have done it—I cannot tell how much I have paid them till the account is settled—when I got that bill of exchange I met. Mr. Daniels in the street, who said "You have not been to see me lately," inferring that I had been to some other bill discounter, and I had been to Mr. Shoolbred—I then told Mr. Daniels of this bill; I did not tell him that I had drawn it on Mr. Russell Miller in payment for hops which I had sold to him, and if Mr. Daniels has sworn so it is false—I heard Mr. Daniels swear it in the other Court, and he swore it falsely—I did not see Mr. Daniels that day; the only person I saw was Mr. M'Donald—I received a cheque for 236<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for interest and com<lb/>mission, and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was kept back—the bill was for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the interest was, I think, 1 1/2 per cent.—you have the discount slip—a commission was charged, I don't know how much, you can easily deduct it—I think the agreement was that the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid to me it the bill was paid—it is a very common thing to leave a deposit on a bill—it was a deposit, not a bet; if the bill was paid I was to have 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—Mr. Daniels came to me about the middle of October and asked me who wrote the words, "Accepted, payable at the London and County Bank"—I told him that they were Mr. Hales's writing—I have heard Mr. Daniels swear that I told him I did not know; that is not true—he then said, "Ah, I thought so, and he has forged it," and that he had had expert's opinion, which was that the man who wrote the one wrote the other—I did not some to the same conclusion—I said that Hales had treated me very badly, but I did not think he would be guilty of such a thing as that—I the suggestion that forged bills were generally met, was made both by Mr. Daniels and Mr. Hales; I do not know which made it first—after that conversation we went to Webster's, a pastrycook's in Moorgate Street, and had a glass of sherry together; I cannot say who paid for it—I paid the cheque for 236<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. into my bank; Hales did not have a penny of the money, I refused to give it to him—I paid 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mountain and Horsier next day—the rest was not entirely used for my personal expenses—that was the last payment to my account before the account stopped—when the bill became due on 3rd December I was not seeing Hales daily—I used not to meet him at the railway-station after the middle of November—I never went down to Horley to see him—I knew where he lived, but just before or just after the bill became due I heard that he had gone, and I did not go down—he was not at Horley till 22nd January, because Mr. Daniels went down—I did not go with Mr. Daniels to look fur him, but I went to see his brother-in-law, and went to several places where I thought we might find him—Daniels brought an action and did not succeed, and afterwards prosecuted me, and last April I got a verdict against him for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the amount of the costs, I believe they were taxed—Mr. Daniels has not paid damages or costs—he disputes them on account of the judgment against me on this bill—I have agreed to take a letter of apology, which I value more than the money, but until this trial ii over he will not give it to me.</p>

Williams and Co. because he told me that that was the name of the party who was going to change it—here are two more, they are the same—this acceptance of mine of 7th June, 1881, is drawn by Edward Hales, junior—he was to give me the proceeds of it—it never was dis<lb/>counted, he told me he had destroyed it—i also gave him this bill of 6th August, 1880, drawn by me on Hales for 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to get dis<lb/>counted, but he never did so.</p>

Miller, for payment for hops sold to him—I believed it was drawn in respect of that transaction, and on the faith of that statement I gave him the cheque—he told me Mr. Miller had been repre<lb/>senting him as a man of means, and he had been to Somerset House and had satisfied himself to that effect, having found he was entitled to considerable property under his father's will—I then had the cheque made out by Mr. McDonald, my clerk, and on that occasion Mr. Barton signed this document—it is not true, as far as my knowledge goes, that lie was called upon to sign it just as he was going away, and had got the money, but it was done by my clerk—I was in the office at the time, and was cognisant of what was going on—I don't know the date, but it was previous to the maturity of the bill; I believe it was in September, but I was away at the time—Mr. Miller had been written to in my absence immediately after Mr. Barton's liquidation—I believe I did not write to him, nor was he written to with my immediate authority—I told Mr. Barton that Mr. Miller had denied that the bill was his acceptance—he did not answer my letter, he referred me to his solicitors—I have said"! believe I told Barton soon after he signed his petition that Miller had denied that the bill was his acceptance; I saw him at Mr. Mountain's office soon after he filed his petition, and said that Mr. Mountain had cast a doubt upon the genuineness of the acceptance" (<hi rend="italic">see Sessions Paper, vol. xcvi., p.</hi> 452)—that is true substantially; all those proceedings were ratified by me fully—it may have been a month after that conversation that Hales came up to me in the street—I had said to Barton that I believed Mr. Hales had committed this forgery, and I say so still—I went with Barton and Hales after that conversation and had a glass of sherry—it is true that when I first asked Mr. Barton who wrote those words "Accepted, payable at the London and County Bank, Lombard Street," he said that they were Mr. Hales's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you swear this: "I asked him in whose writing the words ‘Accepted, payable at' were; he did not tell me it was Mr. Hales's writing, he said that lie had no reason to believe but what it was Mr. Miller's genuine acceptance; he did not tell me it was Mr. Hales's writing, he distinctly said that he did not know"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is not my recollection; there may have been some fencing about it, but it is certain he said that those words were in Hales's writing—I said "He did not tell me it was Hales's writing, he distinctly said that he did not know"—at that time no doubt that was true, but Mr. Barton told me positively that the words were in the writing of Hales—I have sworn that when I first asked him about Mountain's office he distinctly said that he did not know, and I believed it to be true, but on a subsequent occasion it was rectified—it ¦was in the civil suit, in answer to interrogatories, that he told me it was in Hales's writing—it was not till the latter part of 1882 that it was elicited that the words were in Hales's writing—before that he had told me positively nothing more than he had told me on the first occasion—I never thought that Mr. Barton had committed that forgery—I said when I was examined here (<hi rend="italic">Page</hi> 453),"Barton said to me 'Did you suspect me of any complicity of knowing this to be other than a genuine bill? 'I said' Not at all, I knew that you were innocent, or I should not haw come to see you;' and I would not have gone to see him if I had thought he was guilty of forgery: I am doubtful now whether he is guilty of forgery; it is only a matter of belief: I said 'I have all through exonerated the defendant Barton from any participation in the forgery, and I say so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188402250011"/>
               <p>now: my belief is a fluctuating belief, and on the balance I do not believe Mr. Barton is a forger—that was a true expression of my belief at the time I made it, but I am doubtful now, and have been many times at various intervals; I had rather exonerate the man than convict him of forgery"—I abide by that—Mr. Hales left Horley, I believe, in February—I do not know whether it was February 10—I heard in September that it was not Mr. Miller's acceptance—a month later I had a conversation, at which time I believed Mr. Miller was guilty of forgery—on 3rd December the bill became due—I believe it was in March that I made application against Hales, but all those proceedings were in abeyance pending the proceedings in the civil action against Miller and Barton—made my application in March, and I believe Mr. Hales had left the country in February—I never sent thin advertisement down to his father's house at Horley, nor did my solicitor to my knowledge. (<hi rend="italic">Offering </hi>50<hi rend="italic">l. reward for the apprehension of Edward Hales, jun.</hi>)—I abandoned my action against Miller, and then indicted Barton for obtaining money by false pretences, which were that he said the bill was given by Mr. Miller in payment for hops sold to him—he was acquitted, and brought an action against me, and recovered 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damages, which I have not paid, or the costs; having a judgment against Mr. Barton on the bill in question I set the one against the other, not having received any money under the judgment—the agreement between us is that we are simply abiding by what took place in the Court of law; he got 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against me, and I got 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against him—I don't know what his costs were in the action for malicious prosecution, but the estimate is about 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the taxed costs—I have written a letter to Mr. Barton within the last fortnight about apologising, since this case was committed for trial—the words (<hi rend="italic">Page</hi> 452), "I cannot give any opinion whether the words 'Accepted, payable at the London and County Bank, Lombard Street,' and' G. Russell Miller,' appear to be in two different writings, but I believe they are," are a misprint or a mis<lb/>report; it means that they are in the same writing; I certainly did not swear that they were in different writings; I believe now that they are in the same writing—I did not say at the police-court, "I adhere to what I said at the Court; I cannot give any opinion whether the words' Accepted, peyable at the London and County Bank, Lombard street,' and 'GK Russell Miller,' are in two writings, but I believe they are"—that is an extract from my evidence which was quoted to me by Mr. Besley—I said that they were in the same writing—if you have the shorthand writer here who took the notes I cannot help it—I understood my depositions when I signed them—before I showed that bill to an expert I submitted it to an optician two years ago, and came to the conclusion that the acceptance and the signature are written under the writing of the body of the bill—that is my judgment now for what it is worth—I did not try to get Mr. Barton to pay the money before I instituted criminal proceedings—I did not write to him in April to ask him to pay the money—my clerk wrote him a letter in his private capacity, which I repudiated, and Mr. McDonald swore that he had no part or parcel in it—I believe I had no communication with Mr. Barton in 1882—I have said, "I saw Barton on several occasions while he was trying to assist me," that was to assist me in the arrest of Hales—I knew where Hales senior lived—I have only seen him once—it was</p>

               <p>after 3rd December that I went to see him—I did not try to get money out of him—he lives near Tonbridge—I did not tell him I had an acceptance which apparently had been forged by his son—I produced it, and asked him whether it was his son's signature—he did not tell me it was not and that his son could not write like that—he said that if it were not for the misconduct of his son, whom he called "That wretched boy," he had no misfortunes in his life, and he referred me to his solicitors—I did not say that I only wanted my money, and he had better write cheque for the amount and take up the bill, but I said he might possibly remove the difficulty by paying the money—that was not the reason I went—I never suggested his drawing a cheque—he did not tell me if he believed his son was guilty he would do nothing to save him, and ask me to leave the house and communicate with his solicitor; on the contrary he treated me with the greatest courtesy, and showed me into the morning-room with his daughter.</p>

                  </hi>. My office is at 8, Red Lion Square, Hoi born—I have made handwriting a study, and since October, 1882, I have been engaged in giving evidence on writing in Courts of Justice—I have been employed by the Treasury to give evidence in their eases—I have examined this bill and my opinion is the words "G. Russell Miller," and the words "Accepted, payable at the London and County Bank, Lombard Street," were written by the same hand, but slightly disguised—the down strokes in the acceptance are light, the pen is turned to the bottom part and the letters seem to run on the same line of writing, and the same feature is seen in the word "Russell," the last part of the capital R in the signature is in close resemblance to the small "h" ii the word "the"—the loop letters "bl" in "payable" are closed up, and the same occurs in the word Russell—the "k" in "bank" is open, and the same occurs in the two "ll's" in "Miller"—if you compare the "a" in "accepted" with the "a" at the end of the line, you will find the last is angular and not at all like the letters in the same line—the "e" in Miller in angular, and does not agree with the "e" in Russell—the "r" in Miller is of the same formation as the same letter in Lombard Street, with the shoulder to the right—my opinion is that the "Accepted payable" and following words are written with a quill pen, and the signature with a steel pen, but with the same ink—I have arrived at this conclusion after careful consideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not considered the body of the bill at all—I generally look for capital letters for comparison—I have no materials to judge from but these ten words—there is a very small loop in the first "l" in Russell, the pen has gone up and come down on the other side very close but not in the same line, therefore it makes a loop; the down<lb/>stroke does not come down on the upstroke, but it touches it more or less all the way down, the loop is a question of degree—I cannot say which is the true writing, the "ll's" with loops or those without—I compare both—there is one "l" in the acceptance—the "k" in bank u open, it does not correspond with the "ll's" in Russell, but it does correspond with the "ll's" in Miller—the "ll's" in Russell are closed</p>

               <p>up, and are much smaller, and I find two loops closed up in "payable"—the "k" is the only letter in which the loop is open, I think the "l" is filled up, that would correspond with Russell, and not with Miller—I am not prepared to show you which is the true writing—the final stroke of the "r" in the signature resembles the "h" in "three" the downstroke is light, and the pen is turned down at the bottom, making it heavy—my experience is not that it is very common that the lower part of the stroke where it is carried on is thick—my experience is only thirteen months—many people naturally write on the side of the pen, but it is not the rule—my attention has not been called to the body of the bill, it was never suggested to me—I have not had it under my inspect<lb/>tion since I was examined at the Mansion House—in the acceptance the two "ss" are separated and they are not alike in shape—the two "ll's" in Miller are looped—I have not investigated whether the body of the bill was written before or after the acceptance—I have got a magnifying glass, and the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. certainly seems to have been put on after the writing which it crosses; the black ink has certainly been written across the other.

The two men Coutts and Dickens were taken before the Magistrate at Worship Street—I saw the prisoner with reference to that matter, I think, on 13th May—the two men were then in custody—I had a warrant against Walter Henry—I saw the prisoner at his shop, 37, Norton Folgate—I told him who I was and that I had called with reference to Walter Henry, that two men named Plummer and Coutts were in custody, and that one of the references by which goods had been obtained was Walter Henry, of 97, Bishop's Road, Victoria Park, his own address—he said he could not understand it, that he had no knowledge of Walter Henry whatever—he said that he had no knowledge of Dickens or Dixon or any such name—I mentioned several names—I told him that most extraordinary replies had been re<lb/>ceived from persons who had been defrauded from Walter Henry having written to them from 97, Bishop's Road—he again replied that he could not understand it at all, he had no idea who Walter Henry was or anything about it—I was afterwards at the police-court when he gave evidence.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to this indictment—I first knew Swallow 10 years ago—I met him in the Strand in January, and we went into a public-house—I had this cheque in my possession, which I got out of a letter which I got out of the Eaton square pillar-box with a string and a piece of lead and some birdlime—we went to Bournemouth to get it cashed, as it was drawn on the bank there—we went to the London Hotel there and occupied the same bed-room on the night of 7th January—we had breakfast next morning and went out for a walk—he took the cheque into the bank and I waited outside—I had endorsed it "Marie Bichardson" in my room in New street-Swallow was with me and saw me write it; he suggested that I should endorse it, as it would not be safe for him to do it as he was going to take it into the bank, and I was to keep it till we got to Bournemouth—when he came out of the bank we went to a public-house and had something to drink, and he gave me half the money, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the remainder in gold—we then went for a short walk and went back to the hotel, and I paid the bill with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—Swallow went to get some tobacco and he asked me whether I had paid—I said "Yes"—he said "What with?""—I said "With a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—he said "I will try and get it back," and spoke to the landlord—I got this cheque for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of another letter in the same way from a pillar-box—I endorsed it in Swallow's presence, and I gave it to him to the best of my belief in a</p>

Robinson, dated 16th January, Fleet Street: "I am waiting at New Inn, Edgware Road, till 10.30. If not at home, come there"—Swallow sent that—I went to meet him after that, he was not there, and then I went to Mr. Mr. Lazarus's house and received a note from him written by Swallow, to the same effect, to meet him in the house in the Edgware Road.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told Swallow at the beginning of January how I got possession of these cheques when I met him in the Strand—before that it was perhaps two months since I had seen him; that was in the neighbourhood of the Haymarket—I was not stealing from letter-boxes then; I was an honest man—I was valet to Mr. Julian Gold-smith three years ago—he was a very good master to me—I pleaded guilty to receiving some jewellery stolen from him—I knew it was his—I got three months for that; it was last July—when I came out of prison I did nothing—I often met Swallow—I lived by selling my furniture and different things I had in my possession—Swallow knows I sold a screen I made for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he first brought up about cheques when I met him in the Strand—he proposed the birdlime—I didn't give it much thought whether the passing of cheques would require more audacity than dropping the thing down the letter-box—I can't say whether I alluded to it the first day I met him in the Strand—I was sorry for what I had done when I left prison—I overcame that sorrow after I had seen Swallow on dif<lb/>ferent occasionss about the beginning of January—I don't know if it was the first time I met him in the Strand—the first time I saw him there he said he was afraid he should get into trouble over a cheque he had forged, and that a friend of his had cashed for him—I knew him when his father kept a public-house—we did not have a serious quarrel about a game of billiards; we had a word or two—I saw him in the summer of 1883 at the top of the Haymarket in a public-house; he was making a book on horse-racing—I forged the endorsement to one of the cheques—I suggested he should forge them—Swallow said he had two friends in addition to him and me—I did not see them—I was running away when taken into custody—I instructed a solicitor to appear for me—I first wanted to give evidence two days after I was apprehended, when I was told that the police had found things in my room—I gave evidence be<lb/>cause I considered it was my duty to forward the ends of justice; it was</p>

               <p>the office on Monday, and about 10.30 found the lock of the drawer had been tampered with and the money gone, the purse was left—the next morning, Tuesday, I reported it to the chief clerk—I found this screwdriver in the prisoner's drawer, off which the lock was broken—on Tuesday the police officer, when the prisoner was taken into custody, showed me this piece of paper—it is a piece of disused examination schedule in which I had wrapped the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had torn it myself that morning, and am quite positive it is the piece of paper in which I wrapped the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—all disused papers are common in the office—the prisoner had no business whatever in the messengers' room—his room is three rooms from ours.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He asked leave to see his chief before I took him, but I declined—he appeared confused—it would take 20 minutes to take off the lock and replace it—there were four screws to the lock; they were put hack—a mould of the penny having been wrapped in it was on the paper—the other pieces of paper were like this—I searched his room and found a quantity of paper like this—I know he has been in the habit of picking up pieces of paper like this, and that he bears an irreproachable character.</p>

I am medical officer of the Whitechapel In<lb/>firmary—on 16th January, about 3 p.m., I saw the child there, it was covered with cinders, dust, and ashes, and was cold and exhausted—I had it put into a warm bath, and while there we took some cinders out of its mouth, about six pieces altogether; one larger than the others was at the back of the tongue; it was as large as a small bead—there were two excoriations, one at the back of the head and one on the back—those might have been done by the child falling on the stones—I do not think' that a child recently born could have taken in its mouth the cinders I found, I think they must have been put there—the baby could not have been in the dust hole more than a few minutes; the cord was broken—I had the child attended to and it is now doing well—if it had remained in the dust heap it would have been dead in ten minutes—I saw the prisoner about half-past 6, and examined her—she had been lately confined—she was then intoxicated—if the child had opened its mouth the cinders' might have fallen in.</p>

I am 15 years old—I live at Holm brook Street, Homerton—on the 19th of January, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day, I was going down a road in Hackney, and saw the prisoner and a good many more <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> with him—the prisoner was picking a pigeon—I went to look at him—he told me to go away—I said "I shan't"—he said "If you don't go away I will <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> something at you," and he picked up a handful of gravel and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it at me—I picked up a stone and gave it him back; he then picked up halt a brick—I picked up another stone—he said "You little ass, if you don't go away I will shoot you"—I ran away, and as I ran I turned my head round and saw that he had a gun up to his shoulder, pointing to me—I ran about 60 yards, he then fired at me—I felt the shot, and fell to the ground bleeding—I was struck in the eye, in both legs, both arms and in the body—I have since taken a shot out of my leg, on the Thursday night as I came out of the hospital—on the Wednesday when I was before the Magistrate, the marks of the shots were still on my arms and legs—William Leach helped me up from the ground, and was going to take me to the doctor's, and the prisoner came up and took me—he said he was very sorry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He did take me to the doctor's, and then to the hospital—he was with me at the hospital when the policeman arrested him—he came up to me at once, and said he was very sorry for what had happened—this occurred in Clapton Park; they are making roads there,</p>

I am a carman, and live at Holmbrook Street, Homerton—I happened to be passing by with a pair of horses in a cart when this took place—I saw the prisoner with the gun to his shoulder—I saw the flash, and heard the report—I did not see the boy, for the report frightened my horses, and I had enough to look after them.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at the Palmerston beerhouse, Homerton—on the 19th January I was cleaning my tools at the back of this road, I heard a report which made me look round, and I saw the prisoner take the gun away from his shoulder—I saw the boy; he was close by where I was—he was about 50 or 60 yards from the prisoner—I went to him, and picked him up, and was going to take him to the doctor's—I saw blood on his face and hands when I picked him up, and he had his hand up to his eye.</p>

On the 9th of January, from infor<lb/>mation, I went to the Ophthalmic Hospital in Moorfields, and took the prisoner in custody there—I told him he must consider himself my prisoner for shooting the boy—he said "I am very sorry, I did not dream that the gun was cocked"—he afterwards said "I was picking a pigeon, and the boy came round, I told him to go away; he would not, and commenced throwing; I took up the gun, and it went off; I didn't know it was I cocked at the time"—he made the same reply when the charge was read over to him at the station—I went to his house next day, and found this gun there; it is a double-barrelled muzzle-loading gun—one barrel was loaded with No. 4 shot.</p>

At 1.30 on 22nd January I was called to Fryett's, the pawnbroker's, in the Whitechapel Road—I there saw the prisoner and this coat—I asked the prisoner where he got it from. (<hi rend="italic">The <hi rend="smallCaps">COMMON SERJEANT</hi> considered that this conversation, as it related to another charge than that on which the prisoner tots being tried, could not be given, and that it must be confined to the specific charge.</hi>) At the station I examined the prisoner and found these 13 pawn tickets sewn up between his two shirts. (<hi rend="italic">These tickets were dated from November 30, 1883, in various names, and related to coats, trousers, boots, Jewellery, and other articles.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The pawnbroker Webb said you resembled the person who had pledged the articles, but he was not sure about it—he did not suggest that if you had given your right address he would not have charged you—he said "Let us go to the station first of all and see if his address is right or not."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I found the tickets sewn up in the prisoner's collar at the back of his neck—he cross-examined me in English at the police-court—I said "When the coat and rug were shown to you at the pawn-broker's, you said' I never saw them before, you have made a mistake.' All the people in the pawnshop said they knew you."</p>
               <p>

He contended that had he intended to steal the coat he would not have first asked Mr. Lambert if it was his; that he would not have had time to steal the coat and rug in two minutes, which was the time stated at the police-court; and that he would have been too shrewd to go again to the same pawnbroker's, especially as they knew his face by his having lived opposite; that the pawn tickets found on him were for things he had purchased and pawned to gain a living, and he knew nothing about the coat and rug.</hi>

               <p>shop, in which was a bracket and a pipe; this produced is the same bracket, just as it was then, the gas flowed downwards—there was a shelf, and underneath that a gas bracket—I fitted that my self originally and I made this model of it—if the part above was stopped the gas could not get down to this burner—I didn't see anything of the damage done to the pipe—I went to the premises after the tire—I had not been there between the time of fixing the pipe and the fire—the top burner was about four feet from the ceiling—on Saturday, 30th November, about 10 in the morning after the fire, I went there; I saw Arthur Jones and the witness Garrett—I looked at the place where the fire had been—the partition was all burnt away, and the bottom tap was turned off—I moved some of the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> away and saw that it was turned off—they said that there was a leakage in the gas—I could not swear who spoke; they were both together—I said "I know that my joints were wound," and they said that the tap must have been left full on—I said "That cannot be, for the tap is off"—I can't remember that they made any remark upon that—the pipe was entirely gone; all burnt away—it was a composition pipe—I saw the top bracket found among the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> by Inspector Dod—I looked at it, and the tap was slightly turned, not sufficient to let the gas through—I tried it by blowing into it; no air passed, I am quite sure if that—I saw the other three burners in the back room; they were all off—firemen had been there before me—on the Friday night, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was at the Vine public-house; David Jones came in white I was there with three other persons—Stevenson was one of them—after they had been there about ten minutes Garrett came in and gave David a key—David said "Eight," and immediately left the house—he went towards No. 96—I saw him from the window—he was away for about ten minutes—I then saw him come in again; it might have been ten minutes or a quarter to ten—I don't remember whether he left before I did.</p>

I am an engineer in charge of the fire station in the Highgate Road—on the morning of 3rd November at 1.50 I was called to No. 96, it was about 400 yards off—when I got there I saw Good ward standing at the door—I opened the door and saw that the place was all alight, the back part of the house and the passage—I got to work and the fire was extinguished in somewhere about 40 minute—I afterwards examined the premises, and discovered that the fire had originated in the partition on the left-hand side as you entered the room—the fire had travelled upwards and had burnt through the partition towards the staircase—I did not see the composition pipe, none of it was left—the fire had gone through the staircase up to the floor above, which it had burnt through—considerable damage had been done to the back room, first floor; the contents of it had been burnt—when I got into the house I found all the doors and windows closed—after the fire was extinguished I noticed the gas-burners; there were three standing there—I told one of my men to try and light the gas, and I found that the pipe was melted and there was no gas on—there were shutters or boards to the back window of the shaving saloon, they were closed—on going upstairs I didn't find any burner alight—I did not go into the front room for some time, when I did so the gas was out—in my opinion the fire had been alight for some considerable time before I got there—the salvage men arrived before I left—I returned to the station at 3.12 a.m., and soon afterwards the prisoners came in there—David asked me if there had been a fire up the road—I said "Yes," and asked him if he was not Mr. Jones—he said he was the brother, and he pointed to one behind as his brother who was the occupier—I asked David if he could give me any cause for the fire taking place—he said "No," he could not—I asked him what time he left the house—he said, "About 9 o'clock"—I asked him who was the last man in the house—he said, "I was"—he said that his brother had gone out about 5 p.m.—he said he and the barber or workman were in the house—I don't think Arthur spoke to me then; he did speak eventually, but not then—I asked David if he had any occasion to go to the cupboard under the stairs with a candle, or anything of that kind, and he said he believed not—I think he said when he left the house he went to a public-house close by—I asked Arthur if he could tell me anything—he said "No," because he had left and had gone to the theatre or music-hall with a publican's daughter in Camden Town—I booked the times I have spoken of, at least my man on duty did so.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Rouch, the assessor to the Commercial Union Fire Insurance Office—on Saturday afternoon, 3rd November, I went to 96, Highgate Road, for the purpose of ascer<lb/>taining the damage done by the fire—while there I saw Arthur Jones—I told him who I was and what I had come for—I asked him if he was going to make out a claim against the Company—he said "Yes, cer<lb/>tainly"—we then proceeded to look over the place—first as to the shop, I said "There is very little stock here," and he said "Yes there is"—we went into the back room first, afterwards we went upstairs; I saw David there—I said "There is very little damage in the front room"—he agreed with me that there was—then we went into the back room; I found that was nearly burnt out—I handed Arthur one of our usual printed claim forms, and told him we should want the claim made out in the usual way, and left the form with him—that was all that passed at that time—on November 9th I received this claim on the form I had left, filled up—I then went again to the house and went right through the list, and appointed for them to come to me on the 10th, which they did; I had the claim with me—I handed it to Arthur and asked him if the amount did not very much surprise him—it amounted to 134<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "No; what for?"—I said it was such an exorbitant claim that I should think he did not expect to get that amount, and if he did he was very much</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188402250064"/>
               <p>mistaken—I quoted one or two instances where the claims were exor<lb/>bitant, and then I said unless they were prepared to accept a very great reduction on that amount it was useless my going into the matter with them—after a time Arthur wanted to know what amount I was prepared to offer—I said I was willing to recommend the Company to pay 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—David said that was d—d nonsense—Arthur said that amount would not do for him—I said I supposed not; if he thought that the Company was going to pay his debts he was very much mistaken—they said they were going to see Mr. Apps on some other business, and they would talk to him about it, and they would let me know on Monday whether they would accept the amount or not—I told them unless they accepted the offer on that Saturday it would not be made any longer—that was all that passed; they did not come again—after that Mr. Apps communi<lb/>cated with me, and these are the letters that passed, two from Mr. Apps and one from Mr. Middleton—I have been a valuer 20 years—I went through the list in this claim, my valuation was 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in my judgment 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a fair amount for the damage done by the fire—the matter was referred to arbitration—before the reference was finished I saw Garrett—I first saw him on December 18th; I went to his house in consequence of what I had heard and took down from him in my pocket-book some information he gave me—I asked him what he knew about the matter—I afterwards wrote it out in pencil on this sheet (<hi rend="italic">marked N</hi>) while I was waiting at the Law Courts, where I was subpœnaed as a witness—I read it over to Garrett the next night; he made certain corrections—I struck out those parts, and he afterwards signed it—there is some writing after his signature—I added that from memory the same night—it was copied out in ink while he was in our office, and read over to him, and he signed it—after this Mr. Rouch paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about December 20th or 21st Mr. Rouch and I called at Scotland Yard with this state<lb/>ment and gave in formation to the police, and left the matter in their hands.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. Thomas and Hollams are solicitors to this office—I believe Mr. Rouch consulted with them before applying to the Public Prosecutor to pay the costs—I have my pocket-book here—I do not say that what I copied is a verbatim copy of this; this was taken at Garrett's house—I did not say to him "You know more about this than you have told us"—before he said a word about it he did not say "Will you undertake not to prosecute me?"—I didn't promise not to prosecute him before I took down the first statement—I will swear that document M was written after N; there is no original of M, this is the original, it is my writing—it is my usual style of writing—I took it down from Garrett's mouth after he had signed N—I took down exactly what he told me—he said "I was an accessory before the fact"—I didn't ask him if he was—he gave the whole of this without any suggestion from me—I told him that we shouldn't prosecute—I don't think I had promised him that I should not prosecute him—it is usual when there is a dispute there should be an arbitration—before you get the arbitration I believe the Company has to swear that it is not done to avoid liabilities on the ground of imputing fraud—I had nothing to do with the affidavit that was sworn on the 6th of December—I don't know that the Company swore that they did not allege fraud—Mr. Land is fire manager at the Commercial Union; I suppose he would be the person to swear the</p>

               <p>affidavit—I asked Arthur Jones if lie could account for the fire—he said No, he could not, without it was a spark from the grate—he after<lb/>wards said that he had gone out early that evening—they employed no solicitor or valuer until they returned the claim to me—their claim was 134<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and mine was 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe I said to Mr. Middleton after they were in custody that they had only themselves to thank for being pro<lb/>secuted, for if they had taken the 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they would have heard nothing about it—Mr. Middleton was the valuer employed by Mr. Apps—I think he came to our office twice and brought his claim, which was 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I reckoned the value of the furniture in the first-floor front room at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were three rooms and a shop—two rooms on the ground floor, the barber's shop, and the tobacconist's—Mr. Middleton's claim was about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that front room—I didn't discuss in detail with Mr. Middleton to as to try and approach each other—I didn't meet him at the arbitra<lb/>tion—after Thomas and Hollams had been sued with regard to the arbitration application was made to the Public Prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I shall be twenty-four next April—I have been in the dock and heard Garrett's statements—it is entirely false that on Friday, 2nd November, I was depressed, and that my brother said "Cheer up, we will have a flare-up to-night"—my brother never said in Garrett's hearing that a fire was to take place, either in joke or earnest—an engagement was made a week previous to take a young lady to the Grand Theatre; there being a large family, the sisters took it in turns and only went out once a week—Stevenson was a friend of the family—when we left at 6 not a word was said in Stevenson's presence by my brother to Garrett that we must leave it all to him, that we must have a flare-up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188402250066"/>
               <p>—it is utterly untrue, I swear it—having gone to the theatre my brother joined me alterwards at the Buck's Head—Garrett was with him it is not true that I and my brother went aside and had a private conversa<lb/>tion together—nothing was said by any one about a fire till we got to the coffee stall, and then for the first time I heard of there being a lire—we had to pass the fire brigade station on the way to the house—I went into the fire station then and heard the conversation spoken to by Mr. Bate-man—substantially it is correct—my brother then said Garrett was the last on the premises—then we went into the house and found it in the possession of the salvage men, with policemen and fire brigade men—the bureau had been put back in the shop, my brother forgot it had been taken out—it is absolutely false as far as I know that my brother had given Garrett a photograph and a marriage certificate—he never showed me anything of the kind given by my brother—I stopped at Garrett's place that night and my brother at Stevenson's—there was no bed—the next day I got a lodging at Milman Street—this man came to me to Milman Street—I gave him small sums of money—I expected that shortly it would be put in order and that we should go on again—the day before my brother and I went to his place I saw Garrett come to our place at Milman Street, where we were lodging, he said he was going to the City to see a gentleman—I went with him, and on the road Garrett was half intoxicated, and said to me "God strike me dead, if you don't give me some money I will go to the office at Cornhill and tell them that you and your brother put that place on fire, unless you sign that paper"—I told my brother of that—we both went and saw what he would say—he gave me that paper to look at, I handed it to my brother—it had been written by a friend of his, George Bag, I believe—I handed it to my brother, he read it and said "No, you will not sign that paper," and then Garrett flew in a passion and tore the paper up and put it in the fire—I gave him no money after that, I did not see him after that—I had no idea any communication had been made to Mr. Woods until I was taken into custody—I did not know Garrett had carried out his threat—he never said anything to me, nor to my brother in my presence, about going to the loan office, and false pretences—at the time he made that statement to me we were in arbitration with the Company—the Judge in chambers had made the order before he made the threat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The expression "God strike me dead" was used in December in the street going to the City, I had to see a gentleman and so had he—he was half intoxicated at the time and I laughed at him—it did not occur to me at the time it was a threat to extort money, because I thought the man was drunk—I took no further notice of it—before we parted I made an appointment to go to his place on the following day, and it was then he asked me to sign the paper, he claimed 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said a friend of his, Mr. Quick, would lend us 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he got a paper signed by us for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he wanted us to sign a paper for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I read it and showed it to my brother—he read it and said "If you will alter it to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will sign it"—he said "No," and tore it up in a passion and put it in the fire—I have no doubt this is a copy of the document, except that the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is filled in—I cannot tell if he was drunk on this occasion, because his room was not sufficiently lighted—you cannot always tell by a man' conversation whether he is drunk—I took no proceedings against him</p>

               <p>when I found he was still trying to get 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from us—I did not tell Mr. Middleton when I saw him in the City that Garrett had threatened to charge us if we did not give him money—I did not tell Mr. Apps 'the solicitor—I never told anybody till I got into the witness-box to-day—I had no latch-key on this Friday when I went to the threatre—there were two keys to the door—I and my brother mostly met each other at the Buck's Head, Camden Town; we used to meet every night—I cannot remember if I made arrangements to meet him that night—I did meet him; we went about the streets till 3.30 in the morning:—we were rather fresh—the gas had been left burn<lb/>ing and the shelf had got charred two or three days before this; that was found out when we got home about 1.30—I went in with my friend and found the smell of burning and examined it, and saw it put out with a wet towel—I did not notice if the pipe wan burnt through; the wood was charred all round—I saw the state of the pipe when I came down next morning—I did nut notice it; I looked at it no doubt—I didn't take sufficient notice to see if it was burnt through—I cannot recollect if the burner underneath was lighted again after that night—I don't know if it was—I don't know that the pipe was burnt through and stopped up with soap—it was in the same state each night afterwards—I hadn't called in any man to repair it; I had intended to call a man in—if dangerous on one night it was on all—I cannot account for the fire at all—I have no suggestion to make—when I went into possession of these premises I paid Mr. Mackintosh 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the stock—after I took possession I went to live there with my brother David—there are only two rooms over the shop, a front and back, the front was the sitting-room—David didn't assist me in the business; he was there staying with me doing nothing; he had no occupation—I moved in some furniture to furnish the two upper rooms; that was not my mother's furniture, it was mine; it came from Islip Street, where we were staying, and where my mother was staying before she went to Wales; it was furniture that she had used—I got from the loan office altogether 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was deducted for the first instalment—it was out of that that I paid the Michaelmas rent—I don't know whether my brother gave Mr. Apps a cup and saucer—they belonged to me—I believe my brother gave it to him; I am not sure—I don't remember whether any cups and saucers were removed from the house before the' fire—my brother is a Freemason, and I believe he had a certificate—I don't know whether he had my mother's marriage certificate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of 205, Globe Road, Mile End—on 4th November, 1882, the prisoner and a customer of mine named Linden came to my shop—Linden introduced the prisoner as a Baron and a very wealthy man related to Prince Bismarck, Prince Waldeck, and the Duke and Duchess of Albany, and said that he would come into a lot of property in Sheffield and Leeds in a short time, and if I would be kind enough to advance him 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Linden, who was his trustee, would call again in a day or two—he did so, and I advanced the money—the prisoner came in after that and told me Mr. Pearson, the Q.C., would not accept Mr. Linden as trustee, and would I mind having my name put down as trustee—I said I did not mind, and he told me whatever money I let him have I should receive double, and that I should have 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week as trustee, but I must let him have some money from time to time—I asked if he required much—he said "No," but he drew 199<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from November 6th to Christmas Eve, 1882—on 6th November I let him</p>

               <p>have 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—they said on 9th November that the property consisted of houses, a warehouse and railway shares—on 12th November the prisoner came again and said that he wanted some more money for the trustee's stamps, and I let him have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he called every day till Christmas, 1882; and I saw Linden from time to time, who said that Weisenberg was a very wealthy man and had come into a lot of property—the prisoner told me he was going to Leeds to get his aunt's documents and will, and that she was a lord's daughter, and that his uncle had lost 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Glasgow Bank—he was away three weeks and wrote several times for money, and I let him have all he asked for—on his return he brought this wooden box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which he said contained his aunt's will and documents relating to the property—I believed that, but he told me not to look into the box—he obtained money from me up to May, 1883, sometimes he wrote for it and sometimes he called—on 27th April, 1883, he called on me for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., saying that he was going to Scotland to get some documents and papers relating to Prince Waldeck which he was entitled to—on May 5th I let him have 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold; and about a month afterwards Linden brought me a letter asking for 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and Linden and I arranged to meet the prisoner at Bedford Railway Station—we did so, and I gave Linden the 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he gave it to the prisoner, who said he wanted it to get the documents concerning Prince Waldeck, and that it would not be long before the property was settled—about the end of May I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>): (<hi rend="italic">Dated May</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1883, <hi rend="italic">stating that the documents from Scotland would arrive in a day or two in an iron box at the Great Northern Station, and saying" Pray go yourself to fetch it, as its contents are of great value "Signed, "Yours till death, faithfully loving brother, T.

Hutsch, 205, Globe Road, Bethnal Green"—I gave it to the prisoner, and when opened it contained a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Builder</hi> and other papers—when I gave him the registered letter he said that it came from the Duke and Duchess of Albany, and I was to take care of it and put it with the boxes—I asked him next day if he had opened the letter—he said "You can if you like"—I did not do so, and on 7th December my wife showed it to him again still unopened—he said "Take great care of that, that comes from the Duke and Duchess of Albany, and I have to receive 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Rothschild's Bank"—he then told me that no trustee would be required, and I should be paid my money with double interest, and asked me to lend him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I told him to call next day; he did so and I refused to lend him the money—on 4th January this year he called again and asked me to let him have 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go to Scotland, as he was going to sell some railway shares and repay me—I saw no more of him till he was in charge on 18th February—I believed the statements he made, and it was on those representations that I let him have, not only all the money I had, but I deposited the lease of my house and borrowed money</p>

               <p>on that—I received from him these 23 letters, with each of which he sent me an envelope directed to himself to send an answer and the money he asked for—he told me that he lived at the St. Pancras Hotel with Prince Waldeck, and I believed him—he once told me he had lost his watch, and asked me to let him have my watch and chain that he might look respectable to Prince Waldeck—he said he owed 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the St. Pancras Hotel, and his friend Prince Waldeck must not know that he owed anything—I let him have the money—there were two boxes at my house; they were opened and contained rubbishing papers—a warrant was issued for Linden, but he had absconded.</p>

I am in charge of this case—I was before the Magistrate when the prisoner was charged—Giovanni Frig<lb/>senelle was examined—I saw him sworn, and the prisoner had an oppor<lb/>tunity of examining him. (<hi rend="italic">Deposition read:</hi> "I live at 24, Club Row, Bethnal Green. I am a looking-glass maker. On 17th April, 1883, Linden, who had worked for me for some years, brought the prisoner to my house, and told me that he was a very wealthy man and worth a lot of money; he told me he was a German baron and related to the Duke and Duchess of Albany, and had some documents of great value in his possession. Prisoner had a bag in his hand and proposed to go and drink, and we all went to the Knave of Clubs next door. Prisoner told me he had some documents of great value in his bag, and that he had property in Germany, Sheffield, and Leeds, and that he was worth a great deal of money. He said there were more documents in Scotland, but before he could get them he should require 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I told him I had no money. He said he wanted more and we all went away. On 27th April we all three went to the same tavern again, and then Linden told me that the prisoner had to go to Scotland to get some documents, and that he required about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he asked me to let the prisoner have it. I said I had not got it; I said I did not like the look of prisoner much. Linden said he was all right, and had 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week coming in; Linden said' If you will lend him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will let you have 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards it, and that will enable him to get his documents from Scotland.' Prisoner opened the bag he had with him and pulled out a lot of bank-notes, and he showed me one for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said' I don't want any money,' and bragged. He had some papers also in his bag tied up with red tape. I said I would think about lending the money. The same evening we all went to the same tavern again, and I said to Linden' If you give me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will lend him the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Linden told me to ask the prisoner if he wanted the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so I said to him If you are short of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go to Scotland to get your documents I'll let you have it,' and I also asked if 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be enough, and he said' Yes.' Next day Linden came to me and said, 'I cannot get the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,' so I declined to let him have any of the money at all. After that prisoner and Linden called nearly every day for the money. Linden said he would see I had my money back with double interest. I said I doubted his word, and Linden said I should have my money back, and that the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188402250071"/>
               <p>belonged to the German Royal Family and was a relation of Prince Bismarck. I believed it all, and said' Well, he can have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he pays me by the 18th of May.' On the 10th of May prisoner and Linden called and asked me if I had the money, and I said' Yes,' and gave the prisoner a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; my son wrote this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and prisoner signed it and Linden witnessed it. Prisoner said he could not pay me till the 5th of June, and then he would give me double. I received the letter produced of 16th May, and saw Linden and asked him where I should write to the prisoner, and he said to the Midland Railway Hotel, Sheffield. I wrote to prisoner, asking for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he could not send me the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I do not remember the date, but it was after the money became due. On 16th June I received the letter produced, and I wrote again fur my money and received the letter of 29th June, and I then wrote again for the money, but got no answer. On 3rd July I received the letter produced, and did not answer it. Linden saw all those letters; I showed them to him, and he said 'Oh, that is all right; he will pay you.' I received the letter of 9th July, and Linden was in my shop when it came, and I showed it to him and said 'I think you are as big a rogue as Weisenberg, and if you don't tell me where he is I'll make you pay.' I said to Linden 'We will go to Sheffield after him.' That day we went to Sheffield, and went to the Victoria Commercial Hotel. I asked for Weisenberg, and he was not known. Linden and I then went to the Midland Railway Hotel and found out the prisoner was a customer but did not sleep there, and had letters and telegrams directed to him there. All my letters bore my trade stamp. Linden said he knew where prisoner lived, and we went together to the Freedom Beer-shop and Hotel. From what I learnt there I went to Melbourne House, and did not see the prisoner, but left my card for him. Next day I called and did not see him, but heard he had gone to Liverpool. I re<lb/>turned to London. On 14th July Linden brought me the letter produced. I said no more of them then. On 8th October I received the letter produced, and on 2nd November Linden called on me, and I asked him where prisoner was, and he told me to go to 23, Frederick Street, King's Cross. I went there next day, and while I was there prisoner came up and I asked him what he was going to do about my money, and he said 'I'll pay you,' and I said 'When?' and he said 'Next week;' and I said 'If you don't it will be a bad job for you,' and he said 'You can't do anything to me.' I said' I can lock you up now,' and he said 'Don't do that.' He called on me nearly every day up to 21st December and promised to pay me. That day he asked me to let him have 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and I said' No.' He said if I did he would give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of the month. I said I only wanted my 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash. On the 19th of December my son wrote the two telegrams and the envelope for the prisoner, at his dictation. Prisoner wrote a letter in German and asked my son to address the envelope. He said the Duchess knew where she had to meet him. On the 5th of January this year prisoner called on me and asked me to be his trustee, and he showed me a registered enve<lb/>lope which he said contained papers of the value of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I said all I wanted was my money. He asked me to go to the railway station with him to get his box of documents, and I refused. I changed a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note for him, and after that I saw no more of him till he was in charge," <hi rend="italic">February</hi> 8.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I have known Barter and Toomey by sight for some time—Barter lives at stock Orchard Crescent, Holloway, and Toomey at 3, Underwood Street, Mile End New Town—I received instructions about them, and on 19th January, about 10 a.m., I was outside Barter's house—he came out; in about half an hour, and I fol<lb/>lowed him to Buxton Street, Mile End, which Underwood Street runs out of—he met Toomey there, who went into his house; Barter remained in the street at some distance—Toomey soon afterwards came out carrying a brown-paper parcel—he joined Barter, and both walked to White<lb/>chapel Station, East London line, and got into a train together which would go to Peckham—I did not follow them—on January 23 I was with Sager in Underwood Street shortly before 11 o'clock watching Tourney's house—Barter came into the street and knocked at Toomey's door; he was answered by some one from the first floor; he then walked away, and remained about the centre of the street, where Toomey joined him with a brown-paper parcel—they walked to Whitechapel Station, entered the station separately, took tickets separately, and got into the train together—Sager and I got into another compartment of the same open carriage, and I saw Toomey place the parcel on the seat—they both got out at New Cross—Barter, who had the parcel, walked out of the station three or four yards in front of Toomey—we followed Barter to Mr. Akhurst's, a manufacturing chemist's, 207, Queen's Road, Peckham, whose name was on the gate—it is a private house—Barter went in with the parcel—I did not see him come out—I went away—on 24th January we were again watching, and saw Toomey come out; we followed him to a urinal in Pitfield Street, Hoxton; he went in, and Farrah, who was standing close by, followed him in—Toomey came out and I followed Him to his house—on January 25 I saw Toomey come out of his house, and followed him to the same urinal, where he met Farrah, and when he came out his pockets were bulky—on January 26 I saw Farrah at Shoreditch' Station, and followed him to his house—he went in; I waited there, and about 11 o'clock Barter knocked at the door; it was answered by some one from the first floor—he then walked up Underwood Street, and waited there—Toomey came out with a large brown-paper parcel—he passed Barter, who followed him to Whitechapel Station—they got into the same carriage—I followed in the same train—Toomey got out at Old Kent Road without the parcel—Barter remained in the train, and got out at Queen's Road, Peckham, with the parcel—we followed him to Akhurst's with it—he was inside a quarter of an hour, and came out without it—we followed him to a public-house in Old Kent Road, where Toomey was waiting—they remained about 10 minutes, and came out and got on a tram—we did not follow them—on the same day I was with Sergeant Wright and Sager near Messrs. Burgoyne's premises, and saw Farrah come out and join Toomey—they went to the urinal in Pitfield Street—on 30th January, about 10.45 a.m., I was watching Toomey's house again with Sager—Barter knocked at the door, received an answer, and waited as before—Toomey came out carrying a brown-paper parcel, and I followed them to Whitechapel Station, and to New Cross, where they got out—Toomey remained in the station, and Barter walked towards Akhurst's house with the parcel—Sager followed him and brought him back, and I took Toomey in custody—we all four drove to the City in a cab, and I said to Sager, "Have you told Mr. Barter what</p>

               <p>he will be charged with?"—he said "Yes"—Barter said, "What is this man charged with?" referring to Toomey—I told him that Toomey was charged with being concerned with a lad in the employ of Messrs. Burgoyne, wholesale druggists, Coleman Street, in stealing and receiving the contents of the parcel that he had got—Barter said, "I always thought he bought them at sales"—I said, "You must have known better than that, this is the man I cautioned you about last July"—he said, "Yes, so you did, I recollect"—they were all charged when Farrah was taken—it was on 11th July, 1883, that I cautioned him.</p>

Burgoyne's, wholesale druggists in the City"—Davidson brought Toomey up, and we got into a cab—Barter pointed to Toomey and said, "What is this man charged with?"—I said, "He is charged with being concerned with you in receiving the contents of that parcel; he may also be charged with a lad not yet in custody"—he said, "I always understood he bought them on commission at sales"—Davidson said, "You must have known better than that, as you know that is the man I cautioned you about dealing with some time ago"—he said, "Oh, yes, I recollect"—I afterwards opened the parcel—it contained 5 dozen boxes of pills—the charges were read over to the prisoners—they made no reply.</p>

(Produced; total 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and balance 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—there is a memorandum on the back; there was half a dozen of Cockle's pills instead of a dozen, which made it amount to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I paid him—other persons in the market sell them at those prices—he came again on the 23rd—I received this card from him, and paid him 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per dozen boxes for pills at 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per box, and 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for those at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they are sold at the stores at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. including the duty—on the 26th Barter came again, and I paid him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for 21 boxes of pills and 2 1/2 packets of powders—I am not now in the retail trade, but I knew of customers for them and took them, knowing him to be a respectable man—I did not buy them cheap.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was a registered chemist in 1867—I had not the slightest idea that the goods were dishonestly come by—I knew where Barter lived, and that he owned his house, and I always knew him as a respectable man—I considered I was paying a fair price—drugs are sold by auction, but not patent medicines—I know that 52 wholesale druggists failed last year, and I think that would throw a quantity of drugs on the market to be sold—the price of articles sold in job lots and in sales is considerably diminished.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to receiving a number of Messrs. Burgoyne's drugs in January—I have known Barter two years dealing in pills and drugs—he had no place of business, but lived in Seven Sisters Head—I am a general dealer, and live in Underwood Street, Mile End; I have no shop—I sold him some pills nearly 12 months ago which I got from Farrah—Barter told me he was <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> with a man who got them from Farrah, but he did not like him, and would I go and speak to Farrah, who was at Burgoyne's—I went there, and met Farrah coming out—I spoke to him, and got two packets of pills from him like these—Barter came to my house, and I gave them to him—that went on sometimes twice a week, and sometimes three times, and I gave Barton whatever I had; it was always pills—I did not know where he disposed of them, because he only let me go with him as far as New Cross, and I waited while he went—I first heard of Akhurst at Guildhall—on 19th January Barter came to my house, and asked me what I had got—I told him, he told me to bring it down, and we went to Whitechapel Station, and then to New Cross—I took a parcel of pills with me which I had got from Farrah—on the 23rd I went again, and took a parcel of pills which I got from Farrah, and on the 26th I did the same—on the 30th I was apprehended—Barter came to my house that evening, and I said I had a parcel—we went to New Cross, and he took it; it contained pills—I received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and sometimes 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I never gave him an invoice, nor did he ask me for a receipt—I had been convicted of an assault, and I came out of prison on Novem<lb/>ber 26—Barter came to my house that day, and said he was sorry for my getting into trouble, and was I going to commence again—I said I thought not, after what I had suffered I had had enough—he gave me some money, and said that there was plenty of money, and I ought to do</p>

               <p>it—I said that I would rather not, but at last I was very hard up, and I consented—he gave me some pills, and said that I ought to go and see Farrah, and get some more, and I went—Farrah said that he did not care about doing it, and I told Barter so—he said "Tell him he must do it"—I said "I don't care about threatening him"—I used to wait for Barter at a <hi rend="italic">pub</hi> at the Old Kent Road Station while he disposed of the things—he got into trouble before July last, and I missed him—he came round to my house, and said that he had got into a little bother, but it had all blown over, and was I going to commence again—me and Farrrh had a talk about it, and we said we had better drop it—he said instead of meeting me at the different houses he would meet me once or twice a week at my house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This has been going on nearly 12 months—I knew him before—he said that he did not like the man who was getting the things from the boy—he told me who the man was, and I have seen him, but not to speak to him—I knew that Barter's suggestion meant that I was to go and receive stolen property—I said that I would see about it—I took three or four days to consider, and then I determined to do it—I had never been dishonest before—I made no objection to him; I went at once and saw the boy—this is the first time I have mentioned it—he gave me, as the middle man, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen for the pills, and he procured the thief for me, Farrah—he did not pay me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen for the large boxes, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the small ones—I kept no account of what I sold him—when I gave him so many he said "I have got to give you so much," and that was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, but we had no agreement—when we were in a cab with the officers Barter said "What is this man charged with?" meaning me—I did not hear him say "I always understood he bought the things on commission at sales," pointing to me; nor did I say any<lb/>thing upon that—I have never said anything to the inspector or the police about his having sent me to the boy, or selling them at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—I said before the Magistrate that I had nothing to say—I did not say a word about Barter having tempted me—Barter never mentioned Akhuret's name, but he said he took them to a man he knew at Peckham—he did not pay me till he came back from where he took them—the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen applied both to small and large boxes.</p>

You have given the certificate you can ask for what fee you like"—he then bade me good night, saying "I shall call in a fortnight and depend on you for the certificate"—it was about 8.45 when he left—next after<lb/>noon after I shut my surgery at 12 o'clock I went to the police-station and made a communication to Sergeant Targett—I put it in writing the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should not be at all surprised to hear that it was dead—I did not when I first saw it decide that it had consumption of the stomach—it was suffering from bad feeding, from condensed milk, not in proper strength, and in a very dirty bottle—that would produce wasting and emaciation—on the first interview with Mrs. Manning I formed I very unfavourable opinion of the child's condition, and thought it pro<lb/>bably would not live long, and I so stated to the prisoner on the 10th—on the 22nd he came about 8 o'clock and left about 9 and bade me good night—I also bade him good night—the following afternoon I communi<lb/>cated with the police—I did not consult any person before communicating with the police, I am positive of that—I was asked that question by Mr. Ricketts at the police-court, and I said I consulted somebody in the Temple; but that was after I had given information to the police—I did not have the interview personally with the barrister—I did it through my brother, a student in the Middle Temple—I had no ill feeling against the prisoner, but I wanted to know if I was doing right, to protect myself—I thought I might be compromised; that was what I was afraid of—I did not make an analysis of the contents of the bottle; I tasted it, and I believe it was in the same condition in which it left my hands—I had no reason to believe that it had been tampered with—about three-parts of it had been used—I received the bottle from Inspector Dod—when the prisoner first made this proposition to me I was so taken aback I did not know what to do—I made no attempt to mention it to the police that night, and next morning I could not go out, because my surgery was open—I did not institute the prosecution—I have carried on my profession at 66, Jackson Road from 30th January, 1883, before that I was at 104, Store Street as house-surgeon of a provident dispensary for 18 months—I had a mouth's notice to leave because I did not attend at a committee meeting—I left in debt, but not largely—I registered as a practitioner in September, 1882, and was qualified on 29th July—I studied at St. Mary's Hospital from 1873 to 1877—I had an interview with the prisoners father on Sunday night, 27th January—he told me who he was, and asked me if I was the prosecutor—I said no, the police were prosecuting, and that I was an unwilling witness in the matter—I did not say "I suppose your son has been talking of this affair, and it came to the ears of the police, and so Mr. Dod called on me and asked me about it, and that is how it occurred," nothing like it—the prisoner did not bring a vaccination paper with him when he first came, nor at all—he did not say he had had one left at his house—Mrs. Manning brought it on the 22nd I said the child was not fit to be vaccinated—the prisoner did not say "If the child knew what was best for itself it would die, but I suppose I shall have to keep it till it is 16"—I made a few notes of what he said on the 22nd next day—I have not got them here—I did not say before the Magis<lb/>trate that I had not taken any note—I said I had notes of the conversation</p>

               <p>on the 22nd—I had no note of the previous conversations—I don't know that the prisoner is not married—I have heard so—he certainly said on two occasions that he was married—he was not living at the tobacconist's shop—it is his father's business, and he carries it on for his father—I told Mrs. Manning that the child was suffering from consumption of the bowels—that is a term we use for malnutrition, as persons of the poorer class would not understand that term—<hi rend="italic">tuberculosis</hi> is a very deadly disease—I never said it had tuberculosis—I did not tell the prisoner that it had consumption of the bowels; I never thought so—he never asked me what was the matter with it—I told him it was suffering from improper feed<lb/>ing; that it was very bad and likely to die very soon.</p>

I am medical superintendent of the Royal India Asylum, Ealing—about 8 o'clock on the night of 12th February I was at dinner—the door was suddenly opened, with a cry of "Phœbe is being murdered"—I at once left the room with my son and went to the library—Phœbe passed me just as I went in—I can scarcely say that I noticed her just then—I saw her directly afterwards, and I attended to her wounds—I saw the prisoner in the library—my son seized him, and he was brought into the hall and handed over to some attendant—I sent for the police—I then examined Phœbe—I found that she had a wound at the back of her right baud; three fingers were divided right across—there were four separate cuts; the three fingers might have been cut by one cut; the other one was a separate one in a different direction—they were done with a sharp instrument such as a razor—they were about one-eighth of an inch deep—she had a bruise on her forehead, which I imagine must hare been done by the carpet when she fell—she had no cap on—I found that in the library behind the door a chair was turned over and the legs broken off.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector X</hi>). I was sent for to the asylum—as I was going along I saw the prisoner in custody of one of the attendants, Dr. Christie and his son following behind—the prisoner was given in custody by the doctor for attempting to murder—on the way to the station he said he only did it to frighten her—he was charged at the station with wilfully cutting and wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm—I cautioned him, and took this down in writing as what he said: "I went to see my wife at the Asylum; I was shown into the study. After a short time she came in. I paid, 'I am going away to-morrow or next day, and I want you to take care of some papers for me.' She said she would take tare if anything for me, but don't come here again. I told her I wanted to give her a keeper ring, and I lent her a pencil to mark it, which she did on a piece of paper. I then said, 'Now, Phœbe, this is the third man I have caught you with, if it occurs again I will give you the contents of this,' pulling out the razor from my pocket. She grasped the razor; it was not open. I called out 'Murder, and I know nothing more"—I read it over to him; he signed it—I afterwards went into the study of the Asylum, and found this piece of paper, a pencil, and a wedding-ring on the floor, also a woman's cap—Christie pave me the razor at the station.</p>

He denied at the police-court that he had ever been convicted, but he has been locked up several times for assaults on his father and on the police. He threw a boot at his father and only got two months for it, and his father died alter from the effects of it. The chaplain of Warwick Gaol got him on board a fishing smack, and he got eight months for an assault on the captain. Harry Cohen, who took the coat, is a well-known receiver of stolen goods, and has had three terms of penal servitude. He knew that Falk stole the coat when the brokers were in. He knew all about Hooper's, as Fardell's sent him there for orders.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Model Buildings, Gray's Inn Road, and am a hackney carriage driver, badge No. 2619—on Monday, 28th January, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Norman at Rutland's, the Old Drury Tavern, in Catherine Street, Strand—I was driving a Hansom's cab, No. 3566—we had something to drink—I took a job, and came back and stopped with him till 6 o'clock—then we went to the Brunswick Mews to change horses, and then I went down the Commercial Road with Norman inside my cab, and down Cannon Street Road to the Golden Lion, where we stopped till a quarter or 20 minutes past 10 drinking together—I came over queer and stopped down Cannon Street Road all night, and Norman took my cab home for me about 20 minutes past 10—Norman is a driver; I have known him about three or four years, during which time he has always borne the character of an honest man, or I should not have trusted him with my cab—I know Coveney; he is nearly always drunk on the rank of a night; we have often asked him to look after our cabs, and come back and found him lying in a public-house drunk—I don't know who appoints the looker-out—I cannot say what condition he was in on this night.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Samuel Street, Cannon Street Road, and am a stoker in the merchant service—on Monday evening, 28th January, I saw Sills and Norman drive a cab up to my mother's house, 21, Samuel Street, about 7 o'clock—I knew Sills before—I went out and asked them if they were coming inside—we had a few words, and then all three of us drove to the Golden lion, in Cannon Street Road—we stopped there till 10.30, and then Sills was queer, and asked Norman to take his cab home for him—Norman drove the cab, and I went with him, standing at the back on the springs talking to him—we drove some<lb/>where where there are new buildings and a statue, and Norman was stopped by a gentleman—I got on the pavement; the gentleman got in the cab—Norman said to me "I am going to King's Cross, Tem; I will meet you at Mr. Rutland's at 12 o'clock"—I knew Mr. Rutland's, in Catherine Street—Norman came there with Sills's cab about one or two minutes after 12 o'clock—he left the cab outside on the rank with five or six others, and we went and had a glass—Coveney came in and asked Norman to treat him—Norman said "I haven't got any money to spare, but you can have a share of this," giving him his pot; Coveney drank it all—he wasn't sober; this was 12.20 or 12.25—we stopped there till every one had left; me, Coveney, and Norman were the last three to leave; we had been there about 20 minutes—when we came out Norman said "We will take <hi rend="italic">Waxy's</hi> (meaning Sills's) cab home," and he got on the seat and said "Jump up, Tom," and I got</p>

               <p>up on the springs as I had before, and went to Brunswick Mews—I did not see Coveney as we drove off; he left as we came out of Rutland's—I did not see anything of Edwards—we stopped at the top of the mews—Norman said "I don't like to drive the cab down the yard, I will fetch the yardman," and I stopped at the top of the yard with the cab while Norman went and fetched the yardman; the horsekeeper came and took the lamp from the cab and had a look at it, and asked Norman who he was, and Norman said "It is Silk's, he is queer, and asked me to bring it home for him"—he left the cab there in charge of the yardman, and we went homewards, I going with him as far as Guildford Street, leaving him about 12.50.</p>

Dodson on false pretences—I will tell you if you wish to know all about this man's vil<lb/>lainy—Messrs. Dodson have got the picture now, I have given it up since the examination—I refused at first to give it up under the advice of my solicitor—I said that it was not in my shop—it was on my premises, but I said that it was not in my shop because I wanted to consult my solicitor—I bought 950 cigars of the prisoner—I sold him a picture by Shayer as a genuine one—it was not returned to me on the ground that it was not genuine—I told him I would take it back if he did not approve of it—it was returned because he was not satisfied with it, not because it was not genuine, because it was a genuine Shayer—I don't think he said that in his opinion it was not a Shayer—I took it back and allowed him the same money as he was to pay me—I am not indebted in commission to him, nor has he ever made any claim for it—I never made arrange<lb/>ments with him for selling a number of pictures, or to give him commis<lb/>sion—we were not negotiating daily about whether if I bought certain articles he thought he could sell them for me—I sent to him as to buying some pictures which I had offered me—I did not tell him that if he could dispose of them I would give him a commission, or part of the profits—I was not to give him anything for his opinion on those pictures—he has come to my place in the evening after he had done work, but we were not constantly together discussing the value of pictures—I don't know that if I get him convicted I shall get my pictures from Cox, with whom they are pawned—I have been told that if I convict him I can apply for the restoration of them—I suppose an application will be made if I con<lb/>vict him—they are worth 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so that to convict him it is 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my pocket if I get the pictures back.</p>

I am a solicitor, of 3, New Inn—I was retained by Mr. Munster to act as solicitor in the action which he was about to bring against the <hi rend="italic">Brightonian</hi> newspaper—my clerk; issued the writ in accordance with what appeared to be the publisher's name at the bottom of the paper—the appearance was entered on 9th February—at that time I was not aware that any other person was connected with that paper except the person who appeared to the writ—the statement; of claim was drawn believing it to be a genuine and proper appearance—I did not know of any "Co." at that time—the action was tried on 22nd June and terminated on the 24th—in accordance with the judgment I prepared Mr. Minister's bill of costs on the scale between solicitor and client, which is the highest scale—the bill was submitted to the proper officer of the Court for taxation—Mr. Nye in the first place acted as solicitor for Mr. Railton; about March there was a change of solicitors, and Messrs. Lamb and Evett acted for him—a gentleman from the office of Messrs. Palmer and Bull, their London agents, attended the taxation—we attended before the Master three or four times, the allocator is on the Judgment—Mr. Evett attended personally to the case in London—Mr. Cox and Mr. Railton were together at the trial; I believe Mr. Cox was sitting with his solicitor and Railton in the little well of the Court beneath his Counsel—I did not notice Mr. Cox take any part in the con<lb/>sultation with Counsel—I think execution was lodged with the Sheriff on 20th or 21st August—I heard of this bill of sale within four or five days, from the Sheriff; I received a letter which had been sent by Lamb and Evett to the Sheriff; that was the first I ever heard of the bill of sale—I received a notice from the Sheriff's officer—I think the Sheriff interpleaded before the Judge at Chambers—in the first place it came before the Master in Chambers, and was referred to the Judge, and on 5th September an issue was directed to be tried at Lewes in reference to this bill of sale—Mr. Cox was the claimant and Mr. Munster was the execution creditor—Mr. Cox produced an affidavit in support of his claim—I am not acquainted with Mr. Cox's writing—the next Assizes for Sussex where civil business was taken would be in January, 1883; I think the commission day was 10th January—we served this notice to produce certain documents upon Mr. Cox's agents in London (<hi rend="italic">Dated January 9, 1883.</hi>)—I did not then know for certain that there had been any deed of partnership; I had a suspicion that such was the case, and that was a sort of tentative notice—the case was tried on 15th January before Mr. Justice Field, and a verdict passed for the claimant, Mr. Cox—amongst the witnesses I sub<lb/>poenaed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188402250109"/>
               <p>at that trial was Mr. Goodman, a solicitor of Brighton—he was subpœnaed within a day or two of the commission day—at that time I had heard that there was a deed of partnership prepared by him—I saw Mr. Evett at the Assize Court between the 11th. and 15th, I can't say which day—I saw him with reference to producing the deed—I think he was there every day—Mr. Evett and Mr. Goodman were together in the other Court, where the criminal business was proceeding—Mr. Evett undertook to produce that deed at the trial—a letter was handed to me undertaking to produce it—in consequence of that I dispensed with Mr. Goodman's services at that trial—I should not have done so had I not received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">This stated:</hi> "If the defendant will excuse your attendance we certainly will do so")—that was not altered at Mr. Good<lb/>man's request—I was not satisfied with having an undertaking to pro<lb/>duce the deed, I said "I insist on its production"—I did not know what the nature of Mr. Goodman's evidence would be—an application for a new trial was made in the February following, and the rule was made absolute on 15th March, 1882—upon that Mr. Cox applied to the Court of Appeal; that appeal was heard on 19th January—the decision of the Court below was confirmed, and the appeal was dismissed—in June, 1883, there was a motion in the Bankruptcy Court—Mr. Railton had, I believe, become bankrupt—I was present when he was adjudicated in November, 1882—on 26th June, 1883, a motion in Bankruptcy was made in Railton's matter—the original file is here—(<hi rend="italic">This stated:</hi> "Upon motion made, &amp;c., the Court being of opinion that the said bill of sale is fraudulent and void as against the said trustee, &amp;c, the said bill of sale is hereby set aside"—on 2nd July I received this notice of abandonment, from the agents to Lane and Evett—(<hi rend="italic">Abandoning all claim to the goods, in consequence of the bill of sale having been declared void. Signed, "Palmer and Bull</hi>")—the matter was first heard by Mr. Justice Manisty, who adjourned it over the long vacation—they served me with a summons to stay all proceed<lb/>ings—it came on on November 3rd, before Justice Field—this is his order: "On hearing Counsel on both sides, &amp;c., it is ordered that the claimant, R. C. Cox, pay all costs, and that all further proceedings under the interpleader issue be stayed,"</p>

               <p>the first place that I gave the notice, but I went down to Brighton on the commission day—at the time I gave that notice to produce I had not heard from anybody that there was a partnership deed, otherwise I should have inserted the particulars of it—no one had told me that Mr. Cox and and Mr. Railton had been in partnership together at that time—it was my informant, Mr. Brandreth, who induced me to subpoena Mr. Goodman—I know nothing about Mr. Brandreth having six months' imprisonment—I do not know that he was a partner in the firm of Brandreth and Grey; I know he was a Brighton solicitor—I have heard he was struck off the rolls—I have heard that he was prosecuted for obtaining money by false pretences and sent to prison for six months—I have no reason to disbelieve it—I have no knowledge of it one way or the other—I know nothing about it—I have never asked anybody, but he has mentioned it I himself—he told me of it—he never acted as my clerk; I say that posi<lb/>tively—I have asked him to do things for me, to serve documents possibly, I to save the expense of sending down to Brighton—I never paid him for I doing anything of the kind—I have paid him money that he was out of pocket, if he paid money for me in serving subpoenas—I paid him for travelling expenses and loss of time; I paid him for the time he has been engaged—I have had very few occasions, I think, to employ him—he I wired one or two subpoenas, I believe, for me in this case—I laid the information in this case—I did not send a copy of that information to Mr. Brandreth—I do not think he has had a copy in his possession, unless I he has been at the police-court and seen it—I know as a matter of fact that Mr. Brandreth has seen Railton, and he has reported to me the re<lb/>sults of his interviews—I have no writing from Brandreth—I did not em<lb/>ploy or instruct Brandreth to see Railton—he came to me and told me he had seen Railton—it was not with my authority in the first instance that he went to see Railton—I do not know whether he is here—to the best of my recollection that letter was handed to me by Mr. Evett in the Central Criminal Court—I cannot be sure—Mr. Evett and Mr. Goodman were both together in the Central Criminal Court—Mr. Goodman said something about having business in Brighton, in the presence of Mr. Evett; they were both together—I cannot be sure, but I to the best of my belief it was Mr. Evett who said that to me—I told I them I could not have the letter from Messrs. Lamb and Evett in its original form—I cannot be sure whether it was in Mr. Goodman's hands; it was one or the other; they were both together—it meant nothing as it stood; I objected to it in that form on the ground that it was not a positive undertaking to produce; I wanted to make sure that the deed would be produced—I did not know the nature of Mr. Goodman's evidence—objected to it in that form, and the ground of my objection was that it was not a positive undertaking to produce—I do not think Mr. Goodman altered the letter thereupon in his own hand-writing—I cannot be sure who altered the letter—I swear that Mr. Evett was there—Mr. Goodman did not show me the letter; I did not object to it and Mr. Goodman did not then take it away and bring it back altered—I followed Mr. Goodman—the moment it was altered we walked together to where Mr. Evett was sitting in the Criminal Court, where it was altered, I cannot say by whom—I do not know that it in Mr. Goodman's writing—having that undertaking I agreed that Mr. Goodman need not attend; I did not want to detain him—in December, 1882, I was acting as solicitor for the trustee in the bank<lb/>ruptcy</p>

               <p>of Railton, and made an application to postpone the interpleader issue; I think nothing was done, that no order was made—the Judge endorsed the order, I think; if you have it it will speak for itself—the order was dismissed before the Master; then it came before Mr. Justice North; upon my appeal from the Master's decision the Judge made an order, I think in substance confirming the Master's order; I am not sure—it is here: "No order unless within forty-eight hours Mr. Munster agrees to abandon this issue; if he does so, summons to be put in the paper; if Mr. Munster so agrees, Mr. Cox agrees to waive all claims on the issue by 1st January"—it may be "all claims to his costs on the issue;" I have read it as it is here: "Cox to have costs of this applica<lb/>tion"—the interpleader order had been made directing the trial of the issue as between Mr. Munster and Mr. Cox, but no step, I believe, had been taken in bankruptcy with the object of testing the validity of the bill of sale—I made an affidavit alleging that it was desirable that the interpleader issue should be stayed until the validity of the bill of sale had been tested in the bankruptcy proceedings; of course I contemplated making such an application—it was undoubtedly intended at that time that the validity of the bill of sale should be tested in the bankruptcy proceedings; I thought we should have a better chance of succeeding than the Trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings—I did not agree to abandon the issue and allow this to be tested in the bankruptcy pro<lb/>ceedings, because I thought that the circumstances were such as required investigation and we should have a better chance in bankruptcy—it was evident to my mind that Mr. Cox wished to evade an investi<lb/>gation; in bankruptcy proceedings you can bring people forward and cross-examine them, and we have done so in this case, and Mr. Cox's depositions in bankruptcy have been used as evidence in this case—I thought the bill of sale itself was an act of bankruptcy, and therefore it would be more easy to set it aside in bankruptcy as against the Trustee, I anticipated there would be much greater difficulty in regard to the execution creditor—I thought that his personal interests would be better served by the interpleader—there were two distinct questions there, one between Mr. Cox and my client Mr. Munster, and the other between Mr. Cox and the Trustee in bankruptcy, representing all the creditors—Mr. Munster had no interest to serve at that time because he had given a personal engagement to the Judge of the County Court to bring into the bankrupt's estate anything he might recover under that issue, to test the circumstances attending the giving of the bill of sale—I do not think it is more easy to ascertain in bankruptcy the whole circumstances than it is in a litigated interpleader issue, because in bankruptcy we have to abide by the decision of the Judge or Registrar and in an inter<lb/>pleader you would have the benefit of a Jury, and I thought we should have a better chance of arriving at the <hi rend="italic">bona-fides</hi> or otherwise of the bill of sale, and I thought that possibly the necessity would not arise for such an investigation in bankruptcy; preferred an investigation in which a Jury would form their opinion, and there was an investigation at Lewes and the Jury found in favour of the bill of sale—on the very day after the bill of sale had been set aside as void against the Trustes in bankruptcy we gave notice of a new trial of the interpleader issue—the rule for a new trial had been made absolute, and we intended to proceed unless we were stopped by the Court—the appeal by Mr. Cox</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188402250113"/>
               <p>against making the rule absolute was on 19th June, and on 26th June it was set aside on behalf of the trustee, and thereupon we gave notice of a new trial of the issue—there were a good many creditors in Railton's bankruptcy, they are all scheduled; I do not know how many proved, Mr. Evett at the first meeting of creditors produced a long string of them—I was not solicitor at that time, I became solicitor for the trustee in bankruptcy subsequently; I became solicitor to the trustee some time after December, I cannot fix the date, the order is here, if you will allow me to look at the file I will tell you. (<hi rend="italic">The file was handed to the witness</hi>), it would be about the commencement of January, 1883—I cannot tell you how many creditors have proved in that bankruptcy, they are not sent to me—the assets conveyed by this bill of sale were sold to Mr. Cox for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the greater part of which is in the hands of the trustee, nothing has been distributed yet—I have sent in my bill against the trustee, it has been taxed at 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe—when the bill of sale was set aside as against the trustee there was an order against Mr. Cox for the costs, which came to about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Cox's solicitors paid them, I do not suggest that they paid them out of their own pockets—Mr. Cox has paid further sums for costs, he was ordered to pay the costs of the case at Lewes, he paid about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the costs of one appeal, I think, were paid separately, they came to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think—he has paid us altogether in respect of costs about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over and above the 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he paid when he purchased the assets.</p>

               <p>a duplicate was given to Mr. Railton or Mr. Cox of the original deed; I cannot say which—it was my suggestion—when they came to execute it, it was suggested that I should hold it on behalf of both parties, but I suggested that the better plan would be to have it in duplicate, and some little time afterwards I gave a second copy—I am told that the action before before Mr. Justice Hawkins came on on June 24—I remember Railton and Cox calling on me; I cannot say whether it was in June—here is an entry in my memorandum book, "Mr. Cox, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I meant to charge 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the attendance, but I suppose I took 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot fix my mind whether that refers to the Mr. Cox in question; it is I only fair to say that the names of Cox and Railton are not in my call-book at all, but I have an entry on the 28th of a Mr. Cox calling and a 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. payment—I assume that it refers to the defendant, but I cannot positively say, if it does not I cannot fix the date—Railton said, when he and Mr. Cox called, "I suppose you have heard the result of the Munster case?"—I said "Yes"—Mr. Railton said, "Can anything be done to prevent the property being sold" or "seized under an execution?"—I said, "Only a sale of the property to a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> purchaser' '—Railton said, "Could the property be sold and I remain in possession as manager?"—I said "No," I thought possession should be given up, that they should go out of possession—he said "That would do," or something to that effect, "can I give a bill of sale to Mr. Cox?"—I said, "No, you cannot, because of the partnership"—he said, "Does any one know of the partnership agreement excepting you and our<lb/>selves?"—I said "No, not that I am aware of, only my clerks"—Cox said, "You don't think a bill of sale will do, Mr. Goodman?"—I said "No, certainly not"—they asked my fee and paid it, and left the office—nothing was said about a dissolution of partnership at that interview—I have given you the whole of the conversation word for word as far as I remember.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Apart from that entry I have not the slightest idea when it was—whatever conversation took place was with me as a solicitor, and was paid for at the end of the interview—as far as I know the partnership has always been kept a secret from the world, it was specially arranged that it should not be published—Mr. Cox is a chemist who has carried on business some years in Brighton, and is a Town Councillor and is a very respectable man—there were reasons why his partnership in a paper should not be talked about all over the town, we realised that when we mentioned it at the time—nothing was said either way as to whether the partnership had been dissolved or not—I was served with a subpoena <hi rend="italic">duces tecum</hi> to produce the agreement at Lewes—I had not got it—I saw Mr. Brewer—I called at Lamb and Evett's office and saw Mr. Evett—I said, "I don't want to go to Lewes unnecessarily, will you produce it?"—he said, "Certainly, we shall produce it in our own case"—I said, "Will you give me a letter, that I may show it to the solicitor on the other side?"—he said "Yes," and he sent me round a letter from Lamb and Evett addressed to me, and saying, "We will undertake to produce it"—having got that letter I went to Lewes next morning and called on Mr. Woollett, the barrister—I saw him in the robbing-room, and he said that he would see his client later on in the day—Mr. Brewer was pointed out to me, and I showed him the letter—he said, "I do not like that, it is not a positive undertaking"—I altered it</p>

               <p>then and there, and got Mr. Evett to re-sign it—I believe I altered it myself, whether I did or not, Mr. Evett acknowledged that it meant so—all this was entirely for my convenience and at my desire absolutely, because I had to go to East Grinstead on the Monday—Cox has resided some years in Brighton; he is a man of great respectability, totally incapable of committing any dishonourable act; I know him intimately, I cannot find language too strong to speak in his favour.</p>

                  </hi>. live at Franklin Road, Brighton—I was formerly editor of the <hi rend="italic">Brightonian</hi>, and was so during 1881—I recollected this action being brought against the publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Brightonian</hi> by Mr. Munster for libel—I saw the writ—I believe it was issued about the early part of February, 1882—Railton, I believe, showed it to me—it is highly probable I saw Mr. Cox a few days afterwards, as I was constantly seeing him about the town—I knew him very well—it is highly probable that I had seen him at the offices of the <hi rend="italic">Brightonian</hi> in Duke Street in 1882, shortly after the issue of the writ—I would not swear to any one day, but I can safely say that I had seen him there about that time—I saw him frequently in conversation with Mr. Railton—I cannot remember any one particular occasion on which Mr. Cox said anything specific to me about what the writ was for, we were certain to speak on the subject—I recollect his saying on one occasion in a good-natured way "You have got us into a nice mess," or something of that sort—I dare say I answered it good-naturedly, I do not know what I said—it is highly probable I said it would do good to the paper,—my idea was to gloss the matter over and make it appear in as simple a light as possible; I may say I did say-so, now I remember—<hi rend="italic">The Brightonian</hi> is the genece name applied to the paper; it is published at a penny weekly—I cannot say whether Mr. Railton made any remark, I am not even sure that he was there at the time—I was constantly seeing both of them; perhaps every two or three days, and naturally it was the subject of common talk in the office—I could not fix any one day—it was a topic of conversation between me and Mr. Railton, not so much on the part of Mr. Cox—I did not see him so often as I saw Mr. Railton—I do not know what you are leading up to—I have not been seen by a solicitor in the matter—I know nothing of the matter since I was in Bow Street—fifty conversations may occurred—lean safely say that between the issue of the writ and the time the action was tried I had conversations with Railton relative to the action, and as to Mr. Cox's connection with the matter—I cannot bind myself to the specific words—on one or two occasions we have spokes with regard to the liability of Mr. Cox in the matter and the line of defence proposed to be taken—I have spoken slightly occasionally about the same topics with Mr. Cox, but I do not think there was any definite statement made by him to me—we spoke generally as persons mutually interested about the subject matter of this action—I attended at Messrs. Lamb and Evett's office, and gave them my account of the transaction, and was called as a witness at the trial before Sir Henry Hawkins on the 22nd, and it terminated on the 24th, I believe—it was tried at Westminster; and after the trial was over Railton, Cox, and I went together to London Bridge Railway Station—there was a conversation between us with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188402250117"/>
               <p>reference to the action and how it resulted—the conversation was this: Mr. Cox said it would cost him a certain sum—Railton objected, and offered to make a bet that it had not cost 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think that was the amount—Mr. Cox replied that if it had not it would by the time it was over, or something to that effect—on the day of the trial I had tea with Railton—I was anxious to know what the issue would be, and I think I put it to him—we had talked over the possible means and ways of getting out of the matter—I remember he suggested that there were ways of getting out of the matter, and I was anxious to know what they were, of course—it is useless for me to attempt to give it word for word; he suggested giving a bill of sale to Mr. Cox; I think there was something else; it was not spoken definitely as though it were agreed; it was simply a I suggestion, a possibility—observations were passed that Mr. Munster should have nothing; it was a sort of understood thing that Mr. Munster would get nothing, or that he would get no benefit, that it would do him I no good; it was put in a qualified sort of way—Mr. Railton was re<lb/>markably cheerful over it—I remember Brighton regatta; it was in August, or later perhaps; it is generally fixed about eight different dates and carried on; it was somewhere in August, or September, or October—Mr. Railton had a boat, and I was anxious that he should sail it or that I should sail it in the regatta—I remember walking down, and on the way I looked at the boat—as far as I remember he was very much in the I blues and I tried to divert him on the subject of the regatta, but even<lb/>tually the conversation turned on the subject of the action and a great I deal was said; I think on that occasion he spoke more definitely with I regard to his prospective bankruptcy and the means of saving himself—at the tea he returned to the subject of the method of getting out of the I matter, and the impression I came away with was that something definite I had been arranged or would be come to to avoid the payment of costs—if I remember rightly it was the giving of a bill of sale to Mr. Cox which I invoked the question of partnership; then I am also under the im<lb/>pression that the question of liability of partnership was discussed and that something was said with regard to a dissolution; that there would have to be a bill of sale and then a formal dissolution of partnership; something to that effect—I think objected that it could not well be I done—if I remember rightly Railton said it would have to be done before last January—Mr. Railton talked to me about this matter more than once no doubt; we were constantly together; it was the principal topic of mutual interest—the trial at Lewes was on 15th January, 1883, the interpleader issue, before Mr. Justice Field—I remember on one occasion shortly before the trial Mr. Railton coming and inquiring about a little ink case that used to be in the office; it was a small pocket arrangement, holding three kinds of ink, and it was not there; either I had had it or put it away; at any rate I was responsible for it—I do not think he said I what he wanted it for—I remember looking for it; had had it or I mislaid it or something, and he seemed a little bit annoyed about it, and I remember his asking me if one of them was an indelible ink—I do not remember answering him—he did not say what he wanted the indelible ink for—I also remember a few minutes later he came to my room with a bottle of ink and wanted to exchange it for mine, and I think objected or said I was using it, or something of that kind, and he compromised the matter by mixing the ink from my inkstand with his own which he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188402250120"/>
               <p>had in the outer office in his desk—I cannot give the precise date; I am under the impression that it might have been, or rather that it was a very short period before the trial at Lewes; three, four, five, or six days, a short period I know—Mr. Cox came to the office I believe about that time; it might have been the same day, but I could not remember now—I remember Mr. Cox having a conversation with Mr. Railton about that time—there is an outer office and an inner office—I was in the inner office, and I remember Mr. Railton coming in—I believe Mr. Cox was outside; of course I am assuming this to be the occasion I imagine it to be; Mr. Railton held in his hand a paper, and asked me "You know about this partnership being dissolved?"—I looked at the paper and noticed some writing—I could not swear to this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but it is very much like it—this is how I saw it; while talking to him he doubled it in this way and held it in his hand like this (<hi rend="italic">folded</hi>)—he did not ask me to do anything—I made no answer, except that I laughed and said "All right," or something to that effect; I wanted him to leave me, and I said "Get out"—I assumed I knew what he wanted—I was very busy, and I do not think I looked up—I could not tell you how I gathered the idea, I don't know—I don't know that I should be justified in saying that I had any actual intimation, but from things which had passed on various occasions I assumed that he would want me to do something of the kind, but he never asked me definitely to witness any<lb/>thing—I won't say "witness," but to assist him in the matter; mind you, it was only assumption on my part; that assumption was drawn from previous conversation, and from his coming in with the paper—when I told him to get out Mr. Cox, if it was he, said "Never mind, we won't trouble him," or something of that kind—I saw Mr. Railton after the trial at Lewes numbers of times, and it is highly probable he spoke to me with reference to the trial—he spoke to me about the evidence that Mr. Evett gave and Mr. Cox gave at the trial at Lewes, before Mr. Justice Field—it was not very uncomplimentary, it was something to the effect that Mr. Evett had made a muddle of his evidence, and Mr. Cox had done as badly, or that Mr. Cox had made a muddle of his evidence and Mr. Evett had done just as badly; I know he was displeased with the way they had conducted themselves in the box—he was very indignant, very much annoyed at the turn affairs had taken; but he won the action—I do not say he said that he was annoyed, but I gathered that—I won't I bind myself as to whether it was on the same occasion he said this, but he said that the matter had been altogether muddled by Messrs. Lamb and Evett—I think he said something to the effect that the matter had been designed or arranged by Mr. Lamb, who had hit Evett and Thorpe to shuffle out of it—I am inclined to think he said Mr. Lamb, and not "the firm," but I would not bind myself; and he said he had left Evett and Thorpe to shuffle out of it—he was very dissatisfied with what Mr. Lamb had done, and in effect he said that the witnesses had muddled the matter—I have talked this matter more or less over with Mr. Railton since this trial—we were always together, we were together four days a week—I withdraw my remark that I made just now I, thought you were speak<lb/>ing of the action—there was no occasion for Mr. Railton to say anything I about the dissolution, that is to make any definite statement to me about I how things were going on, because I was supposed to know; I should I gather it by inference—I gathered that it was an understood thing that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188402250121"/>
               <p>there was an attempt being made to defend themselves in this matter, and get themselves out of it—I dare say there was more if I could remem<lb/>ber it—I was examined as a witness when the matter came before Sir James Ingham at Bow Street—I was subpœnaed at eight hours' notice—no solicitor took my proof down—I refused to give evidence, but I went into the witness-box—I said that I was an unwilling witness—since that time I have given my evidence to the Treasury—I went there and saw Mr. Pollard; I was examined and pumped, and the result of the pumping was reduced to writing, and what I have told you to-day is the truth about the matter—there is not the slightest doubt about that.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188402250122"/>
               <p>was mixed, and that it was intended that you should sign it, or that there had been some idea of your signing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you put it so pointed, yes; that was the impression made on my mind, and what I believe—not the slightest doubt that a voice like Mr. Cox's, which I am not likely to forget, because I remember voices very well, said "All right," or something about "We won't trouble him"—I could not see his lips; I have not the slightest doubt it was Mr. Cox that said that, but I distinctly refuse to swear to it—I did not look at the paper closely; it was close enough for me to see the colour of the ink—that is not necessarily looking at it closely enough to see the colour of the ink, it was very close indeed to me—I looked at it; I saw the colour of the ink, not to form an opinion of when that ink had been used, but to have an idea that the ink had not been long written—I believe the ink was not wet, for the simple reason that the paper was held in his hand in such a manner that had it been wet he must have smeared it—he held it like that (<hi rend="italic">folding</hi>), so that I could notice the flourish of that "R" in particular; I always noticed and always admired the symmetry of that letter in his signature; and I also remember looking and seeing another; here is an "R" at the bottom; and while talking to me he turned it in his thumb in that way so that I was able to see this "R"—he held it in his hand like this, so that in looking at the paper I could see this "R" there—I do not know whether you can see it so far, but there is a very conspicuous "R" there—it was not laid before me to look at; it did not pass out of his hand—I think at the police-court I said the ink was pale; I did not say the writing on the paper was blue; that was taken down, but I corrected it in my evidence, and also when the clerk read it over to me I said: "For" blue' read ‘pale' or ‘faint'"—at the police-court when I was examined that document was shown to me; I said "I was never asked to witness an endorsement like that; I have never been asked to put my name to any writing of the same substance as that now shown me, to put my name to a dissolution of partnership, or to a paper purporting to be a dissolution," and it is true. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say "I remember Mr. Cox and Mr. Railton being in the office scores of times before the trial at Lewes; Mr. Railton showed me a document; I do not remember what it was; I do not remember what he said." Was that true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Read the context again; read on a little further, there may be something to explain it—it all depends upon how the question was put; you will not fluster me—I remember what Mr. Railton said on that day—I said he showed me a document, I do not know what it was—I do not remember what he said—that was true, but still it all depends how that question was put—I also swore there that I did remember what he said—I said "He once came into the room with a paper which was or might be like this; I do not recognise it, I never had it in my hand, if I re<lb/>member rightly he said something like 'Do you knew,' or 'you do know that the partnership is dissolved'"—that is what I said, and that is what I now stick to—I do not attempt to give the words which Mr. Railton used; I never attempt to bind myself to actual words unless the words are very short and very emphatic—I was very cautious, and am now—I was going to tell you to whom I said the ink on the paper was wet when you interrupted me—if you won't listen to what I say what is the use of asking me questions? I certainly shall answer the questions in my own way—I believe I said this at the police-court "I remember</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188402250123"/>
               <p>saying something like this: that the ink on the paper Mr. Railton had in his hand was wet"—I believe I said it to a man who was then my land<lb/>lord, named Quick—undoubtedly I talked too indiscreetly, perhaps, to several people after this matter, as I thought, was settled, and the other side fished that out and put it by way of a shock to me—I did not talk untruly—that statement came through other hands—I do not think my lips uttered that statement to Mr. Quick—I do not believe I made that definite statement, that the ink was wet, to any one; the answer was made quickly; the question was whether it was wet or fresh writing—the answer I made, as I explained afterwards, was that I used "wet" as a general term to imply it was fresh writing; I do not remember that I said it was wet—I made a statement no doubt to Mr. Quick, to the effect that at the time it was shown me the paper was, if not wet, so fresh that no doubt it had been only just written; I think that is clear enough—I dare say I said that the ink was wet, not the slightest doubt—I cannot recall when I said it, or where—I said it to Mr. Quick, I believe, but I will not bind myself to that; I talked of this matter to two or three people, and what I wanted to imply was that when I saw this endorse<lb/>ment the writing was so fresh that if not wet it was fresh writing—you are trying to tie me down; I repudiate it—I remained till November, 1882, in the service of Mr. Cox, upon the <hi rend="italic">Brightonian</hi>—in the month of November Mr. Railton gave me a month's notice to leave that paper; I refused to take any notice of it, and sent it back to him as you have it—I won't fix myself to any one date when I left the <hi rend="italic">Brightonian</hi>, I should say a month after that—I do not remember if I asked Mr. Railton if he meant the notice he had given me to stand good—I do not remember his saying "Yes," and then my saying "I will start another paper and crush you in a short time;" certainly not—I won't say "nothing of the kind"—if I remember rightly what I said was (this was not that time, because we were most friendly then, on most amicable terms) in the course of conversation, that I was going to start another paper; it was said in a most friendly manner, and what he said was he hoped it would pay—I returned the notice he gave me on the 16th November, and declined to take it—I did leave a month afterwards, it was my interest to do so—I don't believe that between those dates I asked him "Do you mean the notice to stand good?" and saying "I will start another paper to crush you"—if I had I should have remembered it—I had no reply to my letter—no agreement was made that I should apologise and the action not be proceeded with; most emphatically no.</p>

Railton being lodged with the Sheriff—the officer levied under it and was met by a claim on behalf of Cox, upon which an interpleader summons was taken out on 3rd August, 1882—that summons came on in the first instance before the Master at Chambers on 25th August—<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MUNSTER</hi>. and Cox were present—the Master's order was adjourned till Tuesday to consider the claim in the event of its being referred to the Judge—on 3rd September, 1882,1 received from Messrs. Palmer and Bull these instructions for Counsel, and on 6th September I received this letter from Messrs. Lamb and Evett containing these articles: "Dear Sir, Cox and Railton. These gentlemen will be with you at 1.45 to-morrow, and our Mr. Evett will meet you in the Royal Courts of Justice about 2 or 3. Yours, Lamb and Evett. We enclose articles of partnership. To Messrs. Palmer and Bull, solicitors"—when I received these articles of partnership this endorsement of dissolution was upon it, and it was in the same state as it is now in all respects—Mr. Gill was the Counsel instructed to appear on the inter<lb/>pleader issue—I personally attended to it at chambers before it came on—I saw Mr. Gill in the Judge's chambers' ante-room—I had the articles of partnership with the dissolution on it, and I produced it to him and went into the matter with him—I have the back sheet of the brief I delivered to him, it contains words in his handwriting which he made at the time; they are, "Articles of Agreement, 9th April, 1881, dissolved 3rd January, 1882"—then is a further note he took, "Bill of sale, 12th August, 1882"—I read the instructions which came up from Brighton on 3rd September; it contains a verbatim copy of the endorsement on the deed of dissolution—the summons was attended by Mr. Gill on 5th January—the matter was not gone into because Mr. Munster asked for an issue before a Judge—the articles of partnership remained in my custody till 3rd January, 1883—this is my firm's letter-book; it contains a press copy of the letter addressed to Lamb and Evett df that date, stating that we returned enclosed the articles of partnership to them; they were handed back to them for the purpose of the trial coming on in London; I assumed they would want them, and sent them.</p>

I said "31, Halstead Street, Brockley"—she said "I know nothing about it"—I asked if she had anything there that did not belong to her, she said "No"—I then searched the room, and under a skirt which was hanging behind the door I found this silk dolman—I asked her if that belonged to her—she said "No, to my daughter"—I asked the daughter, who was present, if it belonged to her—she said "No"—the prisoner then said "Well, I bought it, and was going to make my daughter a present of it"—I said "Where did you buy it?" she said "I shall not tell you"—I made further search, and found a bonnet box which she claimed as her own, with two silk handkerchiefs inside—I took her to Brockley station, and she was charged—when</p>

On 21st January, about 8.5 a.m., I saw the prisoners in Old Woolwich Road, Greenwich; they had just drawn up a barrow with a basket on it at Francis's marine-store shop—Sisson went in and Winch remained outside—I lifted up the bag and saw that it con<lb/>tained a quantity of melted fat; (it was taken to the station, and Mr. Streeton identified it)—I kept observation on it, and in 20 minutes the marine-store dealer went to breakfast, and when he returned Sisson entered—I met him coming out—he said to the marine-store man "If that is it I will go and get a receipt to show that I bought it on board a ship"—Winch stood by the barrow some time, and then walked down</p>

On 21st January, about 8.45 a.m., in consequence of what Drew said to me I followed Winch into Bury Street; he kept looking back, and then returned to the barrow—I asked him what he was going to do with the fat; he trembled and shook, made a dart and rushed off—I followed and caught him, and said "What are you running away for?"—he said "I don't know; it is not my fat"—I took him to Mr. Robinson; he said that he had not been in his place that morning—I said that I was not satisfied, and should take him to the station—when we got to Queen Street he said "I am not going any farther," and threw me down and bit my arm—I lost him, but caught him again, and got him to the station with assistance—I then went out and found Sisson, and asked him for his pocket-book; he gave it to me—I looked at it, compared it with this, and said "The writing looks very much alike," and asked him if he wrote it—he said that they came from the ship—I went up the river to find the ship, but could not—I met another detective, who told me that a quantity of fat had been stolen in the Kent Road—Sisson said "I did not expect this—I told Winch that morning, at 5 o'clock, to come and get this fat—this is a funny job"—I don't understand that Winch said "If I had but known what was going to happen not six of you would have brought me here"—I found a knife in Winch's right-hand with a quantity of fat on it, and both prisoners' hands smelt of tat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I 'did that to hear what Banks had to say; he had already told me something, but Mr. Dodd was not there then, and I wished him to hear what he had already told us—I had to take it down and the prisoners had to be present—the charge had not then been taken—I had brought them from London and paid their expenses—I look to the Treasury to repay me—on my oath this was not done to get evidence.</p>

About 8.30 on Friday, the 25th January, I saw the prisoner at 9, White Hind Alley, Bankside, which is about 50 or 60 yards from where this robbery took place, he was in bed—I said "I shall take you to the station for identification for being concerned with another man in stealing a purse and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from a man named Webb, at Bankside, on Tuesday last, between half-past 2 and 3 o'clock"—he said "I think I was out at work at the time"—when he came downstairs into the shop he said to the woman there "On Tuesday afternoon I think I was out at work between half-past 2 and 3"—she said "I know you were out at work or looking for it"—he was taken to the station, detained till 8 o'clock in the evening, and placed among seven others—Webb was called in and told to see if the man was there who had robbed him—he walked up to the prisoner and said "This is the man that put his arm round my neck"—the prisoner said "Are you sure?" he said "Yes, quite sure, I can swear to the other man that was with you at the time"—when the Magistrate asked the prisoner if he wished to cross-examine Pitts, he said "No, I was not on Bank side that day, I was drunk."</p>

                  </hi>. I am Chief Clerk at Lambeth Police-court—I was present there on the 31st October, 1882, when John Miller was sworn and gave evidence against John Ludwig and others; I took down Miller's examination and cross-examination, and produce the whole of his depositions. (<hi rend="italic">The examination and cross-examination of John Miller on his prosecution of Ludwig and others were then read. In the cross-examination he stated that he first became acquainted with the Permanent Society in October, 1881. The certificate was handed to him by Mr. D'Aeth, and he gave Mr. Graham </hi>50<hi rend="italic">l. for it and the books; the entries in the share book were made by his son William. He did not know of any business being done for fourteen years before. He was voted, into the chair by the shareholders, his son, brother, and nephew. He was known as Miller and Lawrence. He established the Templars at Brighton in the name of Webb; that society was merged into the British Imperial, of which he is chairman and treasurer, because the directors had misspent the money. In October, 1881, he transferred to the Permanent to make up the wasted money by raising shares. One had better powers in a company than in a friendly society. He was a director of the Eagle, that company was wound up. He had a thousand shares in the Permanent allotted to him for services rendered. He transferred</hi> 400<hi rend="italic">l. worth of shares to his son, William, they were in addition to his 1,000. George Miller, his son, sixteen years old, had</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l. worth of shares, and J. Miller, another son</hi>, 500<hi rend="italic">l. for services rendered. Neal was his nephew—he had</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l. allotted for services. Charles Miller was his brother. They had no banking account; a portion of the money was held by him and kept in a cash box, one cash box was stolen. He paid a claim of</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">l. </hi>10<hi rend="italic">s. in June by his own cheque, which was dishonoured. Neal had the Society's money. His (Miller's) salary was two guineas a week paid by the secretary out of the Company. William Miller had two guineas, Neal two guineas, J. R. Miller two guineas, Charles Miller</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l. </hi>5<hi rend="italic">s., George Miller 1 guinea. The directors voted him five guineas a week, but he took less. Graham was a director, policies were issued with his name on after he left. Monteith had not attended any of the meetings. The total voted to his family weekly was</hi>

               <p>17<hi rend="italic">l. </hi>6<hi rend="italic">s., he did not approve that. Ludwig, Ray, and Waldron sent in their resignations in August; they and others wanted to investigate the books, he said he could not let them that night. He did not tell Waldron there were no funds and that he should bolt if there was any inquiry. He would not wish to stop the Permanent. Neal paid the wages on his behalf and on behalf of the Company. William and George Miller had nothing for six weeks. There were</hi> 6,000 or 7,000 <hi rend="italic">subscribers to the Society, some paid</hi> 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week. The weekly balance from the agents used to average about</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">it had not been now for three months, it was about</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">now; the Society received the money front, the agents, he paid sick claims, &amp;c., and any balance he would pay into his (Miller's) bank or retain. He had an account at the Agra. Quelch was in the employ of the Permanent from its commencement, he was engaged for the British Imperial, he received</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">from him for the Eagle, and gave him</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">shares in the Eagle.</hi>) The documents referred to were given back to Mr. Bordman, the solicitor who conducted the prosecution, from which, after the cross-examination, he withdrew on that same day, 7th November, 1882—the persons charged were Ludwig, Graham, Quelch, Waldron, and Gale.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a public accountant of 53, Sutherland Street, Pimlico—I first became acquainted with John Miller on the 16th November, 1882, he left a message for me—I called on Mr. Bordman, a solicitor whom I had known for twenty years, and from what he said I went to Mr. Miller's office, 12, Westminster Bridge Road—the name of the Permanent was the only name up there—I saw John Miller and Neal, they showed me a lot of books and a balance sheet partially pre<lb/>pared, I simply amended it according to the books—I went through the books of the Permanent Life Office, some of those books had the heading British Imperial, which had been altered to Permanent—I altered the balance sheet according to the figures, and added it up—the signa<lb/>tures to the balance sheet are those of the defendants—I was not present when William Miller signed it—it purported to be a balance-sheet for 29th June, 1882—the books I had examined all started from November, 1881, I took it to be about seven months—I merely acted as auditor to check that balance-sheet—according to the books it was right—the 199<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 362<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are supposed to be balances of their particular funds—in the second schedule the 638<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which they make is supposed to be set off amongst the items mentioned in the assets column; it is all gone—the result of the balance-sheet is that at the end of June, 1882, the agents owed 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and outstanding premiums were due of the amount of 513<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., cash in hand was 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., office furniture worth 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., printing things 179<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that just leaves the 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in hand, out of which 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is due to claims not yet paid—the company going on at that time was a question of living from hand to mouth as the weekly subscriptions came in—there was not a farthing of money except the 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had nothing to do with the number of policies out—I was put down as auditor of the company—this was the only audit I had to do, and the only time I ever saw Miller—I did not know I was advertised as the auditor, I simply made this document as the result of my audit—I never saw a banker's book or any banking account.</p>

There was a paper called the Commercial World which had done everything it possibly could to destroy the business of the society. As to obtaining money under false pretences, all he could say was that he had not in any way acted differently to other societies, and he had not the remotest idea that in what he did he was offending in any way. He was now a beggar through the acts of others who were living in clover from what they had taken from this society.</hi>

His father promised to put him in a good position, and he had no idea he would have placed him in his present position. He placed every confidence in his father, who would not knowingly lead him astray. Although his name appeared in the books as a director it never appeared in any of the prospectuses, and he did not think and evidence had been brought forward to show that he had wilfully conspired to defraud any one.</hi>

               <p>the London and South-Western Bank—we have on our books a customer named Annie Brownell, who opened an account about July 25—she and the prisoner came together—the account was signed in her name, but he said "I will be the one that you will see the most of"—she said nothing—he said she was his sister-in-law—this is a certified copy of the account—it was opened by the payment by the prisoner on July 25 of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a cheque on the London and Westminster Bank, Temple Bar—the account was drawn up in Annie Brownell's name—I find the name of Pook very frequently on the debit aide of the account as the payee of the cheques—I saw the prisoner in October, he asked if we would discount bills and place the same to his account—I said we would do so provided they were accepted by good people—I do not know that he mentioned any one as the probable acceptor—I received this letter dated November 8—I cannot remember if I saw the prisoner afterwards about it—I had not seen him write at all—I replied to the letter, and saw the prisoner about a week afterwards—he came to know if the bill had been placed to his account—I had received this bill for 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., accepted by Thomas Walker, by letter—I received this letter before I received the bill, and then I received the bill by letter; and then the prisoner called and asked if it had been placed to his account—I said it had been discounted in the usual way—I had received no other bill (<hi rend="italic">The letter of November 8, 1883, was signed William Pook, dated Martina Cottages, Camberley, Hants, and requested that the enclosed might be placed to Miss Brownell's credit, that a cheque book might be sent to him for her, and that the witness would let him know if he would place an acceptance for </hi>55<hi rend="italic">l. to her credit accepted by Thomas Walker, Heath Cottages, Camberley, payable at the Capital and Counties Bank, Alder shot Branch, where he had had an account for years</hi>). This is a copy of my reply: "Nov. 12,1888. Dear sir,—We can place T. Walker's acceptance to Miss Brownell's credit, providing a lien of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. be kept on the account; form enclosed for her signature. Tours, H. Brewer." (<hi rend="italic">The letter of November 14, 1883, said that the acceptance would be sent on, and requested that satisfactory answers would be given to any in<lb/>quiries about an acceptance Miss Brownell had given to a man, and about one he had given for a few pounds, as the money would be paid in to meet it; and was signed William Pool.</hi>) I received the pencil memorandum enclosing the bill on November 24, "Dear Sir,—Please place enclosed to credit, and oblige, Yours, William Pook"—the bill is "Camberley, November 24, 1883. Three months after date pay to our or my order 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for value received."Signed Annie Brownell, to Mr. Thomas Walker, Capital and Counties Bank—I placed that to the credit of the account—it was drawn upon afterwards—before I did so I made inquiries of the Capital and Counties Bank at Aldershot, respecting Mr. Thomas Walker—on Nov. 26 the balance of the account was about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received this letter on December 15, it is in the same handwriting as that of November 8 to the best of my judgment. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated December 15, 1883, 24, Queen Street, Maidenhead, and requested Mr. Brewer to inquire and let Mr. Pook know whether he could discount an acceptance for </hi>80<hi rend="italic">l. or </hi>85<hi rend="italic">l. of Walker and Co.'s, of Camberley; and also the same with regard to an acceptance for </hi>50<hi rend="italic">l. by Mr. C.

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 24, Queen street Maidenhead, and signed William Pook for Annie Brownell. He sent Walker and Company's acceptance at three month for </hi>80<hi rend="italic">l., and would write about the other in a few days.</hi>)—on January 16th the prisoner called, and I returned him the bill for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as it should have been endorsed underneath Mr. Thomas Walker's name by Annie Brownell that is where my name appears twice over—that bill is "January 4th, 1884. Three months after date pay to my order 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," addressed to Miss Annie Brownell, and accepted payable at the Capital and Counties Bank, Aldershot, and the endorsement is Annie Brownell, Thomas Walker, and Annie Brownell again—he returned it to me in a letter dated 16th January with the endorsement of Annie Brownell on it—I went with the bill to the Counties and Capital Bank, Aldershot—I received there a report from the manager with reference to the bill, in consequence of which I sent the bill to our head office, and from there a police-court summons was issued against the prisoner—the matter was placed in the hands of the police—I received the report from the manager of the Capital and Counties Bank on the 18th of January—I did not see the prisoner after that till I saw him at the police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When he came in July he said the account was to be opened in her name, but that in all probability I should see him most, as it was going to be worked by him—he said Miss Brownell was his sister-in-law—I believe he said the account was to be opened for a small drawing account, and afterwards for taking a public-house at Norwood—that was not at the first interview—on a subsequent occasion a lease was actually produced and shown to me, and I understood from what he said that they were anxious to purchase it without delay, that the licence might be transferred at the present licensing sessions—I was not told her father had died and her relations had made up a sum of money to put her into business—the cheque on the Westminster Bank was drawn in favour of two ladies named Brownell, and a third name; I knew nothing about the third being one of the trustees—I was told about the matter before the bills of exchange negotiations, and understood that was why the money was wanted—the bill for 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has not been presented at the Capital and Counties Bank to my knowledge—I have had no notice to present it—Hubbard, Son, and Eve act as solicitors to the bank, not to our branch—they are not here—they would act on instructions from the head office, they are not represented there—I have seen Hubbard, Son, and Eve's signature once, I should say this was theirs to this letter: "24, Bucklersbury, London. Dear Madam,—Your letter to the London and South-Western Bank has been handed to us. We are instructed to say that, having regard to the criminal proceedings that are pending, the bill cannot be presented as you wish"—we hold 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the lien against the bill for 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 26th November the prisoner called on me about the letter—I believe my deposition was read over to and signed by me. (<hi rend="italic">This stated:</hi> "In consequence of my letter the prisoner called on me on the 26th November and produced the bill now shown and marked "A")—he called again on the 16th January, the bill had come back before by registered letter—when I said in my deposition "He called again and produced the bill for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," I must have been wrong—I re<lb/>ceived</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188402250179"/>
               <p>a telegram on the 19th January from Miss Brownell, "A great mistake, do not discount bill, return by post at once, reply that you have done so paid."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> That was received after I had received a communica<lb/>tion from Aldershot—the lease was only produced for us to make an advance on if we would, that was in October—I think we did not make an advance—to the best of my judgment I should say all the letters signed W. Pook, and the body of the bill are in the same hand-writing and also the signature to the acceptance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I would have done it to assist Annie Brownell—the subscription for the two sisters was made a year and half ago—they were both single then, the public-house affair turned up after the marriage—I would rather have given them money than a bill—the endorsement Thomas Walker on the back of the other bill for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is very much like my writing, I did not endorse it—the manager of the Capital and Counties' Bank only showed me part of a piece of paper—it was like this.</p>

About 12.40 a.m. on 30th January I was in the neighbourhood of Townsend Street, and heard cries of police several times—I then saw Norman and Fleming struggling in Townsend Street about 30 yards up—I ran up; Fleming ran away; I ran after him and caught him—Norman ran up and said "I charge this man with assaulting and robbing me"—the other two prisoners were not present then—Fleming pretended to be drunk—Norman was covered in mud and bleeding from the mouth—on the morning of the 30th, about 9.15, I met both the Brockingtons at their house, 4, Townsend Street—I went to take back a hat covered with dirt, which I had taken from the same house between 2 and 3 o'clock that morning, thinking it was the prose<lb/>cutor's, who said he had lost his hat, and gave me a description of these men—I handed the hat to George, and said "Is this your hat?"—he said "Yes; what the b——h——had you right to take my hat away?"—that hat James was wearing when I apprehended him—it was Nor<lb/>man's—I arrested James on 5th February, about 11.30 a.m., in the New Kent Road; he was standing by himself, and turned round and observed me coming and ran away—I gave chase, and apprehended him, and with assistance took him to the station—I told him he would be charged with highway robbery with violence—he said "You have made a mistake"—</p>

I was aroused by cries of murder and police—the cries seemed as from a person being held or knelt on and not able to call well, and the cries became so faint they could not be heard well—I jumped out of bed, threw open the window, and saw three men on the opposite side scuffling together and George running towards his own door No. 4; and he stopped, and as he stopped he kicked something into the passage opposite his own door, I could not see him carrying anything—James was holding the prosecutor by the throat pressing him back against the wall—there are houses only on one side, on the other is a blank asylum wall which he was against—Fleming struck him—I called police and murder several times, and when James heard me calling he crossed on to my side and crept up along the wall and slipped into his own house, No. 4—Norman ran after him in the middle of the road calling "Police"—Fleming ran after him to prevent him going into the house and struck him again—the police came and chased Fleming, and Norman ran also—I have no doubt about the identity of the prisoners; I have seen the Brockingtons before, but not Fleming, I have no doubt about him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Elm Cottages, Prince's Road, Richmond, and am storekeeper to Messrs. Allsopp and Sons at their stores in the Kew Road, Richmond—on Saturday evening, 16th February, after the stores were locked up, I concealed myself in them—about a quarter to 7 Brooks came in with three stone jars—I asked him how he came in and he said by a key—I asked him who gave him the key, he said "My friend Scott"—he showed me the key—there is a yard and stable gate outside the stores—he would have to come through a gate to get into the yard—I asked him how he got through the gate, he said with Scott's key, and broke into the building—he had two keys, both Scott's—I was then going out of the stable gate, and met Scott coming in—I asked Scott in Brooks's presence what he knew of this affair, he said nothing—I asked him what he knew about the keys—he said he knew nothing about the store's keys, but the gate key he had given to Brooks—I asked him what he knew about the bottles—he said "What bottles?"—he was not acquainted with anything of the bottles at all—I detained them in the stores—I next went to James Lownds' house, the collector, leaving the prisoners outside—he came back with me—Brooks would have no business in the stores at that hour—there was no light there merely a tire half burnt out—Brooks brought some matches with him and struck a light—there were casks of ale and stout there, several tapped, with the keys left in the taps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I came to Richmond on the 21st of November, and have been there about three months—I never take railway porters or any one in at night, only when they have to make up the fire—I have said I was found on this night with a railway porter friend there, we had been there about a quarter of an hour when Brooks entered, another man was with us—I could bring them in—Brooks sometimes lighted the fire and was occasionally employed about the place; he was Mrs. Maxwell's gardener—I do not know how long he had been there—Lownds is here—he is above me—we don't pay Brooks, we give him a drink of beer; never to take away with him—he used to work a good deal bringing in things—I never gave him beer to take away—I can say he never had it given him—I was rather scared when he struck a light and discovered us there—Scott has stuck to his first story about the bottles all through—he said he had given Brooks one key, and that was for business purposes—I have said nothing before to-day about two keys—I can't say if my friend told Brooks that if he told the truth it would be better for him—I can't say how long Scott has been in Messrs. Allsopp's service; it is a very long time, and he has borne a very good character all through—he was kept continuously in their employment after this was discovered till Monday evening—he gave information to the prosecutor on three occasions as far as he could—Brooks might have to go and light a fire for me, not for Scott—I have gone into the stores with Brooks after closing hours—it would be regular for me, not for Scott—I have not been in their employ at Richmoud so long as he has—I don't owe Scott anything—I do not lodge with him; I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I concealed myself about 6.45, expecting Brooks and some one with him, and the porters were with me concealed for my pro<lb/>tection—Brooks could not come in the evening to light a fire unless he hid been asked because he could not get in—he had no business in the stores—if he was paid in beer he had no right to help himself—it was given to him in a mug; he was not allowed to carry any away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Sherland Villas, Twickenham, and am a collector to Messrs. Allsopp—on this occasion I had instructed Hyland to watch the stores—on the following day, the 17th, I went to the stores and saw three jars—Hyland handed me a key and reported to me—Brooks would not have the slightest business at the stores at that time, not for lighting fires or any other purpose; he received no payment—when he came he could have a glass or tankard of beer if he liked—I questioned Brooks on the following Monday, he told me they took the three jars down with the intention of filling them; that he got in by Scott's key into the yard, into Messrs. Allsopp's premises, and the other key he found in the man's room, which is connected with the stable—there are two keys—they were both produced to me—I asked him whether they intended to fill the jars—it would have been possible for him to do so—it appears he struck a lucifer and found the men concealed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Scott has been in Messrs. Allsopp's employment for years, and has always borne a good character—I only know by hearsay that Brooks is Mrs. Maxwell's gardener—on the Saturday I gave instruc<lb/>tions to watch—I was out of Court when Hyland gave evidence—I told him he might take a witness to watch too if he liked, I didn't mention anybody—I am not on good terms with Hyland—I know nothing of his bringing railway porters there—Scott adhered to his statement that he had given the key to Brooks for business purposes—I saw Brooks on the Saturday night, I did not speak to him—on the Monday I asked him if. I wanted him where could I send to for him—he came back in an hour afterwards and asked if I wanted him any more—I said "No," as I had made arrangements and could send for him—that was after the break<lb/>ing and entering—I saw him twice about the place on Monday—I can't say he did odd jobs about Messrs. Allsopp's premises, he was continually there; he would have beer as a gratuity if he came there—I can't say what he did, or how long he has been off and on there.</p>
