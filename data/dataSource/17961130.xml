               <p>Q. Was it light then? - A. Yes, It was a little light; I found a great hole in the window-shutter, in the front of the shop window, and a great quantity of plated spurs, and a dog-whip gone, they were hanging up in the window; the hole was right opposite to where they hung; the piece taken out was large enough for any man to put his hand in; on Monday the 24th of October, as I was coming down Newington-causeway, I saw some spurs on the outside of a shop-window, exposed to sale, at one Mr. Kingsford's, there were three pair, and three odd ones.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity you missed? - A. I cannot tell, I suppose about four or five and twenty pair; they were iron spurs, plated with silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the last person up the night before your house was broke open? - A. My wife, she is not here; I saw the shutters up at ten o'clock the night before, it was all safe then.</p>
               <p>Q. From the situation of the house, have you reason to believe, they did any more than take the spurs out of that hole? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they hang close to the window? - A. Quite close to the glass; the thickness of the window and shutter was about four inches; the constable has got the three pair of spurs, and the three odd ones; Mr. Kingsford led me to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You found these at Mr. Kingsford's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He keeps that sort of reputable place, called an old iron shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you ask him if he had any more, and he denied having any more, and you afterwards found more? - A. I asked him the price of the pair, he asked me 3s. 6d.; I saw another pair, and asked him the price of them; I asked if he had any more, he said, no, only some odd ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any more? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see Smith the prosecutor? - A. Not before he came to me; I cannot recollect the day he came; as near as I can recollect, it was an hour after dinner; he came to the door, and saw some spurs I had had near a fortnight; he took down a pair of spurs, and asked me what the price of them were, I told him the price of them; he asked me if I had any more; there were two pair more hanging at the door; he took them in his hand, and asked me if I had any more, I said, only for a odd ones; he took them in his hand, and said they were his property, he could shew me the fellows of the odd ones; he said they were taken from his shop, and asked me if I knew who I had them of; I said, I did, and he desired me to keep them till the morrow, and he would bring the odd ones; on the morrow, about dinner time, he brought the odd ones, and asked me to go with him, and show him the person I had them of; I went with him to Duckham's, he was not at home, we waited till he came home; I asked him how he did, he said, I don't know, somebody here has got me in custody; I desired him to come down to my house, he did, with the officer; I pulled the spurs out of my pocket, and said, these spurs you left with me a fortnight ago, I can get nobody to buy them, they are spoiling with me, I will give them back to you, he took them up; his wife came and said, my dear, you know nothing about these spurs; he put them down again, and said, no, I know nothing about them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. These are the spurs you received from him? - A. Yes; the same as the constable had, I had of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner on any other occasion, but this? - A. Not on any occasion like this; he worked for me some time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give him for them? - A. I did not purchase them at all; I took them to sell for him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I know perfectly well you know this man, he is a brass and iron sender-maker, is not he? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Don't you know that is called an old iron-shop? - A. It may be called an old iron-shop, but not in the common way.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that it is called an old iron-shop, in your own neighbourhood? - A. I cannot say that it is called an old iron-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that it is called an old iron-shop; there is some good reason, I suppose, for holding back an answer, don't you know old iron-shops get a bad character for receiving goods? - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body present when you had these spurs from Duckham? - A. Yes, my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here? - A. No.</p>

I suppose, about a quarter of a mile; they before crossed me, looked me in the face, and I thought they were thieves, and then determined not to cross the fields; they crossed the fields, but took a circuit towards Sadler's-Wells, and I saw no more of them till I came within 150 yards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300007"/>of my own door; when I came near the reservoir wall, three persons rushed from the side of the wall, I had then a stick in my hand, so they could not come in front of me, they sidled round, and laid hold of each arm, and clapped a pistol to each of my temples, one stood in front, a tall man, and said, no resistance; I made answer, you have taken away all power of resistance; they having my hand so, one asked me for my watch, I took it out, and gave it the man that stood in front; then another man on my left hand said, where is your money, I gave him the money, and counted it, and said, there are four guineas; about this time, my brother, who was with me, was much agitated, they said to him, don't be alarmed, we won't hurt you, these were the words; the tall man then gave the watch to the man on the right hand of me, and he put the watch, I think, into his pocket; I said, you won't do me any harm of course, they said, no, they would not; I had before heard somebody coming across the field, I said to the men, I am going to Pentonville, they said, I must not go there, for they were going there; I then asked them if I might cross the fields to Sadler's-Wells, they told me I must not go that way at this time, the tall man

             a handkerchief thus over here, just across his nose, and slouched his hat, I asked them(then I was rather hurt, they would not let me go any way), which way then am I to go, they said, you must turn back towards London; I then, in consequence of what they said, did turn back, two of them holding their pistols at me; I said, I certainly should turn back, as I should not like to have the contents of those in my head.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did this transaction take up? - A. Above a minute.</p>

               <p>Q. How were the persons dressed? - A. All in dark great-coats.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Had you an opportunity of observing their faces? - A. I had a full view of them, especially of the man that stood in the front, I thought they had not been robbers, but drunken men; I should know the tall man and the little man that stood on my right-hand side; I had gone but a few paces before I met two gentlemen, Mr. Riley and Mr. Richardson, they asked if I had been robbed, I said I had, and we all joined in the pursuit; at that time two men were running before; I came opportunity own door, about 150 yards from where I was robbed, and found the prisoner in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. In whole custody? - A. In the custody of Day; there were a number of persons round him before that, he said he was not one of the men that committed the robbery, he had none of the property about him; when I came up, I said, you are one of the men that robbed me; he said, he was not, he had none of the property about him, he said, search me; he was taken to the watch-house, and desired to pull his great-coat off, he then drew the handkerchief in the same manner as after he robbed me, upon which I exclaimed, you are the man that stood in the front of me and took the watch, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time was it, between your coming up to him, and the robbery? - A. About two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon seeing this prisoner again and again, have you any doubt he is one of the men that robbed you? - A. The more I look at the man, the more I am convinced he is the man that robbed me; I have no doubt he is the man, because I had a full view of him, and from all the circumstances that happened, I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you take any particular notice of him at the time? - A. Of him particularly, because he asked for my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man in front hold a pistol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You conclude, by saying you have no doubt of him? - A. I have no doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say before the Justice? - A. That considering every circumstance, I had no doubt he was the man that robbed med; Mr. Bond said, he admired my caution.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you did say at that time you were not certain the prisoner was one of the men? - A. I did not say so; I said, when I consider all the matter, I have no doubt he is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not from a recollection of his person then, but from the circumstances? - A. From his person.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first meet with them? - A. In Rosoman's-row.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, you met with them in the fields? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not the fields where they robbed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in the public highway? - A. There is a path through the field, it is a field belonging to the New-River-Company, there is no way for horses and carts, except the New-River-Company's with pipes.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 4, Jermyn street, and keep a shop in the Strand; on the evening this matter took place, I was about ten yards from Mr. Chetham when this happened, I heard a voice say, don't be alarmed, I won't hurt you.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300008"/>Q. Did any person make his appearance? - A. A little boy ran up to me, Mr. Chetham's brother, and begged I would come forward, for his brother was robbed; I said, take my parcel, my dear, I will assist your brother directly; Mr. Chetham met me, and said, sir, I am robbed; I said, there is no time to talk of it, but pursue directly; I followed the prisoner, and in ten minutes he sell, I mixed in the crowd, not wishing to have any thing more to do with it, not knowing Mr. Chetham; I carried the parcel I had, and then had the curiosity of going to the watch-house, and upon hearing the prisoner's voice, I said, that is the man that said, don't be alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of the opinion still that that is the man? - A. Yes; after the number of gentlemen had gone out of the place, and I came again to the watch-house, the prisoner said he hoped Mr. Chetham would have mercy upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you hear the prisoner say so? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at the time he made use of that expression if he did use it, the constable had hold of the handkerchief about his neck? - A. No; he was locked up at the time, and nobody with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say you first heard the voice, how far might you be from where the robbery was committed? - A. Ten or twelve feet.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were so near the place, you must have seen the robbery? - A. It was took dark for me to see the robbery, I could see there were a number of persons together, but what they were about I could not tell, but I was soon informed by the boy; when the child came up, I was upon the move, for I had said I believed there was a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. How long from that time was it before you heard his voice in the watch-house? - A. Four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not repeat the same words? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Though he did not repeat the same words, could you swear to his voice? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So you undertake to say, though he did not repeat the same words that he was the same person? - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You attended at the watch-house after the prisoner was apprehended; did you come to the watch-house twice, or only once? - A. I accidentally made use of these words, when I went into the watch-house, I said to the watch-house man, that was the voice.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard him afterwards apply for mercy? - A. He said, he hoped they would have mercy upon him, and not touch his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that as if he was conscious of guilt, or that they would not do him violence, supposing he was not the man? - A. I wish I could put the sense upon it, that they would not do him violence.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing them at any time on the night of Wednesday the 9th of November? - A. Yes; one of them, the short man in black, he answered to the name of Deputy; at that time, as Bickham and I were going our rounds, we saw Denn in Pipe-makers-alley, Cow-cross: it is a very dark alley, and no lamp; I heard somebody whisper in the alley, we went up, and found two men standing at the door where they lodged, I believe; I asked them what they were, and what they were standing there for; Dunn made reply, what was it to us; I told them I was a patrol, and must insist on knowing what business they had there at that late hour; he appeared not willing to satisfy us from some impertinent answers, I cannot say what they were; I looked down, and in his right-hand I saw the blade of a knife shine, and I catched hold of his arm, and said, what have you got in your hand, a knife; he said, no; and he snatched his arm away from me; by that time, the man of the house where he lodged came down and opened the door, he drew himself into the door backwards, and dropped the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he drop the knife in the alley, or within the door? - A. On the mat at the bottom of the stairs; I called the watchman up, he brought his lanthorn, and I looked for the knife.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300010"/>Q. What was the watchman's name? - A. Blower; I found the knife, and picked it up, and said to Dunn, is this your knife; and he said, yes; and I said to him, what intent could you have in having this knife drawn in your hand at this time of night; and he said he had it cutting his finger nails with.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a knife was it? - A. I believe, a buckshorn handle, about seven inches long; my partner, Beckham, and I took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Tomms was called by a wrong name? - A. Yes, in going up towards that person, his coat caught on the corner of the table, and Dunn put his hand on the coat, and pressed it to the table, and his coat tore then; in a few minutes after Tomms went down stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. What watchman went to take him into custody? - A. I don't know his name; upon that Dunn struck the watchman, and knocked him down; as he was falling, I took the stick from him, then I saw a person of the name of Williams, who is not yet apprehended, that struck at the watchman likewise, and about that time, I left the room as soon as I could, and got down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had got the stick from the watch-man, what did he do with it? - A. I saw him strike at the watchman, I cannot say whether it hit him; I live nearly opposite, down the alley; I went four or five yards down the alley, and came up the alley again, and saw the whole of them come out of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect how Dunn was drest that night? - A. In a blue coat, I think white buttons; then I saw them go to the Compasses public-house, about three doors lower down.</p>

               <p>Q. Before they got into the window, did any of them make use of any expression particularly? - A. I do not know.</p>

No, the opposite; I saw a number of them at the watch-house door, striking, as though they were striking over the hatch at somebody within; there was some night carts at the end of the alley, they prevented me seeing so much as I should.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw several striking over the hatchway? - A. Yes; but could not point any one out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see a watchman at the end of Peter-street? - A. After they were gone I did; I went up to the end of Peter-street, and saw a watchman, he was standing, and was held up by one man; he appeared to me to have had a blow on the head with a stick, which, apparently to me, had drove in the skull.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that watchman? - A. Larcher, I believe; I did not know his name till afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this as they joined the other party? - A. Yes; I heard them say, have you done it, Charley, have you done it to your liking, and they gave him three cheers.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who that watchman was? - A. Larcher; when I came up, he was just getting up from a blow, they knocked him down again several times; when they went away he had several wounds in his head, I was the first person that laid hold of him to take him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the persons you saw there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they of the same party? - A. I believe they were, they had passed me that way.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was he then? - A. Leaning upon the hatch of the watch-house door; I saw three men run up the street as hard as they could run from the Sun, and when they got up by Mr. Terry's door, the public-house, the corner of White-horse-alley -</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You said they did something after they had said they ripped him up? - A. They said they would give a good cheer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give a good cheer? - A. Yes; they pulled their hats off and gave a cheer; then they went away, and Brewer came to the step of the door, and was wiping his face with his handkerchief, the blood ran down from his head, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see any more persons than three? - A. I saw a great many after they were out.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they coming on the other side of the way? - A. They were coming up the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of those three men? - A. I thought they were two patrols bringing a charge to the watch-house.</p>

Some persons took me into my house, they said I should be killed in a few minutes; after I heard the street still, I said, I must go out to see what they had done, I returned from my own door and went to the watch-house; when I came there, I saw Mr. Brewer standing in blood.</p>
               <p>Q. He was bleeding? - A. Yes; the blood was trickling down; before I had time to speak to him, I saw a great many people come up the street, coming to the watch-house; I heard them say,"damn his eyes, we will have him out."</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know who they were? - A. No; with that, they rushed into the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the man you laid hold of? - A. No; with that I heard a blow in the watch-house, but saw nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. What coat had the man on you laid hold of? - A. I don't know; some of my friends came and took me into my own house again; after that, I heard a great bustle in the street, but did not go out till the street became quite still; then I opened the door, and met Mr. Brewer coming into my house, he came in all over blood, running down him, and said, they have almost killed me; he came in, and I sent for the doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Brewer after this? - A. I went to the hospital on Friday morning a little after seven, or about seven, I saw him fitting up in bed; I asked him how he did; he told me he was very bad; I asked him if he should know any of them-</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. At this time, did he at all say he was likely to die? - A. No; I said nothing to him about that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long did he live after this? - A. He died on Saturday evening about half after nine-My Lord, I beg to mention to your Lordship, that on the Friday, the first day of my examination, I was so alarmed, and frightened, when I was at Hatton-garden, I saw the prisoner Arnold at the bar, and would not own to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did not you own to? - A. At the first examination on Friday, I did not own to the prisoner Arnold.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you own to him? - A. I am a poor widow woman, and obliged to go out early in a morning to get my bread, and am up late at night in the shop by myself; I was afraid of my own life, for fear any of the party should come and injure me.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the reason you did not own to Arnold? - A. That is the whole truth why I did not own to Arnold on the first examination.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You thought you would be asked that question? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At the second examination, the story you told was a very different story to what you told at the first? - A. Arnold said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sworn the first time, when you said Arnold was not the man? - A. I believe I was, I don't know; I was so alarmed when the Justice asked me if Arnold was the man, I told him not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us you knew Arnold's person very well, by his passing backwards and forwards? - A. Certainly I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined twice the same day? - A. Only once; the next day after the affair happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined the day after this took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you said you did not know that Arnold was the man? - A. Not to my knowledge, I was so much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you examined next? - A. The Friday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it known there was to be a reward the next day after the affair happened? - A. No; I told all the secret before I knew there was any reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you were examined the second time, was it not known that there was a reward published? - A. On the Jury, in the hospital, I told all the story.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you were examined the second time there was a reward published; had you heard that there was any reward? - A. I had heard that there was a reward by the bills that were stuck up in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was it? - A. I don't know, I never paid any attention to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it in the bills up in the street? - A. No, only what people said; I am no scholar to read it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You knew at the time it was him, but you were so frightened you declared it was not him? - </p>
               <p>Court. Q. I understand you to say, that you knew it was him, but was so alarmed for fear of the people he was connected with, that you were afraid to say it was him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say this man was dressed in a light coloured coat? - A. I took no notice of his dress, I did not say that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You have told us the truth now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The next day, you have told us the reason why you did not own to him; before the Coroner's Jury did you say the same you have said now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them the same reason for not owning him before the Justice you have given now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true that you did know him then, and that what you have now said is the truth? - A. Yes.</p>

            Presented what to his body? - A. The knife; I then said, take the knife out of that man's hand, he has cut the man; the expression was then made use of, you bugger, I will cut you.</p>

I cannot pretend to say, I believe it was from Dunn's mouth; with that they went by me, and kept down Peter-street, by Bull-head-court; Ingelfield, our watchman, sprung the rattle; on springing the rattle, they returned with sticks; I observed, with Ryan, Deputy, Williams, and Osling, they particularly had sticks, they returned to this person who sprang the rattle, and I heard them say, give it him, give it him; I heard Orme's voice particularly; they beat the watchman, there was a boy under the shelter of a window, stooping down, he said, for God's sake, don't kill him, they beat him some time; they returned from beating him, and came down Peter-street, I followed them to Saffron-hill, there is a turn-stile, where they turned up; turning up, there was a gentleman in black, Dunn made an attempt at him with his knife, his hand went so to him, (describing him as putting his hand out towards his body,) he drew back; I did not know he had any hurt, I said, Williams, why don't you take the knife out of that man's hand, he has cut that man.</p>
               <p>Q. You meant the gentleman? - A. Yes; I said, what is the use of cutting people that don't meddle with you, Williams called out, who is that mentions my name; I said, why don't you take the knife out of that man's hand, with that Williams turned round to strike me, they proceeded then to Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Arnold? - A. Before me, on my side, they were in the road way; I heard Ryan say, this is the roller stick.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300021"/>Q. Tell us the observation you made on the deceased? - A. He had received three wounds, one on the fore part of the top of his head, the second, from the left temple down to the chin, a third wound on his right side, a little below the right shoulder blade.</p>
               <p>Q. From the observations you made on those wounds, with what sort of instrument was it that they were made? - A. With some very sharp cutting instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you applied every thing necessary for the purpose? - A. The wounds were dressed; I found him with some inflammation about the wounds, and some fever; in the course of the afternoon the inflammation and fever increased; on the following morning, Saturday, the inflammation was so much increased, his head so much swoln, and all the symptoms so much aggravated, that I thought it necessary to consult with the other surgeons on the case: we held a consultation, but the symptoms continued to increase throughout the day, and in the evening he expired.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you consult the other surgeons? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt the wounds so inflicted, as you describe, were the cause of his death? - A. Not any.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was it the unfortunate man died? - A. About nine in the evening; the body was opened on Sunday morning; the wounds were attended with a great inflammation; that inflammation was attended with a fever, that destroyed the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether, from the situation this man was in, from his wounds and the fever, he had not a knowledge of his approaching dissolution, when you were with him? - A. I had no conversation with him; I conceive he was sensible of his approaching dissolution.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he perfectly sensible? - A. At the time I first saw him, he was perfectly sensible.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Whether you thought it impossible for him to recover? - A. It was too early to form an opinion when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have been asked by the Gentlemen of the Jury, whether you thought he could recover; as the fever increased and the symptoms increased, could you form a judgment of it? - A. We despaired of his life on the Saturday morning.</p>

I believe a few minutes before ten in the morning; I saw him in the broad part between the penns and the Hospital in Smithfield, with a drover's stick and a dog; knowing the man, I said, Arnold, you played pretty tricks last night in Cow-cross; says he, I was not there; I said, I heard you were there, and he was all of a tremble at the time; well, says he, but I went away at ten o'clock; says I, I am glad to hear you did, and I left him; I went to Mr. Brewer, and the other people in the Hospital, and enquired of Mr. Brewer if he could tell who did it.</p>
               <p>Q. You enquired after his health, what did he say to you? - A. He said he was a dead man, and he wished for God's sake I and every one else would apprehend the people, to do justice to himself and the country; I asked him if he knew who it was; he said, there was a man that was brought into the watch-house the over-night, that drew a knife to some of the officers, and was brought into the watch-house, and he said he was let loose the overnight; he said he was one, he believed; he believed him to be one that cut him, and that bad fellow, that drover, that cutting man, he believed him to be one too that cut him; he did not positively say they did do it, but he believed it; I said, is it

            ? yes, he said, that was his name, and begged of me to apprehend him, which I did; accordingly I went and got some assistance, and took him out of Smithfield about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Arnold? - A. He used to drove on Mondays and Fridays; when we apprehended him, I desired him to put his dog away, or I would cut him down, which he did, and his stick; when we apprehended him he had blood on one side of his face; how that came, I cannot tell; I had not power to search him, the number of drovers about him was so great, it was dangerous.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Brewer afterwards? - A. I saw him several times after; I told him I had got him, and he seemed very well pleased that I had got him; I took some others, but none of the three prisoners but Arnold; he said they rushed into the watch-house upon him, several of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. He never went further than saying he believed? - A. Never in my hearing.</p>

               <p>Jury. (To Mrs. Han.) Q. What occasioned you to go to the prison? - A My landlady, where I lived, was taken up for robbing the India warehouse, I went to see her in prison; the prisoner beckoned to me, and said, I hope you will not say I am the man. That is the man I am sure.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had no money of him, but the half crown he gave me.</p>

(The handkerchief produced).</p>

             sworn. - I went with Treadway after this woman, and found her at the house where he said he was robbed; we searched her and found a guinea, half a crown, two shillings and sixpence, and some halfpence, we took a handkerchief out of her pocket; we met him as we were coming from the house with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am certain the prosecutor gave me a half crown piece, he said he had no more money, I must treat him out of the half crown; I said, it was too hard to treat out of it; however, I consented, and we went to bed together; when I got up in the morning, I went to light my fire, the silk handkerchief was left on the pillow; I had no more money than the half crown.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober? - A. Sober as I am now; the silk handkerchief and my breeches with the watch in the fob were on a chair by the bed side; in the morning, between five and six, I found I was robbed of my watch and handkerchief; I lay in a back room to which I went through the front room; when I got up in the morning, I found the door of my room locked on the outside with a padlock, I made a noise at the door, and the servant came and opened it, she told me nobody had been in the room but the prisoner; she went up stairs, and the prisoner came down and abused me in a very gross manner, she took a case knife in her hand, and threatened to take my life, if I offered to accuse her of any thing of the kind; I told her I did not accuse any body, but my watch I had lost since I came into the house; I went for a constable, and had her taken up, the constable found nine shillings and three-pence upon her, and the silk handkerchief at a pawnbroker's, he shewed it me the next day, the 17th, the watch has never been found.</p>

               <p>GEORGE DOBREE sworn. - I am a pawn-broker, at No. 135, High-Holborn; the prisoner pawned this handkerchief with me the 17th of October, between ten and eleven in the morning, I lent her a shilling upon it, I have had it ever since; I know the prisoner, I am sure she is the person that brought it. (The handkerchief was produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was standing at the corner of Dyot-street, the prosecutor asked me to go and have a pint of beer in the public-house, I went, and we had two pots of beer, and he asked me to take him to my lodgings, I took him home, and he gave me a shilling for his bed; he said, he would give me two shilling to sleep with me, he gave me but one, and gave me the handkerchief for the other; I went to bed with him, but he behaved so rude and indecent, I could not stay in the bed with him; I went up stairs and slept by myself, and in the morning I pawned the handkerchief for the other shilling, as he had given me but one; when I was taken, they knocked me down, and used me very ill, I was eight months gone with-child, and their usage occasioned the death of the child; I had 12s. in money they took from me.</p>

             came to my tap, and proposed to bring me ten guineas in half-guineas, in return for 5l. I told him I could not think of giving him any money, until such time as I saw what sort they were; I told him to bring me one or two, and let me see them, and I should be better able to advance money to him to make me some; he told me the next time he came to see me, he would bring me one or more to shew me; the next time he came, he brought two half-guineas.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long was that after the conversation you had had with him? - A. I cannot justly say; when I saw them, I liked them very well, and he told me he would bring me ten guineas worth on the next Monday; after he was gone, I went immediately to Bow-street, to have advice in what manner I was to proceed; I went afterwards to the Solicitor of the Mint, and received directions what to do; the prisoner Turner came again on Saturday, the 22d of last month, about four o'clock; the prisoner Bull was with him; they sat down and had a pint of porter; then Turner said, Mr. Dowling, I want to speak to you; he and I went immediately out of doors into a long passage that leads to our house, between the tap and the street; he pulled two counterfeit half-guineas out if his pocket, and said, I have brought you some of them, and I asked him to let me see them; he took them both out of his pocket; I said I liked them very well; I asked him how much they would be; he told me 9s.; I consented to pay him for them, and told him to come in doors; he came in and sat down, and had something more to drink with Bull, and he asked me for the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Bull present when he asked you for the money? - A. No; he came separately from Bull; when he asked me for the money, I did not know that Bull knew any thing of the business; when Turner gave them me in the passage, Bull was sitting in the house; I told him I would pay him presently, and he seemed very uneasy to get the money immediately; I told him if he would come on Sunday morning, I would pay him; this was Saturday evening; he declined coming, but wanted the money immediately, and said he would call for a shilling's worth of something to drink, if I would let him have the two half-guineas back again; I refused to do so, and went about my business out of the tap-room, and sent to the office for a couple of officers; they not coming immediately as I wished, I went to the back door, and Mr. Harding, belonging to Bow-street, happened to be there; I told him of the business, and desired him to come in; in about two minutes I went in, and told Turner that I would have but one, and returned him the other, and at the same time paid him down 4s. 6d. for the one I kept in my possession; Mr. Harding came in just at that juncture of time that I paid him the money; I put it down on the table, he took it up, and had it at that time in his right hand, he had the other half-guinea in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300026"/>his left hand; the officer immediately took hold of him by the right hand, and asked him what he had got in his hand; he said, nothing; the officer opened his hand and took the 4s. 6d. out; he searched his pockets, and while he was searching his pockets, Turner turned round and threw the half-guinea that he had in his hand behind him; we heard it ring; I thought it was in the fire; I took a candle and found it on the hob; the officer picked it up, and took him immediately to Bow-street; I have the half-guinea I bought, the officer has the other; there was nothing found upon him, I believe, but a few sixpences and some copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When Turner came to you on the 22d, you desired him to let you look at these two half-guineas? - A. He told me he had got them, and we went out into the passage together, and he shewed them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask him to let you see them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave them into your hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you kept them? - A. I asked him how much they would be, and he told me 9s.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing further passed at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to satisfy yourself about them, and he told you they would be 9s.? - A. I told him to step into the tap-room, and I would pay him in the tap.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to satisfy yourself about the money? - A. I was satisfied, and was to give him his price for them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not give him his price, and he wanted them back and to go away? - A. Yes; he said he would call for a shilling's worth, if I would let him have them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not do it, and he sat there drinking? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards returned one to him? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any agrement between you to part with one of them only, the agreement was to part with both or none? - A. No; I was to purchase what I pleased of them.</p>
               <p>Q. The only conversation was relative to buying the two - did you at all converse with him upon the subject of buying one only? - A. No; only when I returned in, I said, I would have but one; he said, why then pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you did not, without any converse at all, return one, and throw down the 4s. 6d. for the other? - A. No; I had a good deal of conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you did not return him one, and throw down the 4s. 6d. without any conversation about buying the one? - A. No; I came in and said, Mr. Turner, I will have only one of them, I will give you 4s. 6d. for one; he said immediately, let me have the money, and I paid him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body present at the time that conversation took place? - A. Nobody but he and I.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a wife or any body that was in the room? - A. Yes; I have a wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any pot-boy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you to say there was nobody present but you and he? - A. I believe he was in the room; I did not observe him; I am not sure; Turner was sitting in one box and I in another; he was in a box separate from any other company; Bull was in another box.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you wife at the time? - A. She was backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not she in the tap-room at the time? - A. I cannot say whether she was in the tap-room, or in the cellar, or upstairs; she was about her business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. Was this conversation carried on so loud, that other people might hear? - A. No.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HARDING sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am a patrole: On the 22d of last month, about four o'clock, I was sent for take Turner into custody, which I according did; I searched him, and found in his right hand 4s. 6d.; then I searched his breeches pocket, and found two sixpences, a bit of wire, and a bit of copper; in the mean time he threw something from his left hand, backwards; I heard the ring of it against the grate; I immediately got a candle to look for it, and on the left hand side of the fire-place I picked up half-a-guinea; I asked him immediately, what did you throw this half-guinea away for; he made answer immediately, I have no business with it, that man gave it to me, pointing to Bull; from that I immediately took Bull into custody, and searched him; I found one sixpence upon him, and a dozen of gold rings, and some copper trinkets gilt; from that I took them to the office, and had them examined.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Bull say? - A. He did not say any thing to me. (Produces the property he took from Turner, and the half-guinea he threw in the fire-place.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Whether Turner and you were not at a distant part of the room when he said he had it from Bull? - A. I was just by the fire-place; Bull was in another box, smoking his pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Bull could not hear what he said? - A. Yes; he could hear him as well as he does me now.</p>
               <p>CALEB EDWARD POWELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fieldling. I belong to the Mint; I was present at the office when the prisoners were examined; the Magistrate before whom they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300027"/>examined was Mr. Ford; this is the examination of Bull, with his signature to it (producing it). The examination was read.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those half-guineas? - A. They are both counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you know that? - A. From the experience I have in the Mint.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are not engaged in coining in the Mint? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak only as a common observer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Turner's defence. In the middle of February I happened to go to the Queen's Larder, I have used it for some time, I had a pint of beer, and four-pennyworth of meat; Dowling pulled a pair of buckles out of his pocket, and asked if I had any buckles; he said, he wanted a pair; I said, I had a pair in pawn; he said, if I would fetch them out he would buy them of me; I said, they lay in King's-head-court, Shoe-lane; I went and got them out, and brought them to Dowling; I said, they they are full-dress buckles, they stand me in thirty shillings; he said, what do you ask for them; I said, twenty-five shillings, you shall have them bargain; he said, I shall give you no such money, I will give you twenty shillings; I said, I am sorry I have been at this trouble, you take the advantage of me; he then said he would give me twenty shillings and two pints of ale; I agreed to take it, and he gave me the twenty shillings, and gave me three bad shillings in paying the money down; I said, here are three bad shillings, I can tell them by the ring; we drank together, and he said, can you help me to any thing of this sort; I said, no; he said, he dealt in that way; he said, these were three of the pieces; this is a dark kitchen, there is a great deal done here; he said, he had thirty-three shillings for a guinea; he said, you being a tradesman might get a little this way; I said, I did not understand it; he said, he had a good E O table, he had a partner belonging to the Lottery-office, and he said, I being a tradesman, if I wanted any encouragement, not to be at a loss, he would encourage me; he asked me if I could help him to any bad halfpence; I said I did not know any man in that profession; he said, he wondered, as a tradesman, I did not get into that line; he further said, there was a person used to serve him with yellows.</p>
               <p>Bull was not put upon his defence.</p>
               <p>Turner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. You have no knowledge about coin, but by having the misfortune to give evidence against a great many people here? - A. No; but I have had a great deal of experience.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no other means of knowing it, but by seeing a good deal produced in this Court? - A. None in the world; I have no doubt in saying they are counterseit, from my experience.</p>

                        targets="t17961130-16-off79 t17961130-16-crimeloc81"/>; I sent Peach about a yard or a yard and a half before me, to knock at the door; he knocked twice, he stopped about a minute between; I saw the window curtains drawn, and I went by the window; I was proceeding to push the door open, when a girl opened it; it was unlocked and unbolted, I heard the lock and bolt drawn; I went in and met Simms coming towards me, he had his cloaths on, but not buttoned; I then told the officers to secure him, which they did instantly; I went on to a passage, and observed the wainscot, pulled down two or three boards, and this rug hung part up and part down, I got under the rug and through the boards, I came to some stairs, and went down those stairs into a place that had been a bake-house, because there was an oven there, that was under the first floor; I found a fire alight, with this iron pot on the fire, with a net in it and a quantity of halfpence being boiled, to receive a colour; they boil them in a liquid, here is the liquid now, that takes the brightness of the copper off; I then saw a press with dies, fixed, and other dies by it, and a stamping press; one of the officers has the dies; in the left hand corner stood a table with these halfpence told up, apparently, in shilling's-worths; these are all coloured, and have been thro every process, and sit for circulation; then in one corner of the cellar, I found a quantity of clean sawdust, which is to dry them when they come out of the pickle; in the other corner there was saw-dust, apparently, with oil, black and greasy; there was a bottle of oil in the cellar, that is to take the dampness off, and keep them from cankering, I have always found greasy saw-dust used in this business; here is a bag which they are shook in, it is called a rouncing sack; they put some saw-dust in the bag, and then put the halfpence in and shake them backwards and forwards, which mixes the oil and sawdust among the halfpence, and puts a blackness on them, to make them look like old halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. That would put upon them the appearance of the halfpence you have produced, that were piled up? - A. Yes, I found this sieve where the press was; the sieve is to riddle them when they come out of the bag; it takes the saw-dust off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or not know that a sieve is used in coming? - A. I have found them in all these places; this is an edging or rounding instrument, I found that fixed in a window up stairs, I took it down; when they are first cut, they have a rough edge, and this will make them smooth; here is a stocking with some misstruck halfpence in it; there were sacks nailed up to both the windows that went into the street, where any light could appear, to keep the light out, and deaden the found, I should believe, because these presses have a found; the door that went into the yard was locked, and we could not find the key; we broke it open; if that door had been open, any body in the next yard might have seen what was going on in the cellar; the prisoner being secured, said he paid eighteen guineas a year for the house; and the little girl's hands being in the same condition as her father's, I took her to the Magistrate, he discharged her.</p>
               <p>Q. How were his hands? - A. Black and greasy, as persons are in that employ.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the stamping press, do you believe or not, that it had been recently at work? - A. I believe it had been recently at work, the oil in the screw then was fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the press particularly? - A. I left that to the persons who took it down, there were some drops of a candle upon it, I found no candle alight, there was a candle near the oven; I compared some of the halfpence I took out of the pot, with the dies, they appeared to tally; they have the same date, (looks at some of the halfpence), they are all counterfeit.</p>

I am an officer of Worship-street; I went in company with Armstrong, and the rest of the officers, Harper, Ferris and Peach; I went into the cellar; I saw the press fixed, with a pair of dies in it; I remained in the cellar, and took the press down; the dies are here; I found three other pair of dies by the side of the press.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Armstrong). Explain in what way the dies are fixed, and how the press is used? - A. A die is put in the bottom, and the sly is fixed on the top,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300030"/>by which they work it, and it is fixed in the ground, that the found may go downwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The halfpence have all the same impression upon them? - A. Yes; all heads and women, there are none plain.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Wray). You found the fly? - A. Yes; every thing was complete, it was in a state to work; there was a great weight at each end of the fly.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. With those weights and the oil, it goes very easy, and gives the impression.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a little girl? - A. Yes; her hands induced me to take her to the Magistrate; there was a girl bigger than her, and some little children; the biggest girl's hands appeared clean.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there people enough in the house to work the press? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have seen that sort of press before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other use it can be put to besides coming? - Yes; a variety of uses, but then they must not have dies in them.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your name? - A. Antoine du Bue Duferrer; I know the prisoner at the bar; he came every morning to brush my cloaths; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; they were all at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prisoner had the care of your linen upon any occasion? - A. They were only given him to carry to the washerwoman; I found some duplicates in the room or kitchen where he was to brush my coat, and I accused him with pawning them; I did not tell him immediately that I had found the duplicates; when I told him, he did not say any thing about them; upon finding the duplicates, I looked and perceived I had lost my linen; I caused the prisoner to be apprehended, and made application to the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you ever gave the prisoner, or any body else, any authority to pawn these articles? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you know any thing more of this business? - A. Nothing.</p>

               <p>Q. How long the prisoner had used to come of a morning to brush your coat? - A. Ever since my arrival in London, two months very near.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before you employed him in this country? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you follow any business in this country? - A. No; I came into this country on private business.</p>
               <p>Q. What part have you of the house, or have you the whole of the house? - A. I lodge in the house of Mr. Phillow, No. 8, Edward-street; I have only an apartment, the second floor.</p>
               <p>Q. How many other persons lodged in the house? - A. To my knowledge, none.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else lived in the house? - A. The master of the house, his sister, and his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. The kitchen was occupied by all those persons in the house, as well as yourself? - A. The servant of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. They had all access to it? - A. The access in common.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether there was a French woman lodged over you in the house? - A. I don't believe it, I believe the servant lies there.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you had any occasion yourself to go to a pawnbroker's shop? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever employ any person to go to a pawnbroker's on your business? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner's wife was your washerwoman? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>EDWARD ROGERS sworn. - I am a police officer at Shadwell; on the 2d of this month, in the evening, I went with Hill, who is a Trinity officer, by direction of the Magistrates, to look after lumpers who plunder shipping; we saw a number of lumpers come out of a ship into a lighter, near Stone stairs; the ship was moored on the Middlesex side of the River; one of the lumpers called for a boat, and Smith, the waterman, rowed us close, under pretence of taking them, and immediately Hill jumped on board the lighter, and I staid in the boat; Hill took off the hat of the prisoner, in which he found a quantity of sugar, which is here (producing it;) we took him into custody, and when we came on shore at Stone stairs, I searched him, and in the inside of his trowsers, on the left leg, I found this bag of sugar concealed; I brought him to the office; he said he had been working on board the Bushy Park, and he found it on the deck; it is clean sugar, there is about 6lb.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You don't know yourself that this man worked on board the Bushy Park? - A. He came out of the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. The ships lie close together? - A. Yes, in the tier.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know then whether he came from on board that ship or the others? - A. He said he came from the Bushy Park; I asked him if he came from that ship; he said he did.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not search him till you came on shore? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he not have disposed of the sugar if he had stole it, before he got on shore? - A. We watched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did you ask him if he was working on board the Bushy-Park? - A. Upon my oath, I did; I said, that is the Bushy Park, were you working on board that ship; he said he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the mate say, that he did not know that any plunder had been committed on board that ship? - A. He said he did not know; we went on board afterwards, and he said there was some sugar taken.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, did not the mate, in the presence of the men, and before the Magistrate, say, he did not know there was any sugar stole? - A. He said something to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not some of the Customs-house officers examined? - A. Not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prisoner did not say, that he came through the Bushy Park from the other ships? - A. I did not hear him say any such thing; there was the name on the stern of the ship; I said, have you been working on board the Bushy Park; he said he had.</p>

               <p>Q. He had been drinking in the house, had he? - A. Yes; he came about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss him out of the tap-room? - A. I did not miss him, my wife missed him about five or six minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him in your bed-chamber; had the bed-chamber-door been locked? - A. Double locked; I immediately secured him, and found an iron crow upon him, with which he had broke open the chamber-door and the drawer, there are the marks of the crow on the door and the drawer; I missed two half-guineas out of this drawer at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him? - A. Not for the money, only for the iron crow; the watchman found one half-guinea upon him, the other was not found.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen this money in the drawer? - A. On the Monday before was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300035"/>lettling day; we put money into the drawer at various times, we frequently put money in every day; on Wednesday night my wife put some in, and on that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you put in the night before? - A. Two guineas; there were besides, three half-guineas, I believe; there had been one guinea taken out afterwards by my wife, before I found the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say when you found him in the bed-room? - A. He said he had made a mistake and got into the wrong room, that he thought it had been the club-room, he pretended to be in liquor; I said he was not so little acquainted with this room as to make that mistake. While I had hold of him, he wanted to persuade me that I had made a mistake, that he was not the person I laid hold of.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the iron crow upon him; what did he say to that? - A. I asked no further account of him, but took him directly to the watch-house; there was half-a-guinea, and about half-a-guinea's-worth of silver left in the drawer when I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you miss out of the drawer in all? - A. The sum total, as far as I can recollect, was about four or five pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You first told me you had not seen the half-guineas from the Monday till the Thursday; that Monday was the settling day? - A. I had seen them over and over, but frequently giving change I could not say exactly what it was, but two half-guineas there positively were when I saw it in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife took out some money on Thursday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what money she took out? - A. She informed me what money she took out.</p>
               <p>Q. The half-guinea found on the prisoner your wife said, she believed, was not your half-guinea? - A. I said so myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You won't swear to any money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a club at your house? - A. A shoe-club.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a shoe-club? - A. A club for people that want shoes cheap, to pay sixpence a week, and spend twopence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner apply to you respecting this club? - A. He asked me if there was a club, and said he wished to be a member of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to pay to be a member? - A. Two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he offer a half-guinea to pay the two shillings, and your wife could not give him change, and returned it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was another sort of a club held in your house? - A. Yes; a raffling-club.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there an application to him from you or your wife, to become a member to raffle for a watch? - A. He put down 2s. or 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the raffle thrown that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might be present? - A. About twenty-five.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the room when the raffle was thrown? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe whether it had been forced open? - A. Yes, I did; I went in afterwards; the prosecutor questioned the prisoner how he came in the room; he said, he made a mistake, and went into that room instead of the club-room; the clubroom was on the same floor; when we brought him down stairs; I told the landlord I thought he had a crow in his pocket; the landlord felt the outside of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300036"/>his pocket, and felt it; in about four or five minutes after, we got a light, and went up stairs, and tried the crow to the jam of the door and the drawer; the prosecutor and his wife were with me; before the Justice, he said he fell over the crow into the room, and took it up, and put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you live at this house? - A. I lodge there.</p>

               <p>Q. How many persons were in the room? - A. Twenty-four or twenty-five.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a light on the stair-case? - A. Yes; but I suppose he had conveyed it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a man in the dark, get into the one room instead of the other? - A. - I cannot suppose that; besides one door was locked, and the other unlocked.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you searched him, he produced the crow himself? - A. No; he denied it; he said he had no such thing about him; I told the landlord he must have such a thing, that he broke the door open with; the landlord insisted upon feeling in his pocket, the prisoner refused it; the landlord felt the outside of his pocket, and felt the iron crow; then he took it out, and gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. There was a half-guinea found upon him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mrs. Smith say, she believed that half-guinea was his own? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Johnson, from the position where he stood, able to see him take it from his frock? - A. Yes; there were four pounds in the hat, and four in the bag; I asked the prisoner Johnson if this was Donahoe's hat, he said Donahoe brought it down.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know in what capacity Donahoe was employed on board the Lord Sheffield? - A. As a lumper.</p>

(Produces the money.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. (Looks at the money.) Here are the four shillings that I marked; two of them are marked P on the head side, one is marked C on the head side, and the other P on the tail side.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the key of your desk? - A. Yes.(Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell whether it was done with a picklock or false key; - A. I am apt to think it was done by a false key, for I found a key afterwards about two feet from my desk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My wife gave me money to go to market on Saturday morning; the prosecutor took me up on Saturday night; I could not buy things to my satisfaction; I had this money to give to the prosecutor: I used to give him all the silver I could get; I had been out all day; I had been up to Mary-le-bonne, and from there to Mile-end, to Bishopsgate-street, and Queenhithe, and had not been at home a quarter of an hour all day; I used to save all the silver I could for the prosecutor on a Saturday; I have witnesses in Court.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to offer him the four guineas? - A. Because he signified to the prisoner's wife, that he had better have a little of the money back, and she came and told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you receive the four guineas from? - A. Mr. Gad, to give to Mr. Payne to be favourable to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Payne say to you? - A. He took the money, and said he would be very favourable to him; that he did it on account of the poor woman and her children.</p>

               <p>Q. What is Rolse's Christian name? - A. Ralph; Rolse was upon the poney, he drove, and I was in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get out of the cart? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you get out of the cart? - A. Rolse on the poney called to me, I got out with a fork in my hand, and the prisoner came directly to me with a pistol in each hand, he told me, if I did not lay the fork down, he would blow my guts out; then I told him I would not, I was afraid to strike him, being near the outside of the road; I fell back on the ground, directly he jumped over me, and stood across me while I was down, and told me he would immediately blow my guts out, if I did not deliver my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the pistols then in his hands? - A. Yes, one in each; I could not get the money out of my pocket, he said, he would blow my guts out if I did not deliver the money immediately; as soon as Rolse came back again, I gave him the money, three guineas and a half in gold, and five shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it then? - A. In a canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver it to him? - A. Yes; Rolse was close to my assistance; I said, Rolse, he has got my money, but he has not hurt me; directly the prisoner tired at me, I had just got up then, I have the powder on my coat now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hit you? - A. No, he singed my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was Rolse from you at that instant? - A. He was close to me then; the prisoner turned to look the contrary was to which Rolse was coming, and we were all three together the moment he fired; the first blow that Rolse gave him, shook the pistol, and hurt his hand, the next blow, he knocked him down; we could not take him then because he was so strong.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you take him at last? - A. Rolse took up the horse-pistol he had dropped, and hit him three or four times; I said, hold, hold, the money dropped out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any man come to your assistance? - A. Yes, a man came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure him? - A. Yes; we all three took him to a public-house, and he was brought to town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has mentioned a great many things that were not done, I never fired the pistol.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The prisoner would have me ask you whether he fired at you or not? - A. He could not but fire once, the powder is on my coat now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never offered to blow the man's belly out, I told him I would not hurt him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear or see any thing done? - A. No, not till I got back; when I came back, he took his leg from off Amour, and looked towards London; Amour said, he has got my money, but he has not hurt me; the prisoner at the bar turned round, and fired directly at Amour, I was near enough to knock him down when he fired; I hit at his head, and he held the pistol up to save himself; I knocked him on the hand, and the money dropped out of his hand; I hit him again two or three times, and Amour said, hold, hold, and then we took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, the blow that the man struck me on the right arm, caused the pistol to go off; I fired no pistol in my life; I never hurt any body, nor bought a pistol in my life time; that was the person that the pistol went off at, and the pistol dropped directly; I never offered to fire at them; I dropped the pistol and purse, they knocked me down, I lost the use of my arm, they laid on me with a dung fork as hard as they could, I begged for mercy, I was all over blood, one of them then said, don't hit him any more; they both got me up, I never offered to touch either of them, they took me to a public-house; I begged of them to wipe my face, the blood was caked on my eyes; I said, for God Almighty's sake, let me go as I am, I have not hurt you, I have not got your money; in the public-house, there came more farmers, I sat upon the bench bleeding a great deal, one came with his first, and knocked me along the bench; I then begged them not to strike me, for I had had enough before; some few minutes before that, they put me in the cart, and took me out again, a man in a brown coat, said, I would blow your brains out for a farthing, he took his first and and struck me on my side, and nothing but corrupted blood comes from me night and day, upwards and downwards; that did not do, I was hand-cussed in the cart, and that gentleman tied my two hands, he beat me on the back till I had not a free place upon me; I have been in the infirmary, and could never sit up in my bed; after I was in the cart, I never offered to stir the least in the world.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't know the value of them, do you? - A. No, I don't rightly know the value of them.</p>

               <p>Q. You never spoke to him but when you went up stairs? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. A week had elapsed, and though you had but a momentary glance of him, you undertake to swear the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen him before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He had a round hat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You shut the hall door when the man came in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that man's life is at stake? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. It is, and, after I tell you that, will you undertake to swear he is the same man? - A. I can tell by his face, I shut the door after him, but there was a light in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding there must be a shade from the hat, and though you had never seen him before, you undertake to swear to the man? - A. Yes, by the length of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen another man with a face the length of his, you would have sworn to him? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you now swear to this man? - A. He is the man that brought the shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was your duty to take care of the plate? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When the prisoner was apprehended, there was nothing found upon him? - A. Nothing that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up to the drawing-room to your mistress? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were some time delivering your message? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If the prisoner had committed this theft, he might have run away while you were up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear to this man, after what has been said? - A. To the best of my knowledge, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear to nothing but the length of his face? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to these things, were they silver or not? - A. Solid silver; there were the stamps upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. This house belongs to Mr. Aickin; how do you know your master's name is Francis? - A. I cannot undertake to say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You always understood his name to be Francis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When he was at Bow-street, he said, he did not miss a part of the plate till next morning.</p>
               <p>Witness. I missed some of the things the overnight; in the morning, I found the others were gone; I am sure they were on the side-board in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you to say against the prisoner? - A. The prisoner came one day with a pair of shoes for my mistress, October the 5th, about three o'clock in the day, my mistress was out, and I took the pair of shoes from him, and put them into the parlour, then she came home and tried on the shoes, and left them in the parlour and went up stairs; the man went away immediately, he left the shoes, and came an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him your mistress was not at home? - A. Yes, I told him so, and he went away directly; at the time he came again, a coach came to the door, I went up stairs, he was standing at the servant's hall below, he came down the area steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him through the area? - A. Yes, the area-door was open, and he came down the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were called away from the door? - A. Yes; I was obliged to go up at the same time he was talking with me; I did not shut the pantry-door, I just shut it to, I left him in the hall; I brought the shoes, after the carriage was gone, and gave them to him, he went away directly; I did not miss the things till my fellow-servant came in; he went out to buy some things, when he came in to put them in the drawer he missed the things, he asked me what had become of them; I told him I could not tell, I washed them and put them in the drawer.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you miss? - A. I missed a silver tea-pot-stand, three silver tea-spoons, a silver milk-pot, a table-cloth, and a pair of silver sugar-tongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all silver? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they all there when the man came? - A. They were all there a little before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. About half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body been in the hall? - A. No; in the place all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes; I remember his features very well, he stood up and talked with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - A. Yes, I am sure he is the man; I was sent for to Bow-street to know whether it was the same man; I came into the room and found my hat upon his head.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was he taken? - A. I cannot rightly remember, I think two weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was he taken by? - A. I don't know who took him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your hat was found upon him; how soon after this did you find the hat again? - A. The hat was not found till he was taken at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the hat that was found upon him? - A. It is here. (It was produced by the officer).</p>
               <p>Q. Independent of the hat, are you sure of his person? - A. Yes; I am.</p>

               <p>Q. Your master's name is Jackson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are no relation to him to be sure? - A. No; I have been christened so.</p>

               <p>Q. There were other people in the house? - A. There are always a good many servants in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. The man told you he would call in an hour, and kept his word? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time you say you saw this silver to the time it was missed? - A. About half an hour after I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never seen it since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The servants were in the kitchen at the time this man was on the stairs going down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is not very likely that a man should go into the kitchen when the servants were there? - A. It was not in the kitchen; it was in the pantry, in a different part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the prisoner was at the steps, you went up to the coach? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see into the kitchen? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see any body go away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any body observe any person go to this pantry? - A. No, they could not; the servants were all about, but not in my apartments.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this hat? - A. Hanging up in the pantry.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had a hat on when he went to your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300043"/>Q. Your hat was lost, and found upon his head? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were rather suspicious that the man had stole the silver, as he went away with two hats? - A. He left his and took mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person in the house? - A. Only the servants.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know how many hats the other servants have? - A. There is no man servant but me and another.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know whether he had two hats? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of marks are there about this hat? - A. It is a plain hat.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark about it? - A. It is a hat that was brought from the West-Indies, and my master gave it me; I took the hat and scraped the dirt off the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, I suppose people scrape their hats when they are dirty - but there is no mark about it by which you can swear to it? - A. I am sure it is mine; I know the hat by experience.</p>
               <p>Q. You will swear to it though there are no marks about it? - A. I know it is mine, he took it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, Sir, did you see him take it out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a mark in the hat you lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But there was no mark in the hat you found; and will you swear it is your hat - do you know that man's life is at stake? - Now attend to that-upon recollection, as an honest man, will you undertake to swear to it? - A. It is an old hat, it was given to me, I know it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. The hat you lost was the hat you wore? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But whether this is that hat you wore you cannot undertake to say? - A. I have had it long enough to know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that hat is your's though there is no particular mark about it, when that man's life is at stake? - A. That is all I know about it.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer belonging to Bow-street; I took this hat off the prisoner's head, the 4th of November, at a public-house, the Brown-Bear, opposite the Public-office Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take it off his head? - A. By the Black coming out of the office, he said he had lost his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew him that hat? - A. Yes; I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you shewed him that hat? - A. He said, that is mine, directly, that is the hat; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The man had that hat on at the Public-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is there any appearance of the mark being taken out? - A. Yes; at the bottom, the lining is taken out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. It is no uncommon thing for the lining at the bottom, you know, to fall out of a hat - nine out of a dozen do so, don't they? - A. Not if it is placed fast in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you return the hat back again to me? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You did, in the Brown-Bear; I came up into the office with the hat on, I had friends there, and I might have changed it if I liked.</p>
               <p>Witness. When I had it in my custody I kept it, he never had it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing farther to say.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the wash-house inside the house? - A. It is a lean-to, the kitchen door opens into it; my wife was alarmed and waked; with that she called my servant, who sleeps in the next room, desiring her to strike a light, for she was sure there was something the matter in the kitchen among the ducks, by hearing a noise of the ducks; there were milking pails and tin pails, which caused a great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300044"/>the servant went down stairs, and opened the kitchen door; she asked the man what he wanted there -</p>
               <p>Q. You heard this? - A. Every word; she asked the man what he wanted there, or what brought him there; she slammed the door to again, and bolted it; with that she went to the street door, the watchman was coming past; she called, Pitt! Pitt! different times, there is a thief in the house; the watchman's name is Pitt; mind the gate says she; then she came to the kitchen door again, and opened it, and went into the wash-house, and opened the washhouse door, and went into the yard, and called out, he is gone, he is gone up the yard; by that time I got down stairs, the watchman came into the gate, and was standing by him in the yard; he had either got down, or thrown himself down off the house; I found the prisoner lying at the wash-house door; I laid hold of him by the arm, and dragged him into the wash-house, and out of the wash-house into the kitchen, and secured him until the next morning, to go to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your ducks? - A. In the washhouse; after I secured him, I asked the maid to go into the wash-house, and see what damage he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner come in? - A. Through the roof of the house, it was pan-tiled and pointed.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no ceiling? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many tiles did he move? - A. Seven tiles, I think, off the place he stripped, and laid them on one side on the roof.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not a very high building? - A. About ten feather edge boards high in front; it is higher behind where it leans to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many feet high is it in front? - A. Something better than seven feet high; I have a milk-cart in the yard, he got the seat board and set it up an end, and with the support of that, clambered up; I will not be upon my oath, whether the man was sober, whether it was by liquor or not, that he fell from the house, I don't know, but I rather think the man was a good deal in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of him? - A. I do not know the man, he must certainly have watched about the premises, for no stranger could know where they were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. There is no door that opens out of the wash-house into the house? - A. You were not there to see; I can give a better account of it than you can, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. As you think I have asked you an impertinent question, I will not trouble you with any more.</p>
               <p>Witness. I have as much humanity for the man as you have, be who you will.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did I understand you right, that the maid opened the kitchen-door into the washhouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MARGARET BUNN sworn. - Q. Are you servant to Mr. Leslie? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This night, the 7th of November, you were disturbed, called by your mistress, lit a candle, went down into the kitchen, opened the kitchen-door, and went into the wash-house? - A. Yes; I unbolted the kitchen-door, I saw Joseph Malcolm with a duck in his left hand, a white duck.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing with it? - A. It was dead in his hand; I asked him what brought him there, or, how came he there, he made me no answer; I shut to the door, and bolted it, and run to the street door, and called the watchman, and desired him to mind the gate, there was a thief in the house; he said the gate was fast, he could not come out there; I told him to mind the yard, he was gone up there; I opened the kitchen-door, and I heard the prisoner fall; I saw the prisoner lying on the ground by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. He was secured? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go into the wash-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he done there? - A. Killed nine ducks out of ten; he threw four or five out of the wash-house into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all alive the over night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When you went in, it was light enough to see the colour of the duck, if you had not had a candle? - A. What! at one o'clock in the morning! - the watchman was crying the hour.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PITT sworn. - When the servant of the house called to me, to run to the gate, I went to the gate, and said, nobody is here; she said, he has run up the yard, she held the candle out, I saw the man on the roof; I put the pistol through the gate, and threatened to shoot him, and he dropped down like a stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he drop from? - A. Off the roof; I opened the gate, and said, here he is; and he came, and we secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. He surrendered very quietly? - A. He never moved or spoke; I asked if any body was there but himself; he said yes, let me go and see for them; I said, no, you must stop here; he said, then, if they are gone, I am here.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you told her it would be better for her to confess? - A. No; I told her she had another guinea; she said, no, she had not; I bid her feel in her other pocket, she then pulled out a gown, she said she had spent the guinea in cloaths; she had bought a gown for 9s. a petticoat for 9s. and an apron for 1s. 6d. and had spent the rest in apples; I told her she was a very wicked girl for doing so, and asked her if she had taken any thing else, she said, no; on the Monday following, I missed my cloak, and asked her if she had taken it, she said, no; afterwards, she confessed she took it on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300047"/>Saturday morning, and sold it to a lady in Fleet-market, for two guineas; and that she would stay with me and work it out: I asked her what she had done with the money, she said she had paid it away to people she owed money to; the cloak has never been recovered.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time she told you of the cloak, had you told her it would be better for her to confess? - A. Yes, provided she got the cloak again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she told you she had taken the cloak, before you told her it would be better for her to confess? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the cloak? - A. Four pounds, it cost me five guineas; I had not had it above a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you offered her any favour before she made a confession? - A. I am not positive of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these guineas marked? - A. No; I could not swear to them, only by her own confession.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the guineas, whether you had not told her it would be better for her to confess she had them? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure she declared these two guineas to be your's, before you offered her any favour? - A. Yes; I never said I had lost any thing till I said the two guineas in the paper were mine; and then she said she took them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you? - A. A week.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with her? - A. Yes; from the Red Ball, in Red-lion-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in that house, in Cursitor-street? - A. A twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a milliner? - A. Ever since I lived in that house; my husband has been dead three years; I only come from abroad lately, I am a German; the officer that took her, found nothing upon her, and he was not bound over.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep the whole house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I hired myself to this place as a private house; when I got there, I found it was a disorderly house; I was to go to see my brother on Sunday, and she begged of me not to say any thing to my brother what sort of a place I was in.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the Prosecutor). Is there any body else in the house besides yourself? - A. Two ladies.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they women of character; how do they get their livelihood? - A. I cannot say, one of them I believe, has a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to doubt they are girls of the town, or one of them? - A. I cannot tell, I do not trouble myself about my lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. She says you told her not to tell her brother what sort of a house she was in? - A. Upon my oath, I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this girl receive any company in your house, or was she merely a servant? - A. No; she was merely my servant.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not call any witnesses to her character.</p>

               <p>Q. You are likewise sure that Cooper is the person to whom you gave the halfpence in Broad-court, and with whom you stopped a minute or two? - A. Not a minute; I had no connection with her at all.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you parted, you missed your watch? - A. Yes; I missed her all at once, I put my hand in, and did not feel my watch; my coat hung back in that manner, (describing it); I dare say she saw me put it in.</p>

            , but could not find the watch upon her; the prisoner Costelow stood at the end of the watch-house, as a spectator as it were; I had some suspicion in my mind, that she might have it about her; I asked her what she had got in her pockets, she said, nothing; I have no pockets about me; when I went to search her pockets, there was no pocket-hole in her petticoat at all; I put my two hands all round her, and searched her as decent as I could; I saw her hands down a fidgeting between her thighs, which gave me more suspicion she might have the watch about her; at last I put my hand between her thighs, and felt something hard like a watch; I said, what have you got here, she said, nothing; I turned up her outside petticoat, I felt her pocket between her thighs, and something in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in it? - A. His silver watch; I asked her how she came by it, she said, upon my word, Mr. Romley, I don't know how it came there; so I secured her, upon suspicion of her receiving this watch, knowing it to be stolen; the other was charged for stealing of it; Thompson said she stole it; this is the watch I took out of her pocket. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner Costelow say, when you found it? - A. She said, she had it of the prisoner Cooper.</p>
               <p>Costelow. I said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Romley. Cooper said, she gave it her to take care of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cooper say how she came by it? - A. Yes; she said she had it of a young man whom she knew very well, that he left it in her hand for half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Costelow in liquor? - A. Perfectly sober; Cooper was rather more in liquor, she had been fighting with Thompson; the prosecutor advertised the watch, by that means I found him.(The watch was produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. You felt her sumbling about your person - she had her hands round you? - A. No; the minute she was gone, I had a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Something passed to create a suspicion? - A. I put my hand in my pocket and found it gone.</p>
               <p>Q. She had her hand upon that side? - A. No; I cannot say I felt her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her fumbling about you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the outside coat pocket, she had not her hand far from it? - A. She was close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you quite sober? - A. Quite so; I had not drank any thing the whole evening.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner Costelow was not there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I can say no more, I know nothing of the gentleman; three of us women were in the watch-house for this watch; when he came before the Justice, he was asked which he could swear to, he said, he did not know which; with that he looked short at me; if I had been the robber, I should not have stood next to him; the Justice asked him if he knew the number of the watch, he said, no, neither the maker's name nor the number; Romley gave him the watch into his hand to look at it; I never was in company with him, I never saw him before; I have neither father nor mother in the world.</p>
               <p>Costelow was not put on her defence.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where were you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300049"/>when you saw the man take these pots? - A. I was in the yard, he was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a dark night, and yet in the yard you saw him put the pots in his pocket? - A. Yes; there was a light in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. He ran out into the street? - A. Yes; I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you have him stopped the moment he put them in his pocket? - A. I chose to let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. You chose to let the man commit a felony when you could have prevented it, and then come here and ask a Jury to convict him? - A. I certainly meant to convict him.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have prevented his going out of the house with them? - A. I gave him an opportunity to run out.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might he be from the house when he was stopped? - A. About fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body follow him besides yourself? - A. Yes; Harry Weale.</p>
               <p>Q. You ran pretty fast? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You were determined not to lose your man? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What light was there for you to see him drop the pots? - A. The light of the lamps; it was very light.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have thrown away the fourth pot as well as the other three? - A. No; the man laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. He could not throw it away then? - A. No; I am glad he could not.</p>

             sworn. - I am the wife of Edward King, my husband is in India, he has been abroad five years, I took the house I live in: On Monday morning, the 10th of November, about four o'clock, I was alarmed by the watchman, the street door was open; I went down immediately, there was no appearance of force; I was last up the night before, the prisoner attended me; I sent her to bed at nine o'clock, I am sure the house was fast in the usual way; the diamond rings were in a drawer, in which my money was, on a side-board; there was near eight guineas in it, the drawer was locked; that drawer was broke open, every thing in it gone, and all the plate off the side-board; I had seen it all safe at eleven o'clock over-night; when I came down, I, went to the parlour door, and just looked in, and thought all was safe; I went to the door to the watchman, who wished to see that every thing was safe; I told him there was no necessity for that, every thing was safe; upon that he went up stairs again, and in about two minutes I came down, and saw that all the plate, and every thing in the drawer was gone, and the drawer lying on the ground; I then ran out into the street, and called out to the watchman, that the house was robbed, this was about four o'clock in the morning; there were several watchmen went by, they said, they did not know any thing about it, they said, it was not their watch; a few minutes afterwards, several watchmen came round the door, among whom was my own watchman, he said, every thing was safe when I was here; when I called out that the house was robbed, the prisoner came down immediately, she had her day cap, a shawl, an handkerchief, and an under petticoat on, she immediately fell on her knees, and said, that she hoped the Lord God Almighty would bring to Justice the offenders before this blessed day was over, and many other expressions to that purpose; I do not recollect having a suspicion of her, I had her brought before Mr. Bond; on searching her, two of my diamond rings that were taken out of the drawer, were found in the drawer of the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your rings again, since they were taken from you? - A. I saw them when they were found in my own house, in the drawer of the kitchen, that was on the Monday after the robbery was; on the Thursday morning they were in a work-bag, among a parcel of old rags.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose work-bag was this? - A. It was her's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept these rings from that time to this? - A. No; I delivered them to the person that found them, his name is Greatis.</p>
               <p>Q. Will they be produced here to-day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else found besides the diamond rings? - A. Nothing but trifling articles not worth mentioning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have told us you have been married? - A. Yes; Mr. King is in India.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought Mr. King was in company with you and the prisoner, after the offence was committed? - A. Is it necessary I should answer this.</p>
               <p>Court. You must answer that question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. There was a gentleman of the name of King in company with you and the prisoner after this transaction? - A. There was a gentleman, but not of the name of King.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person, of the name of King, live or lodge in your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is the man she lived with.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Don't be affected, madam, because, if you live in an honourable way, as an honourable woman, nothing can be attached to you which is not true - one short question might save us a great deal of trouble, and you a great deal of pain - I believe, at Bow-street, you stated the things stolen to be the property of Julia King? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This woman was committed for stealing this, as the property of

               <p>Q. You have told us you lost eighty guineas? - A. I am not quite sure as to the sum; it might be more or it might be less, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Mr. Bond you said you lost Banknotes? - A. I did; four five-pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the door was completely fastened by you after you let this gentleman in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that gentleman stay in the house all night, or go out afterwards? - A. He staid in the house all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard from your husband these five years? - A. Not for the last two years.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know whether he is alive or dead? - A. I could almost undertake to say he is alive.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had regular correspondence with him for these five years? - A. Not for these two years; I have received letters from him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not seen any body lately that knows him to be alive? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no reason to believe him to be alive? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he done the duties of a good husband? - A. He is a man of very bad character.</p>
               <p>Q. If so, I should think he is not alive now? - A. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the servant, the moment you called her she ran down stairs? - A. Yes, I don't think it was a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. You were alarmed at that time of night, though there was a gentleman in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it was right and proper for her to come down stairs? - A. I should not think, when the house was robbed, it was proper to stay to dress herself, because I came down directly.</p>
               <p>Q. It takes no time, you know, to put on a day cap, though it does a gown? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner breakfasted in the house after the robbery? - A. I don't know; she attended me at breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent her out for mussins and other things for breakfast? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent her out again? - A. Yes, at dinner time, and she staid a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had staid a good while, she might then have went away with the things? - A. Yes; but I had so good an opinion of her, that I should never have suspected her, had it not been for persons telling me they had a suspicion of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Eleven o'clock at night was the last time you saw the door fast? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The thieves, therefore, who took the other things, might have taken the diamond rings? - A. Certainly they might.</p>
               <p>Q. She had this opportunity of escaping in the morning, as well as at dinner time? - A. She might.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a good opinion of her? - A. Yes, from her behaviour towards me, which was extremely flattering and attentive, but every body else had a bad opinion of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find these rings? - A. In a drawer in the kitchen, appropriated to her use, among the rags.</p>
               <p>Q. That drawer was not locked? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was open to any body? - A. Yes, if they went into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it was open when the diamond rings were discovered? - A. It was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. These things were found in that drawer, which any body, coming into the room, might have opened? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The girl was in the house after the robbery was committed? - A. Yes; three days.</p>
               <p>Q. And the diamond rings remained there for that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She had sufficient opportunity to escape, and did not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I think you said you apprehended your husband was not dead? - A. I am almost sure he is not dead.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was this house taken by yourself, or any body for you? - A. By myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you pay the rent? - A. I have not paid any rent; I have only been in four months.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the same man you saw in the pastry-cook's shop? - A. I don't know; he had the same coloured cloaths on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his appearance like the man you had seen? - A. Yes; the prisoner was on my left-hand, next my left-hand pocket, my hand was then round my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it round your purse after the man pushed you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure the man had quitted you before your and was off the purse? - A. Yes; I was then pushed almost down by the woman, as I judged.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The man pushed you against the woman, and then she pushed you again? - A. Yes; and then she laid hold on my cloaths, just by my pocket, and almost pushed me down, and obliged me to pull my hand out of my pocket to save myself; when I had recovered myself, in a moment, while the woman was by me, I missed my purse, and cried out, this woman has robbed me of eighty guineas and upwards; her face at that time was full in the light of the lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman by when you cried out you had lost your money? - A. Yes; she cried out, what are you at, what would you have; I said, I was ruined for ever; she went forward, and a man stood ready to receive her.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time she spoke, her face was right against the lamp? - A. Yes; I saw her as plain as if I had held the lamp against her face myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak positively to her person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen her since? - A. Yes; twice at Hatton-garden; on Monday, a week after the robbery, she was taken in consequence of an information, and a description I had given of her to the officers of the Police.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You had observed her so much as to give a description of her person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you see that person in Court now, that you gave a description of at the Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is she? - Go down and touch the person. - (The witness goes down and touches the prisoner).</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the person you saw at the office? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You know, between seven and eight at night, there is always a great croud of people in Fleet-street? - A. Yes; but I never was interrupted before.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there when you were making your passage through this place? - A. I don't know, I believe there were more of the gang.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there sixty or seventy persons passed through while you were in the passage? - A. No, there were not; there might be five or six.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Were you an Excise-officer on the 25th of September 1795? - A. Yes; I know the prisoner at the bar, Waddle, I knew him before this transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he acquainted with your person? - A. Yes; in consequence of an information which I had on that day, I went to Wye, and called on Mr. Hayward, an officer, to go with me for my assistance, it is about seventeen miles from the coast; about ten o'clock in the evening we sat out together, and rode to a place called New-Church, in the country of Kent, where we remained till nearly one in the morning, the 26th, when the prisoner, and

             in company with him, came along with a cart with two horses, which seemed very heavily loaded; I told Mr. Hayward what passed, and we immediately went in pursuit of the cart; on examining it, we found it was loaded with unmanufactured tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it contained in? - A. Common sort of bags for this purpose; we seized it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with the cart? - A. Yes; the prisoner and Hart, at the same time; after that, Hayward called out to me, saying, that Hart was endeavouring to get the horse out of the shafts of the cart; to prevent him from doing so, I went round, and Hart held up a stick in a menacing manner, a scuffle ensued then between Hart and me; I afterwards drove Hart into the hedge, he then sprang from the hedge, and took me by the collar of my coat, and dragged me from my horse, and called Waddle to his assistance, they were both upon me, they beat me with their fists and their knees; Hart sat upon me with a very large knife drawn open in his hand, swearing, that if the goods and horses were not given up he would murder me; after that, Hayward came to my assistance, I was insensible by their sitting upon me; I was choaked by my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that occasioned? - A. By their sitting upon me, and drawing the handkerchief that was round my neck very tight.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you became insensible? - A. About ten minutes; when I recovered myself, Waddle came back with the cart and two horses, and drove off.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had they been with the cart? - A. They came back a contrary road to that which they were going before.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in custody of the cart, when they were beating you? - A. Mr. Hayward, who had taken the cart a little the other way; when I recovered my senses, Waddle came back with the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when they had got away the cart? - A. I was left lying on the ground, I don't know where they took it to, I never recovered it again; I got up about a quarter of an hour after.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time Waddle came back, did you say any thing to them? - A. I told them I wished them to release me, when I could get the opportunity of speaking, because sometimes I was almost strangled; I got to a public-house as soon as I could; I was a month before I could do any business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. I want you, if you can, to tell me, if Mr. Hart was on his trial, what the prisoner did; - where was the prisoner when you came up? - A. They were both riding on the top of the bags in the cart; it was full of bags.</p>
               <p>Q. It was Hart that got down? - A. They both got down.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of these bags open? - A. I cut one open at the time they were getting down, and took out a sample.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you time while they were getting down, to cut a bag open and take a sample out? - A. Yes; they did not get down immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, that afterwards Hart held up a stick to you? - A. Yes; upon my coming round the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that he used it in a menacing posture? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the meaning of the word you have made use of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, the present defendant was not near him? - A. No, nor came near to him, till Hart cried out for assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did he cry out for assistance? - A. Because he was dragging me from my horse, he had got down before he called for assistance; they were both afterwards upon me, and beat me; but only Hart sat upon me, with a drawn knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both set upon you? - A. They were both upon me with their knees; Hart far upon me, when the other left me and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course, he was with you a part of the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300060"/>Q. Did not you or Hayward hurt either of them? - A. He desired them to desist, or else he would fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Hayward actually fire upon one of them? - A. I know nothing but that Hayward threatened to fire.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know whether he did or not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Hayward? - A. He left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these men had you in their power, did they do any thing more to you? - A. No; they let me go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You said you were insensible for a considerable time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They left you in that state of insensibility? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Do you know whether Hayward fired the pistol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Were you in such a state of insensibility, that you did not know whether a gun was fired or not? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am an Excise-officer; I was called upon to go with Walton, on the 25th of September, towards New-Church.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; I saw him that night with a cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it the cart was coming by? - A. About one o'clock; I went to the fore horse, Mr. Walton was behind the cart, he said, stop the fore horse, for it is loaded with tobacco; I halloaed out to Walton, Hart is taking the harness off, and has run away with the reins, Walton turned immediately round, and rode after him; in the mean time I staid with the cart; then Mr Walton in a little time after, called out, Mr. Hayward! Mr. Hayward! with that, I turned back, and left the seizure, to the assistance of Mr. Walton; they had then unhorsed him; they were both upon him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them get out of the cart? - A. Yes; both of them jumped out of the cart, they were both upon Walton, beating him and kneeing him; then I said, if you don't desist from beating Walton, I shall be under the necessity of firing; Hart said, "damn your eyes and limbs, fire and"be damned, we have fire arms as well as you;" upon that, finding they were still beating Walton, I fired, and shot Hart in the hip; Hart says, "damn"your eyes and limbs, I am shot, but I am not hurt;" the prisoner then came and snapped a pistol, but luckily, it did not go off, it only snapped.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the pistol to you? - A. Not more than three or four yards, at the most.</p>
               <p>Q. What pistol was this? - A. I don't know; Mr. Walton had a pistol, and I supposed it was his; I found it was not in my power to get them from beating Mr. Walton, and I went after the goods, seized them and secured them; I came up with the cart, and drove it a small distance, it might be a quarter of a mile, two men came up behind the cart, it was moonlight, and said, "damn your eyes"and limbs, we will soon settle you."</p>
               <p>Q. Who were these men? - A. Waddle was one, but I don't know who the other was; then I found it was impossible to maintain the seizure, my life being danger; I rode off and saw no more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time they were beating Walton, had you an opportunity of seeing his person, whether he was helpless or not? - A. He appeared to be insensible, for I called out, "Mr. Walton," and he could not answer me; I have no doubt at all of the person; the goods were then taken away, the cart was turned round and drove back.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you had an opportunity of seeing Walton again? - A. I got assistance, and he was put to bed at a public-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure you saw both of them unhorse Mr. Walton, or only one of them? - A. He was off when I came up, I saw them when they were upon him.</p>

               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a constable belonging to Lambeth-street Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time go to the prisoner's house? - A. Yes; on Saturday the 29th of October, about three o'clock in the afternoon; I went in company with another officer, to No. 3, Lemon-street, Lemon-row, Goodman's-fields, the prisoner's house; we knocked at the door and were let in by a woman who was in the house, we asked for Mr. Wilson, she said he was not at home, but she called Mrs. Wilson, who was below stairs; Mr. Wilson came up stairs, we told her we had a warrant to search that person's house, and asked her for the keys of the doors, the parlour door was locked, she said, her husband had the keys, she had got no keys of either of the doors, for she lived in the kitchen, and that was all the part of the house that Mr. Wilson allowed her; I went into the back yard, finding the parlour door was locked; I saw a quantity of casks in the parlour, through the window; I then listed up the window and went in, there I found fourteen casks all empty; I asked Mrs. Wilson what she did with those casks there, or something of that sort, and she said, Mr. Wilson bought them for fire-wood; I then came out at the window again, we asked her to shew us up stairs, we went up one pair of stairs, and in that room we saw a quantity of large tilts.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they? - A. They are things to make tents with; we asked Mrs. Wilson who they belonged to, she replied, to a Quaker, an old gentleman who slept in the room; we then asked her to shew us up two pair of stairs, she said she had not got the key, it was locked; I went up to the door, and saw the padlock upon the door, I tried to open it but could not; I desired my fellow officer to go down stairs, and bring up a poker to break it open, he brought a poker up, I wrenched out the staples, and went in, there I saw 101 woollen rugs, or coverlids, 66 blankets, 295 pair of stockings, 189 sheets, two drum cases, and 31 tilts; we just looked over them and came down stairs again; some little time after, Mr. Wilson knocked at the door, and was let in; Mrs. Wilson informed him, that we had been searching the house, we walked down stairs into the kitchen all of us; I asked Mr. Wilson if he knew any thing of that property that was in his house, or where he had it; he said, yes, they were his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention to him the articles? - A. No; I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe it to him? - A. No; I mentioned it as the property up stairs; he said they were his, that he had bought them; I told him I hoped he could bring the person forward whom he had bought them of; I asked him if he had bought them of a shop-keeper who dealt in them; he answered me, no; he had bought them of a person at the Camel, in the Minories; he said, he believed he could bring him forward, if he went out, he should be back and bring the person in half an hour; we told him, we could not let him go, and we got a cart and took these goods to the Public-office, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How many casks were there? - A. Fourteen, empty.</p>
               <p>Q. The goods were found up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present at the conversation between the prisoner and the other constable? - A. Yes; we asked him how he came by them; he said, he honestly bought them, and paid for them, at the sign of the Camel, in the Minories; he believed the man came from Yorkshire that he bought them of, he lived there; these are the things produced here;(the articles mentioned in the indictment were produced;) I asked him if he had a bill and receipt for them; he said, no, he had not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner at the bar hired a cart of you? - A. No, I cannot swear positively whether it was him or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the man that hired the cart of you? - A. I do not; a gentleman came to me in Thames-street, about four o'clock, on a Friday, about six weeks ago, it was a holiday at the Custom-house, and asked me if I had a cart to spare; I told him, yes; I had just sent one home, and went after it;

             drove the cart; when I got the cart back, he told me to drive it into the Tower; I went with my man up as far as the White Tower, the further end; these goods laid on the pavement, and he told me to turn the cart round where the casks lay.</p>
               <p>Q. How many casks were there? - A. Fourteen; I got up into the cart, and the man likewise.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was this man there at that time that hired the cart? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You told us just now, Sir, that the gentleman told you to drive the cart to the Tower; where was he when he told you that; did he go with you to the Tower? - A. He walked before the cart into the Tower.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far did he walk with the cart into the Tower; as far as the casks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300062"/>Court. Q. Did you or not load the casks by his order? - A. He ordered me to set the cart round and load them there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How dared you, Sir, not to give me a plain answer before; then he ordered you to set the cart round and load them there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. How many casks were there? - A. Fourteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they marked? - A. I don't know; I am sure I should not know them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cover them? - A. Yes, with a tilt, for fear it should rain a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Who ordered that tilt to be brought? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stood by and ordered them to be covered? - A. The man said, spread it; I said, there was no occasion for it to be spread.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry these casks when you had got them? - A. They were ordered to Lemon-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who ordered them? - A. My man told me they were going there, that they were ordered there.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom? - A. I cannot positively say; my man went, and I told him to take five shillings for the cartage.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you left them? - A. I told them not to go the same way out, because the way was too steep for the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go with them? - A. I went a little way and turned back; I heard no more till I went home at night.</p>
               <p>WILLIAH GOULD sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am servant to the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 28th of October going to the Tower? - A. Yes, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner at the bar came to my master, and said he wanted a cart to go into the Tower, upon which my master told me to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sell you where you were to go? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else? - A. The prisoner at the bar told me to follow him, which I did up into the White Tower, as it is called; when I came up to the top of the White Tower, the gentleman that hired the cart told me to turn the cart round, which I did; a pulley was put in the cart, and fourteen casks were rolled into the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these casks when you first saw them? - A. Upon the white pavement in the White Tower.</p>
               <p>Court. You say the fourteen casks were rolled into the cart; by whose order? - A. The prisoner's order; my master and I were going to tell the casks, thinking there were more than fourteen; the prisoner made answer and said, there were but fourteen of them, which my master and I loaded too much forward, and were obliged to put them backward, because they should not bear too hard upon the horse going down the hill; then the prisoner told me to drive to Chambers-street; then he afterwards said, drive to Lemon-street, and then he said to one of the men that had to unload the cart, you will go along with him, which he did, to Lemon-row, Lemon-street, Whitechapel, at the corner of Whitelion-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there? - A. When I untied the cart, the man who followed me took the first cask in; I took the next into a small new house lately built.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was that? - A. I don't know; the prisoner was there and received the goods from me, and helped them down from off my back; the prisoner said, at the time when I let one down, not to let them down so hard, that I should have the heads out of them; after they were taken in, I took the tilt in that was over them, and then I asked the prisoner for my cartage; he asked me how much it was? I told him five shillings; he made answer, that he thought it too much; he then gave me five shillings; then I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt whether that is the man that called the cart, and loaded the things? - A. I am sure it is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This was in the day-time, was it? - A. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say these goods were on the pavement, you mean in the open air, not in a room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the common way, where every body walk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This pavement is in the Tower; it is not in the common way? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This tent-room is the place where these things are brought from the different manufacturies? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day is the tent-room left? - A. There is no particular time of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons are to be in the tent-room? - A. Myself and four labourers to do the general duty.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were these things put in the tent-room? - A. They are not always in the same part, they are put in different parts.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the tent-room, is it a common room, or is it like a tent? - A. It takes the name, I believe, from having tents in formerly, it is like any other warehouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How long time in the day is it your duty to be in the tent-room? - A. From ten in the morning till two are the regular hours.</p>
               <p>Q. And when after? - A. From four to six.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Gould). Q. What time was it you went into the Tower with the cart? - A. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Crisp). Q. If I understand you right, from ten till two, and from four to six, is the usual time for somebody to be in the warehouse? - A. So I understood it, I never had any notice, it is the general practice.</p>
               <p>Q. In those hours is any thing left without any body being there? - A. Not without labourers.</p>
               <p>Q. At other times they are left, and then locked up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Was the 28th of October a holiday at the Tower? - A. There are no holidays.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far is the tent-room from the White Tower? - A. About thirty yards, I cannot speak positively, they go immediately from the broad walk to the tent-room.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I know him from being clerk to Mess. Hodgson and Hayters, packers.</p>
               <p>Q. You are cooper, and furnish them with casks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen the fourteen casks that were found in the prisoner's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the casks you furnished to Messrs. Hodgson and Hayters? - A. Yes; they are the same identical casks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. My Lord, I don't mean to call the accomplice, as I submit to your Lordship, the case is sufficiently made out against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This, I believe, is the first in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300064"/>stance where the Crown has received any person as an informer (from whom the case originated), and made that person a witness for the purpose of prosecution, and withheld on the trial, the examination of that witness.</p>
               <p>Court. I don't know whether it ever has been so before, but I always dread to hear the evidence of an accomplice, for he comes in such a suspicious situation, generally shifting the guilt off his own shoulders upon another; and I never find fault with any Counsel for the prosecution, when an accomplice is not called; for his evidence is worth nothing of itself, nor is it to be taken into consideration, unless it is corroborated by other evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. That evidence upon his examination, which they have made use of to six the guilt upon the man, I assert, would prove the case to be of a different description to that now given; as he is upon the back of the bill, I would make use of him; and I think it not candid to withhold him.</p>

               <p>Court. I will call him, and any body shall examine him, as the man is upon the back of the bill; I make it a rule to call every body, for I have known instances in which a single witness has said that which has acquitted the prisoner; but when there are Counsel they know best whether there case is proved, and I leave it to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. It is a novel doctrine indeed, that the Counsel for the prisoner shall say in what manner the Counsel for the prosecution shall conduct his case, it is entirely unprecedented; he being a suspicious person and concerned in the robbery, I determined not to call him, as I found the fact proved without him; and if I thought I had conducted myself uncandidly, I should be very sorry, but when I have a case, full, complete and convincing, I am not obliged to call a witness to contradict the witnesses already produced, under the idea of promoting justice; and therefore I am to use my discretion whether I shall call a witness or not, whom I am suspicious of, when I have called those upon whom I can depend.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This being the case, it comes entirely upon us; he has been made their witness, and has been thought proper to contribute to the purposes of justice, and having made him their witness, now an idea has occurred to them, that he will after the case, that witness is withheld; I would therefore call him on the part of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Let him be called.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he at all present assisting in packing these things in the casks, or lowering them down? - A. He was not assisting either in packing the goods or lowering them down, he only brought the cart to carry them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell all this story to the Magistrate? - A. Yes; and a great deal more.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then you and Wilson agreed that these things should be carried away by this cart, and in consequence of that agreement, the cart was brought and the things put in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wilson know who they belonged to? - A. Yes; he knew they belonged to the Board of Ordnance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Wilson was there when you began to lower them? - A. Yes; before we finished packing them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys My Lord, the facts are different to what I supposed, I thought his evidence would have made Wilson out to be only a receiver.</p>

            That was not the lace she was bargaining for? - A. No; they were both on the counter at the time she was there, she had been looking at them; seeing her run to the door, and open it with her right-hand, I had suspicions; I ran from behind the counter and caught hold of her shoulders before she got out of the shop, I pushed her to the farther end of the shop; then I perceived her, with her left-hand, throw something away which was white; I returned to the door, and on the threshold, I picked up the remnant of lace, and on the step of the door, the cap.</p>
               <p>Q. When she threw away something with her left-hand was that in the direction to the door? - A. Yes; she threw it out as if she meant to throw it on the threshold; I talked to her, and was very much vexed; I detained her and had her committed; I took up the lace and the cap, I have kept it ever since; the lace is worth fifteen shillings, I gave that for it; the articles are both as good as when I bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time her hand was leaning on the place, did you perceive her taking any thing? - A. I saw it by her hand, I thought she was pregnant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive, by the motion of her hand, that she was taking any thing? - A. She was only leaning on her arm, there was nobody but her and me in the shop, it was between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, she gave no account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing about it by which you know it? - A. Yes, the quantity of it; I had cut some off that morning, I know it by the figure and the flower that leads from one to the other; I know the cap to be my property by the work, the spot, and the size, I bought it about three weeks ago, and pinned it up in the window.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the lockers of the Custom-house, in the warehouse of Mr. Cornish: On the 10th of November, the prisoner was at work there; I saw him with a candle in his hand, walking about the warehouse, between twelve and one o'clock at noon; he went to the further part of the warehouse, and there is a window next the alley, which he shut, among the casks of raw coffee; this raised a strong suspicion in my mind; he came backwards and forwards two or three times in the warehouse; that determined Mentor and me to rummage him as he came out; he slipt out of the door; Mentor followed him down the steps immediately; I stopped at the door; there are five steps down to the street; Mentor called, Cleaver, I want to speak to you; he turned short about, and said, what do you want with me; and then he brought him up the steps again; Mentor laid hold of him by the collar, and I rummaged him, and said, he had coffee about him; he said, he had none; in rummaging of him, I found he had coffee in his breeches, in a bag; he got in by me into the warehouse, and he pulled his hat off and threw some coffee out of his hat, and said, there is the property, what do you want with me further; I suppose his hat would hold two or three pounds; we went forward, and he pulled the bag out of his breeches, and shot the coffee close to the side of him, and threw the bag away over the casks; he said, now you have got all the property again, let me go about my business, you cannot hurt me now; an officer was sent for, and he was committed to his custody; the officer has the coffee.</p>

            , the wife, was standing then in the entry with Peach; I said, I have a warrant to search this house; I went through the bottom apartment, the kitchen I believe it is, but I soon returned; I then proceeded to go up stairs; the woman then, it might be the alarm of seeing four of us, just touched me with her hands; I followed up stairs, hearing Ferris say, here, here; I came up three pair of stairs to a garret door from the street door; the door appeared to have something which kept it fast at the bottom; Wray and Ferris being at the back of me, I did get in; I was shoved in by their force and my own; when I came in, I found the prisoner, the father, just half bent, or had got up, I don't know which, and from that I believed it might be his keeping the door; I saw no spar nor nothing against it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to open the door before you got in? - A. I did not; the father, son, and daughter, were in the room; I then acquainted them I had a warrant to search the house; with that a scuffle ensued between me and the father, and kept on, I dare say, for ten or twelve minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a scuffle was it that continued for ten minutes? - A. A fair fight between him and me; on the left hand there was a fire-place, with a fire made of coke, I believe it is, with an iron plate on it, with some round pieces of the size of shillings and sixpences; they got kicked off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the colour of those pieces on the plate? - A. They appeared white; after the three prisoners that were in the room were secured, on the right-hand side of the room I found this trough, with stuff, called black mould, or sand, in it, and this half mould on it, with these filed and round impressions complete in it; at that time, before it had been disturbed, it was all complete; by taking them to the different examinations, they were rubbed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The impressions were more perfect than they are now? - A. Yes; the round impressions were; on the floor, within about a yard where this trough was (producing the frame the other side of the mould,) was this laying; it his the mould; it laid with the mould apparently kicked or fell out, with this money lying by the side of it, (producing some shillings and sixpences;) these are, I believe, the pattern shillings and sixpences, with this half-crown; there are two sixpences that appear to have some of the mould or sand on them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. All this money you have now produced, are all of them good money, and you call them pattern shillings and sixpences? - A. Yes; this counterfeit half-crown (producing it,) I found in the rough, that is unfinished, among the coals, after we put the fire out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. By unfinished, you mean unfit for circulation? - A. Yes, it bears the date of 1745, with the word Lima, and I believe, from all the observations I could make, it might be cast from that good half-crown; in one corner of the room I found these, which I believe are called blue pots, filled, (producing them;) there are four of them; they are filled with grease and bits of cotton, or something of that sort; I have lit one of them to try, and they will burn like a torch or candle; they are used, I believe, for what they deem it smoaking the mould, to dry it, that it may make a very fine impression, otherwise it would be damp, and the impression would not be fine and clear; here is a bag, (producing it,) I found in the same room; I believe it has fine rotten-stone in it; the bag is shook, because the mould would not be so fine as this; it is done over any thing they wish to cast; here are three pair of tongs, (producing them;) the fire being exceeding hot, and the plates, when listed on and off, must be done with these tongs; these two pair, I believe, are to handle the blue pots that may have metal in them; here is a fine sieve,(producing it,) which, I believe, the mould is run through with the hand this way (describing it shoved about with the hand;) these two screws, when the metal is poured in the moulds, are to press down and make the two sides of the mould keep close together.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Pressing that together, the impression both on one side and the other is left? - A. Yes; here is a pot, (producing an iron pot,) with a quantity of fat in it; this was in the same room in the corner where the blue pots were; here are three odd frames for moulds, unfit for use; they have been broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare the impressions made upon the mould you first produced, with any of the silver produced? - A. No; I did not presume to do that, least I should break them, but in the face of this Court (the shillings were laid on the mould, and shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the condition of the prisoners' persons? - A. Yes; the men were then without their hats, in waistcoats, and slippers, with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300069"/>no buckles in them, and dirty hands; the girl was in a bed-gown; I know nothing of her hands; I never saw the mother in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the kind of dirt on their hands? - A. As if they had been handling the moulds; by my handling the stuff, my hands got like theirs.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Had these implements been apparently in use recently? - A. Yes, they had; I was by in the room while the things were found by the other officers, but have had them in my care locked up ever since.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Ward. I am an officer: I went with Armstrong and the other officers to the prisoner's house, on the 26th of October; I went up into the garret with Armstrong and Ferris; Armstrong got into the room first; I went in next to him; I observed three of the prisoners at the bar in the room very dirty and very black; the elderly man had a pair of very dirty trowsers on; his face, and hands and arms, were prodigiously black; I think, to the best of my knowledge, he had his shirt sleeves tucked up; he had no coat nor hat on; I immediately turned myself round upon the left hand, I saw a fire, and on that fire there was an iron plate covered apparently with base money; there was a great deal of what they called coke lying down by it; we endeavoured to secure the two men, and in doing that a scuffle ensued; I observed the girl then go to the fire, and kick up her foot against the iron plate on the fire; I went immediately and got hold of her, to keep her from going to the fire again; while Armstrong and Ferris were engaging with the men, the girl was very mischievous; I did not like to use any violence while I had hold of her to keep her from going to the fire; the son had got away from Ferris, and came and knocked me down; I got up again; he was coming the second time, and I knocked him down; he then was secured; I then went to the fire, and raked out some base money, which I have here; I believe here is one shilling and three sixpences, which are good; they had sell into the crevice of a brick by the fire; here is a base half-crown that was lying close to the fire on the cinders.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whether this which you say is a base half. crown, is fit for circulation? - A. I believe it is; here is another half-crown I took out of the fire; while the son knocked me down, the girl went to the fire immediately and kicked it very violent with her foot two or three times; we then secured the girl, and, with the tongs, I got this crucible out of the fire full of metal, just sit for pouring. (Producing it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Except that it was fit for pouring, it was in the state it is? - A. Yes; there had been something apparently broke in the fire; by the side of the fire upon the floor, there was a great deal of blanched copper; there had been a phial thrown in the fire; here is some more base money which I took out of the fire; there are four among them which appear to be patterns; we secured the prisoners, and they were taken to prison; I returned to the house in company with Armstrong, and Mrs. Simmons; we went back with her, there being a large fire, to see that all was safe; under one of the windows in the garret, apparently one of these moulds had been upset or kicked up; it was broke into pieces, into quarters; I picked up a piece, and on it were two King George the Second's shillings, both heads; Mrs. Simmons was then in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you clearly perceive the mark of 
               <persName id="t17961130-47-person435">

             the Second? - A. Very clearly indeed, they were very perfect; I found a bottle in the fire; there had been a half-pint phial thrown in the fire, which had had something in it, but I could not tell what; the ashes were wet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You say in the part of the mould you could clearly distinguish the two heads of

               <p>Q. This was not at the first search? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. None of the shillings now produced answer to that mark? - A. I did not find any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a half-crown? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any impression in any mould that answered to the half-crown? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the use of it? - A. I cannot speak to the use they make of it; I then waited with the prisoner, Sarah Simmons, in the same room till the other officers came down with the other prisoners.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Ward. I went with Armstrong, and the rest of them, to the house of the prisoners at the bar; I went up stairs first, when I got up to the garret-door, I looked under the door, and there I saw the father and son on one side of the room where the flask was, the daughter was near the fire very busy there; I called out, here, come up here; directly comes Armstrong and Wray, and then the father and son got right up against the door, I tried to push it open with my staff and could not get it open; then us three pushed against it, and Armstrong got in first; then I caught hold of the son, and Armstrong hold of the father, we were going to handcuff them, and got the hand-cuffs part of the way round the hands; directly they parted, and begun a scuffle; I threw the son down and I fell upon him, he turned me over some how, and got up first, then he ran towards the fire-place and struck Wray; then I got hold of him again, and got him up into the other corner, and there I knocked him down; then he said, he would not make any more resistance, and Armstrong at that time had knocked the father down; we helped him up, and then we handcuffed them together; in the scuffle, some how, one of the moulds was kicked up; when we first went in, the mould that was kicked up had shillings and sixpences upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of perceiving that clearly? - A. I had; then we went to the fire-place, for, in the mean time, the daughter had kicked up all the money on the plate into the fire, I tied her with a handkerchief to the father; then I begun to get what I could out of the fire of the money, it was all, apparently, white before it was kicked into the fire; we searched about the room, and found the things that are produced; this is the plate that had the money on when it was on the fire; there were several other plates in the room, but not on the fire; (producing them); here is a pan, it was almost full of liquor, I don't know what it was that was kicked down; here is a pair of shears that were found in the room; I found some money; (produces it); there is one, I believe, a good shilling, and one a bad one, I found them all about the fire-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any counterfeit shillings fit for circulation? - A. I don't think there is one fit for circulation; here is a Queen Ann that is a counterfeit; here are many different sorts of bad shillings which were all on the plate, on the fire, when I first went into the room, they appeared very white then.</p>

               <p>Q. From your knowledge and experience in these things, and looking at all the implements and things now produced, do the whole make a complete set of instruments and apparatus for casting coin fit for circulation? - A. I should believe so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. With respect to the wife, you have told us she never was up stairs? - A. I never saw her there.</p>
               <p>Q. She never had any communication with any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300071"/>body up stairs? - A. Not to my knowledge, if she had, I must have seen it.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it not as big as the palm of your hand? - A. Yes; much larger than half-a-crown.</p>
               <p>Q. That is surrounded by what you call the impression of shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in the other part, any impression that answered to a half-crown? - A. I could not see any.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you knew the business this man was of? - A. No; I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know he was a buckle-caster? - A. No; I saw in one window, which was dusty, seven or eight rims, without tongues or chapes; I saw no moulds or impressions, or any thing like it, that induced me to think he was casting rims for buckles.</p>

               <p>Q. I asked you whether you have any reason from any thing you did see, to know what was his business? - A. I saw rims, from six to eight.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was a buckle-caster, or caster of any thing, were not every one of those things, except the mould, calculated for that business? - A. I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. In answer to a question, whether that was a complete apparatus for coining, you said, yes? - A. I said, I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not aqua-fortis used? - A. There is a pickle used.</p>
               <p>Q. Of that you found none? - A. There was some wet on the floor, but I don't know what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not rubbing necessary, with cork? - A. I never did find cork at any place where there was casting.</p>
               <p>Q. You found none here? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not, to your knowledge, think that necessary? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is a file necessary for filing that that is cast all round? - A. I don't know, I found none.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ever find any file when you have apprehended other coiners? - A. I never took but one before, where there was casting.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all your knowledge is acquired since you took these people up? - A. Yes; I never saw the same apparatus before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand that those shears are sufficient to cut a piece of metal round and perfect? - A. I suppose the spray is cut off by these shears.</p>
               <p>Q. (Shewing him the base half-crown). Could a pair of shears cut that base half-crown as round, as smooth, and as polished as that good one is now? - A. I believe, after the spray is cut off, it is rubbed on the edge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how it is rubbed? - A. I have seen other money rubbed on a thin board; I have seen in some places, rounding engines, and in other places, boards, on which they are rubbed; I saw a piece of sack nailed or laid down on the ground, so wet with the liquid, that I could not form an idea of the use of it.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no rounding engine or board found here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a reward upon the conviction of coiners? - A. I have had the share of a reward.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that? - A. The share of forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. Would rubbing it in soft sand on a board make it complete for circulation? - A. I should believe it would.</p>
               <p>Q.With respect to this mould, I understand when you saw it first, you saw some patterns lying upon it? - A. No, Ferris saw that; I only saw some lying by the side.</p>
               <p>Q. JOHN NICHOL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am one of the Moniers of the Mint.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this money, and the other shillings produced by Armstrong, as patterns, are they good? - A. I don't see any bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these four half-crowns, and say which of them are good, and which are bad? - A. There are three bad and one good.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that is in such a state as to be fit for circulation? - A. I have no doubt of it, I should take it myself without particularly observing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round the edge, and say if any part is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300072"/>more unfinished than the rest, is there any projection that feels rough to the hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that have remained there if a file had been used to it? - A. Very probably a file would leave a rougher mark than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those shillings? - A. Here are three bad and two good.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. The half-crown is such, that skilled as you are, you should have taken it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Do you think that is an apparatus sufficient for coining? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Might those shillings have been cast in that mould? - A. I think it possible.</p>
               <p>The prisoners all left their defences to their Counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. (To Wray). Q. Did you observe when you were in the room, some silver laying upon the surface of the moulds? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that any of those pieces were shillings, sixpences, or half-crowns? - A. They seemed to be some of all, shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say that they appeared to be shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns, you are positive in that? - A. I am, it did appear to me so.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Armstrong). Q. You produced the mould where the vacancy is, did you ever see the part that was to be on that place, in a perfect state? - A. No; it was kicked up.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Wray). Q. Did you see the part that was to be put in that vacancy in the mould, in such a state so as to know what it was? - A. I picked up a part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether there was any impression upon that part, of a half-crown? - A. There was not, that I could see, there were shillings on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any vacancy on the mould, where the impression of a half-crown might have been? - A. I could not perceive it, for a great deal of it was trod upon to pieces</p>

             sworn. - On Friday evening, the 28th of October, the prisoner stole a side of bacon from my door, I saw him pass the window; I was behind the counter, I saw him carry the bacon by; I desired the man to go out, that there was a side of bacon gone from the door, he pursued him about six doors, I followed; he laid hold of the bacon, and I pursued the man through several courts into Cursitor-street, I cried "stop thief," and Walker, the witness, secured him before I came up to him; he was sent to the watch-house, and then conveyed to the Compter.</p>

               <p> - WALKER sworn. - On Friday, the 28th of October, I was coming up Cursitor-street, about five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner rushed out of the court by the stone-mason's; as soon as I saw the prisoner come out of the court, I saw the prosecutor crying stop thief; I pursued the prisoner, he took Craven-head-court and got into White's-alley; when he got to the top of the alley, he turned round and struck me a blow under the right-ear; I then knocked him down, and kneeled on him till the prosecutor came up; he said, he had stole a stitch of bacon; he made a strong resistance, we could hardly take him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going up Fetter-lane, there was a cry of stop thief, I ran as well as other people, and when I came near Chancery-lane, they stopped me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300073"/>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

Yes; I followed her, and took hold of her, and asked her what the wanted in the parlour; she told me she had got songs to fell, she had a basket; I asked her to come back with me, and she swore she had got nothing belonging to me, though I had not charged her with any thing; and, as she spoke those words, the wind blew her cloak back, and I saw the muslin; I told her that belonged to my mistress; then she dropped the great coat my master has on now, and the muslin, at my feet; I kept hold of her and took them up; my master came, and took her into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Does the mark prove it to be your's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. A tire-smith and coach-spring maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had been any where else, you would not have known it was your's? - A. No, most affuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the passage you had this conversa<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300076"/>tion with him? - A. Yes; the passage to the shop, not of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I came back to ask my master for a few shillings; as I came in, I kicked my foot against this iron; I was going to take it up, and my master laid hold of me, which surprized me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said he was tying up his breeches, what do you mean by that? - A. I suppose he took it out of his breeches, and put it in his apron, it is only supposition.</p>

            : Sometime previous to the 17th of November, I discovered at several times, sugar taken out of hogsheads; I had reason to suppose it must be done by some of the labourers employed in the warehouses; at half after four o'clock, on Thursday, the 17th of November, I had left off work in the coffee-warehouse, the Excise-officers were gone; it getting a little dark, I thought it a good opportunity to see if I could discover any body; I went up into the upper story of the warehouse, there is a hole into the lower stories of the warehouse, by which I might discover if any body was among the sugar, for nobody had any business there at that time; I waited ten minutes, at the expiration of that time, I heard somebody as if in the act of climbing up out of the lower warehouse, I waited, and after a minute, or thereabouts, I perceived it was the prisoner, who had been at work in the day among the coffee; when he came up to me, and I saw who it was, I asked him what he was doing there, knowing he had no business there, he said, he was looking for a few hoop sticks to take home to light his fire, and hoped there was no harm in it; I told him he could not think I could believe what he said was true, that he must be after something else; he said it was true, he was after nothing else, nor had he ever taken any thing out of the warehouse; I desired him to walk down stairs, I followed him close out of that warehouse into the next warehouse, on the same floor, and there I found some other of the men who had finished their work, and just shutting the door, I thought it a good opportunity to search him, I called him back, and asked him what he had got, he came back, and said, I was welcome to search him, for he had got nothing; I felt on each side, where I thought his pockets were, then I felt behind, and then before, and under his smock frock before, between his things; I found this bag of sugar under his frock, he then began to beg for mercy, and hoped I would pardon him, he never had done any thing before, and hoped I would excuse him; I told him I could not do it, and in consequence of it, had him taken up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was there any sugar in the warehouse where you stopped me? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any sugar in the way leading to it? - A. The way he might come there was sugar scattered.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see me in the sugar-warehouse? - A. The sugar-warehouse was locked up.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are these persons answerable for the goods stowed in the warehouse? - A. Yes; if any are missing, they are obliged to pay for them.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the sugar on this man? - A. Yes; I was going to leave work, it was nigh five o'clock; I went to the garret, this man passed me by the middling loop hole, I saw nothing upon him; Marshall came after him, and said, come back, let me search you, the prisoner came back, and said, you may search me, you are very welcome, for I have got nothing about me; Mr. Marshall searched his pockets and found nothing; he searched him in the front, and under his smock-frock he found a bag of sugar, fastened some how round his middle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been working that day in the warehouse, till three in the afternoon; Mr. Marshall then ordered me to go down to the wharf, where we landed some whale-bone, the master ordered us to the warehouse; going to the warehouse, I stopped to make water, and found this bag of sugar lying by the post where I stopped, I took it up and carried it to the warehouse, they were loading some rice, I asked if they wanted any assistance, they said, no; I went to get some hoop-sticks; as I found this sugar in the street, I was going to take it home, I thought I had a right to it; I saw Mr. Marshall in the warehouse; he asked me what I was doing, I said I was getting some hoop-sticks; he called me, and said he must search me, I said he was very welcome, as I had no property belonging to him, as I conceived the sugar I found was my own property.</p>

               <p>GABRIEL FERRY sworn. - I am night beadle of the Hamlet of Ratcliffe: Last Thursday morning, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming up the Butcher-row, near Ratcliffe, with a sack upon his back; I asked him what he had got there; he eased it off his shoulders on the payement, and seemed in great agitation of mind, and at a loss for an answer; I told him it was my duty to see what he had; after a little time the sack was opened, and he said, well then, hang me for a little small beer; I said, his agitation of mind, and evasive answer, made it necessary for me to stop him; in the sack was a pin, which contained four gallons of two-penny; it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find to whom it belonged? - A. The prosecutor heard, before I was up in the morning, that I had taken a man with a pin belonging to him.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MYER sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Crotchrade Whissing, <rs id="t17961130-59-viclabel317" type="occupation">brewer</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you miss such property? - A. From the number we have in the brewhouse it is impossible to tell exactly; the prisoner was directed to attend the brewhouse, as watchman, that night, they do it in turn when there is not a regular watchman; we had not a regular watchman at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has that man been with you? - A. Three years; he had a very good character, we had not the least suspicion of him; we have lost the liquor out of the cask carrying it backwards and forwards.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. This cask I found just by the brewhouse, between two and three in the morning, going home from my work; I met the constable of the might and he stopped me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear that to be your master's property? - A. Yes; it was lying upon the counter loose, she was near enough to reach it; we had shewn it to a person in the course of the day, and left it there; it was the only bit we had at a shilling a yard in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner been in that situation with you? - A. I believe eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. You had placed a considerable considence in him? - A. Very great.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ a person of the name of Keene as your currier? - A. I did; he is the son of a Mr. John Keene, who had had our business many years back; he was employed soon after the death of his father.</p>
               <p>Q. The basil skins, the subject matter of this indictment, had they occasion to be sent to your curriers? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose are those basils used? - A. For covering a particular kind of tin-box called, by the Officers of Ordnance, magazine boxes, that is the only purpose for which they are used by us; they are used by other people for caps.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. They were the property of the partnership? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. From some intelligence that you had lost some skins, you were led to Mr. Graves's? - A. Yes; he is a leatherseller on Fish-street-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any skins? - A. I never found the skins; I found there had been a sale there of skins of that quality.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Has it never happened that when basil skins have become mouldy, or are injured, that they have been sent to the curriers to be put in a proper state? - A. I cannot say that; a currier cannot do them any good if they are damaged very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Keene was your currier? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To the time of this information, whether you had not the best opinion of the prisoner? - A. Certainly; he had our full confidence, a general good character.</p>

            Keene is to be called as a witness-do you give him a good character? - A. I certainly thought well of him, or I should not have employed him.</p>

               <p>Q. He was admitted a King's evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You appeared before the Magistrate to prosecute Keene? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. It was in consequence of Keene's evidence that you were enabled to lay hold of any facts against Davidson? - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. If the skins are mildewed, you can brush it off, and would not lend them to the currier? - A. No, I should not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr. Esdaile).

            Before the examination was taken down, had not you, in the presence of a Mr. Wyatt, promised to the prisoner, that if he would tell you the truth, you would not appear against him? - A. I certainly said something of that sort; I told him I had a suspicion he had sent some hides from my house improperly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you promise him say at he confessed the transaction? - A. I certainly and, and sent him about his business.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That promise was not relative to the present subject of enquiry? - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300082"/>Q. Did you, when you promised him favour, specify any particular charge against him? - A. I did; I said, he had sent hides of mine to Leadenhall to be re-sold, this was on Thursday the 27th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you promise him that favour? - A. Upon suspecting Keene of having sent some hides to Leadenhall-market; I went with another person to Keene's, and charged him with the fact, which he denied, and afterwards confessed, I then said, he must have an accomplice, he said, he had an accomplice, who was it? he said, it was Davidson; I said, he must go with me to my house; Mr. Wyatt and the witness and I went to my house; I sent for Davidson, and told him I had information that he had sent some hides improperly from my house, he denied it; I said, he had better confess it, as I had sufficient proof of it; he solemnly denied knowing any thing of it; I produced Keene to him, and then he acknowledged it, and begged for mercy; I took one to one side of the house, and the other to the other and dismissed them, and hoped I should never see them more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It appears from what this gentleman has said, that he promised him favour if he would discover the transaction.</p>
               <p>Court. I have taken it thus, that he made a promise of favour if he made a discovery of a transaction respecting some hides.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Esdaile, in that conversation, charged him with delivering hides to the currier, and promised him, that if he related the truth of the transaction he would be kind to him. The charge here, is delivering hides to the currier.</p>
               <p>Court. The indictment is for basil skins.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Basil skins are hides.</p>
               <p>Mr. Esdaile. No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Court. This circumstance, of the basil skins, was not known nor Heard of at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Esdaile. It was respecting the hides, they both protested they knew of no transaction besides.(Mr. Colquhoun then read the minutes from his book of the examination.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Mr. Esdaile.) Q. Did not you see Davidson the night before the examination? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning, before the examination, did not you say you would admit him King's evidence? - A. No; I had no communication with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Mr. Colquhoun.) Q. Was there any examination taken down at the prisoner's final examination? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Lord, the evidence against the prisoner is that of an accomplice perfectly unconfirmed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, the evidence of the accomplice not being confirmed, you must acquit the prisoner. <rs id="t17961130-61-verdict330" type="verdictDescription">
