I gave her some silver to get something to eat; it was getting late, and both she and Phillips persuaded me to lay down till towards the morning; accordingly I did, I soon went to sleep, and I awoke in the course of a little time; I found the prisoner was gone.</p>

On the 22nd of December, between three and four o'clock, I was up stairs at dinner; the young man in the shop came up to me and said, that a man in the shop had stole some goods from off the counter. I went down stairs, I turned the prisoner round, put my hand in his pocket, and took out a parcel containing the brass pulleys. I took him into the counting-house, left him in the custody of my brother, and turned the key upon him. He let fall the brass nobs from his other pocket while I was sending for a constable.</p>

             came up and asked me what was the matter, I told him I wanted to have nothing to say to him; the woman kept pulling me about all the time, I told her I would charge the watchman with her; the prisoner said he would shew me the watch-house. I walked on a little distance, he took me into a small passage called London house yard, the north side of St. Paul's church yard; he said here is a watchhouse, he collared me directly, and held me till the woman took the money out of my right hand side breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She followed you all the way from Fleet street up to St. Paul's church yard. - A. Yes, both of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had passed some watchman surely before that. - A. No, we had not, there was nobody walking at all. He held me by the collar while she took the money out of my pocket, and then he held me till she got away; he shook me about all the time. When she was out of sight he knocked me down, and directly tried to make his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make his escape. - A. No sir, he did not; just as he got up the passage the patrol seized him immediately, I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose. - A. Nineteen and sixpence; a seven shilling piece, and the rest in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the woman again. - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was going to goal he saw a woman, he said that was the woman; he did not take her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I thought it was the woman, and when I looked her in the face I saw it was not the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was another man took in the watchhouse with me; he let that man go away, and kept me.</p>
               <p>- MACARTY. I am a watchman in Castle-baynard ward. On the 30th of December, about two in the morning, going my round, the patrol came up to me and asked me if all was well, I told him all was well; in about a minute or two we heard a scuffle just at the entering into London-house yard, Pater-noster row. We heard a voice say, take off from me, let me go, or I will give charge of you; the patrol ran immediately towards the place, I followed him, and as the prisoner was going out of the passage the patrol seized him. As soon as the patrol seized him, he said, Macarty, you lay hold of him, and I will go and see what is the matter, where the rest are; he catched hold of another young chap that was there. Shepherd was getting up, Shepherd said he was knocked down and robbed. I saw Shepherd coming towards him without a hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say by whom he was robbed. - A. As soon as Sepherd came up to the prisoner, he said, this is the man who held me while the woman robbed me; he held him till the woman got out of sight, and then he knocked him down; we took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say. - A. The prisoner said that he was robbed in Fleet street, and he wanted his assistance; after that he said that he knew the woman, and if we would let him go, he would procure the woman and get the money back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the other man brought into the watch-house. - A. Yes, he was there, but the prosecutor said he had done nothing, he had no charge against him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says very false indeed; when I was in the watchhouse there was another prisoner there, a lamplighter, they turned him out of the watch-house, they mentioned his name, and they said they knew his father.</p>
               <p>- FITZGERALD. I am a patrol. Going along I heard a noise, I paid attention for a minute, I heard words pass, 'let me go, or I'll give charge of you.' I ran over directly, and in the passage I met the prisoner, I secured him, I called my partner to hold him till I found the others; I saw Shepherd without a hat, he was standing on his legs when I came up to him, I took the other lad, he was standing along with Shepherd; I asked Shepherd what was the matter, he said that man that has gone up the passage has held me while a woman robbed me, and had knocked him down. I desired Macarty to bring his man, which is the prisoner; he said he was the man that held him while the woman robbed him. Going along to the watchhouse the prisoner said, if you will let me go I know the woman, and I will bring back the money to the lad; I told him I would not let him go. In the watchhouse I asked Shepherd whether the young man struck him, he said no; I said, then you do not mean to give charge of him, he said no. I turned him about his business. The young lad called me by my name and told me who his father was; I knew his father, but the lad I did not. The father has lighted our ward about four or five years ago.</p>

               <p>Q. What did this boy do. - A. He seeing the scuffle, came and asked me what was the matter, he never gave me any offence, he only helped to pick me up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Westminster, I had been to sell a horse, it was late when I took it, the man said he would not buy it without he had a trial of it; with that I came along Fleet street, and that gentleman said he was robbed by the woman, and if she did not give him the money he would give charge of her; we came along, and the lamplighter too, he knocked the woman down, the woman got up, held her patten up, and knocked his hat off. I never saw the woman before in my life.</p>

Last Monday evening, between five and six o'clock, I stopped the prisoner in Cornhill, he had a bag on his back, I asked him what he had there, he told me it did not concern me; I told him I was an officer, I would know; he told me he had iron, he was going to Drury lane, he was a farrier; he said he had brought it from Whitechapel, but where he would not tell me; I told him if he did not choose to give me a proper answer, I should take him to the Counter; he told me he lived in Cross street, Holborn; if I wanted to enquire about him I must go to Hackney. I took him before the lord-mayor, he sent for his master, he came and said he stole the iron.</p>

               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This indictment charges the prisoner's with a capital offence; the first count charges them with a burglary in Mr. Spencer's house; and the second count charges them with assaulting and robbing Mr. Spencer's son.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, On the evening mentioned in the indictment, the servant heard a knock at the door, and on her opening the door, I think four persons rushed into the house, and immediately a pistol was presented to her; they had masks upon their faces, or were disguised; and upon hearing the noise young Mr. Spencer came out, and during the time he was engaged with them he received a violent blow, in which his hat was knocked off: the maid servant ran into a room where her mistress was sitting, and escaped out of the back window. Two persons followed; who knocked down Mrs. Spencer; others entered into another room, in which Mr. Spencer was sitting by the fire side, one of them presented a pistol to him, and the keys were demanded of the bureau, in which the money was deposited.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, There would be some difficulty in identifying the persons of all the prisoner by the persons who where in the house; the maid servant saw them but a short time, and therefore was able to make but little observation: I believe she will not be able to speak to the persons of any of them. Mrs. Spencer, Mr. Spencer, and young Mr. Spencer, they had a longer opportunity of seeing them; you will find some of them, speaking to one, and some to two of them, and I believe some speaking to the best of their belief that the prisoners at the bar were the four persons that were engaged in this nefarious transaction.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The servant that escaped out of the window ran to a public house, and before the robbers had escaped, a number of persons assembled about the house, but seeing six men armed with pistols and one with a crow, were afraid of attacking them; they did come out of the house, brandished their pistols and went off. I told you that young Mr. Spencer had his hat knocked off, and that hat was lost, and instead of that hat another hat with something of oilskin was left in the house, which belonged to one of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Information was sent to the police office, Hatton Garden, and the police officers were sent out to discover who were the perpetrators of this dreadful plot. On Monday evening, four days afterwards, they apprehended the four prisoners at the bar, together with a man of the name of Roberts, who was apprehended first, at a public house called the Blue Boar, Whitechapel: and on their being searched, such things were found, which demonstrates what sort of persons they were pistols and masks were found upon some of them: the lodgings of Harvey was searched, a mask was found there; there was found on the prisoner Bridge, Mr. Spencer's hat. On the person of Fordham there was a pistol found, and on Roberts there was another pistol found that matched with the pistol found on Fordham.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, After they were all taken into custody, it was thought prudent for the purpose of attaining as much justice as possible, to admit one person as witness against the rest; and Roberts was willing to disclose what he knew. On searching the person of Bridge they found the duplicate of a coat, which coat will be proved to you to belong to the servant in the house; therefore you can have no doubt respecting his person.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, You will have the evidence of the accomplice, and you will receive it with all caution as from a bad man, thus spared from standing at that bar but; weighing his evidence with all that caution, you will see whether you can entertain any doubt of the truth of his testimony. He will state to you where he found the four prisoners, he will describe the manner the robbery was committed, the part he took in it, and the manner in which they made their escape. All this evidence will be confirmed in so many circumstances by the belief of the prosecutor and the other witnesses, as to the identity of the prisoners, so that you will not be able to entertain the smallest doubt as to their guilt.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the house in the high road. - A. No, it is in what they call South street, Ponder's End.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the road leading to the river Lea. - A. It leads to a river, I do not know the name of the river.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140006"/> Q. On the evening of Thursday the 18th of December, did you hear a knock at the door. - A. I heard a knock at the door, a sharpish knock, about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had it been dark. - A. About an hour and a half, or more. On this sharpish knock I opened the door, and there was a tall person rushed upon me with a disguised face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. State what you mean by a disguised face. - A. It was a black face, but whether it was a mask of a black face I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his dress at all. - A. A dark dress.</p>
               <p>A. Had he any thing in his hand. - A. A pistol, he was a stout man, and to the best of my belief he had a dark great coat buttoned down him.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether it was a blue or a brown. - A. I cannot say, by candle light I could not tell the colour, he had a pistol in his hand, he presented the pistol to my face, as soon as I opened the door, my young master Mr. Spencer came up in my defence; with that the man left me, and presented the pistol to his face.</p>
               <p>Q. While he was doing this did any person come to the door. - A. There was a second, I saw no more, the second was close by the first.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was the second. - A. A lower man than the first, he appeared very dark and dismal.</p>
               <p>Q. By a lower man I suppose you mean a shorter man. - A. A shorter man, he had a dark and dismal look.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether his face was black you do not know. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. All his appearence except his face was dark. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether he had a great coat on. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand that you saw. - A. I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say. - A. Not any thing to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe what you saw next after the tall man left you, and presented the pistol to your young master. - A. I ran up stairs, threw up the sash, and jumped out of the window, and went over some pales to a neighbour's, a public house, and gave an alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave the alarm, did you return to the house. - A. I did not. I saw no more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners at the bar, and tell me whether you have any recollection of the persons of any of them. - A. I cannot say more than his being a tall stout man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any man there that appears to you to be the size of the first man that rushed in. - A. Fordham seems to be the size of the man that first came in.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned they were gone. - A. All was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that any of your property was stolen. - A. Yes, a watch, a great coat, and a purse with three sixpences, two shillings and a half crown piece; they are my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to Fordham you said that he was more of the size of the first man. - A. Yes, he seems to be more of the size than any one of them men.</p>

            . - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at your father's house on this night of the 18th of December. - A. I was; I heard a knock, the servant opened the door, I heard a noise of several men; I got up from the fire side and went towards them. I thought there were some drunken men that came into the house; as soon as I got to the kitchen door, one of them presented a pistol to my head.</p>
               <p>Q. A man. - A. Yes, he had either a mask on or his face was black; he was a very tall man with a dark brown coat, he said if I offered to stir or maked the least noise he would blow my brains out. At that time there was another came up to me with an iron crow, that we found in the house afterwards; he also said he would knock my brains out if I offered to stir.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the dress of that man with the iron crow. - A. He looked very dark, his face was disguised; I rather thought with black crape. I did not take particular notice of his dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a stout or a thin man. - A. He was a stoutish man, but not so tall as the man that presented the pistol to me; he was not particulary stout.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more than these two. - A. Not at that time I did not; then they asked for my money and my watch.</p>
               <p>Court. The men that you have spoken of. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you give them your watch and your money. - A. I told them that I never wore a watch, I told them I would give them all the money that I had in my pocket, that was a shilling and sixpence; that was all that I had got in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. To whom did you give the shilling and the sixpence to. - A. I rather think it was to the shortest of the two, but I am not certain; they were very dissatisfied with the sixpence and the shilling that I had given them. They said they would blow my brains out; after that they left me. I saw them go to my father, and a little time after that, I saw one of them bring my mother out of the parlour.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was that one of these men. - A. No, I think it was another man, I saw four of them then.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was your mother in. - A. In the parlour; my father was in the kitchen, and I was in the kitchen at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw four in the house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe the dress of the other men at all. - A. Yes, there was one in a blue jacket and blue trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the one that brought your mother out of the parlour. - A. I rather think it was, but I am not sure. After they had been with my father, my father begged that they would not hurt him, he would give them the keys of the bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of them been saying any thing to your father to induce him to say that. - A. I believe they had, but I did not hear it; he gave them the key of the bureau. Three of them went up stairs, and one kept at the kitchen door with a pistol to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140007"/> keep us in, threatening to shoot us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mother in the kitchen. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the man that stood at the kitchen door threatening to shoot you. - A. It was the tall man.</p>
               <p>Q. That you first spoke of. - A. Yes, the tall man, he has very much the appearance of that man in the red waistcoat (pointing to Fordham); the three men came down stairs to ask my father for the keys that belonged to the two up stair drawers: I then got up and threw my hands right in the man's face that stood at the door, I struck at him to get my way out. As soon as I did that, I sprung the lock of the door, got out of door, and then there were at the door when I got out, two or three men; I cannot say which were about me, I cannot say whether these two or three men were outside or at the door, or whether they had come from the fire side after they had been talking with my father.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a scuffle with them. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that scuffle did you lose any thing. - A. Yes, they knocked off my hat, they gave me a black eye; luckily I had a great coat on, one of them had hold of the flap of my coat, it tore off, and I got away from him and run away. One of the men ran after me that tore my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more. - A. No, I saw some of my neighbours, and one of them caught hold of the man that pursued me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop to see whether he kept hold of him. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On your return they were all gone. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you return when you found your neighbours were there. - A. No, it was dark, I could not see then, they were my neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since seen any of the persons, look round and see whether you see any of the persons here, that in your judgement, you believe was concerned in this transaction. - A. Yes, that man in the red waistcoat, is very much the appearance of that man that stood at the door (Fordham), and likewise the man whith one hand, (that is Bridge); that man I looked at for about two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the transaction was he engaged in. - A. I cannot say, he never came to me, I looked at his face, he had no mask on.</p>
               <p>Court. The man with one hand had no mask, you looked at him for about two minutes; do you believe the prisoner Bridge to be that man. - A. I do, to the best of my knowledge he did nothing particular as I saw in the transaction, I only saw him in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he dressed in. - A. In a blue jacket and blue trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you saw the prisoner Bridge at the office, did you recognize him by knowing any thing about his face. - A. By his whiskers being carrotty.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he bear any thing of that mark now. - A. The only difference is, the whiskers are not so long.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean they have been shaved off. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You observed the man with one hand had carrotty whiskers when you saw him at the office. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By whiskers, you mean the beard by the side of his face, you do not mean his whiskers on his lip. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak to either of the other prisoners. - A. No, before I made my effort to make my escape, I thought I heard the pistol snap from the man at the door. They still kept threatening every minute that they would blow our brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing at the kitchen door, or was he within the kitchen. - A. Sometimes he was within the door, and sometimes at the door; he would come within and threaten us.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the pistol snapping. - A. I thought I heard the noise, and saw the fire of the flint.</p>

               <p>Q. Where you sitting by your kitchen fire at the time that you heard the knock at the door. - A. I was, they rushed in before I could get up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come into the kitchen to you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many came in first. - A. Two apparently, a tall man with a black face, and one that was not quite so tall; I believe he had got a crape on his face, and both their coats were dark, they came up to me, and the tall man presented a pistol, and said, if I spoke a word they would blow my brains out. I begged him not to use me ill, I put my hand into my pocket, and gave him the key of the bureau.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave them the key of the bureau, did any of them leave you. - A. Yes, they took the key and went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more than these two men. - A. Yes, I saw four.</p>
               <p>Q. How many went up to your bureau. - A. Two or three, I do not know which; one man stood to guard me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that man that guarded you armed or unarmed. - A. He had a pistol, he said if I looked up to him he would blow my brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was that that staid to guard you. - A. He was a tall man.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that the man with his face black that you spoke of before. - A. Yes, it was; I believe he snapped the pistol at me twice, at last I heard it. He told the others to go up and get what they could, and he said he would guard us that we should not come out of the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did any of the men come down. - A. Yes, two afterwards came and demanded the keys of the two drawers, that they could not open. My wife was present, they threatened that they would blow my brains out, if I did not deliver them immediately. I begged of her to give them her keys, she gave them the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do after that. - A. That was the time my son struck the tall man and made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it while your wife was delivering the keys your son struck the tall man and got away. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

            That was when there were three in the kitchen. - A. As soon as my son got out I went to the door, there were three men that were jamed at the house door to keep me in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140008"/> Q. What became of the man that your son struck. - A. He ran after my son; I followed him, two of them throwed me down on the outside against some milk pans, which bruised me; I throwed one of them down, and another I got down by the throat. I was afraid that some of them would come up; I got up and ran away towards the mills.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Spencer, look at the prisoners at the bar, and tell me whether you believe any of them to be the persons that robbed you. - A. I think the person with the red waistcoat was the person that guarded us (Fordham).</p>
               <p>Q. The man who first presented the pistol to you, he was the man who afterwards guarded you while the others went up stairs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak with any certainty or belief with respect to any of the others. - A. There were those two; the carroty one that is nearest me, and the other with the pale face.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you able to speak to the other. - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you certain that he was one, or do you only believe it. - A. I do not like to swear positively, he looks like one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Bridge one that you saw in the house, or was he one of the persons that you had the scuffle with at the door. - A. He was in the house, he was one that came in and asked for the keys; there were two that came in and asked for the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak with any certainty or belief with respect to the persons that you scuffled with at the door. - A. No, I fought my way through to get out,</p>

               <p>Q. Did any persons go with you out of the house. - A. Yes, several other persons that were in the house with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you come near the house, did you see any person come out of the house. - A. I saw Mr. Spencer junior running out; I was not sure at the time who it was, it was either father or son, I will not say which. A man was running after him, reaching his left hand after him, to catch hold of him; he had a pistol in his right hand, he tried to catch him with his left.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular about that man's face. - A. His face was disguised, it was either blacked or a dark crape upon it, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. What sized man was he. - A. He was a tall stout man. I immediately held the man by the left side of his coat, and he immediately turned the pistol into my face; I waved my head backwards and forwards. I stood in that position some time, expecting the pistol to go off, and finding myself unsupported by the people behind me, I drew from him; I begged of him not to fire, saying that my life would be of no use to him. I let go, and the man run away down the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoners at the bar, and tell me whether any of them resembles the man that you laid hold of. - A. Fordham is the man most likely to be him by the size, he did not speak so then as he does now; that I cannot recollect him by his voice, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140009"/> appeared to be as near the size as can be. He had a dark great coat on, and hanging loose as mine is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other person escape from the house. - A. No, my whole attention was paid to him, he had leather gaiters on; I think they were over his knees. That is all I can say of him.</p>

            , in Essex street, Whitechapel. - A. I apprehended some before that. On the morning of the 22nd of December, I received information; I went with my brother officers to the Blue Boar, Aldgate, commonly called Whitechapel, where the person who is to be admitted as an evidence was apprehended; my brother officer apprehended him, after that I went to an house in Hackney Road, near Shoreditch church; at a small cook's shop, where I understood Harvey lodged. I saw the prisoner Harvey sitting reading some book, or paper, with the landlord of the house, in the back room adjoining the shop. I left my brother officer out side of the house; I beckoned the landlord of the house out, and in consequence of that, I beckoned to my brother officer, he came in, and from the denial that was made, I insisted upon searching the house. I left my brother officer with Harvey; I went up stairs, and in a bag among other things, I found this dark coloured coat, and this mask. The coat is very muddy, it appears to be country dirt; it was wet at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it as if it had been rained upon. - A. It was as if it had been rained upon; I called out to my brother officer, and said take care of the man; that is the man; he had a handkerchief tied round his face, having a black eye.</p>
               <p>Q. Which eye was it. - A. I will not be positive whether it was the right or left, he said his name was not Harvey.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ask him. - A. I asked him whether his name was not Harvey, he said it was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you ask him whether that was his lodgings that you searched. - A. He said he slept there, but another man lodged there; the landlord said that man was a smith that lodged there. After that he said his name was Harvey; he said master I used to bring coals to your house, when you lived in the country, but I believe I shall never bring you any more. I then put him in the coach, and went to Fordham's lodgings in Bethnal Green, at the sign of the Peacock; I enquired for the person, I was denied; I would go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Fordham at home. - A. I did, at the Peacock, laying on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this. - A. Sometime in the afternoon; he was laying on the bed without his coat, shoes or hat; he had all his clothes on but them. I entered the room, and when I saw him, I knew him, I had known him from a child; I told him what I wanted, and we were officers, and were come to take him; he seemed to be very restless; I said if you attempt to be in any way, in which I think you are in, I will blow your brains out; I then called my brother officers to search the coat, that was laying upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found - A. A pistol was found, I believe by my brother officer; I afterwards saw it. My particular attention was directed to him, seeing him so restless. I found a pair of bullet moulds in the same room; he was handcuffed, and after he was handcuffed, he threw himself down stairs, with intent to run away; but he fell down two flight of stairs. I likewise found this great coat in the room; this coat is likewise daubed with country mud.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it wet or dry. - A. It appeared more damp than the coat that I found at Harvey's. We then took him away to the office, and then proceded to the

I then returned and spoke to Hartford, I said what is your name, he said my name is Dick; I said well, I know it, I knew him before. I then brought him backwards, where he was handcuffed, by my brother officers. This crow (producing it) was given into my hand at Ponder's End. by Mr. Spencer.</p>
               <p>Q. By which of them. - A. They were both together, and an old hat with an oilskin, the oilskin was in it exactly as it is now; it is an oilskin to cover a hat.</p>

               <p>Q. What joint was it. - A. I cannot say, I believe a piece of brisket, and some soup and some carrots.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for supper. - A. The same as we had for dinner, and the soup warmed up again.</p>
               <p>Q. And tea; I suppose you had some toast as it was cold. - A. We had some toast, as it was cold weather, to make us comfortable.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you was called upon to remember that day. - A. I was called upon no farther than Mr. Harvey was pleased to send to me to remember that day; then I put it in a memorandum, I remembered it in my own mind.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Harvey send to you to make a memorandum of it. - A. He sent to me to recollect that day; that was three days or something after Christmas.</p>

               <p>Q. Then in order to know what day it was, you referred to your master's books. - A. Yes, because if I come before gentlemen, I would not wish to say a wrong thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what liquor you drank for dinner. - A. A couple of pots; I do not know that we had any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor had you for supper. - A. Three or four pots.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When you referred to your master's books, and it confirmed you of the day, you speak from a good recollection of the subject. - A. I do, from my heart.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was this master whose book you talk of. A. Mr. Evans, Hill street, Worship street, Finsbury square, he is a master carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. What work were you doing for him that day. - A. After we had digged the pit we took on timber on the pit; we cut the timber on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Has 
               <persName id="t18070114-5-person148">Harvey</persName>
             any family. - A. He is a married man, his wife lives at Waltham abbey, she lives along with her mother, I believe, at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she not to be living with her husband. A. She did live with her husband when he lived there, but after he came away she went and lived with her mother; he was keeper of two barges on the river Lea, and sometimes the water of the river Lea was shut up, he had nothing to do, and then he came round to see his friends, and when the water was full he returned to his barges.</p>
               <p>Q. Then his business as a bargeman was on the river Lea. - A. Yes, from London to Ware, and to Hertford, and that part.</p>
               <p>THOMAS OLAND; examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a sawyer, I live in Duke street, Finsbury square.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with Demponey, the witness who has been examined. - A. I live in the same house with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing Harvey on the Thursday before Christmas day. - A. Perfectly; I believe on the first part of the day I saw him at Mr. Demponey's, he dined there about twelve o'clock; when I went from my dinner I left Harvey in the house, Demponey my father-in-law, and me, went to our work. About three o'clock Harvey came to us and lent us a hand to dig the saw pit, he might then be with us an hour or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go before you had finished the saw pit. - A. He did, he left us to finish the saw pit.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him again. - A. It might be half an hour or better; I saw him at Mr. Demponey's house. We went over and spent the evening at a neighbouring public house, the

               <p>Q. Do you recollect what hour you went to the public house. - A. I believe it was some minutes after six, and there we staid till nearly nine.</p>

               <p>Q. By what means do you know it was Thursday. - A. I know so, particularly in our digging the pit; Mr. Evans employed us to dig the pit, Mr. Harvey came down and lent us a hand to finish digging the pit; we prove it in every respect by our master's bill that was sent in of the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of that bill. - A. Our bill was very trifling.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not in the bill specify each day's work, you specify the work done. - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for dinner that day. - A. I really cannot pretend to say, I know what I had for supper; it is a question with me whether I had any dinner or no. I am not in Mr. Demponey's family, though I live in the house. I dined with my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go into the room where the prisoner was. - A. Yes, I went into the room where they were.</p>
               <p>Q. What was their dinner. - A. I believe it was beef. I supped with them, we had some cold beef for supper.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some hot broth, of course. - A. Yes, but I had none.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell what you had for dinner, and you question whether you really had any dinner or no. - A. I really think I had some dinner, but what I had I do not know.</p>

               <p>Court. How long was Demponey that day at his dinner. - A. He might be half an hour for what I know, I cannot exactly say to a few minutes of the time that we left our work and went to it again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Demponey and you talked this matter over at all. - A. I do not consider that we have talked any thing about it, I have not heard any thing about it till this day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you did not know any thing about this till a day or two ago. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that wanted you to prove it. - A. I heard Mr. Demponey say that Mr. Harvey was so and so.</p>

               <p>Q. What is so and so. - A. That he was in trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not know that Harvey was in trouble till a day or two ago. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was he that told you that you was wanted to prove something before Christmas day. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never understood that you should be wanted to prove any thing till a day or two ago. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It is very odd that you never heard of it before; upon your oath did not you know that Demponey and your mother-in-law went to the office to see him about a fortnight ago. - A. I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Demponey have been working together every day since that. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you a fortnight ago that Harvey was taken up. - A. I have heard him mention it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, a fortnight ago. - A. No such thing, I cannot exactly say to a day or two; to the best of my belief it might be a week or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what did you mean to say just now that you did not hear that Harvey was in trouble till within this day or two. - A. Till within these few days.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that you did did not know that Harvey was in trouble till within this day or two, you mean within a few days. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have not you heard it above a fortnight ago. - A. I believe if it is that time, it as much as it is.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think it might be a fortnight ago that you heard it. - A. I cannot pretend to say, I know nothing of the business; to the best of my knowledge it might be seven, or eight, or nine days. I heard it of Mr. Demponey, he was the first person, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade is Harvey. - A. I believe a bargeman.</p>
               <p>Q. You are speaking of your wife's cousin. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it since he worked at his profession. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he lived in London. - A. I do not know that he lived any where else than in Waltham Abbey.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then you supposed that he came up with his barge, and so came to see his uncle. - A. I knew no otherwise.</p>
               <p>Court. When was it that you went to Mr. Evans's. - A. I was there yesterday and I was there today.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any book that told you the day, or any thing like it at Mr. Evans's. - A. Not this week.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you went to look at Mr. Evans' list. - A. Saturday night, I gave my bill into my master's hands, and he paid me our bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I understood you to say you had been to Mr. Evans's to look at his book to see when the pit was dug. - A. Yes, on Thursday the 18th of December, Mr. Evans told me the pit was finished.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to say that the pit was finished on Thursday the 18th of December except what Mr. Evans told you. - A. I know it perfectly well; we began that pit on the Wednesday, on Thursday afternoon we finished it; on the Friday we began to work.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is whether you have any reason to say that that Thursday the pit was finished was Thursday the 18th of December, have you any reason for saying so, except Mr. Evans having told you so. - A. I have so far as this, I made a recollection in different things by our own earnings, I know it must be.</p>
               <p>Q. You are desired to satisfy the jury that this Thursday was the 18th of December, the reason that you gave some time ago was, that you had seen Mr. Evans's book. - A. I never saw Mr. Evans's book.</p>
               <p>Court. I should be glad to know what enables you to say it was the Thursday before Christmas day, you may very well begin a pit on a Wednesday and finish it on a Thursday, there is no circumstance that enables you to say that it was on that Thursday, independent of what any one told you. - A. There is a circumstance that I recollect perfectly well; on that day the master-bricklayer had four loads in.</p>
               <p>Q. What master bricklayer are you talking on. - A. On the building that we are engaged in; that master sent for two pots of porter to treat us with, and the master-bricklayer partook of the porter.</p>
               <p>Court. So he might; that might be the week before as well as the Christmas week.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting her on any day going to a pawnbrokers - A. Yes, on the 18th of last December.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you pledge a gown and petticoat. - A. At Mr. Brookes', in Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>Q. You got a duplicate at the pawnbroker's. - A. I did, I requested Mrs. Demponey to take care of it, as I was going to my mother's</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet Mrs. Demponey - A. In Bishopsgate street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go home with Mrs. Demponey. - A. No, I was not at her house all the day.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you. - A. My husband is a professsional man in the law in Lincoln's inn; I live at Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you carry on any business. - A. I carry on the child bed linen business, I have served in lord Auckland's family and lady Pelham. Mrs. Demponey is a laundress, she washed for me; I requested her to go with me, I wanted to go down to my mother's, I happened to meet Mrs. Demponey.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, your being reduced, it was not a pleasant thing to you. - A. Surely not.</p>
               <p>Q. And a thing you were not accustomed to, and as it hurt your feelings, how came you to take a companion with you. - A. I was not doing any illicit thing, I was not taking any person's property than my own, and from that candour of disposition that I possess I told her what business I was going upon.</p>
               <p>Court. Why could you not take care of this tieket yourself. - A. I might have done it to be sure, but I was going out of town; she had things of mine in her possession, and it was not a very pleasant thing to carry about with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the harm of a bit of paper. - A. Probably as I was going down to my mother I might be under some necessity, or some circumstance or accident might occur that might produce it; therefore my giving it to her to keep for me it would put it out of my power of informing my mother of it; that was my only reason for my giving it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Egerton did you give this paper to this woman without any acknowledgement, in order that this might be safe. - A. I had a very high opinion of her principles, or otherwise I would not have invested it in her hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Mrs. Demponey had the ticket from that time to this. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been returned to town from your mother. - A. About a fortnight. I have seen Mrs. Demponey two or three times since I came to town; I did not request it till I had the power of taking out the things; she said Mrs. Egerton my nephew was at my house and was not you with me when I carried the parcel, I said certainly; now says she, this will be a principal thing; I says I am very happy that you have it. She applied to me to let her have it in her possession.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you applied to her for it. - A. No, she could not tell when I should have applied to her for it; when the occurrence happened, she anticipated the thought that I might have asked her for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that. - A. I am only judging.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner advise you to then. - A. He said, now I have thought of another plan; let us go back to London again; I hear you have a son at squire Newbolt's at Fulham, and the mother loves that boy uncommonly I am told; now let us go back there, and we'll go and take him, you have a right to take him, and try and see whether he cannot prevail upon her; if not, and the mother will not be reconciled, we will tell the mother that we will carry him to America, or take and put him on board of a man of war; we shall surely make her come to then.</p>

It was somewhere about the 10th of July, about two or three o'clock in the afternoon; we went first of all to the Eight Bells, then Smith said let me go in, do not you go in to the boy upon no account in the world, and if I see him I will take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave you at the Eight Bells and go. - A. Yes, I waited; when he came back he said he was gone with his master to Oxford, and that he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after that go to Mr. Newbolt's yourself. - A. Yes, I was informed the boy was there, I run over several rooms in Mr. Newbolt's house, I could not find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come back to the Eight Bells to the prisoner. - A. Yes, and I attempted to run away from him, finding that he had told lies. I had not found him out before I got into a boat and made my escape from the prisoner; I was got about half way over the river, when he and a person named Gayton hailed the boat, and the boatman came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Gayton was a friend of yours. - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. When the waterman came back did you join in conversation with Smith and Gayton. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that before you went to Mr. Newbolts. - A. No, it was after, I was alone then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you then see that you had the three hundred pound bank note. - A. That I did not particularly look to; I looked to see that they were all right.</p>

We came to Peter street, Soho, to Mr. Kelly's house; Smith said that he would take me to that house to have a cup of tea, he said he was going up to the Oxford coach. He was going up to that part of the town, to see whether he could see my son coming from Oxford; he could not. When the prisoner was in the

            . I asked him if he was the person that paid in the note that came from Messrs. Haywood and Co., he said he had, and he had called upon me for the ballance. I asked him if he knew what that balance was, he said no; I told him that I had mislaid the letter, and I did not know the exact account of the balance, that I had put it down in my lower office, I would go and look for it; this was up stairs. I went down stairs and sent my clerk for a constable, I went up again to the prisoner, and told the prisoner that I could not lay my hand upon the letter, but my clerk was looking for it, I begged him to sit down, and I dare say I should find it; he said he could not stay, he had a lady ill, in a coach, and desired me to pay the balance to a Mr. Wren.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know such a person as Mr. Wren. - Yes, a publican in Cow Cross; I told him I must have his authority, and begged him to write it; he began to write the authority, he did not finish it, but begged that I would write it, and put that which he was writing in his pocket. I accordingly writ an authority, and desired him to sign it, which he did, which I have now in my hand; he then was going away. I told him he could not go for that the bill of three hundred pounds that he had paid into the hands of Messrs. Haywood and Co. at Manchester had been stolen from a client of mine, and that I suspected him to be the man; first he said he would go, I was on the stairs to stop him, he pushed by me to the door, but my clerk taking the precaution of locking it, he could not get out; he afterwards was very quiet and sat down when he saw I was resolute, and he said his name was not St. John. The constable came and he was secured.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the first instance I wish your lordship to understand that the prosecutor has perjured himself in his evidence twenty times; Mr. Henson's amounts to the same thing. So far when he asked my name prior, I told him 
               <persName id="t18070114-6-person181">

            , that I acted as agent to St. John; he charged me with respect to the acquaintance I had with that man (I am speaking of Mr. Henson), I said that I come from him, I would show him the man, and take him myself; that was refused. The last time that I was brought here I had respectable people from the country; at the present instance I have none; many of them live in Hampshire. The prosecutor has brought these people from Manchester, whom I know not though I do not deny that I negotiated the note. The man was with me and put his dot on the note.</p>

               <p>Q. How was you employed on this day. - A. I was pointing the lead flushing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this lead completely finished in laying it completely down. - A. It was affixed completely to the building, the holdfasts were drove in.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day the prisoner was apprehended what was the business the prisoner had to do there. - A. He was employed as a scaffold man to attend upon the masons. Between two and three o'clock in the afternoon I saw him first on the place where the lead was missing, he had no business there that I know of; then I had to go to another part of the building to do my work, and by that time I had got to that place he had got round to a place where he was cutting the lead up and beating it to pieces; I observed him half an hour before I informed Mr. Pope.</p>
               <p>Q. What lead did it appear to you to be. -

            Gutter lead flushing; it was like the lead that belonged to the same place; I went there and informed Mr. Pope of it, he gave me strict charge to watch him, and to do nothing else all the day. At the time that I got back to the place again, he was still at work<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140019"/> beating of it up, he did not see me, I was above him; he continued cutting it up till he had finished it, then he broke a hole through the centers and let it down into another apartment; I watched him into the same place where it was dropped; I could not see him any more then till he came out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at any intermediate time given any information to 
               <persName id="t18070114-7-person188">Wood</persName>
             the porter. - A. Yes; then I watched him till he put on his coat; the bell rang, and I followed him to the gate, I saw Wood stop him, I saw the lead taken from him; it was about thirty pound weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it taken from him or had any dropped from him. - A. There was some dropped from him, and Wood took one or two bits from him that was hid under his waistcoat; the prisoner begged Mr. Pope's pardon when he was taken. He said it was the first offence that he had ever done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that the lead was affixed, or only placed to be affixed. - A. It was quite fast, it only wanted pointing to stop it up.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a place is it. - A. It is called the New Mint, it is a strong building.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you stop the prisoner. - A. When he came to the gate he was not willing to go, he seemed as if he wanted to turn back again; I took him into the lodge; I took one piece of lead from his person, the five pieces he dropped, they were cut into small pieces. He went down on his knees and begged for mercy.</p>

               <p>Q. You were carrying a girl in your arms, and while you were carrying this girl to the coach you found somebody take the watch from your pocket. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do then. - A. I collared him; I said, you rascal you have robbed me; my master called out to me to give him the child. Then I laid hold of the prisoner with both hands, I called out to the watch, to whom I gave him in charge; I saw him shift the watch from one of his hands to another; I called out there goes my watch. After stopping twenty minutes two other watchmen came and took him to the watchhouse.</p>

I went with her to three pawnbrokers, there was never a one would take it in, they were so old; she gave me these things to take care of till Friday, I did not know that she had stole them, and Mr. Griffith's coming up and taking me, I was frightened; I threw them out of my pocket. I am very innocent, I know nothing of it; if I was to drop down dead I do not know where that woman lives.</p>

A little before three o'clock this woman was brought up with these handkerchiefs, she was discharged, we did not know who they belonged to; I went round to the pawnbroker's, they told me that this woman had been to pledge these handkerchiefs and they would not take them in.</p>

               <p>JAMES DUNKLEY. On the 16th of December, near eight o'clock in the morning, I went into the Magpie, Fetter lane, I called for half a pint of beer; after I had been an hour, I asked the landlord's son, to take care of the bundle while I went to look after some work in the stables; I told him to be sure not to deliver it to any body but me, and I would call for it in an hour or two. The prisoner at the bar was sitting in the room all the time. I returned at eleven o'clock, and asked for my bundle, the landlord said he had delivered it to a man that described the handkerchief. The landlord and a young man in the tap went out in pursuit of the prisoner; he was brought back by the young man, but the bundle was not found.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure he was the man that was there in the morning when you left the bundle. - A. Yes.</p>

            , SENIOR. You keep the Magpie. - A. Yes; my son left a bundle in the bar. The prisoner at the bar was sitting in the taproom when I got up a little before eight; the boy did not say any thing to me that he had taken in a bundle of any body; some time after, I do not know whether the clock had gone ten, the prisoner came up to the bar and said I shall thank you for the bundle I left with your boy. He described it to be a dark handkerchief with a hole in the bottom; I looked for the parcel, I found an handkerchief of that description, containing a bundle, I takes up the parcel, I called the young man that was in the house, I asked him if he had seen that man deliver the parcel to my son, he said he had not. I delivered the parcel to him, he said that was his stable jacket at the bottom, he had been over the way to get work.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you could see the stable waistcoat at the bottom. - A. Yes, through the hole. I am sure<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140021"/> the prisoner is the man whom I delivered it to.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did the prosecutor come. A. About twenty minutes afterwards the prosecutor came and asked for the bundle, and then I called the young man that was in the tap to go and look after the man.</p>
               <p>JOHN CRANK. I am a porter to the White Horse, Fetter lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember to whom the parcel was delivered. - A. Yes, to the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prosecutor came and gave information you went in search of him. - A. Yes. I met with the prisoner at a public house in the Strand, he was smoking his pipe. He asked me to drink, I told him no; I asked him whether he had not been in Fetter lane that morning, he said he had not; I told him he had, and he was the person that took the bundle out of the landlord's hand. I asked him to come back along with me, he said he would; he came along with me to Mr. Pearch's, and I fetched a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the bundle. - A. No, he had nothing with him when I took him. They said at the house they did not see him bring in any thing with him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was the man. - A. He was the man that took the bundle from the landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. Dunkley, what did your handkerchief contain. - A. One shirt, two white handkerchiefs, two pair of stockings, two jackets, and a pair of shoes. The handkerchief had a hole at the bottom.</p>

               <p>Mr. Arabin. Was it dark. - A. Yes, they said they wanted Mr. Whitebread.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there more voices than one. - A. Only one answered. I asked what their names was, they said their name was Brown, as I understood them. I told the boy to unbolt the door, and there were three men came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the appearance of these men. - A. The first man had a black face, and a rough brown coat on; a tall man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Was that a black face, or a mask, or how. - A. I cannot say; they took hold of my arm, and my arm was all black. The first man was a tall man, the second man was a man with a light coloured coat on. I cannot recollect the third, I was so frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any one else. - A. Yes, there was one outside the door, there was four in all; the man that was of the outside, he took the door and pulled it to, and when they came in the first man said your life or your money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any thing at the same time. - A. No, not to me; the second man had fire arms of the same sort as the first. The tall man asked me for my keys, I went into the parlour and took them out of the buffet, he pushed me up stairs before him, and I shewed him where the money was in the secretary; he said that was not all; he took the keys out of the secretary, and made me go to a dressing glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any money out. - A. Yes, out of the secretary he took two ten pound notes and gold, I cannot say rightly the sum of the gold, it was all loose.</p>
               <p>Q. How much do you suppose, was there fifteen or twenty guineas. - A. There were more than that; they asked me to shew them the key of the dressing glass, and I did, there was nothing in the drawer; they looked in a closet in the bed room, they did not take any thing from there; then they came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was it that took the money. - A. The tall man that first came in the dark coloured coat, they went down stairs and went into the parlour, they asked me for my plate, I told them I had none; they looked round the parlour, then they went out.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the fact so that there was no plate in the house. - A. There was plate in the house, I told them that there were none.</p>
               <p>Q. They were satisfied that you told them so, had you any considerable quantity of plate in the house. - A. No, we had silver tea spoons, table spoons, and sugar tongs, and things of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the two prisoners at the bar, and see what is your opinion as to their persons only, say as to your belief. - A. I cannot swear to them, they were so disguised, they are about the size of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the tall man much of the size of one of the prisoners. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man in the light coloured coat like the least of them. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it a coat of the same colour he wears now. - A. Yes, the same colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same make. - A. I did not take notice of the make.</p>
               <p>Harvey. I should have thought that she would know my voice, by seeing me before. - A. Nobody spoke but the first man, he spoke very gruff.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you heard him speak since he was taken up. - A. Yes, but he did not speak the same as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140022"/> he spoke then; he said, Come along, in a very gruff way.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect a knock being given at the door. - A. Yes, I went to the door, I asked who is there, they said they wanted Mr. Whitebread; my mistress asked who was there, they said their name was Brown. I opened the door, and one tall man came in first, the next was a man with a white mask on; the tall man had a black face and a large rough brown coat on. There was a third man came in, I cannot say how he was dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of clothes had the second man on. A. A white coat like that he has on now (witness pointing to Harvey), the second man presented a blunderbuss to my mistress, she run into the parlour and got the keys out of the buffet.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told her to go and get the keys. - A. Fordham, the tall man; he took hold of her arms and shoved her up stairs, and another followed her, and one looked inside the stairs and went a little way up. I cannot say how far he went up, he staid there till just as they were coming down, and then he come down before them; when the three men came into the house I had the latch of the door in my hand, they pulled the latch of the door out of my hand, and somebody on the outside pulled it too. When they came down stairs they took the candle and went into the parlour and asked for the plate; my mistress answered I have got no plate; they looked into two or three of the other cupboards, and they found nothing there; they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoners at the bar and see what is your belief respecting them. - A. The tall man is very much like the man that first came into the house, and I think the other is very much like the man that had the white mask on his face and the white coat.</p>

We parted the money equally alike, excepting three shillings that the prisoner Harvey had in his possession; we agreed to go to the Nag's-head, in Hackney road, and there to spend the three shillings which was not parted between us.

I went with Fordham as far as the Peacock, Bethnall green, to his lodgings, he went into his lodgings, and I went on to my lodging; he saying when we parted he should come to my lodgings to-morrow; he accordingly came to my lodgings the next day, on Sunday the day before I was taken up. I then received a pistol from him, and likewise some balls he had run and gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known any thing respecting that pistol before. - A. I had seen it before, I saw it just after he had bought it; as near as I can guess about three months before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know from him how he came in possession of it. - A. He told me that he bought it at a small shop like a pawnbroker's, in Whitechapel, for twenty-five shillings, and I gave him half the money for it. The pistol that I had on that Sunday was one of that pair. I was apprehended on the Monday following, the next day after I received the pistol.</p>

            ; examined by Mr. Gurney. You are a police officer of Hatton Garden office. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday the 22nd of December, did you with Chapman go in pursuit of Roberts. - A. I did; he was taken by Chapman in my absence, I saw him after Chapman had taken him. In consequence of information that he gave me, I went to a small cook's shop in Hackey Road, where I was informed Harvey lodged; when I entered the house I left Chapman outside of the house, I saw two men in the back room; the prisoner with a handkerchief tied round one of his eyes; the other I believe was the master of the house, he called himself so; I asked the landlord if Harvey lodged there, the man made answer no. I then asked Harvey if his name was not Harvey, he said no; at that time he was reading something, I cannot say whether it was a newspaper or not. I then directed my brother officer to come into the house and take care of him, I had great suspicion that that man was him. I went up stairs to search the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did you go to up stairs. - A. I think the two pair, I am not positive; in a room in a bag I found this mask, I then called out to my brother officer that all was right, to be sure and take care of the man below. I then came down and took Harvey into custody and he acknowledged that his name was Harvey. I told the landlord in Harvey's presence that it was wrong to deny Harvey's lodging there, he admitted it was wrong, and he said he should not have lodged there if he had known such a thing had been, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then ask 
               <persName id="t18070114-12-person249">Harvey</persName>
             any questions concerning of that room. - A. Yes he admitted that he slept there and that this mask was not his, it belonged to another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who that person was. - A. He did not, the landlord said he was a little smith that lodged there. We then took Harvey in a coach to the Peacock on Bethnal Green; I went to the room described where Fordham lodged; when I entered the room I found Fordham laying in the bed, with his hat, shoes, and coat off; all the rest of his things were on.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this. - A. It was in the afternoon, it was day light. He lifted up his head and looked in an alarming way; seeing him so restless as that, I pulled out a pistol and said Jack be quiet; he was putting his arm out as if he was going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140024"/> to take his coat. I told him if he offered to resist I would blow his brains out. I then called to Chapman to take hold of the coat and to search- it, he searched it, and a pistol was found in one of the pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you handcuff him. - A. Yes, he was handcuffed. I searched the room and found a pair of bullet moulds. While I was in the act of searching about the room and Chapman too, he made a sudden spring, and he, I imagine, meant to run down stairs. He tumbled down stairs and went to the bottom, we caught him and secured him, and we returned up stairs again. This coat was laying in one corner of the room, it has got country dirt on it.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you know such a thing as pearl black. - A. I know lamp black, I believe this is lamp black, the inside of that mask shows there has been some blacking in it.</p>

               <p>Q. How long do you think it was from the time he came in to the time that you went away. - A. I should think it was three hours that he was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You yourself did not get in till eight o'clock, how long after that did he come in. - A. Almost directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be so late as nine when Harvey came in. - A. No, my wife told me it was just eight o'clock when I came in, and the prisoner Harvey came in soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. You tell me when you left the cook's shop, you went home to go to bed, who did you leave behind you in the house. - A. I left nobody but my lodger, my new wife, and my brother-in-law, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they. - A. I think Harvey was in the shop, to the best of my knowledge they two sat in the little room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you left your brother in-law when you went away from your wife. - A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Harvey. I have nothing to say in my behalf, but that I am as innocent as a child unborn. I mentioned to this landlord's wife to ask the smith that lodged with me if he meant to quit his lodgings, I thought she might look to me for the money.</p>

            . I am a stay maker, I was coming down Holborn last Thursday about six o'clock in the evening, I saw this boy in company with another by the middle of Turnstile, Holborn; he was standing by the edge of the pavement, whistling and calling some other person to him; I told him he had better go about his business for he was doing no good there. And just as I was coming into Newgate street, they passed me again; I crossed over the way, and they went up Newgate street, I saw him stop at the shop window, and look into the shop; there was a coach coming by just at the time, and I saw the prisoner run across the way with this piece of kerseymere; I took hold of him and took him over to Mr. Blacket's house; he sent for an officer, and took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other boy. - A. The other boy ran down the street.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure this is the same boy that you saw before. - A. Yes, because I looked him full in the face, and told him he would do no good there.</p>

On Sunday the 14th of December last, as I was passing through Islington, I saw a gentleman coming towards me; Murfield the prisoner and another boy was running close and slowly after him, which attracted my attention. I then saw Murfield take a pocket handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, he put it between his coat and his waistcoat, turned back, and ran away with the boy that was with him. I ordered the coachman to stop, I got from the carriage and went towards them; then Murfield gave the pocket handkerchief to the other boy.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of any information did you say any thing to the prisoner and when. - A. I had some reasons to suspect him, in consequence of some suspicion. On the 5th of January I taxed him with robbing me, and he immediately confessed; I said to him, Edward you have been in my employ a great while, I conceive you are a very great rascal; I told him he had robbed me, he said, sir I have. I asked him what he had done with the property he had taken from me; he refused to tell me. In consequence of that I sent for Leadbetter the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Leadbetter and you go to the lodgings of the prisoner. - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his lodgings. - A. Golden lion court, Aldersgate street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in his lodging and what. - A. We found in a box that his wife refused to open, but Leadbetter broke it open, a variety of remnants of silk; these are the articles that are now in court. Leadbetter took them away, and brought them to my warehouse; we compared them with certain goods in our house that matched with them. I have no doubt but they are my property. He confessed that he had taken them before the lord-mayor.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The charges that my prosecutor has raised against me are not facts, nor is there any truth in what he has alledged against me at all. I have served that man in every shape, I have done my duty, and I have protected him in every transaction. I am now a prisoner standing at the bar, and he is a gentleman that has come out of nothing, not so much as I am myself, although I am cast down. I know Mr. Smith for ten years past, he is rising, he has left his duty. I have been the man that is faithful to him; my wife is in the millinery and mantua-line, and what was in her possession I know no more than a child unborn; but this Mr. Smith came to me in prison, he came to try me with all his invention, which is his character, and he is well known by every person in the line to be one of the most deceitful men upon earth. He invents things which is most astonishing, it is beyond the conception of a human being to imagine, that man has such things in his heart. He has come to that property which he possesses by nothing but merely by his own artful invention, and the very person that has gone into partnership with him he knows a mere nothing in the business, he knows he has a tool in his hand; this is the character of my prosecutor, which is my misfortune to be his servant. As to those things I know no more of them than a child unborn; as to those wrappers, he mentioned to me one day, he says, when we have some wrappers, just take them home to your wife to get some bags made; he knew my wife was distressed well enough; she made some for him although she had other work to do, by doing which she would have got a great deal more money; there were some wrappers left, and as she was to make them into bags, I thought it frivolous to bring them back; and these wrappers are brought against me as if I stole them. All this he knows if he would speak to his conscience.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . On the 30th of December, between the hours of twelve and one at night, the prisoner and the prosecutor passed me arm and arm, and a young woman was with them. I was on my duty then, and within five minutes the prisoner ran back and passed me again; the prosecutor cried out, stop him, he has robbed me of my hat. I found where the prisoner lodged, and the constable and I went and took him; we found the hat in a lumber room in the same house where the prisoner was.</p>

               <p>Q. How was she dressed. - A. She had on a light shawl, it seemed to be almost a new one, and a dark green gown hanging very loose about her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she dressed in the same way when the gentleman brought her back. - A. Yes, she was dressed when she was brought back the same as she was when she came in the shop; the gown that she had on was made for a person three times as large as she was.</p>

               <p>Q. You were waiting in the shop at some distance, you did not observe their faces. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say from any knowledge of their faces, that the women which were brought back were the same that had been in the shop before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of your shop was your master. - A. At the bottom of the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. You say they made first of all an offer for this gingham, and the girl went out of the shop, and the other to the door, at that time she went out of the shop the gingham was on the counter. - A. Not that gingham.</p>
               <p>Q. The little girl went out of the shop, the woman went partially out, when the little girl went out was the gingham laying on the counter. - A. I did not see it the second time that Bolton came in, she was not nigh that part of the counter by three yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened you to take notice of Crawley's gown being of that size. - A. Because I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you take any more notice than you usually do to customers that come in the shop. - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in the shop when they came in. - A. I cannot say whether he was in the shop or not.</p>
               <p>Court. (to prosecutor) Had you any opportunity of seeing the girl's face, so as to know her again when she came in the first time. - A. I had, she came up to the counter, I saw her and took notice of her then, and I went down to the bottom of the shop; I had an opportunity to know that she was the girl that came in the shop to buy the gingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you such an opportunity of observing the features of her face so as to know her again. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your apprentice said though he stood by he did not know her face. - A. He ought to know her.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know that he ought, if he could not see I do not know that you could see. - A. I positively swear that she is the girl.</p>
               <p>A. You may swear that she is the girl because she was brought back; I want to know whether upon your oath, you can say that you had sufficient observation of her features before she was brought back; to be sure that is the girl. - A. Yes.</p>




               <p>Mr. Walford. How far off were you standing in the shop when they came in first. - A. Nearer than I am to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had seen them half an hour afterwards in the street, should you have been able to recollect the girl. - A. I could have sworn that she had been in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any reason to suppose they had stole the gingham, before they were brought back. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q, You saw nothing in their conduct that gave you any suspicion. - A. No.</p>

I told him to be carefull when I give him the alarm; I went back to the place, I heard something drop; by the hollowness of the found I thought it was lead, the prisoner at the bar came forward, I asked him what he had got there, he said it was lead, he said he had nothing but what he had brought with him; he was carrying it under his jacket under his arm; I sprung the rattle, and the other watchman came up to my assistance; he took the lead from him, we secured him.</p>

On the 6th of January I observed the prisoner at the bar sitting on a chest of tea, he appeared to me as if he was concealing some tea about his person. I went down and accquainted the elder Mr. Clements.</p>
               <p>Mr. CLEMENTS; examined by Mr. Knapp. I understand you are assistant elder to this warehouse in Cutler street, Hounsditch. - A. I am. I went up to the prisoner, I ordered him down stairs. In consequence of what Buck said, I told him he had something about him that he should not have, he hesitated a little, I said it is of no manner of use hesitating; if he had got any thing to take it out himself, upon which he turned himself rather round, and in the presence of the commodore he took out a quantity of tea from his breeches. I looked at the tea to see if it corresponded with the tea in that floor where he was at work; it corresponded exactly.</p>
               <p>- READ. I produce the tea; the tea weighed a pound and one ounce.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, he called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Edwards haberdasher and milliner, Bishopsgate street; my mistress gave me some money; I went and bought four pair of stockings, two pair at half a crown, and two pair at two shillings a pair; I paid him six shillings, half a crown and sixpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the same money that you received from your mistress. - A. Yes, it never was out of my hand till I give it to the prisoner; there was nobody else in the shop, it was about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Your purchasing these things were only a pretended circumstance; you were not to keep the stockings were you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to give them to the prosecutor Mr. Stirtevant. - A. That I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a contrivance of Mr. Stirtevant for the purpose. - A. I suppose so, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it was so; did not you buy them for Mr. Stirtevant. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The ladies are not so rude as to say yes at all times; did not you give the stockings to Mr. Stirtevant. - A. I gave them to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I came into the shop afterwards; it might be about half after two, I asked him if he had sold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140035"/> any goods, he said he had. I unlocked the till to see if the money corresponded with the articles sold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what money was in the till before. - A. No, I did not, the till was locked up, having strong suspicion of him; he had been accstomed to put the cash on the desk, he contrived to put this cash between the top of the counter and the till into the till, so that when I had unlocked the till there was the money exactly as he had put it in; there was the half crown and the four shillings; the till was partitioned off close up to the counter, it was impossible for it to go where the other silver was, there was no silver but that in that partition. I then requested the prisoner to go to his dinner, finding the money did not correspond with the purchase; after he returned from dinner he was requested to put down his articles in a book, which I kept for that purpose, he put down the articles. He was asked if he put down all the articles that he had sold, he said yes; that was sufficient for me.</p>

               <p>Q. What was in the book. - A. One pair of woman's cotton, two shillings, one pair ditto, half a crown, and one pair of woman's black worsted, half a crown, that made seven shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Had they ever been sold in your shop. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Did you take up any body else that evening. - A. I was about to take up my brother that very evening, but from the behaviour of the two men I had more right to suspect this man than the other. I searched both the apartments, and found none in one, and three pair of shoes in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. That is your argument; you did suspect your brother, did you take him up. - A. I believe I might say for a minute or two, I desired him to go in the coach; he was put into the constable's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they had not been sold in your shop during your absence. - A. His wife said they had been brought there that night.</p>
               <p>Q. She might say that not to injure herself; suppose six pair were brought from the maker, all of one size and of one sort, and three pair were sold, should you be able to distinguish them from the others. - A. Certainly not; I know they are of my make, and they have my daughter's mark.</p>
               <p>Q. So they would if they had been sold. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>

I returned, and took the basket from Half-moon street to Pater noster row; when the linen was taken out there was a shirt and a sheet missing; the bill was in the basket. I returned to my wife, I asked her if she was sure that she had sent all the linen, she said she had; I told the person in Half-moon street that I had lost a shirt and a sheet during the time that I left the linen there, and suspicion fell upon the prisoner at the bar; she was nursing the person's wife in Half-moon street where I left the parcel. I challenged the prisoner with it, she denied it, I traced the pawnbrokers and could not find it; I was obliged to pay for it one pound twelve shillings. On the 29th the prisoner was taken up for another robbery, she was in the Poultry counter; I went to her there, she confessed that she took them, and that the duplicates were in the lining of her stays at her lodgings. I went to her lodgings, and found the duplicates as she told me. I went to the pawnbroker's and found my property.</p>

In the month of August I had sent my steward and other servants to the Cape of Good Hope; in consequence of that I placed the same confidence in him as I should have done in my steward. On the 27th or 28th of September, I received an order, a note, from the Admiralty, saying when the sloop of war would be ready to receive me on board. In consequence of that I gave the prisoner an order to get all the goods packed up and sent to Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Among these articles were there any table cloths. A. There were table cloths, and I believe there were table cloths packed up, but whether they were packed up I do not know, I certainly meant them to be packed up.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mention table cloths, but your order included them and napkins, and every thing that you intended to be sent to the Cape. - A. I included every thing but three beds and linen; it was in consequence of a very hurried state I desired every thing should be packed up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there an order given respecting wine. - A. There was, the prisoner was to pack up some wine also for the Cape.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time these articles were packed up. - A. I saw them in the cart which was to convey them to the waggon office in Warwick lane; there were thirty-two packages to be sent to Warwick lane, and ten to be sent to the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you left this country did you leave any wine in your house. - A. I left this country the first week in December for Ireland. I cannot recollect the exact time I was last in the cellar, but when I was last in the cellar I did leave wine in it; there ought to be wine in the cellar when I left this country.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner the key of your lordship's cellar. A. When I was packing up I sent for my wine merchant, Mr. Harrison, directing him to send me some man to pack up some wine; during that time I entrusted the prisoner with the key of the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave it in his possession during the time you were absent in Ireland. - A. I cannot be positive, there were two keys of the cellar, one was in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether you had left the other key you are not certain. - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing particular occur at the time they were counted. - A. I found the prisoner was not very correct in numbering the packages; he asked me particularly why I counted them twice over, and then he asked the carman about the packages.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when he counted them whether he made them greater or less than you made them. - A. He made them less.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me how many. - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any directions on them packages. - A. On all; some to my lord Caledon, and some to Mr. Dupree Alexander.</p>
               <p>Q. When lord Caledon was in Ireland, after he left London, did you see whether any of these packages were brought back to my lord's house. - A. The very next day after my lord's departure I saw some of them brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. How many was brought back. - A. One, the prisoner himself brought it back in a hackney coach.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether there were any more packages in the house, whether you saw them brought back or no. - A. I saw four of those that were taken down to Warwick lane; there was no other servant in the house but my wife who was confined in bed sick, and my sister who was attending her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring them back. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing done to these packages when they were brought home. - A. The locks were entirely wrenched off after they were brought home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing what the contents of these boxes were. - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean after the boxes were broke, and when the locks were broken off, did you see the contents. - A. I saw some wine and some wearing apparel, and some perfumery.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect his coming to the Oxford Arms with the last witness any time, and when. - A. He came on the 30th of October to our inn and brought thirty-two packages.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those packages delivered to your care. - A. They were.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect in what manner they were directed. - A. Some were directed, Lord Caledon, Cape of Good Hope, and some of them, Mr. Alexander, by the same conveyance as lord Caledon.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you see the prisoner at the bar. - A. Either one or two days afterwards he gave a general order to stop the goods, until a further order from his lordship; the goods were not sent. In about ten or twelve days he then came in lord Caledon's name and demanded a part of the packages back. He at that time opened one box, and took out some boots and shoes and tied them up in a handkerchief, and took another trunk and put it in the coach, and ordered the coachman to drive to lord Caledon's house in Stretton street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other packages delivered to him at different times. - A. Eight more; they were all taken away in a coach, and ordered to be taken to lord Caledon's house.</p>

On Monday the 15th of December, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a noise at the front door of the shop, I was in the kitchen, I went to the door, I heard a lad coming in, I asked him what he wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more lads than one. - A. There were two outside the door; only one came in, I asked him what he wanted, he answered a halfpennyworth of tape.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the shop, or only at the door. - A. He was only at the door, I went in the shop and served him with a halfpennyworth of tape.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the others. - A. The others were out of door all the time. I went into the kitchen, and I had not been there above five minutes before I heard the door go again, I went to the door, I saw one go from the door, I went into the shop, I perceived I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see in your shop. - A. Nobody then. I looked into my till, I missed three one pound notes, a seven shilling piece, two half crowns, and some shillings and sixpences; how many of them I cannot say. I lost about three pounds sixteen, in notes and silver.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to your shop the second time did you see the boy who come in before. - A. No, I saw one go from the door, it appeared as if he had been in the house, because I saw his hand on the door, pulling it after him; he walked very quick away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other boy then. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face. - A. I saw the side of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see sufficient of it to know it again. - A. Yes, it was Marsden, he with the blue jacket on, the tall one.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the shop to serve the boy with the tape, did you take notice of the boy when you looked out, was the other prisoner the other boy. - A. Yes, he was leaning upon the chains before the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Marsden in the blue jacket at the time that you served the tape. - A. I did not see him at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you live at Brent Bridge in the month of September. - A. I have lived there twenty eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. You were at home on the 18th of September were you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it. - A. I do not know that, I cannot tell, I swore to it at the time, I am so destroyed since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen in your house. - A. I will give you the shortest and best account I can. I think it was in September, and I think on the 19th I do not swear now what I did in the indictment. At one o'clock in the morning I heard the window shake, something gave a motion, they called it night in Bow street; however it was one o'clock, I jumped out of bed, I went to the window, I saw a ladder against it, and that Prendergast with a lighted torch in his hand, in secret, with something like a bladder over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he upon the ladder or what situation was he in. - A. He was upon the ladder, he was ascending the ladder, about half way up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known his person before. - A. His daughter was my housekeeper, and he had every day a pint of beer and some cold victuals at my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140039"/> house; I looked out at him and I saw him, I had got my sword drawn just by, at my right hand, I always kept it there at night time; I looked at him and knew him as perfect as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it as to light. - A. Why the night was just in the common way as the weather might be; it was not frost, but it was light enough; but what I saw him by was the light that he held in one hand, in something like a bladder, and the torch burning in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the light of the torch that enabled you to see him distinctly and to know him. - A. Yes. He came up to the window and attempted to push it up, but I held the window down with my left hand; and now upon my oath, as I shall soon appear before God, I was as cool as I am now, and more than I am now. I said within myself I will not shed blood, I shall soon die, my hands are pure, and I will keep them so; I could as easily have done it as I could have put out my hand. He came up to the window and attempted to push it open; I held it down, he began smashing the squares of glass with his hands, still I kept it down and could have done what I liked with him, but I looked into the court opposite, I saw an amazing quantity of men, there were not less than nine or ten; at last he ascended up close to the window with his feet, others ascending behind him up the ladder and held him; he began to smash the frames with his feet. He smashed in the lower frame of the window with his feet, and down he came, his feet hit my leg and knocked me down upon my back; down he came into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. He came in and threw you down upon your back. - A. Yes, he hit my leg, but I do not believe it was by design, but he bruised my leg, he bruised my flesh, sinews, and bone, that I could have no case since, my torture is exceeding great. - [The prosecutor was a gentleman very far advanced in years, and appearing to be in a fainting and languid state, the court ordered him some brandy and water and a chair to sit on.]</p>
               <p>Q. When he got into the room as you have described, and you fell down, what happened next. - A. I hardly can tell; but this he said to me, lie down quietly in bed and be quiet, we will not hurt you, but we must have the treasure for travelling expences; I laid down in bed, and two men with black faces, and another with a bladder over his face, with eyes and mouth cut in it, came in before them; they came in at the window and up the ladder, the same as the other man, into the room. Prendergast came to me and took hold of my two hands, and said I must go down stairs and shew where the treasure was, and must have a light, I called to his daughter in the garret, who is my housekeeper, and desired her to come down, and I entreated and desired these men to be kind. I called to his daughter to come down and bring a light, she did, and she struck a light; the house were all alarmed. Then I saw his face and the other three in my bed room besides; there were four of them.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no disguise to Prendergast's face. - A. No, none at all, no more that it is now, it was quite visible, they were all around me then; I had a friend, a Mrs. Lewis, that was in the back room next the road, and the waggons and carts began to come; she threw up the back window and screamed out Murder and Thieves, they went into the room to her, they said, you blasted b - h, if you do not hold your tongue we will blow your brains out; she then ceased making any further noise, He took me with his two hands, he led me down stairs to him where the treasure was and to unlock the outer door of the house into the court; I unlocked it, I believe, and I do not know how many men rushed in; I pointed to the bureau, and told them that the money and plate was there; then I went up stairs to bed. The bureau was locked; they had got a dung fork and broke it open.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not part with the keys to them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see them break it open. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see it broke open. A. Not till the next morning at day light, about eight o'clock, I could not get up before. I then saw it was broken open, and there were three pocket books gone; in one was six guineas in gold, and a note for sixty pounds, I had been looking at it the day before; a note for fifty pounds, and another for twenty-six pounds. There was missing from the bureau, a silver coffee pot, and twelve silver tea spoons, and different spoons for casters, and a watch, and I do not know how many other silver spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of any of the other people besides Prendergast. - A. I cannot swear that I do; one of the men had a black face; his features were very much like one of Prendergast's sons, but I do not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the coffee pot the lid. - A. Yes, the lid was to it, it was complete.</p>
               <p>Q. What other persons were in the house as part of the family, you have mentioned Mrs. Lewis. - A. There was a Mrs. Akenhead, she belonged to Mr. Sharp the engraver, many of you might have heard of him, she was in his employment and for her health, she happened to be down there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any of them any fire arms. - A. I cannot tell, they said they would blow Mrs. Lewis's brains out, but I did not see any.</p>

He happened to come into my house one evening between ten and eleven o'clock, it is pretty nearly two months ago, my husband was up in his chair, sitting by the fire, I was in bed; he said he was going on board a ship, and that he would throw his life in his hands if Mr. Purcell would be so good as to assist him, he would tell him where the property lay, and he would shew him where it was. He said that he had none of the property, and there were seven of them that went to a farmer's house in the country, and that the property lay near the Edgware road, and he mentioned that there were some of it in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention how far the farmer's house was from London. - A. He did not. I got up and said he had no business in the house, and Mr. Purcell bid him give him down the names of the people that did the robbery; he said if the property was brought away it could be sold, he was going on board a ship, he could not stop in town.</p>

            . - A. Yes, going up to the garret stairs, I heard a voice say lye still and be asey, we will not hurt you my good master. I said to Kitty what shall we do, she said come up here; I went immediately up to the garret, a dark garret adjoining to her's, we continued there about five minutes, then we went into her own room where she slept. I wished to get out of the garret window to secret myself in the gutter but she would not let me.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean she persuaded you not. - A. She persuaded me not, she said I should catch my death by going there; she directly asked me if I had brought up my watch with me, I told her no; she asked me to let her go down and fetch it, I told her she should not, I was afraid she might be seen. She knew that I set a great value upon my watch and therefore she asked me to let her go down, I refused, and she did not go. After a little while, her master, Mr. Bell, called her to come down and get a light, he called several times, and she cried very much and told me that she was afraid to go down, she was afraid she should get murdered; I told her she had better put on some of her things if she went down, which she did, and some man cried out is the light coming; on that she went down and took a light. When she was gone down I heard her speaking to Mr. Bell, and just at the same time I heard the men go into my room (either one or two); I heard one say here is a bed, here must be somebody, where are they. I heard Kitty come up stairs into the first floor, I heard Mr. Bell call out Kitty where is my key. When she was down stairs I thought it was the key that she had in her pocket that he wanted; as she always used to lock up the spoons and the mugs before she went to bed. It was not that key, she did not give him any key at all; then I heard a shriek of murder both from Mrs. Lewis and from Kitty. I could not tell where Kitty was at the time; I heard a man come running a part of the way up stairs, but what he said I do not know, it was apparently after her. I was so much alarmed I could not stand any longer, I flung myself on her bed, and some man that was out in the garden said, come we must be off.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of your watch. - A. I left it in my bed underneath my pillow when I went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When you come down stairs again after the men were gone did you see whether it was there or no. - A. After the men were gone I went into Mr. Bell's room, they called me down and said I might come down now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it when you went into your own room. - A. No, nor a pocket handkerchief, that was not there. Mrs. Harrison and her husband were in the house before I came down, and a carter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the state of the bureau. - A. The drawers were all out, and the papers were throwed about the parlour. Mrs. Harrison examined them very much, I did not because I had no clothes on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Franklin that lived in the neighbourhood. - A. I have heard of him; Mr. Bell has pointed out the place to me, it is called Oxgate farm.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there was any connection between Mr. Franklin and the prisoner at the bar. - A. Prendergast used to work there, and while, I was at Mr. Bell's, he employed him two or three days.</p>

One woman would be able to rob him; I work hard and honest for my bread, I worked along with Mr. Franklin, I believe he is in court, and if he heard me do any thing that is wrong, I will give you leave to do what you may do; and that rascal who is now confined in the house of correction, has that lady's watch, if there was a good charge made.</p>

            (to prosecutor) It was in the month of September that your house was robbed. - A. I swore it in the indictment, and I believe it was; I then swore to an hour.</p>

             was not apprehended till the 17th of December. - A. I knew it then. I told some confidential friends, it was such a crime that I thought it would not be credited, till there were some corresponding circumstance. I was as cool when he came two days after the robbery, when he came and had his pint of ale and some cold victuals; there were some things brought back on the Sunday morning, that were stolen; I had a deal of it returned; I thought I might have all or the principal part come back. I knew it was him, and I told my neighbours, I told several that he was the man that came up the ladder, with a lighted torch in his hand, in a bladder. I likewise told you that I had not a minute's rest in this leg, it was in consequence of his weight in falling when he crushed the sash.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell some of your confidential friends. - A. The next morning, before twelve o'clock, I told Mrs. Harrison and Mrs. Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt now. - A. No; as I told your lordship, I could have run him through as easy as hit my finger, but I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did his daughter live with you after the robbery. - A. Till they fetched her away. I saw the danger, I put her in the room behind mine, facing the Edgware Road; there I put her and there she was. I thought I might have passed it off, and that they would have brought the things back.</p>

               <p>Q. Have any of the things been brought back. - A. Yes, I have had above twenty ounces of plate sent back, and a suit of mourning, and I do not know how many things, and I thought I might have passed it off, but the impression it has made, has never left my mind to the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps the daughter continued to live with you till the father was taken up. - A. Till after, there she is, I told her if she would take care of me I would make her happy, but so perverse was she in all her ways.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Franklin. - A. I do, he lives at Oxgate, near to my house. I had the farm once myself that he lives in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do know what servants were in his employ. - A. Yes, I knew the eldest son of Prendergast was, and I believe him to be a good young man, and Prendergast was employed by Mr. Franklin and sometimes by me.</p>

            . (to prosecutor) Did not you mention whoever went into the window, he broke the sash, and his hand was cut, and there was a great deal of blood in the house the morning following. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw me the next day and I shewed you my hands. - A. You did not come near me on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. I was at work the next day, and Mr. Franklin he saw my hand that it was not cut. - A. I tell it openly in the court; that man's hands are not clean in this business. The ladder that they broke in at my window, he came down and looked at it, he said it was not his, but his was broke, and it was placed at my window when I went out to buy something for dinner; when I came back the ladder was gone. Now this man, there he is, he came and saw the ladder, and he sent one of his men to fetch the ladder away, after he had disowned it; he said it was Grindall's ladder, and that Mr. Grindall has got it.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say now, that the man who smashed the glass of the window, did cut his hand. - A. He did, I did not see his hand cut, but I saw the blood on his hands; I saw Prendergast when he led me down stairs, and when he was leading me out of bed; I am positive, I shall be out of time very soon; I held down the sash with my hand, but I was not cut in any way.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner at the bar on the night of this transaction, was he at your place. - A. I cannot say whether he was or not; he slept in my loft when he was there, whether he was there that night I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him the day after the commission of the robbery. - A. I did, I was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that he was at all charged with the fact at that time. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Or suspected. - A. I did not till Mr. Slade, a farmer just by, came and informed me that Mr. Bell's house was broken open. I was down in the field where Prendergast was spreading a manure, I stood looking at him one or two hours, and two more men where with him spreading the manure.</p>
               <p>Q. Having no suspicion you could not be called upon to examine him. - A. No, I had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak with respect to the condition of his hands. - A. I saw no cut at all in the least; I did not examine them, I saw no plaister on them.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow street. On the 15th of December, as Valentine and I were coming across Bishop Bonner's fields, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, we met the prisoner with a cask on his shoulder, we asked him what he was carrying there, he said table beer; he said he was going to take it some where; we asked him if his master knew of it he said about a fortnight before he had asked him for some, but he did not believe that his master knew of his bringing it away that night. We took him to Mr. Keen, he said he knew nothing of it, not had he give him leave to take it.</p>

               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Keen gave me leave to drink some beer in the brewhouse, which I saved; I had to get up at four o'clock in the morning to go to Whitechapel; I thought I should want some beer and some victuals before I went out, and I took that cask. I had saved that beer up,</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

I saw her going out of the shop, I overtook her about thirty yards from the house, she had a long Bath cloak on; I told her that she had taken something out of the shop, she said that she had nothing; I pulled the cloak open, I saw nothing, and shaking her petticoats, she dropped eleven handkerchiefs from between her legs. I took the handkerchiefs up, and took her to the watchhouse; I gave charge of her, and I left the handkerchiefs in the custody of the watchhouse keeper.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my shop on the 13th instant about twelve o'clock, she said she wanted six pair of black silk stockings for an undertaker; I shewed her four or five papers of silk stockings; just after she came in I had four different customers come in, and I was obliged to leave her a little now and then to one customer in particular, I was obliged to leave her to shew a piece of flannel, when my attention was again directed to her. I saw a paper of black silk stockings which I had shewed to her, all of a heap, and every pair discomposed. I took them pair by pair, and folded them up, she was sitting by at the time on a stool. I found there was but five pair, with two pair that she had thrown by, that she intended to buy; that gave me a suspicion of her. I thought there should be six or seven pair from my observation before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the appearance of her being in the act of stealing. - A. No. After I had this suspicion she had looked out one pair more, she would leave three pair, and as I seemed busy she would call in again in about ten minutes, if I would make out a bill; she put only three pair by, and that excited my suspicion stronger. Upon her telling me this I told her rather in a peremptory way to stay till I had served my other customers, she did so; I then said to her, as you said when you first came in that you wanted six pair, and you have only looked out three, suppose you look out the other three pair; she said I would oblige her very much if I would send some to America place, Baker street; I then desired her to walk into the back parlour, she did so; I told her that I suspected she had stole something, I should send for a constable to search her; she directly produced a pair of black silk stockings from her muff, which she acknowledged was my property, and sell down upon her knees and begged for mercy. I sent for an officer and took her into custody.</p>

               <p>Q. When she produced the stockings you took them from her. - A. Yes, and I know them to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140045"/> mine, I threw them across the table in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the officer take them. - A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he came. - A. About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body present. - A. There was my wife and two or three neighbours came in before the officer came. I certainly received a pair of stockings from the prisoner, which are my property, and I put them on the table; somebody gave them to the officer. They were handed about, they had my private mark on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your wife at this time. - A. I cannot say. I am positive that she was not in the shop during any part of the time.</p>
               <p>Q. There were four persons in the shop. - A. There were four or five different persons in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What observations they made you do not know, whether they suspected her or not. - A. I suppose they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not be angry. - A. I am angry; I gave you a direct answer.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them entered into a kind of discourse with her; is she here. - A. She said they were cheap.</p>
               <p>Q. I only want to know, as you are angry, whether you will venture to swear that those other three customers knew any thing of it. - A. I cannot swear that they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a considerable suspicion of her. - A. Not at first, not till I folded up the five pair of stockings and found one pair short.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that you entertained a considerable suspicion of her, and then you attended to two or three other persons, will you swear that she did not take the stockings at that time. - A. She could not, I will swear it positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your manner before her as angry as you are to day; you said you addressed her peremptorily. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You frightened her may be. - A. No, she did not seem to be such a sort of a lady.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that she burst out in tears' and fell upon her knees and begged for mercy; you was very violent. - A. Not half so violent as you are now.</p>
               <p>Court. Conduct yourself decent and answer the questions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Had you said any thing about this prosecution, about what is called a Tyburn ticket. - A. I asked if the woman should be convicted whether I should be entitled to one.</p>
               <p>Q. And you hoped you should get one. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I caution you now the first time, have not you said that if this woman was convicted you hoped you should get a Tyburn ticket. - A. I did not express a wish, I only asked if a man convicted a woman whether he should be entitled to a Tyburn ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. You expected it; I have not had any positive answer, I ask you if you convicted this woman did not you expect to have it. - A. I should have applied for such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Should not you expect it.</p>
               <p>Court. Attend to the gentleman's question. - A. I expected it; I should have applied for it, I do not know whether it would be granted to me or no</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Did you at any time make any promises to the woman to favour her. - A. I told her husband that if in case she was convicted I would recommend her to mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time before she fell down on her knees did you promise her any thing. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you any suspicion of this woman being at all about to steal your stockings till you had attended this woman that wanted this piece of flannel, and you observed this heap of stockings had been discomposed. - A. No, otherwise than the general suspicion that I have of every body that comes in the shop unless I know them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know who this person was. - A. Not in the least.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Thames police. On the 30th of December I was sent for when I went the prisoner was standing at his own door, when my brother officer and I went into his house; we asked him where the watch was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who asked him. - A. Gillmer; I heard the prisoner say something about going back to the privy, I told him not to let him go, we would search him first; I looked down and saw the watch chain; my brother officer directly tore the watch out, pocket and all.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I work in ballast lighters. Upon the 30th of December; I went to my work about twelve o'clock, my wife always knows me to come home at high water, she expected me that night, and coming into my own bed chamber I catched this man sleeping in my own bed where my wife and I sleep together, I catched him by the breast and asked him what business he had there, he did not speak a word to me, he appeared to be very much in liquor. There was a watch laying upon the table at a distance in the room, I took the watch, I could get no sense of him; I took this watch till I knew what he come about. I went up stairs, having a strong suspicion of jealousy, but finding her locked up in one of my lodger's rooms I went away. In the morning after my going away to my work, he arose and went up to where she lay, and sent the woman out of the house and had connection with her in the bed. I never denied having the watch to the officers; I put it in my pocket only to find the man out; he fetched this Mr. Walker and swore against me, and that he was captain of the Canary; he is neither captain nor owner, nor does he belong to the ship. At the time of my imprisonment in Clerkenwell he lived in my own house with my wife, and took her from me. He came up to Newgate to tell me if I would not prosecute him for having to do with my wife and give him some money, he would not appear against me. I have witnesses to prove the same.</p>

            . You are an officer of Worship street. - A. I am, I went on Monday the 8th of December in the afternoon, with Vickrey and Bishop, to a house situated in Brewer's Yard, Chick Lane, I left Bishop in the front part of the house; I and Vickrey went round the back way, and went into a stair case, that led into a room where the prisoner was sitting, two women were in that room, one he said was his wife. I asked him if he lived there, he said yes, he had lived there a twelvemonth and paid 8 s. a week. I asked him if he had got any thing there, (I believe them were the direct words) he said no, I looked into a cupboard of the left hand side, and in a minute or less, Vickerey said it was all right. I then from that called up Bishop, bolted the door, and in one minute I saw Vickrey lift up a board, and take out this (producing the leather howzells) from between the ceiling below; they were handed to me, and I put them on a table, I believe there were eight of them, and I knew eight were lost. I then says to the prisoner, how came you by this, his answer was, I know nothing about them; the prisoner was secured instantly, and in coming away, he said, I wish you would go up stairs for they had been brought in there by a little boy, that found them in the necessary. I went up stairs, I tried the door of the room, it was padlocked; then I took them to the office; they were sworn to.</p>

In the morning when I was coming down stairs, I saw two boys in the privy, I asked them what they had there, they said that they had some leather that they found in the privy; they said it did not belong to them; I asked them what they wanted, they said they were going to call a drover up that lived there, if I was a mind to have it, I might have it; when the officers came the drover was out; the drover came up to the office to me, I asked him for the boys, he told me he would bring them, but the boys have gone on board a ship this fortnight.</p>

On the 6th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop making motions that he wished to see something for handkerchiefs; I left the prisoner and went to look for the articles, and when I returned I perceived him putting something in his pocket. I afterwards saw his jacket pocket projected out very much, and from the manner of his keeping his arm down, I suspected that he had stole something. I called Mr. Holford from the other side of the shop, he immediately went up to him, and took the chambry out of his pocket. The prisoner at first said it was his; upon Mr. Holford shewing him the mark, the prisoner endeavoured to get away.</p>

They are made strong and of beech, to bear journies.

               <p>Q. Did you ever see her before. - A. No, the prisoner came the next morning to redeem part of them; I detained her, and sent for an officer, and took her into custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 19th of December this woman called upon me and said that she had been robbed, and that she had found the property at the pawnbrokers. I went with her to the pawnbroker's and desired him to shew us the property, which he did; I desired that if any person came for the property to stop them and send for us, and the next morning as I was going down the street I met Mr. Garrard and an officer with the prisoner. I desired them to bring her back to me to go and search the girl's lodgings, I went and searched them, she was a long while before she would shew me where she lived. In her lodging I found this handkerchief and shift, which the prosecutor swore to be her property. I asked her how she came by them, she said they were her own. When I brought her to the office I asked her how she got in this place where that property was; she said that she broke the door with a chisel, near upon three o'clock, and went immediately to the pawnbroker's. I searched her; in her pockets there were one half guinea, two seven shilling pieces, and a five shilling piece, which she said was her money she pledged the things for, and a great number of duplicates.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The shifts are mine; one is a calico one, and it is torn, and the other is joined across the loins; that is my sheet, it is a calico sheet; the petticoats are mine, and the spoons are mine, five of them are brighter than the other, and one is bent by wearing of it more than the others; the gown, handkerchief, and the shawl are mine; they are all my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to this woman's house, I took a chisel and opened the door, I went and took these things out of the drawer.</p>

On the 7th of this month, about half past six in the evening, a man and woman came into the shop, and the prisoner followed behind; he stood behind the man and woman for a little time, and looked over their shoulders to the person that was serving them. I stood at a short distance from him and looked at him all the time, from the first of his coming into the shop till I saw him take two cheeses under his arm; he went out of the door with them; before he went out of the door, I called out that man has got the cheeses, stop thief. They never turned their heads. or else they could have stopped him before he had got out. I run out of the shop after him, I saw him turn to the right, he turned up a court, there he dropped the cheeses, both of them. He ran out again immediately, ran across the road, turned to the left hand, and was taken at a short distance.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 7th of this month, in consequence of any thing that occurred, did you go up stairs to search her box. - A. I did, Mrs. Barker and one of my journeymen went with me. I asked her for the key of her box in the parlour, before I went up stairs; she said that she would take me up stairs and open the box herself. When I got up stairs she pretended that she had left the key in the kitchen, she went down stairs and came up again, and said that she could not find it, she must have left it in the room; she went away again, and took me to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140050"/> bed room twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her box. - A. In the bed room. After she had been in the kitchen a second time, she said she could not find the key, she desired me to break the box open with the poker, which she took from the kitchen in her hand; after a great deal of hesitation she put her hand into her pocket, took out the key of her trunk, and likewise the key of my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she then. - A. In the kitchen; this was the duplicate key, we have two keys to the warehouse, they are kept in a secret place in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any business either in your shop or in your warehouse. - A. No. When she gave me the key she opened the box, and this kerseymere pelisse laid at the top, it is an article that I took in pledge, with a muslin gown; these two articles were missing. I found this shawl in the box, and this cloak I believe to be an article that was in the warehouse; this silk cotton handkerchief was in the box, and four duplicates of things pawned at other pawnbrokers; on these things being found in her box she begged for mercy and went down on her knees, and hoped I would forgive her, and attempted to run away, and said she must have been in liquor when she took them. She said that she had taken the pelisse the evening before I had detected her.</p>

Yes; I heard a knock at the door, I answered it, it was between five and six o'clock; the prisoner and another boy came in and asked if I had any braces, I told him yes, to walk in; I took them up to the braces, the other boy looked at a pair of silk patent, he asked the prisoner if he should have them, the prisoner said he did not care, he told him to try the braces on his shoulder, and while he was trying them on the prisoner at the bar went out of the shop; going out of the shop he made a stumble, the other boy said I dare say my brother George is only gone out to make water, he said he would call in the morning, and he went out of the shop. When they were both in the shop the prisoner at the bar was behind the other boy just by the curtains.</p>

In consequence of that I sent for an officer directly. When the officer came he dropped on his knees and begged that I would not send him to prison, for he knew nothing at all of it.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of some information that you received you went to him at the watchouse. - A. Yes, and he said he would speak the truth; he said that Mears and Hayes were the two persons that applied to him in the morning for some barilla, and Hayes and Mears were the two persons that drove the cart and horses away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you answerable, Mr. Briant, for the delivery of this barilla. - A. Yes.</p>

             TANNER. - Mr. Gurney. I believe you are clerk to Mr. Briant. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Harding in his service as a carman - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. On the seventh of January do you know what cart he had that day. - A. A blue cart. We have two blue carts, the other was not out on that day; Harding came to my house about four o'clock on that day, he told me he had lost his cart and horses and barilla. I asked him how he came to leave his cart and horses; he then told me that he had not had a bit of victuals the whole of the day, that he went to get a bit of bread and cheese and a draft of beer, and while he was gone his horses and cart were driven away. I then went immediately and informed Mr. Briant. It was near four o'clock when I first heard of the horses and cart. I went immediately after them, and did not see them till eight o'clock. On my return home I saw the cart and horses in the Minories, they were going home, in the custody of Mr. Kee's men, and the barilla was gone. I immediately went home, and the prisoner was in the stable with Mr. Briant. I fetched an officer and he was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go with Mr. Briant to the watchhouse. - A. I did; the prisoner then said he knew nothing about the horses and the cart and the barilla, he said he did not know how they were taken away. He afterwards sent for me, I went to the watchouse to him, he said he was very sorry for it, he would tell the truth; he said Mears and Hayes were the two men that drove the cart and the horses with the barilla away, but where they were gone to he could not inform me. Mr. Briant was outside of the watchouse, he came in and heard him say it; he said it twice over. He said that Mears had applied to him for some barilla in the morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What partners are there in Mr. Cleaver's house. - A. Samuel and

               <p>Q. Did you lose two pound weight of iron nails. - A. Yes. On the 15th of December last, between eight and nine in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop for an hinge, that he had left for an alteration. In consequence of what my shopman informed me; I followed the prisoner to his master's shop, he went in at the door of his master's work shop. I went in at the house door, I told his master, Mr. Stone, that he was suspected by my shopman, I and Mr. Stone went to him; I told him that I was informed by my shopman that he had robbed my shop; he said he had not. I told him that I thought he had something in his coat pocket; I put my hand into his coat pocket, and I pulled out two papers of nails; one is marked by my shopman, and the other by my wife; then he fell down on his knees and begged for mercy. When I went for an officer, he ran away; I pursued him and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that quantity of nails. - A. They stand me in two and two pence.</p>

               <p>Q. While he was in your shop are you sure that he did not buy any nails. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Will you swear that those nails found upon me were your property at the time they were found upon me. - A. Most assuredly they were.</p>

            One of them is. On the 15th of December the prisoner came into the shop while I was there, I kept my eye upon him, I saw him put his hand in the place were these things were; I informed my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that the packages of nails now produced were in your shop that morning. - A. To the best of my recollection they were. I never sold him any nails of that sort, they are shoe nails. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140054"/> saw nothing of him after he went out of the shop, till he ran by, and my master after him, crying out Stop thief; he ran down Falcon and Bird court, I went round the other way, I found him behind a cart, I told him to stop, my master came and took him by the collar. Roberts said; for God Almighty's sake Mr. Hornby, save me from utter destruction.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came out of Mr. Hornby's shop I went to Mr. Stone's shop, I pulled off my coat and left it hanging up in the shop; there is a man that works for Mr. Stone that would take my life away, he might as well have put them in my pocket as well as any other man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they meddle with any of the goods. - A. They did not appear to meddle with any, but my suspicion arose from the trouble they gave me. I missed the waistcoat off the line that minute they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen it. - A. Just the minute before they came in. I went out after them, I met them coming up my court, in a direction from Drury lane playhouse; the prisoner being the nearest to me I catched hold of him by the collar and brought him into my shop, I then taxed him with robbing me; he said he was very sorry, he would give me any recompence.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did I not say that I did not know that the property was stole at all. One of the young men gave it to me about three or more streets off. I should not have come back to the court if I had known it had been stolen. - A. That was after he was out of my shop, going to Bow street. The clerk asked if any body had access to the shop as well as myself, I told him my wife had; at the same time before I accused him of the waistcoat, I asked her if she had sold any thing; she then described this waistcoat, and that it was hanging in that situation.</p>

From information, I missed nine cotton handkerchiefs from the door, on Thursday the 15th of January, about three o'clock. I hung them at the door a quarter of an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140055"/> hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that they were not sold. - A. They were not; I pursued her, she dropped down on the pavement just by White-hart court; whether it was for concealing the goods or by accident I cannot say; when she saw me she jumped up and ran away. I caught her with the goods upon her, and when I caught her she threw the goods about a yard and a half from her. I took her down to my employer. Mr. Thwaites ordered me to take her to Hatton Garden.</p>
               <p>- BAKER. I am a single man, I lodge at the Broad Arrow, Grub street, I am a smith</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Holborn on Thursday last. - A. I was, about three o'clock. I saw the prisoner fumbling about the handkerchiefs at Mr. Thwaites' door, she unpinned the tickets from the handkerchiefs; I was across the way, I had suspicion that she was going to take them, she rolled them up in a bundle; then she put them at the back of some more linen that was at the door; she stopped about a minute and a half, till the people passed, until she had an opportunity of taking them; then she put them under her blue apron, crossed the way, and went up White Hart court. I came over and acquainted Mr. Thwaites of it, and I saw her taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bundle then. - A. Yes, it was rolled up.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know no more of it than you do at this moment; I was very much in liquor when this gentleman laid hold of me. I have got this child, and I work very hard for my living.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. You mean the foot path. - A. Yes, this was the day before Christmas day. I saw this man speak to a milkman, what he said I do not know; the milkman put it upon the top of the prisoner's back, when I saw him go off with the cistern; I went round Fitzroy market and met him, I said what are you going to do with this cistern; by Jasus, he said, I do not know; I said, my friend carry that cistern back where you took it from and start off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he carry it there. - A. No, I told him to clap it down upon a bundle of hay that was just by, and start off directly; he took the knot off his shoulder and began to run, I knocked him down. I secured him myself and took him to goal.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not perform your promise with him, you told him to start off, and after he put the property down you knocked him down. - A. He tossed it off his shoulder and injured the cistern.</p>

I worked at Hendon half a year, I came out of Warwickshire; when I came out of Stevenage at five o'clock.

With that we parted, he made one way with his horse and cart, and I made the best of my way home; I went on Tuesday. On Sunday I met him and another man coming together, with that this here man asked me if I would drive his horse and cart. I told him I was going to London, he asked what he should give me, I told him I would have half a crown; It was not Field that told me so, it was this here other man that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140058"/> asked me to drive the horse and cart.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing happen to your property on the 10th of November. - A. Yes, I went to Covent Garden about eight o'clock in the morning; when I returned I found the door was wide open.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave in the house. - A. Nobody. I have a girl that comes in the morning and goes home at night; I have been married fourteen years, my wife has been dead two years. I locked the door, and left the key in the door, as I have frequently done before, expecting the girl to come every minute.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you absent. - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body going with you to Covent Garden. - A. Yes, there was a man that was with me, that I was in company with at the public house the night before. I foolish enough asked him to go home and sleep with me, he accepted of it; in the morning, a little before eight o'clock, I got up, and the prisoner did not attempt to get up. I said to him Wilson (he said his name was Wilson) you must get up, I must go to Covent Garden for some things that I want in the shop, you cannot stop here; he got up, and we both came out together, out of the shop door that opens into the passage, and I left the key in the door, expecting the girl to come every minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you came out together had the prisoner any opportunity. - A. Not at that time; we went out together, as far as the end of Bedford street; at the end of Maiden lane he was going to bid me good morning, I said stop a minute, if I have any halfpence I will give you something to drink, so I gave him two pence, I said get something to drink, or lay it out as you think proper. He wished me good morning and said he was much obliged to me indeed. I went on to Covent Garden, he went on to Maiden lane; I returned from Covent Garden in about a quarter of an hour, I found the door wide open, I was not much alarmed then, because I thought the girl had come. I looked in the parlour, and saw the girl was not come, I was rather alarmed, I went into the parlour, I looked round and missed my watch, that was hanging on a hook at the wainscot.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it there. - A. Just before I went to Covent Garden, I saw it that morning; I looked further, and I missed my great coat and my close bodied coat, two hats, and a silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else at that time. - A. There was a new pair of gloves in the coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these articles last. - A. I had pulled them off the night before. I saw them in the room the night before I went to Covent Garden. I made some little enquiry at the pawnbrokers, I could make no discovery of what I had lost, so I gave it up. On the 9th of December, about a month afterwards, this

               <p>Q. There was no acknowledgment made to you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual when you go out to leave the key in the door. - A. I have done so many times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober the night before. - A. I had been drinking, but I was sober enough, I knew; he was an entire stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take a stranger home. - A. When we came out of the public house he said he did not know what he should do for a lodging, I said I can get you a good lodging for a shilling at the watch-house, he said he had no money. I foolishly observed that I slept by myself, that he might go and sleep with me if he thought proper, and he agreed to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any liquor at the public house. - A. Yes; he had some halfpence. The prisoner took the liberty of sitting down, he put his hand in his pocket and took out some halfpence, and insisted upon having something to drink, and some of the company made it up half a pint of gin together.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch you have seen since. -

            Yes, we took him down to the pawnbrokers, and there I saw the watch and a coat that was pledged at the pawnbrokers; the silk handkerchief he acknowledged that he had sold.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of that. - A. It cost me seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the gloves since. - A. No, they are worth half a crown; they are new, I wore them only three times. - The hats I have not seen since; one was a very good one, the other an indifferent one; they might be worth about fifteen or sixteen shillings together.</p>

I asked him what Mr. Hincks was, he said he was a lawyer's clerk; I knowing Mr. Hincks, as we were going along to St. James's watchhouse, I said how came you to rob Hincks, it struck me this man was the man. Going along Jermyn street, I put the question to him again, how came you to rob Hincks, he answered as soon as ever I saw you I knew I was done; says I what have you done with the things, then says he I may as well tell you, I know it is all over with me. Walking on, before we got to the watchhouse, I put the question to him again; some he said he had sold, and some he had pawned, and he was very sorry that he had robbed Hincks; he said he sold all the things in the street, except the coat and the watch, and them he had pawned, and the tickets he had tore in St. James's park into small bits. I said, I suppose you have pawned them in Westminster; he said very near to the abbey one, and the other was further up, but the name of the street he could not tell, nor the the name of the pawnbroker's. I then put him in watchhouse, and I went and informed Hincks of it; Hincks returned to me in the course of the night. I took the prisoner the next morning along with me to shew me the pawnbroker's. Going along he said the pawnbrokers were very deep; as he had not got the duplicates he must manoeuvre it well, otherwise we should not find the watch. When we got to the pawnbrokers he asked for the watch, and the watch was produced, and he wanted ten shillings more money on it, that pawnbroker's is in York street, I forget the man's name. Hincks was with us, he saw the watch, and he knew it to be his watch; we went to the other pawnbroker in the Sanctuary, by the abbey, and saw the coat; we found only one coat, I took him to the magistrate, and the pawnbroker produced the things.</p>

The prisoner pledged the watch on the 10th of November, I believe it to be him to the best of my knowledge; he is so much disguised now that I cannot swear to him, but by his features I think he is the man. I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it. - A. A silver watch. I advanced one guinea and a half on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a judge of the value of watches. - A. I suppose it to be worth three guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at any time after that. A. I saw him when he came with the constable, and asked for more money on the watch; then I thought it was the same person, but I could not exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. What more money did he want upon it. - A. I think five shillings, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it was him that the officer brought to your house. - A. Yes, that I am quite sure of. I produce the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you let him have a duplicate for leaving the watch. - A. Yes, he had a duplicate of the watch. I have had the watch in my possession ever since.</p>

Yes, I know it to be mine by the watch-string, it is a black string that I usually wear, it was rather two long, I tied it in two knots to make it shorter; I likewise know it by the maker's name; I have had it three years, it cost me four pound ten.</p>

No, nor I did not suspect him, while he was in the shop; as I was returning from the other side of the shop, where I had been to get some other waistcoats to shew him, the prisoner was going out of the shop, and immediately after he went out I missed a piece of toilenet from the shop window. I went out to look after him; I saw him about a yard or two off, I went after him and stopped him, I opened his coat and found a piece of toilenet, I took him into the shop; I called John Hall from the inner room to come and detain him; while I went for an officer he got away; as I returned with the constable I met the prisoner, the constable then apprehended him. I am sure the toilenet is my master's property, I had it in my hands two minutes before he came into the shop.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Hampstead. On the first of January last, at half past four o'clock in the morning, I stopped a cart with a quantity of hay, which the prisoner was driving; I asked him where he brought it from so early in the morning, he told me Edgeware, I asked him how he came there with it, it was quite a contrary road; he told me he brought it through Hendon, and up North End hill, which if he had he must have crossed the box that I was watching, and which I knew he had not done, that gave me reason to suppose the hay was stolen. I then stopped him, he told me that he could call the master of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Before he said that, did not you tell him it would be better to confess. - A. Yes, then he called Jem three or four times, the man came, and he refused to be taken; he asked him what occasioned him stopping, he told the watchman, he asked the prisoner to give him the whip out of his hand, to knock me down; making use at the same time of bad language. I pulled out my pistol and took him in custody, and let the prisoner go on with the team; he offered me half a guinea first, then a guinea, not to say any thing about it; I refused to take his money, he told me he brought the hay from Needham, I asked him if he knew the man that was driving the hay, he declared he did not before that morning; he said he was going with the hay to Mr. Price's at North End, and I saw the hay unloaded there.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose team was it. - A. Mr. Price's</p>

On the 5th of January about ten o'clock, the prisoner came in for work for her husband; I gave her work, and she went away; we missed a pair of shoes immediately. I went after her and could not find her. At three o'clock she come for some more work, and brought some work in. I observed the shoes as they lay when she came in, fifty pair, I had packed on a box and they lay as I put them; I stooped down to pick up some soles to give her, and on rising up I found one pair of shoes gone, the top pair; she went out of the shop about twenty yards. I brought her back, I told her she was a thief, she had stolen some shoes; I ordered her to open her apron, then she dropped the shoes down, she went on her knees and begged for mercy.

I told him I should get blame of the gentleman, it would not do for me; then he dropped this crow out of his hands; when I had got hold of him, my partner took the crow up; the saw was afterwards found in the garden where he was, and the knife was found about him.</p>

I found that he had taken him, I made to him as fast as I could, and after I got up to him, he dropped that iron crow out of his hand; he begged very hard for us to let him go, he offered what few shillings he had in his pocket, and likewise his watch, and asked the number where I lived, and he would call upon me; we took him to the cage, and after that we went on the premises, and found the lead, and the saw laid just by the lead.

               <p>Q. Did you see him do all this. - A. Yes, I was in the cupboard, which commanded the whole of the shop. I looked through a broken window; he made the till fast, he returned the instrument from whence he took it, and went into the bakehouse; I opened the shop and went into the bakehouse to him, and demanded the money, out of his right hand waistcoat pocket, which he had taken out of my till; he then took the money out of his waistcoat pocket, and gave it me. I took him to the watchhouse. I will not swear to the money, only the manner he took it in.</p>

I went home on Sunday afternoon to my father, I told him that I wanted my small clothes mended, I told him I did not like to ask my master, because he was mean enough to deny me. My father gave me half a crown. On Tuesday I got up to work and went down stairs, and cut off a piece of cake of gingerbread, I was hungry; with that my master thought I was robbing the till.</p>

               <p>- DURANT. I am quartermaster on board the Worcester. On the 15th of December, late at night, I am the boatswain's mate went below to make our bed; we saw a pig of lead secreted under the cable, we removed the lead into a place of greater security. The next morning four lumpers came on board; they looked for the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar one of them. - A. I cannot swear that he was one or no; they looked for the lead, and not finding it where they left it they lit a candle and found it; there were four persons, they came down, found the lead, and took it away to the Lazoret. In consequence of some noise I went down, I saw the pig of lead laying upon the support of the bits, and a carpenter's hand saw about an inch into it; there were three men rushed out against us. When we went in, the prisoner at the bar came to me; he says, d - n you, I know you are down to it, but we will splice it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time might this be when you went there, after you saw four men take the lead away. A. A quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner made that observation, what did you do or say. - A. I said not for a thousand guineas; I will not have any hand in it, and I would advise you to let it alone, or else you will come to harm. I left the Lazoret again, and returned in about ten minutes; after that I found it there the third time, and then the lead was nearly cut in two, all but half an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other division in the lead. - A. Only one, nearly cut off to make two pieces of it; says he, d - n me, we will cut it off, then says I you must stand to the consequence. I then left sight of the lead, and immediately they took possession of the lead I gave the information.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did the lead weigh. - A. One hundred, one quarter, and fourteen pounds; they divided it to carry it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going my round, and just opposite of this gentleman's house I found this lead, I then looked up to the house, and there I spied the prisoner. I sprang my rattle, he jumped down from off the place; I was not so far from him as I am to you; I pursued him. As soon as he came nigh another watchman he catched him, I never lost sight of him. I told King to mind the man, and I went and fetched the lead; we matched the lead with the place, it is exactly the same.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he get up. - A. I do not know how, I think he must have help. We went back to the place where the prisoner was upon, we found his hat and his knife; the next morning he said the knife and the hat were both his.</p>
               <p>- KING. I heard the other watchman spring the rattle, and I stopped him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was about eleven o'clock when I was coming from my sister's house, when I heard the rattle spring; somebody jumped off from the top, and the lead knocked my hat off.</p>

There were six table spoons on the table at dinner; they were given into her charge to lay on the table for supper, and when the cloth was laid for supper, there was only four remaining, and she had absented herself. On Friday we traced her to Price's apartments in a court on Saffron hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find her there. - A. The prisoner Thompson and Price were there, they said Kearn had been there a few minutes before. When I came in I said it was of consequence to them to find her, otherwise they would be implicated, for that she had robbed me, I did not say of what. The prisoner Thompson then said she would find her, she could find her in a few minutes (I had Mr. Dobson with me at the time); I told her I would stay till she returned, she said she would be back in a few minutes; the prisoner Price sat in the room but said nothing. This happened at twenty minutes past twelve. I waited in Price's room with Mr. Dobson, till about a quarter past one, I then went home, I left Mr. Dobson in the room. I returned about half past two, and continued there till near five; I at last supposed Thompson had gone to tell the girl to keep out of the way. I told Price they were doing wrong, for I was determined to find her. I then said she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140065"/> had robbed me of two table spoons; Mrs. Price said if she had she was then in the house. If it had been for a trifle she would have concealed her, but she would not for so much as that; with that the girl came out, she had concealed herself behind the fire place in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Kearn came out. - A. Yes. An officer was fetched, he searched her, and found nothing upon her. I saw my spoons on the Saturday before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>MR. DOBSON. Q. Did you go with Mrs. Millington to the lodgings of Price. - A. I did, the prisoners Thompson and Price were in the room, I went away; on Mrs. Millington's return, and on my returning again, I found

On the 26th of December, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I went to Price's lodgings to apprehend Kearn, I searched her and found nothing on her; I searched Price, and in her apartment I found nothing there. The next morning she confessed to me, and in consequence of what Kearn told me, I found Thompson, she told me she had them of Kearn to pawn for Kearn.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I sold the gentleman no spoons; I have been eleven year's in his Majesty's service, and I was wounded in my head, and I lost an arm with lord Nelson. I cannot bring to my recollection any thing of the kind, being very much intoxicated in liquor; if done, it was not meant to defraud. It is the very first crime that ever I have been charged with.</p>

On the 12th of December, at about a quarter after ten at night, as I was going along, I saw them three in Spital fields market, I saw them at a cheesemonger's shop, outside, placed where they put the shutters in the day time, I and Mr. Hart desired them to come out; they were not dressed as they are now, they were meanly dressed indeed. They came out, and we took them to the watch-house, and Mr. Hart will tell you what he found upon them.</p>

               <p>- HART. I am a constable. On the night of the 12th of December last, the prisoners were brought to the watchhouse by the patrol, Taylor, Foley, and Kightley; the patrol told me he found them under the place where the cheesemonger's shutters were placed, and while the little one was running away, the shirt fell out of his breeches, here it is. I took this child's great coat from Kightley, from under the waistband of his breeches, and this shirt and check apron were buttoned under the coat of Taylor; I asked them how they came by them, they told me they found them by Well street playhouse. We did not believe the story; the next morning they said two other boys brought it to them, who represented that they had found them there, and they had kept them for these two boys.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the other two boys. - A. No; and the next morning they said they took them from a China shop in Old Gravel lane. Mrs. Briscoe afterwards came and claimed them; they told us that the other two boys were their companions, and we brought them up by the order of the magistrate.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 12th of December, at six in the morning, as I was going to put my horse out, I saw the prisoner with a firkin on his head, just by Petticoat lane, it was very dark; I asked him what he had got there, what is that to you he said; I said I wished to know, he said he should not tell me. I seized him by the collar, made him put the firkin of butter down, and took him to the watchhouse. When he was before the magistrate he said he was a porter, he was hired to carry it. I wished to find out the owner of it, I advertised it; by that means the owner came to my house.</p>

               <p>CHALES MEDLEY. I live at the Black-horse, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose a sack, two bridles, and a breeching. - A. They were brought to me on the 7th of January, they were kept in a small room called the ostlery, at the Bolt and Tun in Fleet street; the prisoner had liberty to sleep there, he was employed by a tenant of mine, he was not my direct servant.</p>
               <p>- COLTSON. I am a constable of Hornsey, I took this man at Hornsey on the 6th of January. I saw an old man offering these things for sale, I saw the old man deliver the things to the prisoner, I asked the prisoner how he came by them, he told me he bought them in Smithfield, but he could not tell the man, he said he lived at the Bolt and Tun; I looked at the sack, I saw the gentleman's name on it. On seeing that, I secured him and brought him down to the Bolt and Tun; the bookkeeper said he left the yard on Sunday morning. I asked the bookkeeper whether he knew these bridles and sack; he said yes.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them in Smithfield market, the Monday in Christmas week.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Ever since I have been from that unpleasant situation in Woolwich, I have been in his Majesty's service in the Isle of Man, stationed under lieutenant Clark; and by my wife being taken remarkably ill, I came to see her. I was in a vessel, laying along with the Princess in the river; I received a letter from my wife, I went to see her; in consequence of that, a bosom freind went and sold me to these gentlemen. I was a midshipman under lieutenane Clark, and that your lordship will see. (A letter was handed from the prisoner, to the court.)</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you served on board. - A. Two years and seven months. I was a midshipman on board his Majesty's tender, Three Firends, stationed the Isle of Wight.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you leave of absence. - A. Yes.</p>

On Monday the 8th of December, the prisoner came to our shop just before we shut up, and pledged a cloak for two shillings; we had folded up a great coat, it was on the counter just by were she stood, she took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take it away. - A. No, it was missed soon after she was gone, and suspicion fell upon her; I saw her the next morning about nine o'clock, I charged her with it, she told me she knew nothing about it. I sent for Mr. Griffiths the officer; she then owned that she pawned the coat at Mr. French's, White's row, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>- FRENCH. I am a pawnbroker; on the 6th of December, about half past eight in the morning, the prisoner pledged the coat with me for five shillings.</p>

I very well recollect how she paid me, a guinea, a half, two half crowns, and seven shilling piece; I had other change in the till.

I told the prisoner I had missed them, he said it was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140070"/> great pity, and he wondered very much how it could be.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss these things. - A. I missed them sometime before he left me. In November I went to his house. in East Smithfield; I found the property there, he was not at home when I went in, and we did not begin to search till he came in; and then he said we should find some feathers, and that would be all. He said the parasol he had found in the shop. I said Bell you and I have always had a good understanding, till you went away in the manner you did; how is it you have these things; he said he took them for his own security, he said he had offered the feathers for sale, and could only get a guinea for them, or else he would have sold them. Then we went to Marlborough street. When he was with me he was to have fifteen shillings a week and his wife was to have fourteen shillings a week, during the exhibition.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. This man came to your service in January, and staid with you till April or May; were you at home all this time. - A. No, I was a good deal out.</p>
               <p>Q. For pleasure or business. - A. Only on my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Where might you have been at these times. - A. In Buckinghamshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you in Surry. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By the bridge. - A. I was in the bench.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated you went to Marlborough street. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not the first time you was there. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In what character have you always appeared there, as prosecutor; do not hesitate Mr. Brookes, did you always appear there as a prosecutor. - A. No, I appeared there in consequence of having a dog, it was a false charge, the gentleman swore to it. I was obliged to give bail to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not satisfied with the magistrate, you were tried at the sessions, and there the magistrates were of the same opinion with the magistrates at Marlborough street. - A. I was convicted of a penalty and I paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. This man's wife was to have fourteen shillings a week, was it ever paid. - A. I never knew what was due to them, they received money at the exhibition, and paid themselves. I do not believe that I am in debt to them a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never say so. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of May when he left your service, and till the month of November, you never saw him. - A. Yes I did.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you first see him. - A. A little time before he was taken into custody; I said Bell I am very glad you are come, for Mr. Richardson charges a bill of twenty pounds which you have paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Was that after he left his lodgings in Rupert street that he called at your house. - A. I did not know where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you had been robbed. - A. No, I did not think it right till I knew where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you send for a constable. - A. I was in great business.</p>
               <p>Court. What was that great business. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had some great business, I insist upon your telling the jury - A. I had some particular circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that great business that prevented you from sending for a constable; do not you know the obligation of an oath. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. An oath is to swear to the truth and the whole truth and nothing but the truth; as you have told the jury that you had business so extremely pressing, what was that business so extremely pressing. -

            Why I was in fear of being arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that prevent you from sending for a constable, I will have an answer to the question, or I will send you to Newgate. - A. I had an execution in the house, I was obliged to attend to it, I can say nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how dare you say you had business to attend to; your goods then was in the hands of the sheriff's officer. - A. I considered that was business of consequence to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the business that prevented you from sending for a constable. - A. It was. I was going to get the money that was owing me, and if I had given charge of him I must have gone to Marlborough street.</p>
               <p>Q. What prevented you from making the charge the second time you saw him. - A. I wish to make up this matter of twenty pound between Mr. Richardson, if I had taken him up I did not conceive he would have come respecting the twenty pounds that he had paid, he went to Mr. Richardson, I was not satisfied with the account that he gave to Mr. Richardson; I immediately after that searched his house, the next day or the day after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You have now spoke to two times of that man coming to your house. - A. I do not think that he came more than three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take him up the third time. - A. The third time I think I met him in Cranbourn alley, and the third time he called at my house I was so ill.</p>
               <p>Q. This makes four times you saw him without taking one single step to apprehend him. - A. I cannot state whether it was two or three times.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray, sir, when you met him in Cranbourn alley did you come up to him, or he to you. - A. We met, I cannot speak positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you no remembrance of what he said to you in Cranbourn alley (witness paused), are you dumb or deaf. - A. To the best of my recollection it was about Mr. Richardson's business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation about the money you owed his wife. - A. There was nothing passed about money, but Mr. Richardson's business.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you swear that he made no demand either upon account of his own service or his wife's in Cranbourn alley. - A. I cannot say that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to put your credit to the jury, whether this man who is suspected by you of having robbed you, made any demand of money due to him. - A. I cannot recollect; the conversation that passed was only momentary in Cranbourn alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if it was momentary you must recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140071"/> what passed. - A. All that I cannot recollect respecting money due to him, says I, Bell this business of Mr. Richardson's must be made up.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr Brookes do not imagine the court to be imposed on in this way; I ask you upon you oath did he in that momentary conversation make any demand of money due to him, aye or no, I ask you again, do you swear that he did or did not demand money at that time. - A. I cannot swear whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You did not turn back to apprehend him. - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner came to you on the 29th of October at Butcher-hall lane. - A. Yes; he said he was an interpreter in the pay of this country, he said he wanted eight pounds to pay some foreigners, as he had not time to go to the banker's; I had known him some length of time, he had breakfasted and dined with me when I kept the Three Pigeons, and he saying he was an interpreter in the pay of this country, and seeing some Turks come after him, I let him have this eight pounds, that was soon after breakfast; on the same day, after he had dined, he returned, and said what he would have for supper, for four or five Turks; he requested to have a private room, as they were not allowed to drink wine, or to see wine drank, and he wished me to let him have fourteen pounds, that would make up twenty one guineas, and that he would make up the money when he came to sup with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him have that. - A. Yes, in gold and notes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had not represented himself an interpreter in the pay of this country, you would not have lent him the money. - A. Certainly not, I would not have trusted him from his own appearance.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever get the money back again. - A. No, he never returned to the house again. One evening a little girl that I had in the house said she had just seen him; I went out and saw him in Cheapside, I followed him into the Poultry, I asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140072"/> why he did not return and pay me the money, as he said he would, and have the supper that was prepared for him.
