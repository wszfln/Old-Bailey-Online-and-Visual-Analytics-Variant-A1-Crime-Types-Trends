I found another piece in the closet; I asked him how he came by it, he told me he could account for it elsewhere, he said he would shew the magistrate the bill of parcels, but he did not think it worth while to shew me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. (to Watson) Have you examined them pieces of canvas? - A. Yes, I have measured it, and I find it corresponds; I believe it is the same canvas.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you measure it? - A. The day after it was taken; they measured thirty-nine yards each, including the remnant, I chalked it on the piece, it is now erased by being handled.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say you believed them to be your master's property? A. Yes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150004"/>Q. Do you mean to swear it? - A. Only my belief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. (to

            .) Do you think that is the canvas that you lent to the prosecutor? - A. Yes, to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you speak to belief only, because the Castle Lee fell a great quantity of this sort of canvas? - A. Certainly. I will not swear to it. There was thirty-nine yards marked on the bolt; but here is another circumstance, the gentleman that we bought the canvas off, is a quaker, it has the London number of their stamp; he always books what canvas we buy.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that of your own knowledge, have you got the bill of parcels here? - A. No, but the man shewed it at the justice's.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do all bolts of canvas run nearly those yards? - A. They run from thirty-nine to forty, and so on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have not got anything particularly to say. In respect to my stealing that, I never did. I never stole an article in my life. I had these goods, that the prosecutor took away from me, of Captain Sharp, for which he traded with me for soap and candles; unfortunately for me, he is gone up the Straits, and I cannot bring him forward.</p>

            . From information I received on Friday the 13th of December, about two minutes before nine o'clock, I stopped the prisoner as my men were going to breakfast. [The prisoner worked for me about three weeks]. I told him there was some metal missing, I took the skirts of his coat up, and found both his pockets loaded, I knew it was metal by the weight of it. I asked the prisoner where the ingot piece was, he pointed to his stomach. I then sent for a constable, the constable came, he searched him, the piece of ingot was found near his stomach, the prince's metal was principally in his pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these pieces? - A. I set the value, 11 s. 6 d. they are worth more.</p>

Yes, the screw that fastened the padlock, had been cut off by some instrument, the lock of the door was forced open, and two lower drawers in Smith's room were forced open. I tried the scissars and the chisel to the drawers that were forced open, and they seemed to fit the marks on the drawers that were cut; the drawers were cut terribly.</p>

             sworn. On Saturday evening, in the early part of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, returning home from Lamb's-conduit street, with three of my neighbours, I heard a woman call out Stop thief; I was in the beginning of Guildford Place.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Guildford Place a square or a street? A. It joins Lamb's-conduit-street; it is a street, there is about two houses on each side, I believe. When I heard the woman cry out Stop thief, I saw a man running towards me and my neighbours, but seeing of us he took another course, he ran strait down Guildford-street till he came to Carolina Place, then he turned up there; I immediately ran after him, he dropped a bundle.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pick it up or how? - A. I stepped over it and pursued the man; when I came to the end of Carolina Place, there was a man had got the prisoner at the bar in custody. I heard the prisoner ask the person that is here a witness, what he had hold of him for, he had done nothing; he was taken to the watchouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When you set about pursuing him after you heard the woman cry out Stop thief, had you your eye upon him the whole time? - A. I had till he came to the corner of Carolina Place, then I was obstructed by the corner of the Foundling wall.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that interruption continue? - A. I suppose about five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had turned the corner, and by that means could see, what did you observe? A. Before I got to the corner he was taken into custody; he was then at the other end of Carolina Place when I got up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of observing his dress? - A. No, not till he was taken; it was rather a cloudy night, the moon was shining, but not bright.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any authority from you at any time during the time that he staid with you to sell any of your goods? - A. Never, not even my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose these articles in the indictment? - A. I did, with others; these articles are, the cobler and his wife, and the Egyptian mummy; I missed them about eleven months ago, when the prisoner was in my service; he left my service about the beginning of last November, I found the figures in Mr. Lee's house in Sloane-street; on the 3d of January, I found them by accident, the servant brought them down to me in mistake for something else; when I saw the cobler I knew it to be mine, I turned it up, I said is there not a fellow to it, the fellow to it was brought part of the way down stairs, I went into the dining-room, and there I saw the mummy in the corner of the room, standing up with a bust of Homer upon it. I looked to the mark and knew it to be mine; Mr. Lee was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before your servant went away, sold either of these in your shop, the cobler and his wife or the mummy? - A. Never to Mr. Lee or any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Mr. Lee? - A. I did not see Mr. Lee till I got the warrant; on the same day the prisoner surrendered before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe to Mr. Lee the marks? A. I did before I took them out of the house; the mark is two crosses, I put the mark at the bottom of each about eleven months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this your own dwelling-house that you live in? - A. No, it is my own property.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150008"/>Q. You are in partnership with your father I understand? - A. Yes, but this is a business that I took up on my own account entirely, about a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man your servant? - A. Yes, he came from Mr. Blore, I think he told me that Mr. Blore gave him twenty-eight shillings a week, I agreed to give him thirty; I agreed to give him task work, as he said he was rather low.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing due to him for wages? A. No, nor any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. He is your debtor? - A. I think he is, I have got an account of every farthing that I paid him, he generally over drew, he went away without paying me, in fact I told him I was disatisfied with his conduct; I suppose he owes me twenty pounds at least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever make a demand of more than that of you; did he ever employ an attorney? - A. He did, for the sum of 196 l. 12 s. 6 d. after he had left my service.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make a public charge against him previous to his leaving you? - A. No, I depended too much upon the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had Mr. Lee dealt with you at any time for figures? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When was the demand made by the attorney for the prisoner? - A. About three weeks before this, after he had left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discharge him or he leave your service voluntarily? - A. I told him that I had missed a great quantity of figures, and then he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he made this demand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say that you had lost these things, and that you should prosecute for it? - A. Never.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. We understand you live in Sloane-street. These things that are now produced were found in your house? - A. Yes, I purchased them of Mazzoni. I purchased the cobler and his wife about nine months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Mazzoni before? - A. I knew him at Mr. Blore's, I had bought these things, he makes these sort of things. About nine months ago, as I was going home, I met Mazzoni, I mentioned to him that I had got a bust that I wanted bronzed, he made a reply, I have left Mr. Blore, but I will do it for you as well as any body; he did it and brought it home, I paid him for it, I asked him what I should give him for the two figures, describing them to him, I do not recollect what he asked me, I told him I would give him a guinea, he made a demur at the price, I said you may let it alone; I saw him at Mr. Hamilton's shop about three weeks before they were brought home, there was a large figure there, I went in and saw Mazzoni, I asked him about the figures.</p>
               <p>Q. What figures? - A. The cobler and his wife; he had agreed to my proposal, he brought them home in about three weeks after I saw him at Mr. Hamilton's shop, and I paid him, I think it was a guinea or twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Hamilton go with you to the the figures? - A. No. Mazzoni told me as soon as it was dry to take the bronze he would bring it me home.</p>
               <p>Court. Could Hamilton at the part of the shop that he was at hear that? - A. I cannot say, the shop is large, this was at the bottom of the shop, and Mr. Hamilton never moved.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the large mummy? - A. I had purchased a bust of Homer at a sale in Bond-street; I saw Mazzoni at the top of Sloane-street, I told him that I wanted a stand, describing the stand, I asked him what he would charge for it, he asked me twenty-nine or thirty shillings, I told him I would give a guinea; I called three or four different times at Mr. Hamilton's shop about it, and the servant called Mazzoni down; and once when I called on Mazzoni, Mr. Hamilton was in the shop, I walked down the shop with him and he shewed me the stand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation either about the cobler and his wife or the mummy with Mr. Hamilton? - A. No. I had been in the habit of employing his father near seventeen years to some considerable amount; I called at his father's yard one time about some business, Mr. Hamilton behaved extremely rude; I was always shy with Young Hamilton after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. The cobler and his wife was made for you by Mazzoni by an order which you gave? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards gave him an order for that mummy, which was made and brought home to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. While the mummy was making you went to the shop as you had done several times before; did Mr. Hamilton see you? - A. He must, Mazzoni was then in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you converse together in whispers? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw this figure, and Mazzoni<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150009"/>was telling you that it was not fit for bronzing, and when it was dry enough he told you he would bring it home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in Mazzoni's conduct that appeared he was telling any thing secret without the knowledge of his master? - A. Certainly not; I considered him the principal in these things; I did not know that Hamilton was in that branch of business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon Hamilton as his master? - A. I did not; I looked upon it that he did it upon his own account.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Mazzoni was there Hamilton did not do any such things? - A. No, the shop was fitted out as a mason's with marble chimney pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Hamilton after the prisoner had been examined at Marlborough-street? - A. I asked him what could be his motive in taking these steps; he made a reply that he brought him in a bill above an hundred pounds; what could he do?</p>
               <p>Court. What employment did you suppose the prisoner at the bar had under Hamilton? - A. I looked upon him as making these figures for Mr. Hamilton, or any other person that should engage him.</p>
               <p>Q. Not as a servant? - A. I never looked upon him as a servant to Mr. Hamilton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My first connection with Mr. Hamilton was through his coming to Mr. Blore; he told me repeatedly if I would leave him he would take me in partnership; I told him I would not leave Mr. Blore to work as journeyman at another place, but if I could be in partnership I would leave Mr. Blore; under that colour he took me. I knew Mr. Lee previous to my going to Mr. Hamilton, I had done some things for him; Mr. Lee met me one day in Sloane-street, he asked me to bronze a head for him; I told him then I did not live with Mr. Blore, I lived with Mr. Hamilton, but I could do it all the same; I went and fetched the head and bronzed it; in a little while after Mr. Lee said he should like a pair of figures, the cobler and his wife, I said I could make them; he said, have you got the moulds, I said Mr. Hamilton bought the moulds of Mr. Blore; I told Mr. Hamilton, and Mr. Hamilton told me to deal with him, for says he, he does not deal with me; I executed the work for him, in a little while after Mr. Lee ordered the mummy, for which I received the money, and Mr. Hamilton desired me to keep it; Mr. Hamilton gave me leave to make any cast that I wanted, for my own use, or what not.</p>
               <p>Court. (to prosecutor) Do you remember Mr. Lee coming to your shop when Mazzoni was there? - A. I cannot remember it; I have seen Mr. Lee stand and look at a large figure that I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection of his coming in the shop and going down the shop along with Mazzoni? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you do not recollect any conversation in the shop between them? - A. No, that I am certain of.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he so employed by you in October last? - A. He was. The consumption of corn in the early part of October, gave me suspicion to think that something was wrong; on the 22d of October I sent for a sack of oats, a bushel of beans, and a sack of chaff, which is the usual quantity that I have had about once a week or ten days, since September; I sent a particular written order each time; on that day I sent my team by the prisoner, he brought back a sack of chaff, a sack of oats, and no beans; I asked him the reason why he did not bring a bushel of beans, as mentioned in the order; he told me that Mr. Knight had no beans, nor had not had any beans for some time past; being surprised at that I went into my parlour and made a minute in my day book, therefore I can positively swear to not receiving any beans on the 22d of October. On the 31st of October, finding no beans come, I immediately wrote to Mr. Knight for my bill, the prisoner only having brought a sack of oats and a sack of chaff, I had given him a written order for a sack of oats, a bushel of beans, and a sack of chaff; I asked the prisoner the same question, he said Mr. Knight had no beans. On the 18th of November, I took the prisoner to Mr. Knight's; Mr. Knight's man stated to him that the beans had been delivered, the prisoner said he never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150010"/>had any beans; when I went into the parlour, he ran away out of the shop. I heard that he was at work at Pinner, I went on Saturday morning and apprehended him, and brought him to town, and lodged him in Marybone watch-house.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am servant to Mr. Knight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 31st of October, the prisoner coming with any order to you? - A. I never kept any account of the day. I recollect his coming on the latter end of October, he came three or four times in October. I delivered each time to him a sack of oats, a sack of chaff, and a bushel of beans; I am quite sure of that.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room? - A. No, he was out at work. I had two officers with me when I searched his chest; upon opening the first chest I saw two shirts, one of which I thought to be mine, and the other I knew to be mine from the mark that was on it, and this half handkerchief was in the box, and this one pound bank note was found laying at the bottom of the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you took the number of that bank note before you had lost it? - A. I had of that and two more about three weeks before I lost it. The officer took the things, one shirt I did not immediately know at the time, but afterwards, on close examination, I discovered it to be mine; he had almost taken the mark out of it. Two days afterwards I brought Stanton, the officer, to the house again, to take the last shirt with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you and the prisoner are both carpenters, did not you both work for Messrs. Wig and Mansfield? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They are people of respectability. You have been discharged from their service since you made this accusation? - A. No, before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always mark your notes? - A. I do not. I was resolved if I had a spare note to lay by I would take the number of it, accordingly I took the number of these notes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you communicated your loss to your fellow lodger on the evening of the same day you lost it? - A. No, I only told the landlord privately, between him and me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you never charged the prisoner with having taken the note before you got the warrant? - A. I never said a word to the prisoner till after I got the warrant; I could not accuse any one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever mention the loss of your first shirt to the prisoner, which you say you lost a week after you lost the one pound note? - A. I believe every person in the house heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. A week after that you lost another; do you think that every body in the house heard of that too? - A. I believe they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your loss must be well known to the prisoner? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you and the prisoner a quarrel before you made this accusation? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not remember bringing some window lead into the house, and putting it into the box which was common to you and him, for which he was angry with you? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not make a complaint to your master about it? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a chest in the room that was common to you and him? - A. Yes, there was a chest of the prisoner's in the room that had but little clothes of the prisoner's in it, and I put some of my clothes in it, such as a coat and waistcoat, but no shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. The key of that chest was always hanging up in that room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to swear that these shirts were not put in by yourself? - A. I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your washerwoman, by the desire of you, put the shirts in that box, when you was out of the way? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was before the magistrate, did you give the magistrate the number of that note? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150011"/>Court. You have been aked some questions about a chest, in which the prisoner said you might put some clothes in, was that the chest in which these shirts were found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And in which there were some of your clothes? - A. Yes. But three weeks before I got the warrant I took them out, and was resolved to keep them out of it, as I suspected him taking the one pound note.</p>
               <p>A. Had you lost the shirts before you took the things out of the chest? - A. No, I had only lost the note before I took the things out of the chest.</p>

             sworn. Q. Do you wash the linen of the prosecutor Denny? - A. Yes, and I wash for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that shirt that the mark is almost rubbed out? - A. That shirt was in King's bundle the last time that I washed it, and I carried it home in King's bundle. Sometimes their linen was tied together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You know of course that red ink will wash out? - A. It will.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge that is laid against me, I know not of one article being in the chest. On Sunday evening he was at the chest till near one o'clock, I thought he was putting in his clothes, as he was in the habit of putting them there, he always had the use of my chest to put in his linen and his clothes. When I came home at one o'clock, my landlady said that Kenny had lost a one pound note and two shirts. I made answer, that he had been out along with the girls of the town as usual; I did not suppose that he had lost any shirts; I offered two or three times to go and look in my chest, but he refused.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there day-light enough to distinguish the features of a man, supposing there had been no lamps or candles in the windows? - A. I do not think there was. I observed the prisoner at the bar with a piece of white goods under his arm, near to Mr. Gill's door, he was not above a couple of yards from the door, and there appeared to be a piece laying on the ground, that had been dragged out of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner alone? - A. I did not see any one with him, observing that I made the best of my way up to him as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see you? - A. I believe he did, he set up a running.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep the piece of goods still under his arm? - A. Yes, I overtook him about forty or fifty yards from the premises, I stopped him, I told him he must go back with me to Mr. Gill's with the piece of goods, he begged of me to let him go, I took him back, and the goods were claimed by Mr. Gill's warehouseman; he was secured.</p>

               <p>Q. Might not the door have been left a jar, by somebody going in, or coming out, between the time that Mr. Gill left the warehouse, and the time the prisoner was brought back? - A. There was no person in the warehouse but me, I never heard the door open, after Mr. Gill went out till the prisoner was brought back, I was only about ten yards off from the door in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How many minutes was it from the time Mr. Gill went out, and the time the prisoner was brought back? - A. I suppose about ten minutes, the door does not latch, it fastens very tight, it requires a great deal of force to push it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other piece besides that which was brought back with him? - A. That was the only piece that was brought back with him, the other piece was partly in doors, and partly out; both the pieces were Mr. Gill's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you loose a pair of trowsers at any time? - A. We did, on the 20th of December, about eight o'clock in the evening, they were found on the prisoner. The prisoner had been in our service many years. I had him stopped, when he was going to leave the warehouse at night, from information that I received from Mr. Steel. He was brought into the counting house to me, I told him that I had reason particularly to suspect him, that we had lost au article that could not be taken out of the warehouse by fair means, he said he knew nothing about them, I was welcome to satisfy myself that he had not got them about the warehouse in any part that he was employed. I told him that I must first be satisfied that he had not got them about his person; upon which he immediately said that he had, and put his hand under his apron, and apparently from the forepart of his breeches; he took them out.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - A. Seven shillings; I knew them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What could he earn? - A. He lived with us about twelve years, he had standing wages, twenty-five shillings a week, besides an handsome acknowledgement at Christmas; his pay was constant, whether ill or well.</p>

Yes, after the prisoner went out of the house we had suspicion that he had a pot about him; Batho the constable followed him by Mr. Hewitt's directions, he was brought back to Mr. Baker's counting house, he was searched, there was nothing found upon him. I went into the shop where he worked, and under the bench where he worked, I found one pot of Mr. Knight's, and one belonging to Mr. Hewitt, they were both bent quite flat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose the halfpence on the 16th of December? - A. On the 15th I had suspicions of him, I sent for the constable on the 16th, his box was searched in my presence by the constable; the prisoner was standing by at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon opening of the box what did you find? - A. We found several papers of copper, some half-crown papers, some five shillings, and some two shillings; one half-crown paper I could swear to; the prisoner said at the time the paper might be mine, but I could not swear to the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to having wrapped up halfpence in this paper? - A. I have sworn to it; there were three or four half-crowns tied in such paper.</p>
               <p>Q. It is such paper as all cheesemonger's use? A. No, not all, it is part of an old book.</p>
               <p>Q. You buy all sorts of paper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose other cheesemongers buy all sorts too? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All you can say merely is, that you wrapped up some halfpence in some waste paper, and this paper is of the same description? - A. I know it is mine.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know that paper is yours? A. Because the other papers were tied up at the same time, and they correspond one with another, I know by the appearance of the hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. This kind of paper was laying about your shop to be used? - A. It was behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore the prisoner being in your shop he might get it for any purpose that he wanted it for? - A. He might.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. I am a constable, I apprehended the prisoner, and searched his box; I produce the paper parcels of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find that parcel of copper money? - A. At the bottom of the box, he unlocked the box himself. I told the prisoner I thought it was strange of him having this quantity of halfpence; he said that he carried on business for himself at Hounslow, and had taken them in payment; the master said then he could swear to the paper, that he had told the prisoner to tie up between two and three pounds worth, and one of these parcels was the parcel that was missing; the prisoner said he might swear to the paper, but he could not swear to the money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutrix has taken a false oath; the first time that I saw her she was very much in liquor, she was put to bed, and some person went to bed to her, she said she was come to town to walk London streets; she had lost her character at Feversham; I am a wife and a mother, though I have a blackguard husband; I took the liberty of putting these things on, as any body might have done the same with my things.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there? - A. He was in the passage of the house close to the room; the prisoner told me it was his room; I asked him who the veal belonged to, he said it belonged to him; I asked him if anybody slept in the room along with him, he said nobody but himself; I asked him who brought the veal there, he said he did not know, he did not bring it there, it was his property. I employed a man to take it to the office, Mr. Hunt saw it there, and said it was the veal he had sold to Mr. Greenfield. At seven o'clock in the evening Mr. Greenfield saw it at the office, he examined it with another breast of veal, it appeared to be the same kind of veal.</p>

The prisoner was called up stairs, and she said they were gone to the washerwoman's; I said to her, you have no right to send the sheets to the washerwoman's without your mistress's leave. I asked her where the washerwoman lived, she would not tell me; she said that was nothing to me so long as I got my things back again. I then fetched an officer to search her, taking the key of her room with me, in the mean time she went up stairs and broke her room door open, and when we searched her, we found a vast number of duplicates, and two duplicates were found upon her of sheets belonging to me.

               <p>Q. Is Mrs. Williams a housekeeper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and tell me whether the prisoner at the bar ever came to your mistress's house? - A. I think that is the same man, I am not quite certain.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - A. I think it was on the 7th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning: a person, whom I think was the prisoner, came to enquire for the place, I told him to walk in and sit down in the hall; he walked in; I asked him where he lived, he told me he lived three years in his last place in the country, I cannot tell his master's name. My mistress called me up stairs, I left him sitting on the bench in the hall, I went up to her bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing alarm you after you was gone up stairs? - A. As I was going up stairs I saw the man open the hall-door that goes into the street. He went into the parlour and took a basket of plate out.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. I do know that I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing? - A. My mistress heard the plate basket move.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the parlour door open into the hall? - A. Yes, and the dining-room, they both open into the hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was you at the time that you saw the man open the door that leads into the street? - A. I saw him from the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do then? - A. I missed him out of the hall then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out of the door? - A. No, I could see the hall from the two-pair of stairs, and I looked down to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon this, seeing him open the door? - A. I ran down stairs and called my fellow-servant.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got down stairs, was he in the hall? - A. No. I ran into the parlour, and the plate was missing from the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the plate in the parlour? - A. That morning, I carried it into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you placed it? - A. On the tray-stand in the basket.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in it? - A. There was a silver bread basket, a silver slop bason, two silver waiters, two silver salts, two silver salt spoons, two teaspoons, one desert spoon, one table spoon, eighteen silver four-pronged forks, a silver soup ladle, a small silver skewer, a silver snuffer stand, a silver butter knife, a pair of silver sugar tongs, and two silver bottle stands.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they entirely of silver? - A. No, the rims were silver, and the bottoms wood.</p>
               <p>Q. These things you were carrying in the morning, and you missed them when you come down stairs; did you ever see them again? - A. Yes, we got them all again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner go into the parlour? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go out of the parlour? - A. No, only go out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner brought back to the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The person that came to enquire for the place was not brought back? - A. No.</p>

            ? - A. I was below stairs setting the breakfast things for my mistress. In consequence of the alarm I ran up stairs, (I heard my mistress call out); I looked round and I could see nobody, the door was nearly shut, I pulled open the street door, and as soon as I got out, I saw the prisoner at the bar with the basket of plate under his arm. He was about half-way up Welbeck-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he moving with it? - A. He was running with it, he had the basket and the plate in it. I ran after him down Great Marybone-street. A gentleman that is here, hit him on the breast with an umbrella, and the plate fell out of the basket and I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was it to him when you came up to him? - A. I was very near to him when it fell from the prisoner's arms, I came up to him directly and picked it up, I carried it home to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner? - A. He was taken to Marybone watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Welbeck-street in Marybone parish? - A. I believe so, I do not exactly know; he was taken to that watchhouse. I took the plate home. It was taken to Marlborough-street. I went in the coach with it and my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the plate that you picked up? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150018"/>- A. A bread basket and slop bason, and tea spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. One or two? - A. I cannot say. Two waiters, a pair of bottle stands, a small silver skewer, a snuffer stand, a pair of sugar tongs, one desert spoon, one table spoon, eighteen four-pronged forks, a soup ladle, a pair of salts, a pair of salt spoons, and a butter knife.</p>

             sworn. Q. Did you see the prisoner on the 7th of September? - A. I believe I did, he is extremely altered now by dress, or something or other, I cannot take upon me to swear that he is the same man; I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Between ten and eleven o'clock where was he? - A. On my going along High-street, Marybone, I heard the cry of Stop thief, by Franklin, a former witness; upon hearing the cry, I turned round immediately, and I observed a person, whom I believe to be the prisoner at the bar, running towards South-street.</p>
               <p>Q. He is so altered in appearance now that you cannot be positive as to his person? - A. Extremely so indeed; he had at that time a basket (which is at this moment in court) under his arm, I heard a great jingling in the basket, I supposed it to be glass bottles at the moment, I endaevoured to stop him, but thinking he might knock me down, he run so violent; I had an umbrella in my hand, the point of the umbrella went against his chest, he ran so violent that he ran against it, and every article fell out of the basket.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the articles? - A. Those are the articles that I believe came out of the basket (pointing to them).</p>
               <p>Q. What did they appear to you to be? - A. I conceived them to be plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see them drop down? - A. By the umbrella coming against him, the basket flew off his arm, and a great jingling was the consequence; I believe it was that plate.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was something that jingled, the question is whether you saw what was the contents of the basket? - A. Not till after the prisoner was secured; immediately the prisoner passed me; I followed him instead of looking to anything that come from off his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he run from you? - A. About two hundred yards up South-street, until he was stopped by the last witness; immediately upon his being secured by the last witness, I accompanied him so far as High-street only.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the road to the watchhouse? A. It is, at the corner of High-street, I left the prisoner, and went to Mrs. Williams's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the cry of Stop thief by Franklin? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that was running? - A. I saw no person but the prisoner and Franklin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man that you stopped the same person which the witness Fynnymore took into custody? - A. I believe him to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that he run this two or three hundred yards, how far was you from him? - A. I was very near to him almost the whole time; I dare to say he gained upon me at one time forty or fifty yards, or rather better.</p>
               <p>Q. During the whole time did any body else join in pursuit besides you and Franklin? - A. There were several persons endeavoured to stop him, but I could not perceive any body forwarder than me that was running after him, there might be but I did not see them; I was certainly the most forward at the corner of High-street; in South-street there possibly might be another or two following him before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150019"/>me, I cannot say that positively, I did not see them to notice them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot speak to the person of the prisoner having passed you with the basket on his arm? - A. I do not speak positively to the man, I have every reason to believe it is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not asking you collateral facts; you are not able to swear that is the man? - A. By no means, I never saw his face so as to make that observation.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he going? - A. He was coming from Marybone-street towards the end of South-street, and at the corner of South-street was the very place that the umbrella hit against him.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was the jingle of glass-bottles? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not the curiosity to see whether it was glass that was picked up or plate? - A. I had not</p>
               <p>Court. There was none running before the man that was stopped? - A. I did not see any running before that man that was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was only one corner that you run the umbrella against him; was there any other corner after that before he was stopped? - A. None.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see the pork in the hands of any one? - No, I saw him put his hand on it at the stall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner when you turned round again? - A. No, I asked my master if he had brought the leg of pork in to be weighed; he said no; I run down the alley to see whether I could see him; not seeing of him, I came back, and went up a little higher; I then saw him come down a little alley, only two doors off, I said that is the man that took the leg of pork away to the maid, she was with me; he then run as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the leg of pork with him? - A. No; when he ran I halloed out Stop thief, as loud as I could, and the watchman came up, and laid hold of him and brought him back; I told the watchman which alley he came down; we went up the alley, and found the pork lying in a corner of that alley, the pork was taken up and brought back to the shop, I knew it was the same pork, there were three of them, they were salted.</p>

             sworn. I am a watchman; on the 21st of December, between nine and ten o'clock, I had been to buy some tobacco, I was going to do my duty, there was a cry of Stop thief; seeing the prisoner at the bar running, I stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else? - A. There was a young man before him, walking gently up Hand-alley, it is a very narrow alley, he could not pass the young man without shoving him down; when I had stopped the prisoner, the lad came up and said, that is the man, where is my master's pork; we found the pork in another alley, where there is no thoroughfare, up against the wall in a corner.</p>

             sworn. I know no farther than the leg of pork being mine, I saw nothing of the transaction. The prisoner at the bar told me it was distress that occasioned him doing this, saying he had three children; I went and found he had none.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He asked me when I was taken, whether it was distress that occasioned me to do it; I told him it was not, I told him I had a wife and three children, but I was not so much distressed as to take his leg of pork, I never saw the leg of pork till I was taken up the alley; I am certain the boy is mistaken in the person.</p>

               <p>Q. What public house was it that you went to get a pint of twopenny? - A. They took me to the White Star; I met with them at the corner of the turning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them before? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have any conversation with them? - A. The public house and wine vaults where I went to get my pint of twopenny was shut up, it was opposite of where I stood with my onions, in the Butcher row, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. You enquired of them where there was a public house that was open? - A. Yes, they told me if I would go down the street with them, they would shew me a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the public house with them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go into the public house? - A. They called out to a person of the name of George, they called George in the street; I asked them what they called George for, they told me that was always the name they called when it was late, because they knew their customers; they came behind me and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at the time they told you the reason of calling out George? - A. In the street, they were by the side of me; I bid them good night and was coming away from them</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to bid them good night, you had not got your beer? - A. Because I would not go any further with them; I catched the shortest of the two with her hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you turned round after you bid them good night? - A. No, I came strait back to go to my things again; I had left a little girl of eleven years of age to mind the basket in the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Being knocked down, what happened to you? - A. The tall one held me by the hair of my head, and kept her hand to my mouth, that I was not able to cry to any watchman or any thing else; my money was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took your money? - A. The short one, she took it out of my pocket apron.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did she take from thence? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150022"/>A. I had five shillings and six-pence, in silver, and I had to the amount of thirteen shillings and six-pence, or fourteen shillings and sixpence, in copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the shortest take all away? - A. Yes, while the tallest was holding of me.</p>

               <p>Q. Why she had not left you? - A. Yes, when she had taken the money out of my pocket, she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did she go? - A. I cannot tell which way she went, it was impossible for me to tell while the other held me down by the hair of my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the tall one do any thing to you? - A. She only held me so, and kept me down by the hair of my head till the short one came back again in about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she hold you down all that while with her hand on your mouth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About ten minutes you say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was as much as ten minutes? - A. Yes, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the shortest came back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she holding of you down when the shortest came back? - A. Yes, she returned with a man with a brown coloured coat on, he fell down a-top of me, and then the girls ran away, I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing away besides your money? - A. My apron, cap, bonnet, and handkerchief, was taken from me while I was held down by the hair of my head, I missed them when I got up, I cannot tell who took them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the man go away after he fell down? - A. In about two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What light was there in this street? - A. no light but the light of the lamps; it was under a lamp where I fell.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw them before that night? - A. No, I saw them on the Monday following, near the middle of Whitechapel, between the linen-draper's and the pump.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you charged them with this, and had them taken up? - A. I looked at them stedfast in their faces; I watched to see where they went, I followed them down an alley to a skittle ground in Windfield-street; when they came there they called George, and some man looked out of the back part of the skittle ground, between the boards where the wood work was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they go then? - A. I do not know where they went then, I turned round and saw no more of them; I went to the office and gave information, and they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. The two prisoners seem to be much smaller women than you; how came you not to get up, you seem to have sufficient strength? - A. I wished to keep my hands rather to myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought proper to lye quiet for ten minutes while this girl held you down, rather than try to get up? - A. What could I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have exerted your strength, and have tried? - A. How could I when she had me down by mere strength.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have tried? - A. I did try.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not understand you to have tried, just now you said how could you; I think if you had tried you might have overcome them? - A. I was afraid to do much, I was afraid of having a parcel of Jews about me; very possible if I had tried I might have lost my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought then it was safer to lay quiet and let them do what they liked with you? - A. I was afraid I might loose my life they took the copy of my husband's freedom out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of your clothes again, your cap or your apron? - A. No, I was obliged to go home bare headed and bare-sided, I had not got so much as a cap to put on my head.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you loose any of your property on the 8th of December? - A. I lost my purse, I was sitting in the bar at past twelve o'clock at night, I was sitting up till my family had put every thing to rights; having been ill for two days I dropped asleep, while the prisoner was in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the prisoner been in the bar? - A. He had been in and out of the bar all the evening, he lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. He had been backward and forward in the bar several times? - A. Yes, he was like one of our own family.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner? - A. I do not know; he said that he had property to receive at the India house, he came into the bar to supper, my family was gone to bed, I was there and he was left there, and when I awoke, he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at supper when you fell asleep? - A. No</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150024"/>Q. What was the last thing that you observed him to do before you fell asleep? - A. He had some peppermint to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been asleep? - A. I might have been asleep perhaps half an hour, I got up and went to bed, I did not miss my purse till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he placed respecting of you when you went to sleep? - A. He sat at a table not far from me, because our bar is very little. The next morning when I came down stairs, I missed my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you felt your purse before you found that you had lost it? - A. That evening, I had given change just before eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you put your purse in your pocket again? - A. Yes, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the purse? - A. Two ten pound notes, two five pound notes, two ones, two or three half guineas, and three or four seven shilling peices.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it that you missed your money? - A. It was near ten o'clock; when I came down stairs he was gone, out of the house; I said to my husband that I thought he had got it, he went out of the house a little before nine o'clock, I never knew him to go out of the house before for the three weeks that he had lodged with me; my husband followed him, and he was brought back again; I see him brought back between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass on his being brought back? - A. My husband accused him of picking my pocket, and he denied it; they took him into the parlour and insisted on searching him; I was present, he refused being searched, they insisted again on searching him, he said it is all right to my husband; when he came into the bar they took the purse from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the purse here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce it (the purse produced)? - A. This is it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is your purse? - A. Yes, the money has been in it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there the same coin that you had in it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the notes folded up in the same way? - A. I cannot say, it was folded up in the same way then as it is now. There is two ten pound notes, there is only one five now (there is one five gone), there is two half guineas, and four seven shilling peices, I am positive that was in my purse.</p>

             sworn. This man came to my house on the 19th of November and he continued there till the 8th of December; during that time I used to let him make free with any part of the house below stairs, he was in the habit of spending a great deal of money, I could not account how he came by it, such as two or three guineas a day, he treated every body that came into the house; on the morning of the 8th of December my wife missed this purse, in consequence of that I made diligent search about the house; to see that it was not mislaid about the house; we found that it was not so, she supposed that he had taken it from her. In St. Martin's Lane I heard of him; he was gone with another man, I sent two or three people after him, at last a man came and said that they had found him at the Green Man in St. Martin's Lane. I went down myself, and took a constable with me and brought him back to our own house, we took him into the parlour and desired the constable to search him, he refused being searched, he wished, he said, to speak to me at one corner of the parlour, I of course heard what he had to say, he said all was right; I suppose he meant as to the money, however he said that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand what he meant by it? A. I judged it to be so; however he wished to speak to me in the bar a second time, after his things began to be stripped off to be searched, I went into the bar, he followed me with the constable, and he gave up to me the purse into my own hands; I took the purse into the taproom, and laid it on the table, and told it out for the constable to witness what it was that was brought back. The two ten pound notes I took of two gentlemen in partnership next door, I backed them; and one five I took of one Betts, No. 4, Fleet-lane, in Fleet-market; I rather objected to it when I took it, they have never been out of my possession since.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they bank notes? - A. Yes; as to the other five, I do not know what became of that; as to the two one-pound notes there is nothing particular on them, I was satisfied that they were good, I took no further account of them; I can swear to the notes that I have marked; I sent him to St. Martin's watchhouse, and from there he was taken to Bow-street, and from there he was committed to Tothil-fields.</p>
               <p>ROBERT - sworn. I am constable; Mr. Dellear came to me on Sunday morning, about ten o'clock; I went with him to the Green Man and apprehended the prisoner, and brought him back to Mr. Dellear.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then? - A. He refused being searched, he wished to speak to Mr. Dellear in the bar, he took the purse out of his pocket, and put it into Mr. Dellear's hand; Mr. Dellear said that was his purse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On that said night, when I was going to bed with my candle in my hand, I found that purse on the floor; I said to myself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150025"/>I suppose I shall find an owner for that in the morning; I sat in the tap-room, a man came in, and says good morning to me, I had spoke to him before; after sitting a little while he says, I want to go out to get my shoes cleaned, he said will you go with me, I said with all my heart, I will go out and get my shoes cleaned; after that he asked me to have some beer, and he and I went into the house together that he had been speaking of, we sat a little while together, and the prosecutor and the constable came in, if I had any intention of going off with it, or had taken it with a design as is represented, I had time enough from three o'clock in the morning till eleven, but I did not intend any such thing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called no witness to character.</p>

In the beginning of September last I had occasion of going into the country; he then had the care of my business and property; that was the time he took my property. A little before Christmas last I catched him stealing some leather; I searched his lodgings on the 28th of December last, I found a new pair of boots there, the prisoner was present, and I had two officers with me; the officers have the boots (the boots produced); this is the pair of boots I found in the room, he had rubbed out the gentleman's name (I had wrote upon them) with vitriol, but when I ripped the morocco lining at the top, I saw there the name of Wilson; they were returned by Mr. Wilson in the year 1804, and they were in my shop till the time the prisoner took them; I always put the name on the front and back privately, they are my boots.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see him cut them? - A. No, I know they are the same boots by a cut in skiving them thin for the binder before they were bound.</p>

On the 18th of December, the prisoner came in the shop between the hours of one and two in the afternoon; he asked to look at some muslin for neck handkerchiefs, about ten or twelve shillings a-yard, I told him I had none so good as that, I would shew him the best I had; I shewed him one at four shillings, he told me that was not good enough, he must go elsewhere and get them; with that he left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more of him in the course of that day? - A. In the afternoon between six and seven o'clock he returned to the shop, and brought another with him who was lustier than himself, he then asked me to shew him to i same muslin he had seen in the morning; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150026"/>reached a bundle of muslins which happened to be a bundle of worked muslins, I untied the string, I said this is not the right bundle; I was turning myself to reach the second bundle, I saw the prisoner go towards the end of my counter which is next to the window; the other young man was near me, to look at the muslin.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you on the counter at that time? - A. I had placed single pieces of cloth and lawn, and two table-cloths, which had stood in the window in the day, the two table-cloths I had placed one at one corner of the counter near the window, and the other at the other; as soon as I had taken the second bundle of muslins from the shelf, I saw the prisoner with his left hand draw the table cloth from off the counter, and with his right hand he shoved it into his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the table-cloth in his hand? - A. I saw him draw it from the window under the skirt of his coat, I cannot say I saw it in his hand, because I had hardly the glimpse of it, but I saw his hand draw it from the window, and I saw his right hand shove it into his bosom, as he drawed it; it appeared from under his coat; seeing what he had done, I threw down the second bundle of muslin, went round the counter, and set my back against the street door; I says to them gentlemen, you have more than belongs to you, I told them they had a table-cloth of mine, which had stood at the corner of the counter, I said it was there when they came in; the prisoner began swearing to me, I told him it was of no use to have words, and seeing a woman passing, I asked her to call the butcher in to my assistance; when I turned my back to let the butcher in, he chucked the table-cloth to the other side of the counter.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him do it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you only suppose that he chucked it there? - A. It was throwed over there by some means or other; my brother came in, he said go round and count the table-cloths; I had them in that morning, I had sold but one of them, I had nine sent in, and one I had sold, seven was on the shelf, and this one which the young man took, I found it doubled up in three creases on the floor; when I picked it up off the floor, the prisoner offered to purchase it of me ask what money I would for it; I told him I could not sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had seen this table-cloth in the situation that you describe? - A. When I went to open the door to let them in I saw one of his side on the counter, and one of my side. There was no other customer in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see if it had sell there, it might have been thrown down? - A. It was impossible, because no one had been there but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was the table-cloth folded up as it lay on the counter? - A. It was folded up as it came from the maker, I had never opened them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it folded up in the same manner when you saw it down on the floor? - A. No, it was in three doubles; by his shoving it in his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of this table-cloth? - A. Five shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sure you do not mean any thing wrong, you have told my lord you are positive that the prisoner chucked the table-cloth over the counter? - A. I am positive he must chuck it over.</p>
               <p>Q. That is argument, you did not see it done? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you leave the gates secure? - A. Yes, the gates were both locked; one was a stop lock, and the other was a little round lock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to the field in the morning? - A. I went about six o'clock in the morning, but I did not miss them till about seven o'clock, when it came day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing with respect to the gates? - A. The gate was lifted off the hooks and just open, sufficient for the beasts to get out, and as far as they well could; it was locked upon a staple, and the staple was a little bent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any hides afterwards? - A. Yes, at Dorking. On the Saturday following I fetched one hide, and the other I saw at Guildhall; I am quite sure they were the hides of these two steers.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the hides that you have been describing were the hides that belonged to these steers, and whether the steers were your master's property? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn: Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a morocco and fish-skin case maker. I keep one of the city stands in Fleet-market. This good man comes there of a morning and does not go away till ten o'clock, and we cannot come in till after the gardeners are gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him there before? - A. Yes, several times; he asked me if I could tell him of a slaughter-house; I told him there was one at the top of Bear Alley, where I have kept a house these nine years. I told him if he would ask for one Mr. Ellis, he would tell him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said by the prisoner about any bullocks to you? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner is the same man? - A. I am sure the prisoner is the man that asked me for the slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it? - A. I will not be positive whether it was Christmas day or the Saturday before; it was about ten o'clock when he put the sage in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever send him to Ellis's before? - A. Never, nor he never asked me such a question before.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a slaughterman living in Bear Alley, Fleet-market? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner: do you remember his coming to your slaughter-house at any time? - A. Yes, on Christmas day in the morning part, before dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring any thing with him? - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - A. He said he was recommended to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who he was recommended to you by? - A. No, he asked me if I could kill him a couple of beasts, I told him yes, I could; he asked me when would be the best time of the market; he should wait to make the best account of them he could, that he had more coming if these answered his purpose, and that he was given to understand that I could set them off in the best manner.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you understand by beasts? A. I understood that they were oxen or steers.</p>
               <p>Q. Steer is a young ox? - A. Yes; he said they wanted a good deal as dressing; I agreed to butcher them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When did you afterwards see him again? - A. I think it was on the Saturday following; he came to me at the salesman's that I told him that I would get to sell the beasts; he came, and made an excuse for not bringing them as he had promised, he was to have brought them on the Saturday. He then asked me if Sunday morning would do, I told him he might bring them on Sunday if he pleased; I asked him what time, he said about six o'clock; I told him six o'clock was too early, I should not be up before seven or eight on Sunday morning. He never brought them on Sunday morning. On Monday morning about twenty minutes before six o'clock, he called me up himself, I got up and received these two steers in question. One was very nice meat indeed, and the other was not sat enough; when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150028"/>he brought them, we put them into the slaughterhouse; he wanted me to kill them then, I told him I could not kill them till day light came; when day light came, I took them to another slaughterhouse, there not being utensils enough to kill them there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you agreed with him for the price? - A. No, I killed them in a common slaughter-house about nine o'clock on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had killed them what became of the hides? - A. The hides I sent to a salesman at Leadenhall-market, and sent word to send the money for the hides to Mr. - , who was to sell the meat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any marks on the hides before you sent them to be sold? - A. Yes, they have got the marks on them now.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the the prisoner again? - A. About one o'clock on the Monday, he then asked me if he could have the money for the beasts, I told him I did not know that they might be sold so soon.</p>
               <p>Q. The hides that you have seen afterwards, and were produced to you, the one which was at Guildhall, and the other at Dorking, were they the hides of the beasts that the prisoner brought to you? - A. I have not any doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the prisoner at the bar being the person who came to you three different times? - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose possession have the hides been since? - A. In the constable's</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not in Kingston that night the beasts were taken; I have witnesses to prove that I was not there at the time, but they are not here.</p>
               <p>Court. You had the beasts in your possession, and was enquiring for a slaughter-house.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Ellis.) You are sure that the hides are the same that belonged to these beasts that come from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you by that time examined the bag to find what was contained in it? - A. I had put my hand on the bag in the street, when I addressed myself to him, and asked him what he had got, and when I interrogated him in the warehouse, as I had done in the street, he said, If I must tell, Joseph (who is another porter in the warehouse) helped me up with the bag, and we were going to make a property of it. A constable was then sent for and he was apprehended. Joseph, was called in, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150029"/>he refused to make any answer. The bag of sugar is here.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you? - A. Four months. I had a good charactor with her, I frequently went out of the house, I cannot say I ever missed any thing during the time that she lived with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in liquor? - A. No, I do not know that she was given to liquor, nor can I account how she unfortunately acted in that kind of way.</p>

             sworn. I keep a pork shop in White-cross-street. On the 30th of December, about ten o'clock in the evening, as I was coming home, I met my wife about twenty yards from my own door, she told me that two girls had run away with all the dressed pork, which had just come hot from the bake-house; I told her that they had just passed me, laughing; I pursued them, I never lost sight of them at all, I stopped them just at the bottom of Chiswell-street; I asked them what they had got, they replied nothing; I told them I must see, I took the piece of pork out of the prisoner's left hand, it was hot (the other young woman that got away had nothing); I then brought the prisoner home and sent for an officer, he took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was your pork? - A. I have sworn to the pork and could swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she contrive to hold it in her hand? - A. By the knuckle, under her coat, the knuckle was not chopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sober? - A. I believe she was sober when I got her home; I believe she is a horse-hair weaver; the tradesmen about where she lives have given her a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went in the shop with this young woman, I did not know her intention, she bought two polonies, when she came out of the door, she put this piece of pork into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150032"/>my hands, I asked her how she came by it, she made me no answer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

             sworn. I am one of the patroles belonging to Bow street. I was going along High Holborn, a little before five o'clock in the evening on Friday the sixteenth of December, I observed the prisoner Jones walking before me knowing of her induced me to follow her at a little distance; before her I saw the other two, they all three met together at a shop before they came to Mr. Davis's; there was some cottons put out at that door a person came out and watched them, they went away; they then went up to Mr. Davis's and stood two or three minutes together before the shop window, all three together; the prisoner Dow and Jones left the prisoner Shaw at the window; the prisoner Shaw took her apron and throwed it over her left arm; I could see her left arm work as if she was taking something into her apron; she followed the other two and went up the hill, she walked two or three yards with them and then crossed over, as she crossed on the opposite side I took hold of her and took her into a shop with this piece of cotton in her lap; I left her with the shopkeeper and went and secured the other two as they stood in the street looking after her; Jones had a piece of print in her lap which I could not get any owner to.</p>
               <p>REES. It is Mr. Davis's cotton, there is eightteen yards and a half, it is the same piece, the number of yards is on it in my own writing.</p>
               <p>Shaw's Defence. I was going down middle Holborn, I met a woman with a red cloak, she asked me if I would do her a favour, I told her I would as far as lay in my power, she gave me this piece of cotton, and told me to go to Turnstile, and she would follow me, I went on, and the officer laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. I had been to buy a new gown, which Crocker took away from me; I know no more of the fact than a stranger.</p>
               <p>Dow's Defence. I was going up Grays's Inn-lane to see what o'clock it was; Mr. Crocker took hold of us, and said I had a bit of cotton.</p>

I did not hear her come down stairs, I rung the bell again, I heard her go down stairs then by my door, which she passed to go to the kitchen, I heard her open the kitchen windows. I am generally up the second in my house if I am well. In about five or ten minutes I heard my house-bell ring, which was my shop boy, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150034"/>sleeps not in my house: she immediately let him in, I heard his voice talking to the girl. After that she came up to my room door, knocked with her finger and then opened the door and came to my bed side; she said come down, your house is robbed, and your gold and silver things are about the floor; she had some in her hand that she said she picked up at the street door. I immediately got up and come down stairs, I looked to see whether my door was wrenched, or bolts broke, or any of the windows were broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing of that kind happen? - A. No, it was as safe as when it was shut up in the evening. I saw some large silver buckles, and one gold ring lay on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any drawer opened? - A. Yes, there was a drawer half open in the shop window, where these things were kept. The gold rings were found afterwards by the officer.</p>

             sworn. Q. You are shop boy to Mr. Dudman I understand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning of the 10th of December, what time did you come to his house? - A. About a quarter to eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came there was the door shut? - A. Yes, and the shutters were all fast as I left them the night before, the prisoner let me in.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened? - A. When she opened the door, she said, the door is upon a single lock, (the chain was not up); I heard her open the spring lock, she said we shall have the shop robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood that the door had been upon a single lock? - A. Yes, immediately on my going in I took the bolts out of the shutters and she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the bolts of the shutters? - A. They were all secured as I had left them. The maid came back to me and shewed me two ear-rings she had picked up, she said they were on the floor, she gave them to me; upon which I told her she had better call master down, I then said, stop a minute, I will see if any thing has gone out of the drawer. I went in to the other room and saw the drawer half open; I asked her if any one had been in the shop after I left it last night, she said no one; I told her I would take the shutters down and see if any thing was gone out of the drawer; upon which she went down into the cellar, I then took the shutters down, and upon examining the drawer, I found almost all the gold rings out of it; I went to the top of the cellar stairs and told her to go and tell my master, she went up, and called him down, he came down; afterwards I saw the cellar searched by Gill the officer, and after he had searched all about, the cellar, he found these gold ear-rings and finger-rings in the saw-dust; they were wrapped up in a knife-cloth in the cellar, were the maid had come from.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated that the door of the shop that she let you in was on the single lock, how was the other door of the shop? - A. That was bolted as I had left it the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any way to get in the house but at the shop doors, could they get in by the kitchen windows? - A. No, nor could they get in the cellar windows without taking the iron railing up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go away? - A. About half past nine o'clock at night, that is my usual time of going away.</p>
               <p>Q. How the door was fastened that you was let out of that you cannot tell? - A. No, the other door was bolted and double locked as we found it in the morning.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer of the Thames police: on Tuesday the 10th of December last, I searched different parts of the house; I then went into the coal cellar, after moving a great deal of wood that was there, I searched a heap of saw-dust in one corner of the cellar, there I found a knife-cloth with a quantity of gold rings wrapped up in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What number? - A. Thirty-four finger rings and forty-three pair of ear-rings and one odd one. These are the rings.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutor) Look at these rings and tell me whether you know them to be your property or not? - A. I know them to be my own writing, the selling price is to them, they were in my drawer the night before I was alarmed of the robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150035"/>Q. They were put upon a paper as they are now with the price written with your own hand? - A. Exactly; on this paper there is three pair and an odd one, they stand me in about six shillings a pair; here is two pair, they are six shillings a pair; here is two pair, they are worth seven shillings a pair; another parcel there is three pair, they are eight shillings and sixpence a pair; two pair five shillings and two pence a pair; two pair at five shillings and six-pence a pair; one pair at five shillings and six-pence; three pair at five shillings a pair; one pair five shillings a pair; five pair at three shillings a pair; there is eight pair more of ear-rings but they are off the paper, they are of different prices, we will say five shillings a pair; and these are finger rings, they are upon black velvet as we keep them in the drawer; there are thirty-four finger rings, from two shillings to ten shillings or eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that these were in your drawer the day before? - A. Yes, I always go round my shop every night, to see that my locks and bolts are right, and my fire and candles out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen these things in the drawer the day before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lives in this house besides yourself; your wife and servant maid? - A. My two sons and one daughter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Very little gold in any of these things? - A. I trust they are gold, I have no rings made but what are Hall marked; we buy none but of the makers.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you swear to them is, you had gold rings of that description on black velvet; supposing any body had brought you these gold rings on black velvet at any other place, could you have sworn to them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore that is the only reason that makes you think they are yours. You have one daughter and two sons, is the other son here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your daughter here? - A. No, she knows nothing about it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called six witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

             sworn. Q. Your are an officer of the Thames police? - A. Yes; on Wednesday the 27th of November I was sent for; I found the prisoner at the Gun public house, in Wapping; I took him into a little parlour and searched him, I found this little screw-box concealed under his waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search his pockets? - A. Yes, I found nothing in his pockets but a few halfpence; when he unbuttoned his waistcoat this box fell out, I unbuttoned one part and he the other, this box fell out from under his left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any holes in his pockets that could have prevented him from keeping anything in his pocket? - A. He had two pockets in his waistcoat that were sound.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him what you were searching him for? - A. I told him that I suspected him of robbing this girl, I did not mention the box, I have had this box ever since, I am sure it is the same that fell from under his arm, and from under his waistcoat, there is a shilling and a sixpence in it, I found that he had changed some gold at the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. That you had only from information, there is nobody here to prove that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutrix) Look at that box? - A. It is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it, there is many boxes like that? - A. This here box we could not unscrew it at one time, we have a stone kitchen, I put it on the ground and put my foot on it, which made it dirty, it was black then, it has been cleaned since, it was black when the officer found it on him.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Gill) Was it dirty or clean when it came into your hands? - A. It was much in the same state then as it is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you done any thing to it since? - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutrix) There is no particular mark to it that you can speak to it? - A. No further than I had it four years, I had it continually under my eye.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a kind of a common box is it not? - A. No, it is not, it is a lemon box.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know it by any particular mark do you? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I know no more of it than this place does, I had half a dozen of them boxes at one time, I do not know any thing of the money, that box was mine, and I had six of them at one place.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prisoner) Is there any person here that knows who you bought this box of? - A. There is one, but he is not come up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

As soon as I went into this man's house, another man that went with me called for a pint of beer; he went out of the house afterwards, and I went up stairs with the prisoner to go to bed; there was some people in the tap-room.</p>

Yes, he shewed me up to bed himself with a candle in his hand; after he went down, I pulled my jacket and waistcoat off and laid it on a chair, the landlord went down and brought up a pot of warm ale, he took the waistcoat off the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the landlord came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150037"/>up with the pot of ale? - A. It was not more than five minutes, to the best of my opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. You had bespoke the ale I suppose? - A. Yes, and I paid him for it too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay him for it then? - A. Yes, and I sent for a glass of good gin and water.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you pay? - A. Six-pence or a shilling, I cannot say, I know I paid the money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in silver? - A. It was in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take your shilling or six-pence out of? - A. Out of my pocket, along with the two notes I had in my pocket, I had some small change in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You had two notes? - A. Yes, One a five and one a two pound, that I got at the commissioners office, at Portsmouth, after I come from the West Indies.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take out these two notes at the time that you paid the shilling or six-pence? - A. Yes, while the landlord was in the room, I took the notes out of my waistcoat pocket; I cannot tell the numbers, I can neither read nor write.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said he brought you up a pot of hot ale when you were in bed? - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Q. Was it then that you looked at the notes? - A. It was a little while before, when I was going into bed, that I over hauled the notes, when the landlord was present, he was standing quite close with the candle in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. And you looked at the notes by the assistance of that candle? - A. Yes, and I put them in my pocket again, while he was standing with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purport of your over hauling your notes? - A. The purport was, that I was perfectly sure that I had them in this purse that I will show you; I separated them and looked at them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the use of your looking at them if you was sure that you had them in your pocket? - A. I was confident, I looked because I would not miss them in the room, and afterwards when I got up; he gave me a half guinea on my watch, when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came from Tottenham-court they were twisted together in your purse? - A. Yes, I meant to take them down to the ship at Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Having laid your jacket and waistcoat on a chair by the side of the bed, and the ale being put there, what happened then? - A. He took the notes out of the waistcoat before my face, after that I said not a word, and I come down in my shirt; I brought a wrong hat down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing? - A. Not a word, I was afraid of my brains being beat out if I was to impeach him at that time of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out of the room so soon as he had taken your money? - A. Yes, and I got up immediately and put the waistcoat on and come down with my waistcoat and shirt, and went into the bar, he went up for my jacket and hat, as I had brought a wrong hat down; upon that I asked him half a guinea upon my watch, and I walked out of the house the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out of the house the next morning? - A. I went out of the house that night and did not come to the house till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go out of the house? - A. The very moment I got the half guinea I went out of the house; I went again the next day to the house between twelve and one o'clock to get my pass to get it signed; I took notice of the house, to come with a peace officer to secure him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the house did you say any thing to the landlord? - A. Not a word.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you went to the marquis of - at Tottenham-court, and I believe there for safety, because you was not able to take care of it yourself, you deposited all the notes that you had with the marquis's steward? - A. No, I had more notes about me; I gave him these.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the five pound note that you received from the steward was not the five pound note that you lost? - A. No, that I changed at a public-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What time did you leave Tottenham-court? - A. In the morning, about daylight.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you come down with your waistcoat in your hand and sent him up for your jacket and hat? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you asked him for half a guinea on your watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you went out of the house, where did you go? - A. I went about a quarter of a mile from the place, and there I slept.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ask her where to find a police-office? - A. I did not ask a question till I came out of the house; I came to the house between twelve and one in the course of the forenoon of the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you come there was the prisoner at home? - A. Yes, that was the time that I asked him for a half guinea on the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. You said that just before the prisoner had taken the notes, you took them out to be satisfied? - Yes, to see that I had them about me; they were twisted up, I untwisted them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150039"/>Q. When they were twisted up, you might see as well and be satisfied without untwisting them? - A. It was to be sure that I had took them about me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was not sure? - A. I was sure of it, it was to satisfy myself, and to look at them.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you be more than sure of having them; why did you untwist them? - A. I untwisted them to look at them.</p>
               <p>Q. You was sure they were there? - A. It was to satisfy my own mind.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you were certain you had them? - A. I was certain of it, it was only a foolish idea of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to look at them and to see if you had them, when you was certain of it. whether it was foolish or wise? - A. I will tell you, when I am among six hundred men of a night, I look that I should see my notes about me when I am going to bed, and when I saw the two notes, I rolled them up before I put them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any more Bank notes about you? - A. Only these.</p>
               <p>Q. When you untwisted them was it for the purpose of seeing whether it was dirty paper or Bank notes? - A. To see that they were the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say at Tottenham-court before you come away, how much money you had left? - A. They did not know how much I had left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say that you had deposited above twenty pounds in the steward's hands? - A. No, never; I said that I had five or six pounds in his hands; it was the gunner of the ship that gave me the money.</p>

I believe it was on the 27th of December that the prosecutor came to the public office, in Whitechapel, and said that he had been robbed of a five pound note and a two pound note, at a public house in Blue Anchor-yard; hearing that it was at a public house, I went and spoke to the magistrates, they desired me to go down the next morning, and desire the publican to come up; I went down, I stated to the servant of the house, my business, the publican not being at home; as soon as he came home he came up, it was about a quarter before three o'clock; I took him before the magistrate that was then sitting, he examined him; I was desired by the magistrate to take him into custody till the evening, when he was examined again, the prosecutor gave much the same account then as he has now.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to your father's shop on any day? - A. Yes, on Saturday the 7th of December between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop besides yourself? - A. My sister; the prisoner when he came in the shop said he came from a lady for two yards of lace to trim a spencer; we asked him what sort he wanted, he said he did not know: if we would give him some patterns he would pay us for it. My sister said that she never cut patterns, but he talked to her a long time, so wishing to get rid of him she looked for some; all this time he stood by the shop window, close by the door, and while he stood there, he kept rubbing the right side of his face: so that his hand was even with the lace which hung in the window; while my sister was looking for the patterns he snatched a piece of lace from the window; I heard a little noise, which was occasioned by the ticket falling that had been pinned to the lace, and looking at his hands I saw it in his left hand. I said you have got a piece of lace, my sister came round the counter and took it from him; he said he did not mean to steal it; he immediately made up to the door and ran away. A gentleman passing by, saw him run, came to us, and asked what he had done; we told him he had stole a piece of lace; he was pursued and brought back, he was delivered to Hawthorn the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the lace here? - A. Yes, this is it (producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. A guinea. Prisoner's Defence. The piece of lace was laying down on the ground, and I picked it up.</p>

My lord, I will inform you as brief as possible; I have been in business myself; I have a wife and seven small children; about last July my trade fell off, I applied to some gentlemen to get me a place in the Wet Docks, Mr. Whittle the merchant, recommended me, there they said I was too old for Wapping Dock; I went to the West India Docks, there I worked till I got a jam between the sugar hogsheads, by which means I was unable to work, my family was in great distress; I had always maintained my family without ever applying to a parish or any person to assist me; when I recovered I went to the Dock again, and when I came home my wife was taken ill of a fever, and I was likewise taken very ill last Christmas, when my wife and my children were obliged to go to the workhouse, my goods were seized for the rent that I owed, I was drove to the pit of distress; after recovering from my illness, which was the month before this, I called upon Mr. Clark for work; my wife and children being in the workhouse, and the parish officers threatening they would have me apprehended, was the reason of my changing my name, as I understood they offered a reward to find me out; Mr. Clark gave me work himself, and when I got into Sun-street, I gave the boy six-pence to get me half an ounce of tobacco, I waited for the boy while he went into the shop; a person whom I knew came up to me, we went to have a pint of beer together; I told him I was waiting for a lad whom I had sent into that shop, but it would make very little difference I said, as I should do some of the work in the morning and take it in; I tied the work all up but the boots in my apron, and unfortunately drinking a drop too much, I lost all but the pair of boots; the next day when I found the loss, I in a distracted state of mind went and enquired to find the work, but in vain; I went to a friend, to inform him of my sitution, at the White Horse, Moor-lane, on purpose to get him to go to Mr. Clark, to speak for me; when Mr. Clarke came into the house, Mr. Clark said are you not the man, I directly owned myself as such, I never denied it; I had eight or nine respectable friends last night; I am a man that bore a good character, and a man that worked hard for my living.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - A. Between four and five, near dusk; I thought I knew the coat, and after going some way with her, I spoke to her; she then asked me if I would have the goodness to go home with her, I went, she delivered me the coat; on the day before yesterday the prisoner was taken and lodged in St. Ann's watchhouse.</p>

             sworn. I keep a linen shop in Monmouth-street, I sell second-hand clothes. On the 2d of December the prisoner at the bar came into my shop, and asked me if I would buy a pelisse coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day? - A. Between three and four o'clock; I asked him to let me see it; he took it out of a linen apron which he had before him, I opened the coat and looked at it, I said how came you by this, it is a droll thing for a man to sell; he told me that his wife went out a nursing, and the lady gave it to his wife; I asked him what made him sell it, he said his wife was going out to another lady, she wanted money and bid him sell it; I then asked him his name and place of abode, he told me he lived at No. 16, Stacey-street, and his name was Miller, and said I need not be afraid to buy it; he asked me one pound for it, I told him if I thought he came honestly by it, I would very willingly give him half a guinea for it. The young man that lodges in the house was coming through the shop at the time; I said do you know this man, look at him, he said he did not know him, but he looks like a working man, he says to me you may buy it. I gave him ten shillings (I wanted sixpence), I told him to call and I would pay the sixpence; I never saw him again till he called for the sixpence, I told him I had no money in my pocket, I went up to my husband, and he and the young man in the house came down to my assistance; I told the prosecutor I would stop the man when he come for the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen Mr. Tilbury? - A. I bought the pelisse on the 2nd of December, I saw Mr. Tilbury on the 9th, and on the 15th the prisoner came for the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the man who sold you the pelisse on the 2d of December? - A. I am certain.</p>

             sworn. On the 2nd of December I came through the shop at the time the prisoner offered the pelisse coat for sale, it was near dusk. The landlady asked me if I knew the man or had ever seen him before; I told her I had never seen him before, to the best of my knowledge; she then asked me if I thought it would be right to buy it, I told her he looked like a hard working man; accordingly she bought the pelisse; that was all that passed in my presence at that time. Last Wednesday evening, a little before dark, the landlady came up stairs to her husband, and wished us to come down, as she had got the thief in the shop; we both went down, he was taken into custody, and I went to Mr. Tilbury; he returned with me, and the prisoner was lodged in the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is the man who sold the pelisse? - A. I am perfectly sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I produce the pelisse, this pelisse is my property, it is the very same that I took from Mrs. Musket's.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the value of it? - A. Eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Musket) The pelisse that Tilbury took from you is the very same that you bought of the prisoner? - A. It is the same pelisse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg leave to inform your lordship, in consequence of my coming for the sixpence, the lady detained me, and when Mr. Tilbury came down he promised to me if I would acknowledge the truth before witness, he would forgive me, and set me about my business; in consequence of that I did; I sent for my brother, as the lady said if I would pay her the ten shillings, she would not appear against me; my brother came, but he being in a passion for what I had done, went away out of the room.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that is your cheese? - A. By the cheese that we have in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hundred cheeses had you in the warehouse at the same time? - A. We did not count them.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore not having counted them, you do not in fact know that there is any missing? A. We have counted them since, and we found several missing.</p>

This gentleman went and searched my house where I live, he found no bad money there; in the course of the day I had sold several articles out of my shop, such as rags and bones that I had there; as to the money being bad I did not know it, and the way I had so much small change in my pocket, I was always in want of it in such a business in regard of buying rags and bones.</p>
