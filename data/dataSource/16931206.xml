Five Mathematical Instruments, value 3 l. a Magnifying Glass, value 20 s. a Gold and Silver Purse, val. 10 s. Two Guineas and 20 s. in Money these were Mr. Pepys Goods and Money. The things they took from Mr. Jackson were, a Silver Hilted Sword, val. 50 s. a Hatband, val. 2 s. &amp;c. Mr. Pepys and Mr. Jackson could not Swear the Prisoners were the men that Robbed them, because they were Masked; Mr. Pepys conjured them to be Civil to the Ladies, and not to Affright them, which they were; and by their demeanour of themselves, my Lady Pepys saved a Bag of Money that she had about her; Mr. Pepys desired them to give him a particular Instrument that was of great use to him; and one of them told him Sir, You are a Gentleman, and so are we; if you will send to the Rummer Tavern at Charing-Cross to Morrow, you shall have it there: Mr. Pepys did send, but there was nothing left. Another Witness for the King Swore, That the Prisoners were Two of the Three that committed the Robbery, for that Mr. Hoyle had oftentimes sollicited him to go abroad with him to take a Purse; at last he told them he would; and at the same time, viz. on the 29th of September last, they went upon this design; but this Witness shifted the matter, under some pretence of an accidental business, and so they went away by themselves; but however he immediately followed them, with a purpose to see what they did: and he saw them stop the Coach, and commit the Robbery; and they pulled off their Masks after they had done the feat, and he saw their Faces plainly. The man that let them the Horses Swore, that they had Three Horses of him at the same time, about Michaelmas-day, and that Mr. Hoyle Hired them, and that they returned back about Six a Clock in the Evening. They were taken at Westminster in a short time after, and Mr. Hoyle had a Pencil about him, which was Mr. Pepys his Pencil; they were taken at the Rummer Tavern at Charing-Cross.</p>

Other Evidence on his part, declared that he was Sick, and had taken Physick; he further said that he was an <rs id="t16931206-24-deflabel110" type="occupation">Officer in the Army</rs>

               <p>In the first Letter, The Shallops or Well-Boats which have with so great diligence been fitted out, are now ordered to be laid up again at Portsmouth, and the Stores to be taken ashore.</p>
               <p>In the Second Letter, The States of Amsterdam have made their Complaint in the Assembly of the States of Holland, of the condition of the Fleet of the States, and do demand, That the Fleet of the States may no more act in conjunction with that of Holland. 'Tis also said, they prest Peace, and endeavoured to incline the other Towns to do the same; which 'tis believed they will never consent to till France is reduced to a lower Estate.</p>
               <p>In the Third Letter, Some French Privateers a few days since landed some men at Altam in Essex, and burnt some Houses, and took some Farmers Daughters on Board, who they soon put on shore again.</p>
               <p>In the Fourth Letter, The States of Amsterdam are still of the sentiment to have a Fleet of 70 Men of War at Sea next Summer, and to act apart.</p>
               <p>Then, after Mr. Dyer was taken up a second time for writing those scandalous Reports, he writ another Letter, (for which he was not now Indicted) in which were these Words, That the Author of this Letter having received fresh Trouble, and that he was reflected upon by scandalous Scriblers, notwithstanding all of it was true, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Counsel for Their Majesties opened the Indictments; and to prove all this several Witnesses for the King were called, some of which were Coffee-men to whom he sent the Letters; and one was a person that was his Clerk, and writ some of the Letters himself; who all swore positively, That Mr. Dyer was the Author of them, and that they were by his immediate Order sent abroad and published.</p>
               <p>To contradict this Charge against Mr Dyer, his Counsel called several Witnesses, which were of two sorts; the first was to prove that the Shallops or Well-boats were so laid up at Portsmouth, which they could not do: The second was to his Reputation, who gave account, That Mr. Dyer was a man very well affected to the Government, for ought, as ever they found by him; and that they never heard him speak, nor never knew him write any thing against it; and that he very ill resented the Imprisonment of the Bishops, and other irregular Proceedings in the late Reign; (that might be): But then as a further demonstration of his Loyalty, he had put 200 l. into the Exchequer for the use of Their Majesties. What if he had? so do many others (that perhaps, are no Friends nor Well-wishers to the Government) because of the benefit they receive by so doing; so that all he could do would not make him so honest as he hoped the Court would believe him to be; for the Court summ'd up the Evidence on both sides very distinctly to the Gentlemen of the Jury, (who were men of unbiass'd Principles, and would not easily be wrought upon), telling them, That tho he was troubled at the Imprisonment of the Bishops, and had put his Money into the Exchequer, any man might be and do so, and yet be disaffected, for it was well known how sensible the Bishops were of their Troubles themselves, and yet for all that it was as well known too, how they acted afterwards, and what a great Defection they made; and altho a man had been a Friend formerly to the present Government, yet he may be against it now, notwithstanding all his pretences to the contrary; and that there was nothing tended more to the weakning of this Government, and breaking the Confederacy, than to tell the world, That the States of Holland will not let their Fleet go out another year; and that these things were of very great consequence, and therefore it behoved them to consider well of the matter; and if they believed (from any thing that they had heard), That Mr. Dyer was guilty of this Offence, then they ought to find him so; but if not, they must acquit him.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen of the Jury having considered of a Verdict, they brought Mr. Dyer in <rs id="t16931206-60-verdict240" type="verdictDescription">
