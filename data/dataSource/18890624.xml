                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of John Brinsmead and Sons, Pianoforte Manufacturers and Timber Merchants—in January this year we had supplied oak to the firm of Henry Pound, Son, and Hutchins, Limited, to the amount of £273 2s. 5d.—it was sold through a Mr. King—between 21st and 28th January we were asked to supply further timber, and I declined doing so unless I received security—before the 28th I saw the defendant, and discussed with him the question of security—he proposed that the Government securities, or the payment for the Government contracts which they held, should be transferred to us, both the accounts that had accrued and those that were accruing—we undertook to supply timber, as the goods were sent in, to those amounts, presuming the Government were to accept the transfer of the debts—I then agreed to supply timber to an equivalent amount, as the goods were delivered to the Government by them so that we were clearly secured—this document, marked A, was given to me by the defendant—this is a statement on the one side of the contracts then current, and of the goods, and on the other side that which had been delivered, the amount being £450—against that I delivered goods to an equivalent amount, or very nearly—on 28th January I wrote this letter to the company: "Gentlemen, in consideration of your assigning to us any contracts due to you from the Government we undertake to supply timber to an equivalent amount, drawing upon you at six months for such purchases"—on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188906240004"/>
               <p>same day I wrote this letter to the company—I then entered into this indenture of the 28th, signed by Henry Pound and J. McGregor, described as directors, and also by the secretary, and sealed by the company. (<hi rend="italic">This was an assignment by Pound and Co. to Brinsmead and Co., of all debts due and accruing from the Secretary of State for War, specified in annexed schedule, amounting to</hi> £5,622 15s. 7d.)—I received letters from time to time, stating that goods had been delivered by the company—relying upon those statements, I supplied timber from time to time—I have made out a statement of account—the total amount of goods supplied amounts to £4,016 15s. 2d., subject to a deduction of £253 7s. 3d. for oak supplied before the contract, leaving a balance of £3,763 7s. 11d., between 31st January and 16th March—on the 2nd January I gave notice to the War Office of the right to receive due monies, which had been assigned to us under the contract, and I received an acknowledgment from the War Office—I received this letter, dated 5th February, from the defendant, giving particulars of two deliveries under the contract, amounting to £348 7s. 6d. and £260—after 28th January we supplied timber amounting to £952 15s. 11d.; bills were drawn with reference to those transactions to that amount—the security given to us at that date was £992, so we had a margin—on the 5th and 11th we supplied goods to the value of £748 15s. 7d.—we received this letter of 11th February, stating that since the last advice there had been a delivery of packing cases, amounting to £239 11s. 4d.—I had supplied goods up to that date within the margin—on the 15th I received this letter, in consequence of which on the 18th I supplied goods to the amount of £274 8s. 11d., and on the 21st to the amount of £485—on 25th I received this letter, and from that date to the 6th March I supplied goods to the amount of £336 9s. 10d.—on 6th March I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">containing particulars of deliveries since last advice amounting to</hi> £554 10s. 7d.), and on 7th March I made a further supply, amounting to £627 2s. 7d.—on 8th March I received this letter containing particulars of deliveries amounting to £576 15s. 5d., and on the 16th I supplied timber to the value of £592 2s. 3d.—the total amount of the advices of goods delivered to the Government was £4,424 18s. 9d.—the value of my delivery under the contract was. £3,763 7s. 11d.—£503 3s. 1d. has been paid us—those amounts have been paid us by the Government for the goods which have been delivered—there is a balance of £3,260 still due to us under the contract—if the goods stated to have been delivered had been delivered we should have been entitled to receive the money—I believe it was not due on delivery, but some time within six months—I believed this timber had been delivered, or I should not have supplied the goods.</p>

               <p>£353 for the oak, that was given elsewhere as a security—I say that of my own knowledge—I saw some of the directors from time to time—I ascertained that the Government acknowledged these contracts—I took the bills after the timber had been delivered; they were signed by the directors—they were not for all the goods supplied, but for a large proportion, I think about two-thirds of the amount—the total amount of the bills was £3,597—the defendant did not tell me that his company was in difficulties—there was some remark about the company wanting the contracts financed—I did not say I would make him free of the timber trade in six months—I said I daresay I could manage it for him—if the contracts had been carried out there would have been a margin of about £700—the timber we supplied was to carry out the contract; there was no stipulation to that effect—I understood, of course, that the timber would be used in the contract—the bills I hold are for over £3,000—the goods were not manufactured at Fenchurch Street, but at Deptford—I understood him that he attended at Deptford; he went there with me once—I went to Deptford previous to making this arrangement—I did not go there during the time this was going on, or ever sent anyone there—I had every confidence in Mr. Pound—he asked me particularly not to make any inquiry at the War Office as to the delivery—I have not said that before; I have not been asked—I was not present before the Magistrate when he said he would dismiss the charge—I was in Paris at the time—on the first occasion there was a discussion respecting the matter, but I can't say I understood him to say he was going to dismiss the charge—I believe none of the bills are due yet; the first bill is more than provided for by the actual cash I have got—I applied for process before I knew there was a petition; I heard of it the same afternoon—I applied for a warrant; they gave me a summons—I heard there was a petition against the company and a liquidator appointed—I had no interview with the defendant before applying for the warrant—I saw him the night before I went down to Deptford—I did not go to Deptford to see the state of things—I believe about £800 worth of goods were supplied after that—I have not applied to the War Office for that amount; it is not necessary—I believe I shall get it; I am not sure—the matter is in liquidation—I went to Deptford to see what had become of the timber, and what quantity of goods were ready for delivery—I valued the goods there at about £300 or £400—there was nothing absolutely ready for delivery—I speak of the value simply on my impression on looking at the stock—I went more particularly to see if there was any of my timber there, and I found there was not—that was about three or four days after I had obtained process—I saw no work on the goods at that time—the factory was in work—I found that the whole of the timber I had supplied had been consumed; at all events, it was not there—I did not see a large quantity of goods commenced—there was no question as to the supply of some fittings—I knew that some fittings were wanted to complete the contracts—I find that I am mistaken in saying that nearly the whole amount was drawn for—about £400 was not drawn for; about £1,200 is still undrawn for—for some of the things a different kind of timber would have to be used—I saw the liquidator twice after he was appointed—I desired that the contract with the War Office should be completed; one portion only was completed—I saw Mr. McGregor with the defendant the night before I applied for process—they</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Deptford works of this company, and have been for about two years—during that time Mr. Pound has not taken an active part as to work or management there, he has come very seldom indeed—the timber from Messrs. Brinsmead has been used under my supervision—these War Office contracts were commenced at Deptford in January, and were carried on with as much despatch as possible during January, February, and March—I got the number of boxes made approximately from the labour-sheets—as to making the ammunition boxes, the first step is the cutting out and the machine work, grooving, planing, and preparing the stuff for putting together; then they are put together by the carpenters, and the gun metal fittings and zinc linings are put on—about 1,700 are nearly complete out of the 2,046 for which the contract was—putting on the fittings would not mean much work; they are metal—the completion was prevented by the difficulty of obtaining from the country some zinc trays to fit in the zinc linings—it was a long time before we could find out where to get them—we received some about 24th March—they were detained at the station—that was one of the principal causes of delay—there were also gun-metal hinges and hasps—when the petition was filed there was a cask containing 500 sets of those at the railway station awaiting delivery—in consequence of the petition we were prevented from getting them; I have obtained them since; the work was stopped for a time—if there had been no delay in getting the fittings the work would have got on much faster, because I should have put more hands on, but their being stopped there was not the work for the men to do—at the time of the petition I believe about £500 worth of goods had been delivered under the contract of 1888—since then we have delivered 346 ammunition boxes, for which I have the Government receipts—the contract is complete, with the exception of about £1,000 in labour and materials and fittings, and a small portion of timber; £1,000 would cover it—it would take about three weeks or a month to complete the contract by putting these fittings on, and so on—when the petition was filed everything came to an absolute standstill—I was told not to make any further delivery; I had to take my orders from the liquidator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was this delay about the fittings for the ammunition boxes from the commencement—we first delivered some on 28th March; I should have delivered others the same week—the goods were at Deptford Railway Station, the London and Brighton depot, at the time of stoppage—I don't know how long they had been there—they have</p>

               <p>been delivered since—it was a matter of money—I was unable to pay for them, that was why they were not delivered—the liquidator has since supplied the money for doing the work—£1,000 would have been sufficient to pay for all the contract for the ammunition boxes—I only know of the contract of 1889 for Pimlico—I should think it would take at least another £1,000 to complete the boxes for the Army Clothing Department—we have delivered about 1,000, and we have another 1,000 ready to be delivered—about £3,000 is required to complete the contracts.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector Y</hi>). At a quarter to three on this Sunday morning I was passing the back yard of the Lamb Hotel, and saw the two prisoners there, standing in the gateway leading to the yard—I was in uniform—as I passed, Cleasby, who was looking furtively about, moved into the yard, which is used very largely as a cab yard—I thought they were men engaged with cabs—I have no doubt the men I saw were the prisoners; there was a lamp on the other side of the way, and I had full view of them—when I went on duty at ten that morning I heard of the house having been broken into, and I then went out with Murray, and made inquiries, and at four o'clock a. m., on 27th, I found Cleasby concealed in a corn-bin in a stable in the yard of the hotel—I said, "I shall charge you with being concerned with others in breaking and entering the Lamb, and stealing boots, meat, and 14s."—he said, "I did not do it; Smeggy, Sparkes, and Scotty know as much about it as I do"—I took him to the station, and he was detained—I knew Scotty was Brown's nickname—about nine o'clock the same morning I found Brown in the Cattle Market—I told him he would be charged with being concerned with others in breaking and entering the Lamb Hotel, and stealing boots, meat, and money—he said, "Has Cleasby <hi rend="italic">rucked?</hi> If he has, I will b———y well kill him when I come out"—<hi rend="italic">ruck</hi> means telling—he was taken to the station, and both prisoners were charged with breaking into the premises—neither of them said anything in answer to the charge—I examined the premises, and found the catch of the back kitchen window had been pushed back—there were marks on the window, showing it had been forcibly pushed back.</p>

I am in the employment of Phineas Cohen, cigar maker, of 24, Hanbury Street—the prisoner has been his apprentice, and would be out of her time in about two months—I identify these twelve cigars as the property of my firm, by the tobacco we make, and the peculiar construction—I have no doubt about them being our make—we did not sell them, because these cigars could never have been purchased retail; we don't sell retail, and they could not have been purchased wholesale in this condition, because these are all sorts of colours, and they have not been packed or put in a box—the value of them is 1s. 6d.—I have seen the prisoner's mother this morning—she has come over from Holland, and says she would take her daughter back with her, and we don't wish to push the matter any further.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Glasgow, and am on a visit to London—on 17th June, in the afternoon, I was sitting on some railings opposite the Newcastle Temperance Hotel, Ruston Road—the two prisoners came up and said they could show me where to get a good glass of beer, and we went to a public-house and had some beer, which I paid for—I was sitting on a seat in front of the bar, and Orr tried to take my purse out of my left trousers pocket; he had his hand in my pocket, but I got hold of it, and prevented his taking it—both of them then got their hands in my pockets; I roared out "Police," and Orr bolted with my purse—the door was locked—the barman came to my assistance, and we kept Taylor—there was £9 in my purse; I have not had it back; I said £5 at first, but I forgot that I had put in £4 afterwards—I saw Orr at Bow Street Station at the end of the next week, and identified him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Taylor.</hi> I sat down to smoke and fell asleep—I was not the worse for liquor; I was only in two public-houses that day—I think I had three glasses of ale; I had no whisky—some women were in the house—I did not speak to them—I did not take out my money and say that I had plenty of money, and was cashier of the Bank of Glasgow—I am a cashier.</p>

I am barman at the Dolphin public-house, Tonbridge Street—on Friday evening, June 7th, McDiarmid and the two prisoners came in together about a quarter-past six—Orr called for three halves of bitter ale, which McDiarmid paid for with a sixpence from his waistcoat pocket—he did not take out his purse—he sat down on a seat, and the prisoners stood in the bar—I was sitting down reading the paper and heard a scuffle; that was about five minutes after they came in; no one else was in the bar; it was a quiet time—I looked up, and the prisoners had got the prosecutor on his back, feeling in all his pockets—I got over the next bar, and Orr ran out and ran down the street; I locked the bar door, and detained Taylor—he said he could throw me away from</p>

               <p>the door, but I said he could not—the prosecutor knew what he was about, or I would not have served him—I picked Orr out from six others on the next Friday at Hunter Street Station—he left his hat in the bar at the time of the scuffle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Taylor.</hi> There were a lot of people in the house, but not in that bar; they could not see into it—there is a screen round the bar; it is a little private bar—I never saw either of the prisoners before.</p>

On 7th June, about 6. 15, I was called to the bar of a public-house, and found Taylor detained there, charged with robbing the prosecutor—he said, "I know nothing about it"—he said that if I took him to the station he would make it warm for me—he tried to get away—he said to the prosecutor, "You ought to be ashamed to charge me after coining from Scotland with you, and being with you all day long"—he said, "I don't know you; I never saw you before"—I found on Taylor a £5 Bank of Engraving note, No. 1786, from the same plate as the others, and the same number.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of Ely Place—after the action of Demay <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Morris was commenced, with the concurrence of the prosecutor's family solicitor the matter was transferred into my hands—I produce the original writ by Amelia Demay against M. A. Morris, issued on 25th February, 1889, in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court, for breach of promise of marriage, and for slander, claiming £2,000 damages—I also produce a letter of 21st February from Mr. Hatton, a solicitor, which was handed to me with other papers, and was produced by Mr. Candy, who represented Demay, before the Magistrate; that letter preceded the writ—the statement of claim was delivered on 8th March, stating that the plaintiff had suffered damage by breach of marriage by the defendant—the statement of Mr. Morris in reply is dated 5th April, 1889, denying the promise—on 15th April the matter was transferred to me—I got an order for particulars; the first particulars were delivered on 6th May, 1889, stating that the promise was verbal, made on 21st March, 1886, in the first floor front sitting-room of the plaintiff's house, 85, Bolsover Street, and that the refusal to marry consisted in the defendant withdrawing himself from companionship and society of the plaintiff—I then had an order for further and better particulars—in consequence of that I wrote a letter to Mr. Hatton, protesting against this persecution to which Mr. Morris was subjected, in fact he complained that his life was a perfect misery—I produce a letter of Grandy's, dated April 29th, and in consequence of my reply to that Grandy brought an action against me for libel; I put in a statement of defence, and I do not suppose I shall hear anything more of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEITH FRITH</hi>. I have seen Grandy at my office, not in connection with this case, but as a private detective in connection with the Parnell case—I did not recognise him until he put the question to me at Marlborough Street—I then remembered him as coming to my office dressed in a fur coat, in company with a man named Scanlan, who, I believe, had been in the police, and who brought me a letter of introduction from somebody connected with the <hi rend="italic">Irish Times</hi>, asking me to employ him as a detective, which I refused—I remember also on a later occasion Grandy coming alone and pressing me to employ him as a detective, alleging that he could give me very wonderful information, and stating that he had great facilities; I refused—he never was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188906240018"/>
               <p>employed by me in any way—it did not come to my knowledge that he had been employed by Mr. Soames, nor do I believe it—I do not know that he had been shadowing Pigott and Mr. Labouchere; I do not believe it; Mr. Soames is a highly honourable solicitor; but if the prisoner was employed by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> it only shows what an escape I had in his coming and wanting employment from me; however, I should have refused to have anything to do with him—the action he brought against me for libel is still pending; the libel consisted in my having stated that, whilst he was living with this woman Demay (which he was) he had been guilty of misconduct against Mr. Morris, and that he had suffered two months' imprisonment for an assault upon a poor prostitute—when I first saw him I did not understand that he was a private detective; I only understood that as a perfect stranger he brought his card; I had never heard of such a man—he came with Scanlan, who brought a letter of introduction—I did not know Scanlan as a private detective; I had heard the name, and I believe there was a man of that name in the Police force—I employed Mr. Clark; he is a superannuated inspector of police in possession of a pension.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I cannot fix the date when Grandy came and asked for employment—it was before the inquiry commenced into the letter part of the Parnell case; some little time before Piggott's examination, which was in February last.</p>

S. of London—I have lived at 8, Harley Street, Cavendish Square, for two years; before that I lived for ten years in Montague Square—I have made skin diseases a specialty; I am surgeon in charge of the skin department of St. Mary's Hospital, and am lecturer in that medical school—I am also a member of seven or eight societies connected with medicine—my practice has been extensive; my name is well known in the profession—I am forty years of age; I was married in July, 1872, and have four children—my eldest boy is sixteen—I know Mr. Archibald Forbes, the war correspondent for the newspapers—in consequence of a letter I received from him in November, 1887, a Mr. Hester called upon me and consulted me, and in consequence of that visit I went to see him at 35, Charlotte Street, so that I might see him undressed and in bed—a woman opened the door to me; she had on a dressing-gown—I should not know her again—I asked her where my patient was—she said upstairs—I went up to the attic at the top of the house, where I saw him—a nurse was attending on him, who I heard had been in the family for some time—Mr. Hester was an ex-taxing master in bankruptcy, and was a gentleman in reduced circumstances—his surroundings were of great discomfort; it was an exceedingly poor, miserable sort of place, not suitable for a gentleman who was suffering from a mortal disease—I had told him previously in my consulting-room that his only chance was to go into a properly constituted hospital—there is a private hospital kept by a lady, Mrs. Marmade—I have no interest whatever in that hospital—I advised him to move, and he was removed shortly afterwards—I attended him daily, sometimes twice a day, up to the February, 1888, when he died—I attended him gratuitously the whole time—on 16th February, 1889, I received a letter signed "Amelia Demay"—I had no knowledge of any woman of that name—I had never been in a house in Bolsover Street in my life—the</p>

               <p>whole story in the letter is an absolute fabrication and lie from beginning to end—I afterwards received a writ, dated 25th February, issued by Mr. Fk. Hatton, of 150, Strand—subsequently I received a letter dated 21st February, 1889, and another dated 27th February, 1889—I had then consulted my family solicitors, and afterwards, with their consent, put the matter in the hands of Mr. George Lewis—I first saw the prisoner Grandy when he called at my house—he told me he had a friend coming from Denmark, who was suffering from severe skin disease, who wished to put himself under my care in my house—I asked him the name of his friend; he said Captain Ohlsen, and that he was a Dane—I said I could not take him into my house—he said perhaps I could take him into some private hospital—he said he had heard of a private hospital in York Place, and he asked me for a card—he said his friend was a wealthy man, perfectly capable of paying for advice—I gave him a card, and wrote on it the name and address of Mrs. Marmade, 28, Baker Street; a lady named Bates was a nurse there; she had acted as nurse for me in some cases—I cannot recollect the date of Grandy's call, but I think it was a fortnight before I received the first letter of 16th February—I think I next saw Grandy a week or ten days before Easter—I saw him outside my house; it was in the morning, about the time I receive patients—he was there for several hours; he walked up and down on the opposite side, constantly looking at the house; one of my servants called my attention to him—after that he followed me and my wife and my servants, and generally produced a reign of terror in the house—he followed them wherever they went, so that they were actually frightened to leave the house—he followed me for hours together, and made my life an actual burden—he also followed my wife and my servants—I don't know the names of my servants—he followed me to my patients' houses, and he has waited till I have come out, and then followed me again—about this time I was attending upon Lord Lytton—one wet Sunday afternoon I took a cab from my door to Stratford Place—the prisoner was standing at the corner of Harley Street and Cavendish Square—he took a hansom cab, and followed mine—I went to Stratford Place, and held a consultation, and then I went to Sir James Paget about a bulletin to be issued next morning as to Lord Lytton's condition—after staying some time, I went to Bryanston Square, Sir George Campbell's house, where Lord Lytton was staying—I dismissed my cab, and the prisoner dismissed his, and stood waiting at the corner of the square—I went in and saw Lord Lytton—it was a matter of considerable importance—he noticed something was amiss with me—I told him what had occurred—I came out again, and hailed a passing hansom—Grandy rushed after my hansom, flourishing a stick; but as there was no other cab he could not follow—this persecution has occurred constantly—to my knowledge I never in my life saw Demay till I saw her at the police-station—I never had any conversation with her such as has been suggested—at last this persecution became unbearable, and I went to Mr. Lewis, and then we went to Marlborough Street—I may mention that the prisoner followed me once to the police-station, where I asked the inspector for protection against him—I showed him standing outside to the inspector; but the inspector said he could not protect me, and the only thing was to go through a public trial, which I did not shrink from doing—I saw a card produced by Grandy at the Police-court—I gave that card to a man</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at 3, York Place, Baker Street, up to last Saturday—I was employed as clerk and servant to Grandy—I have been connected with him in that capacity since October, 1888, when he was living at 35, Charlotte Street, with Demay—they lived there up to last March—I stayed in the house on several occasions—they lived there together as man and wife—I afterwards continued in Grandy's employment when they moved to 3, York Place, in March—they lived there as man and wife—I was secretary and manager of the household matters—I opened the door and attended to the servants—I had no salary; I had board and lodging for my services—Grandy at this time had an office in the Strand and afterwards at 10, Agar Street—I attended there and received customers who came for inquiry purposes—no business was transacted when we were at Agar Street; we were on the look out and ready for it—I wrote letters for him—this of 16th February is in my writing; I copied it from Grandy's dictation—I believe the signature to it to be in Demay's writing; I have seen her write—I directed the envelope, Grandy gave me the address—I don't remember if I posted it—I asked no questions about it—it was written just before we left Charlotte Street—I know Grandy's writing—I have heard him spoken of as the French Colonel—I think Grandy wrote this letter of 27th February, 1889, but I don't speak with certainty—all this draft of the letter of 21st April is in Grandy's writing, and the letter "F" is in his writing too—after I gave evidence before the Magistrate, I received these letters of June 5, 8, 10, and 11 from Grandy (<hi rend="italic">The letters alluded to were put in and read</hi>)—I heard of this proposed action against Dr. Morris—Grandy asked me several questions about it, if I thought there was any ground for a breach of promise action against some party, not naming the female prisoner, and I said I really could not see any ground for action in the</p>

               <p>matter—that was about December—it was to be brought by some lady; I was not informed who it was—he spoke of Demay as "Madame"—he consulted me so frequently about the action that it began to grow tedious towards the finish—on one occasion he said that instead of the lady he had represented bringing the action it was madame's sister, who had been connected with Dr. Morris, and she was dead; that was after he had received a summons for Marlborough Street, as we were walking through the streets round Manchester Square, I think in company with another party, Lynch—he showed us the summons—he said this action was not from the party whom he had represented to me, but the lady, he was sorry to say, was madame's sister, who was dead and six feet under ground—I don't know if madame was to take her place—I was not to give any evidence that I know of—I remember a letter from Grandy of 10th June—I introduced Lynch to him—"You introduced me to Lynch, and Lynch introduced that man Walker, who of course will be the cause of my case before the jury being refused, and me found guilty"—that refers to obtaining Walker to commit perjury—he never talked to me about Walker; I never saw the man, only while he was in Marlborough Street—Grandy told me frankly that Lynch had found him a man who would come and swear in Court that he had seen madame and the doctor together—I knew he was going to procure the man—when he says, "That would not have happened if Lynch had not introduced me to Walker," that refers to the same thing—I knew what it referred to.</p>

I will give you £5 when you go into the Court, and another £5 before you go in the box"—he told me it was a doctor, and he said, "You must say that you saw a lady and gentleman walking arm-in-arm down a certain street, which I will show you; I will show you the lady and the gentleman"—I said, "Very well, sir"—I had to meet him on the Easter Monday, I think it was, at three o'clock, by appointment, at the Globe, I think, near Baker Street Station—I did not meet him—the next time I saw him was in Marlborough Street—at the interview I had with him he said he was bringing an action against Mr. Lewis, and he showed me a letter from his solicitor's, in red ink.</p>

While riding in the train, I sold my watch and chain for £3 to a lady, a stranger who I did not know, and it is not true what the witness Sexton said that I told her I had got money in the bank in Wales."</p>

I am a fishmonger, and live at 8, Bayonne Road, Fulham—the prisoner is my father; he married Mary Jane Mills, my stepmother—on Sunday, 26th May, I came home about eleven or twelve at night—my father and mother were in the kitchen, no one else—father was sober, mother was the worse for liquor—I went to bed—while there I heard a few words between them; I did not hear what was said; I heard nothing else till between five and six in the morning, when father awoke me and said, "For God's sake come into the next room!"—I went and saw mother lying on the floor undressed—she did not know me; father was trying to restore her to consciousness—I had no conversation with him then—after the doctor came he told me what had happened—he said he was in bed asleep, and mother came up and struck him two or three times in the face, that he rose up half asleep and struck her back—I noticed a mark on her left eye, I did not notice her ear.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physican and surgeon, of Norman Lodge, West Kensington—on 27th May, a little before 1 p. m, I was called to Bayonne Road—I found the woman unconscious, suffering from compression of the brain—there was a contusion on the left eye and behind the left ear—those seemed the only external injuries—the left side was paralysed, and the right half of the face—I asked the prisoner how she came in that condition—he said that she had been knocking herself about, drinking; that he was asleep in bed when he received two blows from her, which he returned, and struck her on the side of the head, and he found her unconscious when he got up in the morning—he did all he could to carry out my instructions as to her treatment—she lingered until the 29th, and died at 9 p. m.—on the 31st I made a postmortem examination—there was extensive ecchymosis behind the left ear, and the pia mater was ruptured—the immediate cause of death was due to injury on the left side of the head, caused by a blow—the other organs were healthy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothier, of 223, St. George Street, St. George's-in-the-East—I was acquainted with the prisoner in the year 1887—he was not employed by my son, he gave him shelter, and allowed him to sleep there till the commencement of August, 1888—I gave him notice to leave, after a conversation with my son—on Bank Holiday, 6th August, 1888, I received an anonymous letter; that was after the prisoner had left—I placed that letter in the hands of the police the same morning—I believe the detective has lost it—shortly after that I was engaged as a defendant in proceedings in the Chancery Division in the case of Roach <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Pollock—the prisoner made an affidavit in that case in favour of the plaintiff, and against me—after those proceedings had began, I received this letter of 8th February, 1889—I believe it to be in the prisoner's writing—I afterwards received these eight other letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I live at 9, Langton Street, St. Luke's—on 20th June, about 10. 40, I was in Three Herring Court, with Mary Ann Fisher, who I keep company with; it is a long court, and rather narrow; there is a lamp in the middle and one at the end—Brewer came up as I was wishing her good-night, and pushed violently against both of us—I asked him why he did that—he moved a few paces up the court and turned back, and came at me as if he would strike me, and I knocked him down—he got up again and continued to struggle, and we both fell, he on the top of me, and I felt something very sharp all over my head and near my eye, and I was smothered in blood, but I did not lose sight of him—I got up and saw Crow and Mr. Fisher fighting—I went to the hospital—this patch over my eye is in consequence of the wounds—I have seen Brewer, but I do not know either of them—I saw something protruding from Brewer's hand.</p>

I am a dealer in cotton waste at Chorley, Lancashire—Mr. Greenhill was my solicitor last year, and the prisoner as his clerk came to me at Chorley on November 1st—I had advanced money on mortgage on a house at Brockley Lane, Lewisham, and the prisoner said that Mr. Abraham Smith had issued execution for the ground rent, and begged me to let him have the money to pay out the distress to avoid further costs—I drew this cheque for £25, payable to Abraham Smith on order, and gave the prisoner £2 10s. for his trouble—the cheque was cashed through my banker, and I afterwards found that Mr. Smith had never had it—I went to the prisoner's house, and could not find him—I found him in a public-house, and said, "I have come to see you with reference to that cheque I gave you"—he said, "I am sorry that family matters compelled me to use that cheque, but I will see it righted"—he did not say how the endorsement came on it.</p>

I am parlourmaid to Miss Lloyd, of 34, Ashbourne Place, Kensington—on 5th June, about 10. 30 a. m., the prisoner came to the house—I answered the door—he asked if that was where Miss Lloyd lived; I said, "Yes"—he said he came respecting the character of a manservant, James Payne—I asked him into the entrance-hall—he gave me this card, "James Smith Cunningham"—I took it up to the drawing-room to Miss Lloyd, leaving him in the entrance-hall—I waited on the draw room landing while Miss Lloyd hesitated whether she should see him—when I came down after three or four minutes he was by the dining room door—in the dining-room the silver was kept—a silver salt spoon, value 10s., was on the table there when I let the prisoner in; it was just after breakfast—I would not be positive if the dining-room door was open—Miss Lloyd came down; I did not hear what took place between them; she let him out—about 12. 30 I wanted to lay the cloth for lunch, and missed the salt spoon—Miss Lloyd has never kept a man-servant.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective F</hi>). On Wednesday evening, June 12th, I saw the prisoner at Kensington Police-station having an altercation with a gentleman there; I recognised him from a description—I told him I should take him in custody for stealing, from 34, Ashbourne Place, a silver salt spoon—he made no reply—when the charge was read to him he said, "The servant has made a mistake in my identity; I was not near the place"—I found on him between fifty and sixty slips of paper relating to addresses of widows and maiden ladies—Miss Lloyd does not appear among them—I found three visiting cards in his waistcoat pocket, with the names Hussey Walsh, Trevelyan, and Hope; I also found 6s. 3 1/4 d., a small memorandum book, a gold pencil, knife, bunch of keys, and small scent bottle—he said that the pencil-case was his own, but since then I have found out it was stolen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, said he called at the station in consequence of hearing aspersions had been made on his character, and he contended that he would not have done so if he had been a thief.</hi>

I live at 8, Munster Square, Regent's Park, and am a widow—I have a small shop there—on 17th May, about 5. 30 a. m., I heard a rustling about of things, and in about twenty minutes I heard a repetition of the noise—about 5. 45 my son came down—I then went into the shop with his assistance, and I saw that things had been taken out of the window, the glass of which was broken, and the blind pulled on one side—it was quite secure the night before—about half the pane of glass was out—I missed two skirts, two bodices, a pair of shoes, and several other things, value about £4 10s.—I had left them on the counter within reach of the window, if anybody smashed the window and put their arms through—my shop had not been opened since Saturday, the 11th, because I had been ill—I was in the parlour behind the shop—in the square in front of the house there is a garden belonging to the persons who live in the square—these articles were kept in the shop on the ground floor.</p>

I am a gardener, of 6, Cumberland Market—a little before 6 a. m. on 17th May I was at work in Munster Square, and I saw that Mrs. Martin's window was broken—I saw the prisoner come out at the street door carrying a quantity of clothes, a portmanteau, and wearing apparel—a lady's dress was on the top—I could not see what was underneath—I was about ten or twelve yards from him—he went to York Passage or Court, about ten yards further, and made a bundle of the things, and then he went up a narrow street towards Stanhope Street, about 100 yards long; then he passed to the right, and went out of sight—five or seven minutes afterwards I saw him standing outside Mrs. Martin's again—his arm was through the window as far as he could reach—I saw him turn drapery and other things about at the window—twice he was disturbed by men passing to go to work, and when I was within five yards of him, he went back again after the first man passed, and was still ransacking the window; then a second man disturbed him; he went back to the window—I did not see him take anything from the window, as I lost sight of him—I am quite sure he is the man—I knew him by sight—I informed the police—I saw him again on the Monday following at the bar of a public-house in Jermyn Street—previously I had spoken to Fox, and he was close by—I told Fox that he was the man—I afterwards saw him at Marylebone Police-court, and identified him.</p>

I live at 14, Lucretia Street, right facing No. 9—about three o'clock on the day of the fire I was sitting at my window, from which I could see the parlour door at the back of the shop—I saw Mr. Inglis come out of the parlour, and come out of the side door into the street; he walked away and went round the corner—as he shut the parlour door I noticed some smoke coming out of the back parlour door; he looked up at me, and I nodded to him, and he nodded to me—I was waiting for my tea to draw—I afterwards heard some screams—I went to the window and saw Mrs. Lorden run across the road, and I heard her call up the stairs, "For God's sake bring down the children, the house is on fire!"—I saw some flames when Mrs. Lorden put her foot to the back parlour door and it came open—that was about ten minutes after the prisoner had left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fireman to the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, at Waterloo Road Fire Brigade Station—on 22nd May, at ten minutes past three in the afternoon, I received a call to 9, Lucretia Street—I arrived there within nine minutes of the call—I found both the doors open—I went in and found some fires; one in the cupboard in the back parlour; another in the cupboard in the shop; also some fire under the counter; but I think possibly that had been thrown there—those in the cupboards were two distinct fires; they could not have communicated—the fire under the counter consisted of rolls of paper; and there was a parcel of coal-and coke there, about ten or twelve pounds, saturated with fresh paraffin, quite wet—I also found some rags and felt there, freshly saturated with paraffin—there was also paraffin on the counter, and generally all over the room, also in different parts of the floor in the shop—I found a can in the back parlour, close to the cupboard that was on fire; it contained about half a pint of paraffin—I think the things on fire under the counter were very likely thrown there by some of the people who had come in to put out the fire, because there was no damage to the counter, and if there had been a fire there, there would have been damage, it was a lighter fire than the others.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I opened the door to you between quarter and five minutes to twelve—you looked as though you had been running—one of the detectives came for me—I have given your wife notice to leave; you owe us rent—you are not on bad terms with me as a landlord—I have no vindictive feelings whatever—I heard you say, "I think I had better go"—the detective told me to mention it to the Magistrate as I was about to leave the witness-box—I had not told them about it—I told them my suspicions about you—my wife may have told them—you ran out of our house, and I did not see you again till at the Court—I did not see the detectives till the Wednesday, I think—my wife was in bed when you came in on the night of the robbery—very possibly she could see you come in from the position of the bed; she says she did—the bedroom door was partly open when I came to let you in—I never saw you wear anything but a cap of this description—I did not observe you go out on the morning of the robbery—I saw you half a dozen times while you were living in the house—you were not there all the time—I heard you were away all day and night for some time—I made inquiries about you—I saw you with a coat of the description you have now—I never saw you with a jacket that I know of—your cap, when you were at our place, appeared to fit you—I cannot swear this is the same cap, it is very much like it—when you said you had better go, I thought you had been doing something wrong by the manner you came into the house—I had my suspicions about you—I had been watching you—I think very possibly my wife heard you say, "I think I had better go"—you did not say, "I think I had better go and get them"—I told my wife what I heard, and said, "I will not have them in my house; they are dangerous people."</p>

I am the last witness's wife, and live with him at 50, Elliot's Road, St. George's Road—the prisoner lodged with us for about four weeks—on the night of the 7th May he went out, and came back about 11. 45, wearing nothing on his head—he generally wears a round cap, similar to this; I saw it on the table on the Tuesday morning—he passed my stairs when he came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 116, St. George's Road, Southwark—some few days after his first appearance at the Police-court, Mr. Freeman came to me, and I examined him—he was in a very nervous state, shaking very much; his right thumb was bruised—he had a severe bruise extending above and below the left elbow joint, below to the wrist, and above to the shoulder—he was also bruised about the left hip on the outer side of the leg, and he complained of stiffness all down that side—he was suffering very considerably, too, from shock—his injuries were severe, not dangerous—an ordinary fall would not cause such injuries; a fall with violence would; a blow on the ear, and being knocked or dragged down would cause them—a tear with a nail would have caused the injury on the wrist—the skin was quite off the inner side of the right thumb—the back of the hand and wrist were slightly swollen—the thumb is swollen to this day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM HENRY CHANDLER</hi>. I am storekeeper at Her Majesty's Prison, Wandsworth—the prisoner has been a warder there about twenty two years in Her Majesty's service—for the last nine years he has been reception warder—it was his duty to receive prisoners when they came into gaol—a book, called the prisoners' property book, is kept, in which is entered the property and money each prisoner brings into gaol, and it is the duty of the warder on duty to require each prisoner to sign the description of his properly and the amount of his money—in addition to that there is a paper called the prisoners' record, in which there is an entry of the money brought in—it was the prisoner's duty to bring me the prisoners' property book every day about eleven a. m., and I checked his adding up of the money received from the prisoners the previous day; if it is correct I initial it, and enter the total in my cash-book, and require him to give me the amount—when prisoners are discharged they are entitled to gratuities according to the work they have done; an account of the marks returned is kept in the chief wardens office—the reception warder has nothing to do with it—the gratuity-sheets are not prepared under my superintendence—on the day previous to a prisoner's discharge I give Batchelor a certain sum to pay next morning—he gave me about the amount he should require from his rough list which he brought me—I gave him sufficient to cover the prisoners' money and gratuities—he would learn the amount from the clerk's office, and then calculate the gratuities and enter it on a slip of paper before he came to me—he made out the entire gratuity-sheet on which would appear the date, the prisoner's number and his name, his private money, his gratuity, and his signature—when prisoners are discharged they are required to sign the prisoners' property-book again—there are two columns, one for signing on reception, the other on discharge—on going out a prisoner's attention is called to the book rather with regard to property than money; he would go to the reception warder's desk and receive the gratuity and private money due to him—if he can write he is required to sign against the entry, and if he cannot to put his mark—it is the prisoner's duty to witness the marks, and sign his name in the place marked "Witness for the marks"—prisoners are discharged at 8. 30, and the prisoner would come to me the same day at eleven o'clock, and bring the gratuity-sheet and account to me for the amount paid out that morning, giving me the balance—the gratuity-sheets are checked three or four times a month with the prisoners pay-book—here is" 7241, William Young"; he would trace out his name in the property-book, find his name, and pass it, and initial the property-book—to avoid that check it was necessary to alter the prisoners' property-book to make it agree with the gratuity-sheet—on April 1st each year there is a more extensive check for prisoners' money; three clerks do it; each record is</p>

               <p>got out, and the amount taken down by each one; it is totalled, and the amount due to prisoners, which my cash-book shows, should agree with the amount on the records—my cash-book is compared with the prisoners' property-book once a month—the individual amounts are not put down in my cash-book, only the total for each day—I do not know whose writing the words "his mark" are in this entry in the prisoners' property-book: "January 5th, 1887, Young, cash received £6 1s. 6d. his mark"—the initials A. H. are Albert Hawks, the clerk—I do not know the prisoner's writing sufficiently to say—there is no attestation at the bottom of that—the total at the bottom of that page is £6 7s. 3 3/4 d., that is carried over 7s. 3 3/4 d., omitting the £6—I have initialled the 7s. 3 3/4 d.—this is also a check mark at the top of the page over, showing that I checked it as properly carried over—in my cash-book of January 5th I have 7s. 3 3/4 d. as the money given to me taken from prisoner on that day—that book remains in my custody—it would be very difficult for any person to get at it—I received 7s. 3 3/4 d. from the prisoner that day, and no more—it is not true that I received £6 7s. 3 3/4 d.—the books are checked for the previous month up to date, so that the alteration could not have been made on the prisoner's discharge—if it had been made after eighteen months the alteration would not appear—the prisoners' property-book was in Batchelor's possession—the amount he brought in on Young's record-sheet was 1s. 6d.—I cannot say in whose writing that is, as it is in figures—the sheet is in Batchelor's writing, though I cannot swear it, because I do not know enough of it—the person who makes out the sheet does not always enter the money—this is the gratuity-sheet for April 3rd, 1888; it is in Batchelor's writing—the first entry is "7241. W. Young, £6 1s. 6d. Prisoner's money, gratuity, 10s. W. Young, his mark"—that is in Batchelor's writing, and at the bottom here is "Witness for the above, H. Batchelor, "in Batchelor's writing—this £1 18s. is the total amount of gratuities—I have an entry of the amount I gave the prisoner—in anticipation of that he gives me a receipt for it, and when it is done with next day it is torn up—I know that I gave the amount necessary to Batchelor the day before, and it would be sufficient to have included the £6 in addition, to the 18d.—he showed me this gratuity-sheet on the same day that it was paid out, and accounted for the balance of the money, supposing he had not spent it all—he represented that he had spent £7 15s. 11 3/4 d., prisoners' money, and £1 18s. for gratuities, including Young's £6 and 18d.—on 10th January, 1887, I found in the prisoners' property-book, "Duckett, £5 0s. 0 1/2 d."—the total at the bottom of the page is £6 13s. 3 3/4 d.; that finishes it—it is signed by Duckett, both going in and coming out—I find by the cash-book that Batchelor paid me £1 13s. 3 3/4 d. that day, so that the £5 0s. 0 1/2 d. would not have been included—I added up the prisoners' property-book, and at that time it was correct, and I entered £1 13s. 3 3/4 d. in my book—this is Duckett's record-sheet; the entry on the prisoner's record-sheet is £5 0s. 0 1/2 d.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the sheets the prisoner used to bring when he told me the amount he required, and I find entered against each prisoner the amount to which he was entitled—against the top entry," 7333 Duckett, "I find no entry at all—on the gratuity-sheet in Duckett's case I find "Prisoner's money £5 0s. 0 1/2 d., and 10s. gratuity, signed 'T. A. Duckett'"—Batchelor was the reception</p>

               <p>warder, who drew sufficient money for the prisoner, to be discharged on July 9th, and that was sufficient to cover the £5 0s. 0 1/2 d—on 9th July he brought me the gratuity-sheet, and accounted for the money he had paid, and gave me the balance, which included Duckett's £5 0s. 0 1/2 d.—this gratuity-sheet is in his writing, and here is written at the bottom, "Witness for the above marks, H. Batchelor," in the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been engaged at the prison thirty-three years—Batchelor had to receive prisoners as late as 10 p. m.—he received sixty or seventy prisoners a day, in batches; he had to take down a minute description of them—he had two assistants, and he might have other help—Rowan is a warder; he sometimes initialled the prisoners' property book—"P. R." opposite Duckett's name stands for Rowan—my office is a long way from the reception-room, and from the stores—Duckett was employed in the store; that is down in the basement—the reception-room is in a distinct building—these frauds were only discovered this year—I do not know that up to that time these books were, left lying about the reception-room, or whether they were kept locked up; I know they should be; it is not my business to look after them—I balance my private cash-book nearly every day; I never let a week elapse; I always do it myself when on duty—I am sometimes away three weeks, on leave, and during that time the chief clerk would look after my books—there are six clerks—Batchelor's wages were 28s. a week—when a prisoner was going to be discharged Batchelor brought the rough list and told me the amount; I never looked at it—he would tell me what gratuities the prisoners were entitled to—I should not know or inquire their names; I should not give him £50 if he asked for it; but unless it was some very large sum I should not check it, I could not—I could ask him the prisoners' names, but it would be no use for my cash-book; it has been tested since by the prisoners' record—the total receipt of each day is entered in my cash-book, but no prisoners' names—prisoners are discharged in large numbers every day—Batchelor was not in the habit of coming to my room and assisting me—I have a safe in my room, where I keep all the money, and sometimes I have large sums there—I left the room while Batchelor was there; I never missed anything—I locked the safe when I left; I should not like to say always—I gave him receipts for the sums I received day by day; they are really like I O U's, and when his account was squared they were torn in half and given to him—there used to be a balance coming to me day by day from him—he got an even number of pounds from me, and I knew whether the balance he brought back was correct by checking his totals—he was responsible for all the property brought in by-prisoners—when he was absent one of the assistant warders took his duty, and there are other initials—I think each prisoner on leaving goes before the governor, who asks him if he has received his correct amount—the store-room is in the basement, and the storekeeper's office is upstairs—I do not remember the prisoner demanding as large a sum as £335 of me, but sometimes we have large sums going out—I checked them by looking at the record—I should not give him a large sum of money the day before, it would be locked up till morning—if any man was going out with £10 I should do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant warder at Wandsworth Prison—my duty is to assist Mr. Chandler or to act in his absence—I have heard his evidence as to receiving prisoners and discharging them; it is correct—the entries in the prisoners' property-book for January 5th, 1887, are, some in my writing and some in the prisoner's—Young's entry is in the prisoner's writing—I did not enter £6 1s. 6d. there—if the prisoner says that one of the assistant warders made that entry that is not true, as far as I am concerned; I neither made the original entry, 1s. 6d., nor have I altered it since to £6 1s. 6d.—the rest of the entry on his reception is in Pink's writing, and this is my signature on his discharge—that refers to the property, not to the man; the prisoner would pay the money on discharge, and he would have the sheet before him, which the prisoner going out would have to sign as a receipt for the money—this is the signature, H. B., at the bottom of the page—this £4 7s. 3 3/4 d. is not my writing, nor is the total in the next page mine, or made with my knowledge—I see 1s. 6d. entered in Young's record-sheet; that is the prisoner's writing, and Young's gratuity-sheet also, as near as I can say—I did not make the entry, "7241 W. Young, £6 1s. 6d.;" this is the prisoner's writing, "H. Batchelor, witness of the private marks"—this entry, on 10th January, in the prisoners' property-book, with regard to Duckett, is mine; but the figures £5 0s. 0 1/2 d., are not mine—the total, £6 13s. 3 3/4 d., is not in my figures—it was not my duty to add up the columns, it was the prisoner's duty—six prisoners are told off to clean each day in different places, there is always a warder with them, and if I was on duty a prisoner could not leave his work of cleaning and go to the books and make an alteration without being seen; but sometimes they are in separate rooms, with only one warder to mind the six—the prisoners have nothing to do with receiving money.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made some of the figures in these books—I can pick out my own figures—two rooms open into the room in which the book was kept—it was kept in a cupboard in one of them when it was not in use, and that cupboard was always locked—the book was locked up when it was done with at 10 p. m.—it was on the desk in the daytime, there is never an officer out of the room for a moment to my knowledge—I have seen twenty prisoners received at one time—they occasionally talk together while they are waiting; they wait till the principal officer arrives, but there is always an officer there—when Batchelor or Rowan was not there, it was always my duty to look after the book and enter the figures—six prisoners were sent to that room for cleaning purposes—the governor would not put a prisoner who could read and write to assist me—he would only send six men for cleaning purposes, and one officer to look after them.</p>

                  </hi>. In January, 1887, I was sentenced to eighteen months' hard labour—I went to Wandsworth Prison—I was taken to the reception-room, but the reception warder was not there—my articles were all taken from me—I cannot say whether I had any money, but I think I had 9d.—I am certain I had not £5—what I had was entered in a book, which I signed—when I went out I received from the prisoner my articles and 10s. which I had earned—I signed the book against the 10s.—I am quite sure there was not an entry of £5 0s. 0 1/2 d. against my name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think I can swear that I did not ever receive 9d., but I was so joyed at coming out—there were a good many prisoners there getting paid, and getting their things back—that was not the first time I was in prison, but not there—I am earning an honest livelihood now.</p>

On the morning of 29th April I went to Wandsworth Prison, and the governor gave the prisoner into my custody for falsifying the accounts to the amount of £40, and drew his attention to two entries in the prisoners' property-book—he said, "Other warders have access to the books, and may have altered the figures; I know nothing about it"—he repeated that at the station.</p>
