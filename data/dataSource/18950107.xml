I am a warehouseman, of 13, Gutter Lane, City—the house is let off in portions to different warehousemen—each separate warehouse is let to different persons, and each has an outer door—on Saturday, December 22nd, I left my warehouse at twenty minutes to three—I locked the door—there are two glass panels in the door—the warehouse is on the third floor; it contained a quantity of goods—I re<lb/>turned on Monday morning about half-past ten—I found that one of the glass panels had been broken, and portions of glass were lying on the floor—the locks were entire—the glass was broken sufficiently for a man to get through—I found a lot of empty boxes which had contained silk handkerchiefs—my cash-box was lying open in the inner office—there was nothing in it—I missed an Inverness cape—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the silk ties, and this is one of the silk handkerchiefs—I am able to identify this pattern—it is a very common pattern; but this is a special pattern, the whole of which I bought from one manufacturer, and which had been in stock since July 20th—the wholesale price of the ties is 8s. 6d. or 9s. 6d.—the total value is about £20—the handkerchiefs are 24s. a dozen.</p>

On December 24th I received infor<lb/>mation of Mr. Blythe's warehouse having been broken into, and I went and examined the premises—I found a glass panel of a door on the third floor had been removed sufficiently for a man to get through; the place was strewn about with empty boxes in great confusion—I made inquiries, and on the following Thursday, the 27th, I went and saw Coster and had a conversation with him—he mentioned a name to me and produced to me this tie and handkerchief—next day I went to Royal Mint Square and kept observation—I saw the prisoner going into the square, and I went up to him and said, "Mr. De Roode, I am a police officer; I want to know where you got those handkerchiefs and ties from that you sold last Saturday?"—he said, "I know nothing about hand<lb/>kerchiefs and ties"—I said, "Those you sold to Mr. Coster last Saturday?"—he said, "I bought those of a man in Oxford Street, close by Tottenham Court Road"—I said, "In a shop or in the street?"—he said, "In the street"—I said, "Do you know the man?"—he said, "I have seen him before, but I don't know who he is, or where he lives"—I said, "How much did you give him for them?"—he said, "£7 10s."—I said, "Did you get a receipt for them?"—he said "No"—I said, "Did you look at them or count them when you bought them?"—he said, "No, I counted them when I got to Mr. Coster's"—I said, "What time was it when you bought them?"—he said, "About four o'clock"—I said, "You will have to come with me to Cloak Lane Station"—he was charged there, and in answer he said, "How can I be charged with two things, breaking and entering, and receiving the goods?"—he was searched, and £2 7s. 8 1/2 d. was found on him, and several articles not relating to the charge—I am sure he said he knew nothing about ties and handkerchiefs till I mentioned Coster's name—it is about a mile from Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Street, to 13, Gutter Lane, I should think; it may be a little more.</p>

It is too heavy for me"—the prisoner said, "I wish I had much of it"—the money was paid for silk handkerchiefs and scarfs—all this happened on 23rd December, not 13th—I don't know who the lad was—I had not seen him before and I have not seen him since.</p>

I live at Wood Grange House, Forest Gate—on December 17th, between eleven and 11.30 p.m., I was with Mr. Leach and Mr. Clark—I had a silver watch and a gold chain—I looked at it just before going into an urinal—the prisoner came by, and a little girl with him, and some one said, "You ought not to bring a child into this place so late at night"—the prisoner made some remark which I did not catch, and left, and immediately came back alone, came straight up to me, struck me on my face with his fist and knocked me down—I got up and hit at him with my umbrella—he ran away and I immediately missed my watch and chain—Potter brought him back and I at once identified him—the constable said, "Is that him?"—I said "Yes," and he knocked the constable down—four constables came up and held him, and he tripped up another—he was taken to the station—my watch and chain were worth about £3—I have not got them back.</p>

Going to have a drink?"—I said, "Yes," to detain him—I followed him in, and then told him I should take him into custody for robbing a man in Fornier Street—he said, "I know nothing about it"—he had his hand in his pocket—he would not allow me to search his pocket—he said, "Take me into the tap-room"—I did so, and searched him, but found nothing—there were three other men near him, standing close by—I had sent for another constable, but he had not arrived—the prisoner kept his hand in his pocket till I took it out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller—I live at 155, Bridge Road, Battersea, and trade in Newgate Street—I had a son, William Godfrey Holland, who went to America about two and a half years ago—since ho went I and my family were in communication with him by letter, scarcely a week or ten days passed without our hearing—I had no intimation that he was married or living with a woman; we knew he had a sweetheart in Battersea, who expected him home—in September he died—about 16th September we received a letter from America, and after that a telegram from Liverpool, and my sons went to Euston Station to meet someone, and came back with the prisoner, who told us she was my son's widow—I expressed surprise—she said, "If you have any doubt as to my being your son's widow I will leave your house at once"—she said he had courted her in Sheffield, and when she got to America everything was prepared for her, and she walked into a room where a clergyman and witnesses were, and the marriage took place—she said she had been a single woman before that marriage—she and my wife sat up and talked together, and hardly went to bed that night—in consequence of what she said I allowed her to stop at my house, and supplied her with food free of charge—my son's life had been assured—this is the policy; I gave it to the prisoner, relying on the statement that she was my son's widow—the whole of the time she was at our house she was greatly dissatisfied—she said my son had made out that we were very much better off than we were, that she had greater expectations, and that she was given to under<lb/>stand I was a magistrate and lived in a large house—the Prudential office after making inquiries gave her a cheque for £9 10s.—she asked me next day to cash it for her, and I did so and paid a small bill for her and gave her the balance of between £7 and £8—towards the end of Novem<lb/>ber she left my house—after that, on 21st November, I gave her £1, still believing she was my son's widow—on 10th December I went to Sheffield—Mrs. Brooks, the prisoner's sister, had stayed at our house from October 8th to 10th, a week after the prisoner came—I came back from Sheffield on December 11th, and the same night I went with two of my sons and told the prisoner I had been to Sheffield and found out who she was, and she said, "I could have told you all that, and saved you the trouble. A pretty thing you have done, going to Sheffield," and she was very much put about by my going—I said I had seen her husband, and found out she was married to Charles Hobson—she admitted it—afterwards, in talking to me in her apartments, she said, "A pretty lot you have done for me"—she said she quite expected the policy was for £1,000—I afterwards got a summons from her for the return of two sheets, which she had asked my wife to send to the wash, and which had not come home, and some pictures which she had given to my sons—she had been to ask my wife for the sheets—she could have had them when they came home—after receiving the summons I consulted Mr. Bell, my-solicitor—T went to the Police-court and swore an information, and got a warrant against her—I was present when her summons came on for</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Before my son went to America he lived at Sheffield for some time, and I know now that he there lodged with the prisoner and her husband—some short time after my son went to America the prisoner left for America—this is a photograph of myself as a sergeant in the East Surrey Volunteers; it was taken some four or five years ago—it must have been sent to my son, I did not know it was—this is a portrait of my late son—this certificate of death from the authorities of New York was shown to me by the prisoner—I have not before seen this receipt for the purchase of a plot for a grave in the Brooklyn cemetery—I fancy I have seen one of these undertaker's receipts for the burial of Mr. Holland, but not this other—the prisoner told me that she had buried my son, and erected a monument over him; I don't know the expense of it, but she said she had paid it from the money she received from Macey's, his employers—I never heard that she was employed as a saleswoman at the same establishment as my son, who was a second-class accountant—this is the certificate of baptism of a little girl; the writing on it more resembles that of a son at home than that of my late son—I cannot say if it resembles my late son's writing—we have doubts whether the prisoner lived with my son in America—she made up her case by means of those documents; we should not have received her in our house but for them—we don't believe she lived with my son as his wife in America; we believe he had apart<lb/>ments in her house, and that she was the housekeeper—I have no doubt she was living in the same house with him—I have a doubt as to whether the child is my son's natural child—we have no evidence about it one way or the other—when the prisoner arrived at our house, my wife sat up nearly all night talking to her—she appeared to know everything about my son—Mrs. Brooks, her sister, came on the Monday week after the prisoner came—I was not then told the exact circumstances under which the prisoner came to live with my son—I did not know that she was married, and had a husband named Hobson, at Sheffield—I did not say that although my son ought not to have done it, yet, as she had been a good wife to him, I would look over the fact that she was not married to him, and would forgive her, and that if Mr. Hobson did not know of her arrival in this country, it would be as well not to let him know, and that I would get her rooms—Mrs. Brooks came; she was astonished—she described how my son went to her shop for refreshments, and became engaged to her sister, the prisoner, who was in her employment, and said that their mother was so broken-hearted when she went to America that she offered her £50 not to go—the sister is here—I never heard of Hobson till I went to Sheffield—I thought the prisoner could earn her own living very easily as a book canvasser, and so I did not give her more money—I told Mrs. Brooks she could earn 30s. a week for three or four hours' work a day—Mrs. Brooks said she would give her 5s. a week till she got straight, and that was sent—the Prudential officers called and filled up the papers while Mrs. Brooks was there—I don't know that my son knew he was insured for certain—Mrs. Holland always kept it paid—when</p>

               <p>the Prudential officers came the prisoner did not say she had not paid the premiums, and did not want the insurance money, and that I could have it, and that if she signed a receipt it would be on my behalf—I did not reply that the prisoner would receive it indirectly—I knew we had to do something for her, and it did not matter whether she had the money, or had something for it—I endorsed the cheque from the Pruden<lb/>tial, which was payable to a number—I paid her the £9 10s., except for the amount of a small account of hers which I paid—things went on not very rosily, and in consequence I went to Sheffield on 10th December—I saw Mr. Hobson there—my son gave me the name of Hobson, which he said he had found in an old pocket-book, as the name where my late son lodged at Sheffield—after finding Hobson, and coming back, the prisoner admitted that Hobson was her husband, but stuck to it that everything was right, and that she was an honourable woman in America; she told us a pitiable story about Sheffield, that she would do seven years rather than go back to Sheffield, as her husband had treated her very badly, and that she had had four or five miscarriages through his ill-treatment—then she gained our sympathy—then she made arrange<lb/>ments to go to America, and she said, "I will go by Monday's boat, if you will only give me my fare and £1 or £2 for when I get there, and you can have everything that is here"—I got a ticket for her by the <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi>—Arding and Hobbs offered £14 for the furniture—I don't know that she was anxious to take it—I would not part with the ticket or anything until she was off, that was the trouble—it was not likely that I should give her the £5 note till she was in the railway carriage—there was no difficulty about her accepting the ticket for her passage on board the <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi>—I said I would not give her the ticket or anything until she was clear of the place and out of it—she did not say she would rather have the £14 10s. from Arding and Hobbs instead of my having the furniture and giving her the ticket and £5—nothing was said about what I was to give her besides the ticket, we could not trust her—she did not then ask for her pictures and things back—I had nothing of hers in my possession—the Magistrate made an order upon her summons—I have given up the pictures and sheets to her, but the pictures were not hers—she gave them to my sons when she arrived—she was to have gone by the <hi rend="italic">Majestic</hi> before I was summoned—she brought back my son's watch from America, and gave it to one of my other sons—it was not very valuable—before I received the summons I had been to the Police-station and had a detective in my house—when I came back from Sheffield I was under the impression that I could give her into custody at once, and I was told I could not—I received the summons about ten days after coming back from Sheffield—I did not intend to take proceedings if I had not received that sum<lb/>mons, because I did not wish to run into a lot of costs.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Forest Gate—I am a master mariner—I have held a certificate for thirteen years, and have had the command of vessels in various trades—in June 6th last year I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Shipping Gazette</hi>—this is a copy of it—"Master wanted for new boat, 3,600 tons. Ready Must invest.—Address, with copies; of testimonials, 466, <hi rend="italic">Shipping Gazette and Lloyd's</hi> Offices, 54, Gracechurch Street."—I replied to that address, and then received this letter of June 8th. I believe in Richards' handwriting, from what I have seen of it—"26, Bedford Row. Please call about two to-morrow afternoon, then we can discuss terms. <hi rend="smallCaps">E. M. RICHARDS</hi>."—I called at that address on Saturday, 9th June, and saw Richards—he said, "About this a boat, what can you do?"—I asked him what vessels he owned—he said lie owned none at present, but that he had owned several sailing ships and one steamer; that he had sold the sailing ships, and the steamer was lost, and that he now intended to build four larger steamers, and that he wanted a master for the first one, which was being built in West Hartlepool by Messrs. Furness, Withey and Co.—he then asked me if I would take shares in the first boat, or in the company, the Park Steamship Company, Limited—he had told me this before, when I went there—he said, "This is the Park Steamship Company," and he showed me a plan of a steamer—he represented himself as manager of the company, and that was his reason for writing to me as manager—when he showed me the plan he said the vessel was to carry about 3,800 tons—that corresponded with the advertisement—he said the company was formed, and that they had in England £15,000 in hand, and a further £1,500 in shares subject to twenty-one days' call; that they had the whole of the money to pay for the first boat and some money for working expenses—he said that he and Errington were getting up this company: he was the manager and Errington was trustee for the debenture-holders—he asked me how much money I could put into the affair—I declined to take shares; but he tried to persuade me to hand over £200 as to allotment of shares, which would have been about 7s. 6d. in the £ they were £1 shares—I made a calculation in my own mind, and I declined to take shares—he said if I did not take shares I must hand him a deposit as security for the ship and as master—he showed me this prospectus of the company—I read it at his private house—I just glanced over it; but when he saw me reading it he began talking about other things, and I really did not read it. (<hi rend="italic">The prospectus was put in and read</hi>)—I referred them to my late employers, and agreed that if my references were satisfactory I would deposit £200 as security under an agreement—in reply to a telegram I called on him again on Monday, 11th June—he said he had seen my references, and they were so far satisfactory that he was willing to accept me as master of his vessel, and he arranged for me to meet him at 25, Bedford Row, and be introduced me to Errington on the next day—in speaking to him in the first place, I asked him if the company was formed and registered, and he said "Yes," and that they had the money—he mentioned the name of the firm as Anann Ward and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189501070028"/>
               <p>Errington, but I was to see Mr. Errington—on the next day, 12th June, I went to 25, Bedford Row, and met, the prisoners—Richards introduced me to Errington in that name—Errington made the same statement that Richards had done, as to the capital they had in hand, and the capital to be called up—Errington said he was trustee for the debenture-holders, that they had the money, and that they intended to build the four boats, and they wanted a good man, and were perfectly satisfied with me, and wanted me to go down the next day to West Hartlepool to superintend the completion of the ship—Errington said they had £15,000 in hand, and a further £15,000, subject to twenty-one days' call, in shares, and that they had more than sufficient to pay for the first boat and to leave them a working capital; that after the first boat was away they would go on with the others—the boat was to be ready at the end of July—on that day at that office I paid over this cheque for £200 under an agreement, of which this is the counterpart, and which I signed—my cheque was payable to "E. Middleton Richards, manager, Park Steamship Company"—it is endorsed "E. Middleton Richards," and "E. Middleton Richards and Co." in the same writing—I got this counterpart of the agreement stamped—it was brought to me a few minutes after I arrived—this is the receipt for my cheque. (<hi rend="italic">This receipt was signed "E. Middleton Richards and Co., Park Steamship Company." The agreement was read. By it Captain James was to be captain of the first steamer delivered to the company's order, at a salary of £18 a month, and an annual bonus if the ship was kept clear of casualty, the salary to commence from the date of completion and qualification; he to deposit £200 at 5 per cent, interest; the deposit to be returned to him if he left the company's service</hi>)—At the time I parted with that cheque I believed what had been told me about the company and its capital—next day, 13th June, I went with Richards to Hartlepool—he took me to Furness, Withey and Co.'s building yard, where someone from the yard pointed out a steamer and said, "This is the steamer, No. 208"—that ship was subsequently called the <hi rend="italic">Windsor Park</hi>, but the name was never cut into the vessel—I superintended the vessel for some time, not to the finish I corresponded with Richards from time to time about the work that was being done, and suggested alterations and soon—I was in Hartlepool altogether two and a half months, but on 3rd August I got a letter from Furness, Withey and Co. ordering me out of the yard—upon that I wired to Richards—I got some letters from him, and some time afterwards he came down with regard to another steamer that they were going to pay cash for—he said he had not got the first vessel on account of the deposit not being paid, but that it would be paid in full when it was completed—I knew that the engines were not ready at the time—I don't think Richards said anything about that—on 31st July I wrote this letter to him. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they were well on with the engines</hi>)—on 4th August I received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">This acknowledged the witness's letter, and stated that he had written to Errington asking him what to do in the matter</hi>)—when he came down he said that they could not divide the money; that they had the money, but they must pay it all in a lump, for some reason or other, for which Errington was not responsible, but they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189501070029"/>
               <p>were quite prepared to buy a ready boat—that the builder's number was 203; it was called the <hi rend="italic">Rosebery</hi>; that she was launched and engined, and was practically ready for use; that she could be got ready in two or three days—that she was to cost £27,350; that he was going to get her from Furness, Withey and Co.; that they were going to pay £27,000 in cash, and the balance in bills at three months—on 12th August I wrote to him about the <hi rend="italic">Rosebery</hi>, and on 13th I received this reply from Richards, from 25, Bedford Row—on August 14th I received this from him, stating that the proposal was not accepted—I afterwards received instructions to go over the <hi rend="italic">Rosebery</hi> and report, which I did—afterwards Richards came to Hartlepool—he said he did not really know what he had come for, but he wired to Errington, and received instructions to go to Sunderland and see a gentleman there—I never got possession of the <hi rend="italic">Rosebery</hi>—she did not go to sea while I was there—they got her name changed to <hi rend="italic">Richmond Park</hi>, and a week after I went to the yard and asked how it was, and I subsequently found someone else in charge of her—I then came up to London, I think, on Saturday, August 25th, and saw both Richards and Errington on the Monday or Tuesday, at Bedford Row—I asked what was the meaning of it—they said they could not understand it, they were quite ready to buy a boat, and a lot of talk; that they still had the moneys, but it appeared that it never could be produced—other people were not so foolish as I was, and would not part with their money—I got no reason why they had not parted with the large sum of money that they said they had in hand—nothing was said at that interview as to what had become of my money—they said if they did not get that boat they would buy another—some time afterwards Richards told me that he had handed the greater part of my money over to Errington—I believe he said £170 or £175, out of my £200—I did not get any of my wages for a long time for going aboard the ship and superintending—afterwards I got £20 from Richards, by way of instalments of £10, £5, £3 and £2, and I gave a receipt for each one—on September 21st I wrote this letter to him: "Dear Sir,—I have been thinking about what you said to me about having fresh articles. I must decline. When I deposited £200 with you it was on the understanding that I was to have the command of a new ship, and that she was ready, and that the money was ready to pay, but it seems this was not the case. I shall be seeing Messrs. Lowless and Co.," etc.—they had pretended to treat for other boats, and eventually said that they would take one at Antwerp, and wanted me to sign articles on that ship—I don't think I got any answer to my letter—Richards never wrote repudiating that he had made such representations—on August 5th, 1894, I wrote this letter to Richards about returning my money, and on the 7th I received this answer, stating that Errington would be back to morrow—subsequently I saw Richards frequently about returning my money, and I saw Errington, not about returning my money, but on other occasions—I asked him about the ship, and he wittily remarked that he would buy me a sixpenny one; I expect he thought that witty, because he had a grin on him—I never got more than the £20—I never have got a farthing of my £200.</p>

               <p>£75—he did not go with me to Hartlepool between September 1st and my coming back to London—I don't know where he was during that time; he was sometimes at Hartlepool and sometimes elsewhere—I got letters from him once or twice, dated from Hartlepool, in reference to steamers that he said he was trying to purchase—that was between the time I went to Hartlepool and the time of his arrest—he paid me the £20 as wages—all through the affair he said that the reason the promises were not carried out was because Errington would not find the money—there was a strike, not at Furness's, but in connection with the engineering trade—I have said that for a long time one man was employed on the <hi rend="italic">Windsor Park</hi>, and that it. was impossible she could be got ready by the 9th July—on the 9th July I said in a letter to Richards, "I hope he will be able to get the <hi rend="italic">Rosebery</hi> as the first boat, for I fear it will be a long time before the <hi rend="italic">Windsor Park</hi> will be ready for sea"—I saw Richards occasionally during September and October—I met him by appointment sometimes—I remember his going to Criccieth, in Wales—it was rather a surprise to me—I did not know where he was till he wrote to me from there—I first knew that this company had not been registered, and that I had been taken in, after I had returned to London and applied to my solicitors—that was at the end of August—the receipts are here—I cannot remember the dates—I believe Richards was arrested on the 1st or 2nd of September—I consulted Messrs. Lawless and Co. about that time—I told them I had parted with my money in consequence of false representations, and I authorised them to write to him—I authorised them to act for me. (<hi rend="italic">A letter of September 1st, from Lawless and Co., teas read, stating that unless the money was repaid proceedings would be taken</hi>)—Lawless and Co. are conducting this prosecution—when I first saw Richards he told me hat he had an agreement with Furness, Withey and Co. for steamships, and he showed me the plans that were for the ship afterwards called the <hi rend="italic">Windsor Park</hi>—he did not tell me that he had an agreement with Errington to find the capital for the purchase of that boat—the only time he told me that Errington was to find £175 was at the end of October, a few days before he was arrested—when I returned to London and told them about not being able to get the ship, they both seemed surprised—they were surprised at seeing me in London, and, I suppose, surprised that they did not get the ship—Furness and Co. said it was through not furnishing the capital—they did not complain that Errington had been humbugging them—there was no suggestion to that effect.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. I told the Magistrate that I had in<lb/>structed my solicitors to take criminal proceedings against Richards unless the agreement was carried out, that is, that I was either to be provided with ray ship or the money returned, otherwise I should not have been able to commence criminal proceedings—I do not exactly remember using the word "unless"—I instructed ray solicitor to take criminal proceed<lb/>ings when he had not done so—if I made that statement before the Magistrate, of course I cannot go back from it; I would not desire to do so—it was Richards I charged in the first instance—I did not tell my solicitors that Errington had offered to give them every document in con<lb/>nection with the case and place them in full possession of the facts of the case; I was not informed of that—Errington was at the Police-court on</p>

               <p>the second occasion, not at the first—some time ago my solicitor said that Errington had offered, through his solicitors, to produce some documents—I don't think I was informed that he offered to produce <hi rend="italic">every</hi> document, but <hi rend="italic">some</hi> documents—I think it was on the 22nd November that Errington first appeared, and then he was remanded for a week—I had two interviews with Richards before I saw Errington; the first time I saw Richards was at his private house at Canonbury—I saw him there for about two hours, I think—I am not positive whether I saw the prospectus then or not; I may possibly have seen it then; I saw the plan of the ship, and we had a conversation about it; that was on Sunday—I saw him again on the Monday and on the Wednesday—on the second occasion I was with him somewhere about the same time, and we talked about the matter—he said at that time he had no ship at sea, but they were build<lb/>ing; that Furness, Withey and Co. were building a ship for him and Errington, for the Park Steamship Company—he told me that the com<lb/>pany was formed, not that he was trying to get up a company, or trying to get some friends to form a company—he said nothing about friends assist<lb/>ing to form a company—I don't think I said before the Magistrate, "Richards did not say he was starting a company alone—he said that he was getting it up with friends; if that is in my deposition I suppose it must be so; I have no recollection of saying so, or why I should; my deposition was read over to me—there were some words not exactly as I placed them, but the facts were all there—it is quite possible I said those word?—in cross-examination at the Police-court I said, "Richards did not say he was starting the company alone; he said he was getting it up with friends"—it was being suggested to me that what took place was not that I was told that the company had been formed, but that the company was being got up with friends—I remember saying that I believed he told me the company was registered—he told me they were going to get out another prospectus—he said the company had temporary offices at Bedford Row—he asked me if I would take shares, and I refused—I said I could not part with more than the £200—7s. 6d. would have to be paid on the shares at allotment, and there would be a further call—I was unwilling to take the risk—at the first interview I agreed to deposit £200, subject to his seeing my late employers, and to an agreement, which was to be drawn up if he was satisfied with my references—I was to see the agreement, and hear Errington's version before I parted with my money—in the first place I did not mention Errington—I said I wanted to see the office, and make some inquiries about it, and see how the thing was standing, and if everything was <hi rend="italic">bona-fide</hi>—I think some<lb/>thing was said about Errington at the first interview—I am not positive that he told me what Errington's position in the company was; I think he did—it was on the Monday that I agreed to pay the deposit if the agreement was drawn up, and my reference satisfactory, and after I had seen Errington, who was Richards' partner, or something of that sort—I understood that Richards and Errington were getting up the company—Richards at the first or second interview told me the company was formed, and he told me his position and Errington's position in the company before I saw Errington—I have never read more than the first page of the proof of the proposed prospectus—I took it away to read it if</p>

               <p>I felt disposed to—I stopped just on the first paragraph—it was a first proof of the prospectus of a company to be incorporated, but I understood it had been printed for some time, and that, since the printing, the company was thoroughly formed—I was led to believe they would have the money as soon as Errington had got it together—he was only to speak and the money would come in hand over fist—Richards told me a prospectus was being prepared—I had never anything to do with companies before—I did not see the names of any directors down—I did not ask who the directors were—the object of the company was described as that of purchasing four cargo steamers—I do not suggest that Errington and Ward are the same person—I have seen someone who was introduced to me as Mr. Ward—Errington is described as of 25, Bedford Row, where I went—Richards told me that was the temporary office of the company—Errington said his firm had guaranteed £15,000 of the debentures—I don't know if he used the word "underwritten" or "guaranteed"—a gentleman appearing for Errington explained to me that they were somewhat similar terms—I understood Errington to be a man of money at that time—I did not know that he had gone about the country trying to get people to take shares in this company—two and a half months after I had parted with my money I heard that he had tried to get Mr. Barwick to entrust to Furness, Withey 'and Co. a cheque for £15,000—Richards told me that—I heard from Furness, Withey and Co. that Richards or Errington had found a gentleman with £16,000—I was not at 25, Bedford Row, on the Tuesday for very long—Furness, Withey and Co. were at one end of Hartlepool and I at the other; I was at their yard superintending the completion of the ship, they were building—I went to their office about twice—I saw Mr. Furness—I was in communication with Richards by letter while I was at Hartlepool—there was a difficulty with regard to the completion of the <hi rend="italic">Windsor Park</hi> on account of a strike among the men connected with the machinery, but that was well known to Richards before I parted with my money—in consequence of that difficulty I suggested that it would be better to get a vessel more advanced, like the <hi rend="italic">Rosebery</hi>—I did not like to see them keeping their money idle—that was after I was at Hartle-pool—Errington came to Hartlepool—while there he said he hurt his foot; he leant on me to get into a cab—I did not know he was laid up for a fortnight—I did not discuss with Richards how capital could be raised to get any of the ships—I mentioned to him what I thought would be a reasonable and fair way of raising shares for future boats, but nothing connected with those four boats; and only a day or two before he was arrested I mentioned it, seeing he was trying to work some <hi rend="italic">other fake</hi>—it is becoming quite usual for captains to deposit money to be returned on leaving the, employ—Richards mentioned in his letters that Errington was away—they made the excuse that they had all this money, but it was positively to be for the first boat, this £30,000 they had—they could not get that boat, but they were prepared to buy another; they had the money, and if they could not get that, they would buy another—I never asked Errington for my money.</p>

               <p>25, Bedford Row, but not in connection with this ship—I had no conversation with him about the ships—I was introduced to him as Mr. Ward; he never took any part in the company—I only knew since the case was committed for trial that Errington also went by the name of Simpkin—when Errington spoke about the £15,000 he spoke in such a manner as to lead me to believe that he was putting in the greater part of the £15,000 that was secured or guaranteed—in addition to the £15,000 underwritten or guaranteed he referred to another sum of £15,000 of debenture money that he actually had in hand—there was that £15,000, and £15,000 subject to twenty-one days' call—I am quite sure he referred to two sums of £15,000 each, making £30,000 in all—Richards had done the same before I saw Errington, and he did it in the presence of Errington—when I paid my £200 I asked if they could not give me some other security than the agreement—they said, "What security do you want more?"—there was the ship being built, they had the money in hand, and moreover it was deposited as security, and it was as safe as the bank; if anything went wrong my money would be returned at once—it was in my anxiety to get to sea that I suggested they should not wait for the <hi rend="italic">Windsor Park</hi>, but take the <hi rend="italic">Rosebery</hi>, as she was ready—I could not say when the <hi rend="italic">Windsor Park</hi> was completed—the <hi rend="italic">Rosebery</hi> could have been completed very comfortably by the first week in September, if they had paid the money—I put the matter in my solicitors' hands, in the first place, either to have my agreement carried out or my money returned—my solicitors received this answer to their letter of 1st September. (<hi rend="italic">This was from Richards, expressing surprise at the letter he hand received, as he had no dispute with Captain James about their agreement; that James was aware of the dispute between the builders of the</hi> Windsor Park <hi rend="italic">and himself; that as soon as he heard when the ship would be finished he would let Captain James know; that there was a com<lb/>pany, but that it was not registered, and that there were good reasons for not registering it; that all the papers were ready to be sent to Somerset-House, and that the necessary capital for the purchase of the boat was ready, but that his friends would not part with it till the boat was ready; that if James wanted to resign he ought to send in his resignation, and that it was quite incorrect that James had parted with his money by false pretences, etc.</hi>)—this is the reply from my solicitors on 4th September. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that they did not want to enter into a discussion as to whether the statements in his letter were correct, but that he could satisfy the requirements of their letter by documentary evidence that a company had been formed with capital, and that the only difficulty was about getting a contract for a boat; that they would not be satisfied if it turned out that the capital had been borrowed, because that would mean a mortgage on the vessel, but that they would also want a guarantee for the repayment of the</hi> £200 <hi rend="italic">and the wages due to Captain James</hi>)—I saw Richards after that; he never offered me a guarantee for my £200—I commenced proceedings against Richards—he was then out of London, and so a warrant was obtained for his arrest—after he had been brought up and remanded, a summons was applied for on my behalf against Errington.</p>

                  </hi>. I am London manager of a department of Messrs. Furness, Withey and Co., of 5 and 6, Billiter Avenue, shipbuilders of Hartle-pool—this is a copy of an agreement, made on 11th May, 1894, between my firm and E. M. Richards, under which he agreed to purchase from us the steel screw steamer No. 208—this is the original—we undertook to use our best endeavours to complete the steamer by 31st July—the price of the steamer was to be £24,500 on the basis of cash, £1,000, to be paid on the final adoption of this contract after the buyer's approval of the plans and specifications, and balance on the completion after a satisfactory trial trip—the deposit of £1,000 was never paid—I applied to Richards for payment several times between June and October, so far as I remember—we never got a single fraction of it—Richards paid nothing in respect of the ship, either deposit or purchase-money—I called at Bedford Row on Errington whose name Richards brought up <hi rend="italic">as</hi> getting up the capital for the company—Errington said very little that was definite; he gave various assurances that this money would be forthcoming—I saw him three or four times about it; he said on the other occasions the same as he had said previously—on June 25th, 1894, we received this letter from An an a Ward and Errington. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that owing to Mr. Errington's accident at the shipyard, which had incapacitated him from proceeding further, they should not be able to register before the end of the week; and that, as regards the deposit, Richards would receive the same upon the adoption of his contract by the company</hi>)—I believe the accident referred to was that Mr. Errington slipped on a plate and sprained his foot; I had no details about it—on August 2nd I wrote this letter to Errington. (<hi rend="italic">Asking him to call at Billiter Avenue that after<lb/>noon, and stating that the limit of time for the payment of the deposit on the Windsor Park had been exceeded, and that it must be paid to-morrow, and that the question of the Rosebery could not be enter<lb/>tained until the payment of</hi> £1,000)—I do not think I got a reply to that until August 14th, when I received this from Anann Ward and Errington. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Richards had requested them to call on Mr. Furness, but that they could not do so as they had appointments; that if they were prepared to accept Richards' proposal</hi>, £20,000 <hi rend="italic">cash on delivery of the</hi> Rosebery, <hi rend="italic">and bills of exchange for the balance, the money would be forthcoming</hi>)—our firm wrote on 14th August to Errington accepting that proposal. (<hi rend="italic">Agreeing to accept</hi> £20,000 <hi rend="italic">on delivery and</hi> £6,750, <hi rend="italic">the balance, by acceptances at six months with</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">per cent, interest, they handing over the securities of the steamer, and to hold a second charge on her, and that they would agree to make the date of the transfer Monday next</hi>)—that was ft definite acceptance by our firm of the proposal that the <hi rend="italic">Rosebery</hi>, in addi<lb/>tion to the <hi rend="italic">Windsor Park</hi>, should be taken—the contract with regard to the <hi rend="italic">Windsor Park</hi> was still treated as being open—I heard of a cheque for £16,000 being paid by Mr. Barwick in respect of this matter between August 18th and August 22nd; that was a cheque for money to be advanced on mortgage of the ship—that cheque was returned by us to the drawer—nothing prevented the <hi rend="italic">Rosebery</hi> from being handed over except the non-payment of the money—the completion of the <hi rend="italic">Windsor Park</hi> was delayed because of the strike; it could not have been handed over till</p>

From May 11th till the middle of September we were in communication with Richards, either personally or by letter—I saw Richards on several occasions between those dates in London—he struck me as being desirous and anxious to complete the contract, and appeared considerably put out when there was a hitch in the matter—this letter is signed by Stevens, a director of our firm. (<hi rend="italic">This, dated June 1st</hi>, 1894, <hi rend="italic">and addressed to Richards, stated that he was glad to hear that he had got an underwriting contract, and everything in order</hi>)—Richards several times discussed with me the failure to pay the deposit—he said Mr. Errington was complicated with it—the impression on my mind was that Richards looked to Errington for payment of the deposit—he expected the money was coming through Errington as a medium—finally he gave me the impression that he was very angry with Errington for not putting him in a position to complete the contract—I thought that the money was to be supplied through Errington, and that Richards was to pay it over to us—we thought that Richards was interested in it to some measure, but not so largely as Errington—the <hi rend="italic">Windsor Park</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rosebery</hi> are the only two steamers the purchase of which Richards dis<lb/>cussed with me—by the agreement the <hi rend="italic">Windsor Park</hi> ought to have been ready for sea on July 21st, but the strike occurred, and it was delayed, and the <hi rend="italic">Rosebery</hi> was asked for instead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs. Botterill and Roach, solicitors, of Sunderland—we are solicitors to Mr. Barwick—on August 20th, 1894, Richards came to see us at Sunderland with reference to a proposed mortgage of the 88. <hi rend="italic">Richmond Park</hi> as it was then called; it was afterwards called the <hi rend="italic">Rosebery</hi>—as solicitors we had received this letter which had been sent to Mr. Barwick on 30th July, 1894, from Anann Ward and Errington, proposing the mortgage, and asking Mr. Barwick if he would advance £21,000 on the mortgage of that ship—ultimately he agreed to advance £16,000 on mortgage—he came to our office, and saw Richards, who urged him to advance at least £20,000, because he expected the total purchase-money would be £26,760, £20,000 of which was to be cash—Anann Ward and Errington had told us in correspondence that Richards was the buyer of the vessel, and was at Hartlepool, and he had been requested to call, and then we had a letter from Richards from the Royal Hotel, Hartlepool,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189501070036"/>
               <p>saying he would call, and he was then told to call on us—he came and in<lb/>troduced himself to us as the buyer of the vessel—Mr. Barwick agreed to advance £16,000, and would not exceed that—Richards was to see Fur<lb/>ness, Withey, and see if he could arrange for the difference—we under<lb/>stood Furness, Withey were to have a second mortgage—I questioned Richards as to whom and what he was; I have notes of the interview—he described his firm as Middleton Richards and Co., of West India House, Leadenhall Street; that he was the sole member of the firm—we inquired about the insurance of the vessel, and he told us that John Hol man and Co., of London, were his brokers, and they were arranging the insurance; the vessel was to be insured for £33,000, of which policies to the amount of £27,500 were to be endorsed and handed to Mr. Barwick as mortgagee, and that at least £20,000 of those policies were to be with English underwriters—on the following morning Mr. Barwick handed me his own cheque for £14,000, and two other cheques in his favour, making altogether £16,000—the following morning Richards telephoned, and I went to Hartlepool and saw him at the hotel—he said Furness Withey were raising a lot of difficulties; and then he said they were getting up Tour or five different vessels—he said Mr. Furness would not accept less than £20,000 cash; that he (Richards) had assured Furness that the £4,000 difference in cash would be forthcoming on that day, and he produced to me a telegram from Errington with regard to the £4,000—Richards then told me that he had been trying to induce Mr. Furness to accept £16,000 only, the money on mortgage—Mr. Furness declined to do it—the cheque for £16,000 was deposited with Furness and Co. on the understanding that the other £4,000 was found—Mr. Richards produced to Mr. Furness, in my presence, the telegram he had shown to me, and told Mr. Furness he proposed going to London that night, and immediately he arrived the £4,000 would be forthcoming—it was arranged that he should act for Furness and Co. in preparing a second mortgage, and that the whole matter should be carried out the following morning at our London office—I handed Furness and Co. the cheques, and they gave me the builder's certificates, and an undertaking to hold the cheque to our order, we undertaking to hold the builder's cer<lb/>tificates to their order until the matter was carried out—the £4,000 was not forthcoming, and four or five days later the cheques were returned by Messrs. Furness and Co. to Mr. Barwick—I did not hear from Richards after he left for London, but Mr. Roche saw him and Errington in London afterwards—Mr. Roche was going up to London that afternoon and was to complete the matter.</p>

At 1.30 p.m. on December 10th I was in the Staines Road, when the prosecutrix came up and spoke to me—the pri<lb/>soner then came up and asked me what was the matter—I said, "Not much "—the prosecutrix said, "You know what you threatened to do to me, and I stopped the constable for protection"—the prisoner said, "You b—swine! I will, too," and he struck at her with his hand and drew an open knife from his pocket with his right hand—I made a run at him across the road and caught him by the back of his collar—he struck at her violently eight or nine times with the knife, but could not reach her because I held him back—then she made her escape across to a shop—it was all done in a second or two—he only reached her hand, which she put up to protect her head—I could not say whether he hit her more than once—Hawkins came up—the prisoner struck him with the knife and cut his cheek—he did not injure me—when I had the prisoner by the back of the neck he said, "You b—pig, I will stab you!"—I said, "Will you?"—he made a drive at me with the knife—I bobbed my head down, and escaped the blow, and then Hawkins came up, and the prisoner made a rush at him, and Hawkins closed with him, and they fell to the ground—I had been there two or three minutes before Hawkins came up—I took the knife from the prisoner when he was on the ground—we always carry truncheons.</p>

About 1.30 p.m. on December 10th I was in the Staines Road, and opposite the Green I saw Brown in pursuit of the prisoner, who was pursuing the prosecutrix—the prisoner was five or six yards ahead of Brown before Brown started in pursuit of him—I had not seen anything previously—before I got up I saw the prisoner striking at the woman—I did not see the knife till I got up, and then I saw the policeman struggling with him, and preventing the prisoner from striking the full force of his blow at the woman—eventually she got away—I doubled across the road to them—the prisoner broke away from Brown, came up to me with a knife and said, "You b—! I will strike you"—he made a blow at me—I avoided it, but the point penetrated my left cheek, which bled profusely—I closed with the prisoner; we fell to the ground—I struggled with and overpowered him—he was very violent at first—he said if I let him get up he would go to the station quietly, and he went with me—he was under the influence of liquor I should say, but he knew what he was doing—if a policeman found a violent man with a knife stabbing repeated blows at a woman, it would be his duty to use his truncheon to prevent further mischief—Brown has only been a few months in the force.</p>

I am divisional surgeon of police at Twickenham—on 10th December I was called to the Police-station, where I saw the prisoner, the prosecutrix and Hawkins—the prisoner had a cut on the little finger of the right hand, and cuts across the fore and middle fingers, of the left hand, as if he had grasped the knife in taking it from his poc<lb/>ket—the prosecutrix had two wounds on her left hand, the skin was shaved off the forefinger knuckle and there was a punctured wound on the back of the hand—those two wounds might have been done by the same blow, but probably they were done by two—this knife would hav</p>

I am a labourer employed at Ridley, Whiteley and Co.'s floorcloth factory in Angel Street, Edmonton—I was at work there on the morning of the 24th December—I knew the prisoner and the deceased William Clark—Clark was in charge of a van belonging to the contractor for canvases—he had to cart the canvases from the barges on the wharf to the workshop on the River Lea, that is a distance of from 150 to 200 yards—Green was ganger over the canvases, and was in charge of the working party in the barge, which came in about nine to 9.20—the loading of the van began as soon as he came—Clark was there, but he was at the other end of the shed, he did not appear in time—Clark said to Green, "I want you to go to the workshop with this load," and he kept swearing at him—Green took no notice of it—the van was loaded and went on—Clark came up several times that morning and was swearing at Green—it went on till about twelve, when Green told him to come out of the canvas shed—he did not care about coming out, and he began swearing at Green again—at last Green said, "Are you going to be quiet, or do you mean to have a row?"—Clark said, "I don't care," and then Green struck him and he fell down—I picked him up and Green also—he was unconscious—in a short time he recovered—Green suggested that he should be taken to the hospital—he did not go, he wanted to look after his horse—Green said, "Will you go and see a doctor?" and he said to Wheeler, "Will you take him to the hospital?"—he said, "Yes," and he did so.</p>

I am the son of the last witness—she drew my attention to the advertisement, and I went to the Maltsters' Arms and saw Harrington and Stevens—Harrington said that he wanted a manager, that the house was his own; he had not long bought it, and, if I suited him, he would have it thoroughly done up—he engaged me at £1 a week and wanted £36 security—I said, "In the paper it looks like £26 "—he said that must be a mistake—the security was to be returned in full if I did not suit—Horrex was sitting outside the door on the steps, and I should say he could hear the conversation—Harrington said that the trade was £38 or £40 a month, that he was a matmaker, and that he had another house, the Marquis of Lorne—a man named Hiscock came in—he asked what I was prepared to pay—I said £5—he said, "as you were here first I will accept your money"—Stevens wrote this receipt "Received of C. G. Stewart £3 on account of £30 "—it was arranged in the evening that I should pay him the rest, which I did, and got this</p>

               <p>receipt for £23, which was signed by Harrington on August 8th, 1892—when I moved in on August 6th the house was full of people—I gave Har<lb/>rington another £5; this is the receipt for it, signed by him—I gave up my situation to go in—Horrex was upstairs with a very bad leg—the business was very bad, only about 5s. a day—I spoke to Horrex about it, and he said that the depression was caused by the factory; they did not employ so many men, and therefore could not spend so much in beer—the factory was Harrington's—I only once saw the same number of persons drinking as when I went in, and that was the night afterwards—I was there nine weeks—when I went to Assembly Passage they said that Horrex was not in—I went up to his office and found him there—we had some high words, and he said he would try and sell it—I gave him notice—he came and saw me there—he said if I would stop he would transfer the license to me, and that he was not in a position to supply any more beer; would I do so?—I agreed and pawned the piano for £6 to do it, and raised £10 on other furniture—brokers were put in—Harrington said that I should have my money back, and gave me these two bills, one for £25 and the other for £30 10s.—my salary was £1 a week—I received nothing, and took £2 8s. out of the takings—his daughter took the takings home at night, and he went round for them—I first saw Seaton at Assembly Passage after I left the house; Harrington was there—I was promised £5 that day—I did not get it, and told him he was a d—d villain, and we got to blows—Seaton said that Harrington was a very honest man; he was prepared to pay £1 a week if I did not pro<lb/>secute Harrington—I said that it was a fraud—Seaton said, "You will have to prove that; it is no use prosecuting Harrington, as he has noth<lb/>ing," and that he had taken an assignment of everything belonging to Harrington, and had taken all his liabilities over—I received this letter from Seaton: "December 2nd, 1892. Dear Sir,—Owing to delay in the receipt of accounts from the country, I have not been able to send you any cash, but directly it arrives I will send it"—he paid me £5 or £6—when Horrex left I suggested that he should turn the license over to me, as I could not sell beer without a license—he said he would take a sovereign for it—I gave him 10s. deposit, and Harrington came in the same night and asked me if Horrex had been about the license—I said, "Yes," and I had paid him 10s.—he said, "Pay me 10s.," and I did so—Horrex brought the certi<lb/>ficate on the Monday, but not the license—the license was never trans<lb/>ferred to me—I afterwards saw Harrington and Horrex together, and told them I had been to the brewers about it, and found it was a fraud—he said, "It is only a b—fraud all through," and asked if I would assist him—I said I would not assist him in a fraud—he told me I could not prosecute him because I had no money—Harrington was present—I made a complaint at the Police-court, but I did not see Harrington afterwards—I have not got my deposit back—Seaton said his place of business was 84, Lombard Street, and after a time he said he was going to move, and would send a circular, but I have not had one—I tried to find him, but did not succeed.</p>

I had retired from business in 1893—I was then 52—Seaton's office was in filing Street, Cheapside—Harrington had told me that Seaton had lent him money for his business transactions before I went to Seaton—he did not tell me that he owed Seaton money, £100 or £150—I said before the Magistrate that I never owed him more than £50 in my life—according to my recollection the debt was not vouched at £50—£100 was paid in my presence, and I saw Seaton take £40 of it and the £100 bill—the first bill matured at the beginning of October, and it was met and paid; the second was due in January, 1894, and I consulted a solicitor about it—a writ was issued and judgment was signed against me, under Order 14, I understand—I went to more than one solicitor—I was not advised by them in 1893 and 1894 that I had no defence to the action—I have said I consulted a solicitor as to paying the second bill—I did not tell him I had been defrauded—I was not satisfied and went to another solicitor, who advised me that I had no defence, and I paid it—the third bill matured at the ninth month, and the fourth at twelve months—I made no complaint to my solicitor that I had been defrauded ty Mr. Seaton—I made no direct complaint to Seaton that he had swindled or defrauded me—I saw him last in relation to</p>

               <p>the fourth bill in June, 1894, and made no complaint—I kept the business up to June, 1894, and sold it to Hough ton, a man in my employ, twelve months after I took it—he was to pay me between £35 and £40, in<lb/>cluding stock; for which I had paid £350 without stock—I saw a number of machines and looms there; it was for them the £350 was paid—the agreement was for the business and everything on the premises—I had not got the money to go to law—I know nothing about Seaton, except in connection with this offence.</p>

               <p>1894, Harrington applied to me to become the tenant, and gave me as references Seaton, Elmslie and Co., of King Street, Cheapside, and John Horrex—I went to King Street and saw Mr. Seaton; I told him that Harrington had given him as a reference, he was going to take a beer-house, and what sort of a man was he—he said he had known him some years, and had had business transactions with him, and I believe he said he had purchased for him at rummage sales at the London docks, and had owed him £200 which he paid him, and always found him very honest—I then applied to Horrex and Co. by letter and got this answer. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they had known Harrington fifteen years and always found him a business and reliable man.</hi>)—I then let the house to Harrington, he agreeing to purchase the beer from Whitbread's and not from any other company—on September 28th the rent was not paid and he agreed to give us possession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Harrington.</hi> You did not ask me if I knew the man who was buying the house—I did not give you a slip of paper to go to the man who was buying the house and who is in it now; I think he came to you—he paid you £11, I think, for the loose things—you came and asked us to take possession of the house—you asked for the account to stand on the books, I don't know for what reason—I was the last one who came out of the house—it was 4.30 or five o'clock—we shut up about 5.30—we came in about 4.30—we only had to take about 6.30 and get out of the place—I had been telling you so for weeks, and had written to you, and called on you—I put the little account on my book—I did not say, "I will give you twelve months "—I do not think Seaton said that he had no knowledge of Harrington, except having business transactions with him—I don't recollect his saying that he had financed him; that he had lent him money when he bought goods for him—the word "financed" was used—I took it that Harrington had bought the goods, and that Seaton had financed him; that he had advanced him money for that purpose—he instanced this transaction, and said he had found him honest and straightforward; although he at one time owed £200, he had paid that sum.</p>

I live at 86, Ackernan Road, Brixton, and am the owner of 43, Chelverton Road, Putney, which was to let in November, 1890—Justice applied to me in the name of Mrs. Stone about that house, and I discussed the matter with her, and she gave me as references Mr. J. E. Dennan, 4, Sloane Terrace, Sloane Street, and Mr. Bartlett, Bloomsbury Square—I believe he was a solicitor—I wrote to them; I got no answer from Mr. Bartlett, but this is the reply I had from Dennan. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had every reason to believe that Mrs. Stone would be found a desirable tenant</hi>)—I then accepted Justice as my tenant, relying on the reference—she took possession on 1st December, 1890, as a yearly tenant, at a rental of £43 per annum—one month's rent up to the end of the year was paid at Christmas, 1890—on April 21st, 1891, she sent a post office order for £10 15s. for the rent due to Lady Day—on June, 7th, 1891, she left "without giving me any notice—I got no rent for the period after Lady Day—she sent the key by post on 9th July—her goods were followed, and discovered at 13, Maryland Road, Queen's Park, W.—I did not see her or hear of her after that till these proceedings.</p>

I live and let lodgings at 80, Warwick Street, Pimlico—in April, 1892, Justice came and took two rooms at £1 a week—she wanted three, two bedrooms and a sitting-room, but I had only two—the two rooms communicated with folding doors—she said they were for a gentleman friend of hers who had met with an accident and broken his leg, and was in the hospital—she came the next evening in a cab with Dennan—I don't think they had much luggage—I believe Dennan had broken his leg, he walked on crutches—she said he might be there for a permanency, she was not sure, but she would stay with him for about ten days to look after him, till he was better—they occupied the two rooms—at the end of the first fortnight they paid me—they stayed on after that for three or four weeks, for I forget how long, but when they went away they owed me £5 for rent, coals, gas, and candles—I asked Dennan about the rent, and sent up the bill the day before they went—he did not pay it—I went up and told him I should want the rooms that evening for another gentleman, and asked him what time</p>

               <p>he would go—he was alone then—he said he should go when it suited him—I said, "I must have my rooms," and I was disagreeable to him and he to me—afterwards I sent up my niece with the bill, and he said he should not pay it, as I had ordered some teeth—I did not order any teeth—one morning Justice said, "You do not look very well. Do you suffer from indigestion?"—I said, "Yes,"—she said, "Sir. Dennan is a very clever dentist; he will make you some teeth"—I said, "I can<lb/>not afford it just now," and she said, "He will do it as cheaply as any<lb/>body else"—that was all that passed then—I never ordered any teeth—when he said some teeth had been ordered I said I had not ordered any—he said I had, because I had the model of my mouth taken—he had taken a model; I did not know what he was going to do—he rang the bell, one afternoon, and said, "Bring a basin of water," and he told me to sit down, and asked if I minded his putting something in my mouth—I said, "I don't want a set of teeth now"—he said, "It won't take a minute," and I sat down, and he took a model of my mouth, but it was against my wish—when he told my niece I had ordered teeth I said, "I ordered no teeth; if you do things in that way you are nothing better than a swindler"—he said, "My nurse is a witness; you had it done of your own account"—Justice was not present—when she came in afterwards she called me, and said, "I am sorry you have had a dispute with Mr. Dennan, because he wishes to be honourable to you"—I said, "You know I never ordered teeth"—she said, "Yes, you did; I was there when you did, and had your model taken. I am in a hurry, call me a cab"—I said, "Not till the bill is paid"—she said, "The luggage is mine. I am only Mr. Dennan's nurse "—I said, "You told me you had no luggage when you came, only what you stood up in"—she told me that several times—she said, "You cannot stop my luggage"—I said, "You can take what is yours"—my niece called a cab, and they took all the luggage they had—I said to Dennan, "I suppose you have not got the money to pay me?"—he said, "Yes I have," and showed me sufficient money in his hand to pay my bill—he said, "I shan't pay you, you can go to my solicitor if you like"—he gave me the name of his solicitor; I forget it—I got no money and no teeth—I got a letter about the teeth and about the solicitor—I never saw Dennan again till I saw him at Bow Street—he never called.</p>

I am a licensed broker and valuer at the Malt Hall, High Street, Kensington—on 27th November, 1892, Justice called on me at my private house, Grove Park, Chiswick, and said she had got a very troublesome tenant named Dennan, and she had been recom<lb/>mended to come to me to distrain on him for £40—I asked her for her address; she declined to give it—she said the troublesome tenant was at 49, Talbot Road—I understood her he was a weekly tenant, but I think he was monthly; he had not paid any rent—she signed this authority for me to distrain—I went to 49, Talbot Road, and saw Dennan, and showed him my warrant—he said he thought it was very sharp practice—I said I thought so, too—I distrained on the goods in the front room on 27th November—I gave him fifteen days out of my good nature, instead of five—I asked him if the furniture was his own; and he said it was, he and his friends had bought it—he was carrying on the business of a dentist there—on 10th December I got this letter, headed 49, Talbot Road. (<hi rend="italic">Asking him to meet Mr. Platt on Monday</hi>)—on 12th December he signed an authority on my original warrant for me to take away the goods, and I took them to Mr. Platt's auction rooms, Hammersmith—next day I got this letter from Mrs. Justice. (<hi rend="italic">This asked/or an advance of</hi> £15 <hi rend="italic">on the goods</hi>)—she said she was going to get married—I removed goods from only the front room, and only took what I thought would cover the distress—I saw part of the furniture in the other rooms—on 14th December she called on me, and said she was going to get married, and wanted money, and would I advance her £15—I told her it was not usual to do that, but upon the</p>

               <p>strength of my having the goods I gave her three £5 notes—she gave me this receipt—on 20th December I got this letter from Dennan. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had arranged for the intending purchaser to meet Mr. Batsman the next day</hi>)—he brought his friend, who bought the goods and paid me out—I was desired by Justice to take £37 10s.—I received this letter from her of 31st December. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that if it could not be charged otherwise, he might deduct the expenses of removing the furniture from the</hi> £37 10s.)—when Dennan's friend Cohen bought the furniture I gave a receipt and took the money, £37 10s.—I only charged £1 1s. for expenses; I considered he was an ill-used man, and that it was sharp practice putting in a distress so soon, when there were so many goods on the premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Dennan paid me the levy—he reset some teeth for me, and I paid him £1 10s.—he said he would give them to me for nothing, and I said I would pay him—I think he was carrying on a dentist's business, but I don't know anything about it—I believe he, wanted to save the furniture, and did what he could to do so—we took about £60 worth from the front room, and left the curtains and hangings, so that no one outside should know that anything inside had been disturbed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Wiesbaden Road, Stoke Newington—in August, 1892, I was living at 38, Windsor Terrace, Eastbourne, and letting lodgings there—Justice in that month took a bedroom at 6s. a week—she was dressed in ordinary dress—next morning she was dressed in black, with a large black cloak, like an hospital nurse, and she had a collecting-box with a slit on the top, and leaflets pasted on it about, the St. Michael's Orphanage, Worthing—she had a medal fastened with a red ribbon; I fancy it was the badge of the orphanage—I don't remember if there was any device on it, I only saw a small piece of it—she said she was going out to collect, and that she was working for the Lord, and enjoyed her work, and was proud of it—each day she went out—she told me on one or two occasions that she went to Hastings—on one occasion she asked me to give something for the Home, and I gave 6d., it was all I could afford—one day she asked me if her son could come there and spend the Sunday with her—on the Sunday she went apparently to meet him, but when she came in she said he had broken his ankle, and was going to New College, a school at Eastbourne—she came back on that Sunday with Dennan—she introduced him to me as a friend, in the evening, when I went into the sitting-room where they were—our conversation turned on my teeth—Justice said that Dennan was a dentist—on the Monday morning Dennan said it would improve my appearance very much, and he thought that I had better have some, teeth, because it would be so much better for my digestion—I agreed that it might—he took a model of my mouth, and said he would make me a nice set of teeth for £20—I expected that he would—I felt I was obliged to agree to pay £20, although I could not afford it, as he had taken the model of my mouth—I had some false teeth by me, but was not wearing them—I gave them to Dennan, and he took them away—I think he went away in the evening—he came more than once whiles Justice was there—she stayed five or six weeks—it was the busy time of the year there—she paid me nothing, but owed me the whole rent and the meals which she sometimes had at home—she had very little food from me—she owed me altogether £2 or £3; I don't think more than that—we spoke about her bill once or twice, and she said she would pay it when she could, later on—she only had a small black bag with her, which she could carry in her hand—I never saw her after she left—I got no money—I made no application—I had sent to me the top set of my own former teeth, and some new ones for the lower jaw; but they were cracked, and I have never been able to use them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Roland's Road, Worthing—in the beginning of January, 1893, I owned Salisbury Lodge, Queen's Road, Worthing, a detached private house with garden 50 by 15 in front and 50 by 100 in the rear—it is near the sea—it was to let in January, 1893—Justice came to see me about it—I asked £55 rent—she did not say what she wanted it for—I expected it was to be for a private residence—she agreed to the rent—we had no agreement in writing—she had it from 9th February, half-quarter-day, and took possession at once, I believe—she bought some furniture at the sale of the goods of the previous tenant at Salisbury Lodge—the first quarter's rent, due on 9th May, was paid on 1st July, I believe—I got no other rent—after she had been there some time I noticed a board up, "St. Michael's Orphanage"—I saw no children there—the house has eight bedrooms, three sitting-rooms, kitchen, and offices—St. Raphael's Convalescent Home has been carried on at Worthing for some years—the next rent became due on 9th August—I don't think I applied for it, I think Justice was not there—it was 17th September before I saw her again, when the distraint was made by the owners of the furniture she had obtained on the hire system—I stepped in as landlord—everything left in the house was sold, and I realised £19 2s. 10d., leaving a balance of £8 7s. 2d. arrears of rent—I have not been paid—I took possession then—she promised to send me the key, but I did not receive it—that was the last I had to do with her—on 17th October I got this letter, signed J, E. Stone, and headed 6, The Mall, Ealing. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he was instructed to purchase a house at Worthing, and asking for particulars of Salisbury Lodge</hi>)—I replied, describing the house, and stating that the lowest price for the freehold was £950—I got another letter of 22nd November, 1893, signed J.

               <p>July there were five children—three of them were sent from Mr. Waugh's Home—they bore the appearance of having been very well treated and cared for; I bathed and dressed them every morning—there was no actual unkindness, and with fresh air and cleanliness they looked well and healthy—in addition to the children from Mr. Waugh's Home were the crippled boy, and another—Mrs. Layton's grandchildren were never at Worthing; Justice said she was expecting them, but no arrangement was made for them till after she had left, and was at Dorset House—when I brought them to Brighton from Littlehampton I simply took them to Shirley Street and left them, and did not see any more of them—I cannot say if they were there only one night, or if clean beds were made up for them—Justice may have been at Shirley Street that night, I did not see her—I had ceased to be matron when we had left Worthing—I spoke to Mrs. Jackson about the dirty room—I did not tell the person at Shirley Street to make up clean beds for the children; she said she had no other place to put them; I asked whether she had—it was a bedroom—I went to Dorset House on several days, not daily, but when Justice sent for me—I wrote letters for her—she was continually talking about reopening it—she left all the furniture there when she left, and made no attempt to remove any part of it—before my request for salary I was not aware that she was soliciting subscriptions from the public—she said it was a work of charity, but that she had independent means—she did not tell me that collections were being made for it—I did not know that she had collected on the Brighton Racecourse—I was not suggested as a member of a ladies' visiting committee—I know that she applied to the Local Government Board for the orphanage to be registered, so that she could get aid from the Needlework Guild through the Charity Organisa<lb/>tion Society—I signed that application at her request; there was already a lady's signature on it—I understood that it was necessary to have a second name—I wished to help her all I could, being there as matron—I did not know when I was at Worthing that it was Justice's object to solicit charity to enable her to conduct the orphanage—I never saw a collecting-book, or badge, or anything else; I did not know where she went when she was away—she defrayed the expenses for food, and so on, during the fortnight I was there—talking about opening the Home for gentlemen and others, she said we had no servant, and they would want late dinners—she got the circular printed when she was at Dorset House—she said if we had £1,000 between us we could buy the freehold of Salisbury Lodge—I should have been a partner, and, I suppose, the matron—when we left Salisbury Lodge I wrote out a notice to the effect that the house had been closed in consequence of the epidemic, and put it up myself—before we left there was no coal in the cellar, and we did not get any more; that was in July—Justice told me there was an epidemic of typhoid; it got worse afterwards; it did not get into our house—Mrs. Justice shut up the house, and we had to go out—she said she shut it up because of the typhoid fever—she asked me to write the notice; it was true then—I asked her for coals; she said she had ordered them, but they never came.</p>

I am the wife of William Plese, of 2, Colebrooke Row, Islington—Stone lodged with us from about the end of 1892, and through 1893—about August, 1893, he brought Dennan to lodge with him, and introduced him as a friend, a dentist—Stone said that he had been a clerk in the City, and had left to do writing work for his mother—they occupied one room between them at 10s. a week, and had the use of a sitting-room for meals—they paid extra for any meals they had in the house—they stayed till October, 1893, going out in the morning and returning at night—if they did any writing it was in their own room; I don't know what they did there—in October they left together—I understood that Stone's mother was interested in an orphanage at Brighton, but I have found since it was Worthing—I got my information from Stone, I believe—I under<lb/>stood</p>

               <p>that the writing work was connected with that orphanage—letters came to 2, Colebrooke Row, while they were with me, and for some time after they left—I did not know that when they were with me, and after they had loft 2, Colebrooke Row, was being described as the office of St. Michael's Orphange, Queen's Road, Worthing—I did not know of this notepaper with that description stamped on it; I did not see it before it was shown to me at Bow Street—I saw a circular similar to this, which gives the secretary as J. Edmond Stone, 76, Finsbury Pavement; I read the poetry at the top—when they left in October, 1893, they left the address 6, The Mall, Ealing, and as letters came after that I forwarded them there; they were not very numerous.</p>

Eustace, Salisbury Lodge, Worthing"—he said that was his private address—he said he courted any inquiry I might like to make as to the orphanage—I believe I told him that I had heard he represented himself to be a dentist—he said, "My private practice has nothing to do with this matter "—he did not deny that he was a dentist—I thought his explanation was satis<lb/>factory, and let him go—I saw in the collecting-book names with sums of money entered against them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Alexandra Road, Hornsey—in May, 1894, I saw an advertisement in a newspaper for a lady collector—I replied, and in consequence went to the Lady Guide office, 352, Strand, on 19th June—I saw Stone first and Dennan afterwards—Stone said I was to collect for St. Michael's Orphanage, Worthing, which had been closed in consequence of typhoid fever—I was to be paid £1 a week, and 25 per cent, commission on every collection of 16s. a day—Dennan came in, and Stone introduced him—he did not give him a name, he only said "This is the chairman of the committee"—Dennan asked me if I had had any experience in collecting—he was very particular about references, and said that my application would be sent to the committee for their approval; that there was nothing unfavourable, only that I was rather young; I believe Dennan said that—I afterwards got a letter, which I tore up, giving me the appointment—it was signed by Stone as secretary, and it appointed me to meet him at Broad Street Station—I did so, and we went to Clapham together—on the way we talked about the work I was to do, and he gave me this collecting-book. (<hi rend="italic">This showed that</hi> £63 8s. 10 1/2 d. <hi rend="italic">had been collected.</hi>)—I got a badge a month later—I was employed for about four months—the badge had an angel and an orphan on one side, with the words "St. Michael's Home"—I was to wear it in my pocket, not on my breast, and, if anybody wanted my authority, I was to produce it—the book was called Convalescent Home for Servants outside, and inside it was called an Orphanage—on the journey to Clapham he told me the orphanage was closed, and they were collecting funds for it—the first week I collected from a local directory, and did as much as I could in a day—Stone gave me the directory and I used to copy out of it—we settled every night—I once asked him about the children who were supposed to be in the orphanage—he said there were fifty or sixty—I asked that that I might give information to the persons who I collected from—he said there were twenty-five convalescents—he did not give the name of any other institution—I went from house to house, repeating the story he had told me, and asking for contributions—I went on collecting until the 31st October, and collected £63 8s. 10 1/2 d.—I reported to the City Road, and later on to Nicholas Road, Brighton, sometimes to Mr. Stone, and sometimes to Mr. Dennan—I got my salary paid—I did not always get a commission as I did not always get more than 15s. a day.</p>

I live at 5, Dorset Square—in August, 1894, I received a letter, in consequence of which I went to 99, City Road, where I saw the two male prisoners—they asked me to collect for an orphanage, and offered me £1 a week, and a commission upon all I got over 16s. a day—I agreed—they asked me for references—I gave them a clergyman and a doctor—they refused them and said they preferred a lady—I was told to say that the orphanage was closed, and they wanted funds to re-open it—that some female servants' home was attached to it, but I did not hear much about that—having sent my references I went again to 99, City Road, and there entered upon an agreement as collector—I began by collecting 15s. and 16s.—I went to Surbiton the first day with Mr. Stone—he did not go with me from house to house—he gave me two sheets of a local directory—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my authority from him to collect, and this is my collecting-book—I went on collecting till about the 20th August—it was a very short time—I collected 23s, the first day and 32s. the second—I gave up the sums each night—I do not remember the total I collected at Surbiton—I went to Hastings and collected £7 19s.—that was about the middle of the second week—I went there with Mr. Stone and Miss Gardiner, and collected for about four days, sending up my collections daily to the City Road—I was stopped by the police on August 27th—I then wrote to Mr. Stone stating that I did not know what to do—next day Miss Gardiner got a telegram from London and went up—I went up the next day and saw Stone—he asked if I was going to resign—I said I did not wish to go on with the work, I was not well enough—he said it was a pity I did not stop at Hastings and get better—he said, "You ought not to be frightened by a policeman; you have not got enough self-confidence. You are helping a good work "—but I had made up my mind, and resigned—he sent me a cheque for £1 10s. 10d., but I returned it, as well as my collecting book and box—we received donations in the boxes, and one day I had £1 2s. 6d. in my box.</p>

               <p>whether he was paid); that Mr. Edmonds and Mr. Eustace were two authorised collectors—she denied any connection with St. Raphael's Home, Worthing—I asked whether any of the clergy at Worthing were references—she replied that there was great jealousy among the clergy, and she desired not to put anyone on her committees or as references—I asked the same question about the doctors—she said she had excluded the name of Dr. Simpson, who was a doctor at Worthing; I cannot recollect for what reason—she said she received children from Mr. Waugh, and they had been sent to her in a shoeless condition—I gathered that she had had words with Mr. Waugh before coming to me—she told me she had told him to take his children away—she said there was a visiting committee at Worthing, and she mentioned three names, of which I remember Mrs. Montgomery and Mrs. Beccles as two—I asked whether Mrs. Beccles was the wife of the colonial Bishop of that name, and she said "Yes"—she told me that the children were at that time boarded out at Lancing and other places, and she was then in negotiation for a house at Eastbourne—her address was Chesham Mansion, Trinity Place, Eastbourne—that was the substance of the interview—on September 25th Stone called—he said the St. Michael's Home was a young institution, and he was a young man, and he asked for advice as to the management—he said he was a dental student, and he came about St. Michael's Home at Worthing, which had been opened in March last, and that the outbreak of typhoid fever and other things had prevented a report being published—I said it was unnecessary to publish a report more than once a year—I mentioned to him the coincidence about the two St. Michael's Homes and the two Mrs. Justices—he knew nothing of the Frampton Cottrell Home—I said that Mrs. Justice spoke of moving altogether from Worthing to: Eastbourne—he said he had no doubt they would re-open at Worthing; that the house had been taken in Mrs. Justice's name; that any money received was put into the Holloway branch of the London and South-Western Bank, to the account of the St. Michael trustees, and that he only drew on it for working expenses; that the only com<lb/>mittee was the ladies' committee of inspection at Worthing, who had no financial control—he said that Mr. Eustace was a dentist—I suggested that Mr. Eustace was the originator of the scheme; he denied that, and said it was got up among them all, Justice and Eustace, and possibly more—he said that Eustace was a fairly well-to-do man—he said that he himself looked forward to be the paid secretary of the institution—next day, 26th September, Justice called and asked whether I had seen Stone—I gathered that she expected to meet him at the office—she told me they proposed to re-open at Worthing as soon as they had a clean bill of health—she consulted me as to the proper method of getting rid of the secretary and collectors to whom she had given authority, and with whom she was not satisfied—I understood that to refer to Stone, the secretary, and Eustace and Edmonds, the collectors—she said they kept control of the funds, and she had no power to draw on the banking account—she said she had founded the Home, and that they held the appointments at her pleasure—I advised her to consult a solicitor, and come and see me again when the Home was in better or some working order—next morning I received this letter from Stone, dated 26th September.

In August, 1894, complaints reached me about this orphanage, and I was communicated with by the chief constable of Tunbridge Wells when a young lady was arrested there; I communicated with him and she was released—on October 30th, I went to Nicholas Road, Brighton, and saw Dennan, and read the war<lb/>rant to him, for obtaining money by false pretences—he said, "What does it mean? I can't understand it; everything I have done has been correct. I have been down here taking the house called the Furzebank"—he pro<lb/>duced plans of the house, and said, "This is what we came down here for, and by your action you have stopped the whole thing. I am glad it haft happened, and I court the fullest inquiry; we have been expecting it and have got everything in readiness; we know you have been making inquiries respecting us for the past three months. Mrs. Justice has had nothing to do with it since she left Worthing. As a friend I have ad<lb/>vised Stone what I thought was right"—I asked if he could give me the name of any person on the committee of the orphanage—he said, "Not at present"—he expressed his willingness to accompany me to 99, City Road, and to hand over everything which would assist me in the inquiries, which he did—I had wired to London to detain Stone, and he did all he could to assist me—I found on him a pocket-book containing papers relating to racing matters—at 12.40 the same day I went to 14, Claremont Terrace, Preston, Brighton, and saw Mrs. Justice—I read the warrant to her for obtaining money by false pretences—she said, "What does it mean? What have I done? I have had nothing to do with it since I left Worthing, and then I left on account of the epidemic. I worked until I made myself ill, spent my money, and cut up my clothes for the children I had under my charge. I was not aware that Mr. Dennan and my son were collecting money in the manner you describe; I will tell you everything"—she handed me some papers, and said she would give me all the assistance in her power—I brought them to London, and at 8.30 I took Dennan to 99, City Road, and found Stone there in custody—he had been apprehended by Sergeant Gould—he went to a glass book<lb/>case and said, "These books will show you everything;" but they principally related to racing matters—there were two or three books there connected with the office, which he pointed to—the three were taken to the station and charged together—I returned next day to 99, City Road, and found a number of books and documents. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—two are collect<lb/>ing books such as have been identified by the young lady collectors—some of them had outside, "Convalescent Home for Servants"—I have added them up and find that the ladies collected £1,022 during 1892—the aggre<lb/>gate amount of the two collecting books of the two male prisoners is £180 9s.—it commences at Bedford and ends at Newmarket and Berkeley Square, Lord Randall Gordon £1 1s.—I also found the books of Miss Gardiner, Miss G, Miss Woodhouse and Miss Flinter—I found some letters of February, 1893, passing between Mrs. Justice and Miss Cullum.

Edmonds"—the books show collections in October, 1894, with the exception of about six weeks, 180—I found a number of letters asking if Flinter, Eustace and Edmonds were authorised collectors, and replies—this is the new ledger of 1894, the posting has only got as far as the letter B—that would only be about two hours' work—I found a copy of a promissory note, drawn by Mabel Justice, and a number of unpaid tradesmen's bills where she had lived at Worthing and at Talbot Road; also an authority in Dennan's writing, authorising Justice to sign cheques, and an advertisement for collectors of October, 1894, and a number of replies, but no list of a committee, and no minute-book—I found a number of letters relating to betting transactions, and to Lansdale, the betting<lb/>man; also a number of letters between Mrs. Justice and the two male prisoners in 1893, but none of later date—I believe I found a £3 cheque. (<hi rend="italic">One of the letters from Dennan to Stone referred to the stoppage of a cheque for</hi> £3)—I did not go to Ealing—I also found a post-dated cheque for £380, drawn by Stone on the National Bank, and a letter from the manager of the London and South-Western Bank—some of the papers were on the shelves, some in a bookcase, and others in a basket.</p>

I am a surgeon and physician at Nor<lb/>wood—on Sunday, the 25th November, I was called to the house of the last witness by her husband—I went upstairs, and from what I noticed I was led to suppose there had been the birth of a child—I searched the room to see if I could find a child—I 'found in the bedroom an afterbirth, such as would be attached to a full-timed child—after that the prisoner was sent to her bedroom and put to bed—she was in the kitchen at the time—I went to the lavatory, and there saw on the floor a quantity of blood; it was covered with a piece of paper—I lifted that up and there was a quantity of blood under it, and also in the pan of the w.c.—my attention was attracted by hearing a muffled sound, upon which I pro<lb/>ceeded to the coal cellar, which was about ten yards away from the lavatory, in the basement—the door was shut—I was unable to detect anything until I again heard the cry of a child—it was a very faint cry—I went into the coal cellar—there was a quantity of coal in the cellar—after hearing the sound I raked about and found the child buried under a hundred weight of coal, wrapped in an apron—I removed the coal, there was one piece of coal lying on the chest of the child, and on examining the child I saw that it was scratched on the chest; its lips were perfectly blue and the hands were clenched—it was in a convulsion, quite collapsed—after sending for Mr. and Mrs. Quare, the child was removed upstairs, and put into a warm bath, and after about a quarter of an hour I was able to rally it—every endeavour was made to preserve its life—there was about a hundredweight of coal built up over the child; it must have been placed over it—it died on Thursday, a few days afterwards—it died from bronchitis, the result of exposure—I found that the umbilical cord was not tied—I spoke to the prisoner when she was taken upstairs—I asked her what she had done with the child—she refused to tell until I had found it in the coal cellar—she then said that a gipsy woman had come a few days previously, and had administered a draught to her,</p>

               <p>and said she was to place the child in the coal cellar, whether alive or dead, and she would come and take it away—from the appearances I asked her if she had ever had a child before—she denied it—from the appear<lb/>ances I saw I supposed she had—the child was full grown and well developed—the cellar was cold and damp, and it had been a frosty night—the child had not breathed properly from the time it was found till it died—not having had a post-mortem examination I am not able to state whether there was any internal injury—the hundred-weight of coal was packed right over it, and one large block was lying on its chest—there was a hole made for it, and then the coals were built over it—the amount of coal pressing on the body must have killed it had it remained there—it was built over in small pieces, and the child put in afterwards—probably coal may have fallen upon it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fully qualified medical man, and live at 9, Windermere Villas, Earlsfield—on 24th November, the deceased child was brought to me by the male prisoner—it was properly nourished and clothed—it had a large running sore on the top of the head—the head was very full of vermin and the stench from its head was awful; I cannot imagine anything like it—that was mostly from vermin—ordinary cleanliness, soap and water, would have kept the vermin from the head—I told the father first of all to closely cut the hair and poultice the head with warm bread poultices, so as to get the scabs off, and then apply some ointment, which I gave him, and I also gave it a bottle of medicine—three or four days after I saw the child in the street in a perambulator with the female prisoner—I stopped it—it had nothing on its head but a hat; I raised the hat to have a look at it, and I think the stench was worse than ever; the hair had been cut, but not closely, not sufficiently; not enough to prevent anyone seeing the vermin or the sores—I do not think the head had been attended to a bit—I told her the head stank, and repeated my directions that I had given to the husband—on November 29th I went again to his home to see the child—it was dead—the head was very much in the same condition—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I could find no organic disease—it was perfectly healthy except the head—there was not a sign of disease about it—I can give no reason why the head had got into that state except the vermin, which could undoubtedly have been kept clean with ordinary soap and water—that must have been obvious to anyone associated with the child—it would be impossible not to see that it was bad—it must have suffered from its head; the condition of the head was likely to cause it unnecessary suffering.</p>

&gt;death—I have had no evidence that the child had convulsions—I have never known a case of a child three years old having convulsions owing to irritation of the scalp—it is a good many years since I attended children, but I have always kept myself informed on such subjects, and I have not met with such a case—I will not say that such cases have not occurred, but they must be extremely rare, or I should have known of them—convulsions, as a rule, do not extend beyond the teething age—I should say it is not a danger likely to be anticipated—as I have not been in practice for many years, I should not like to give an opinion as to whether <hi rend="italic">eczema capitalis</hi> is contagious or not; it is not likely to cause death, if there is care and cleanliness—it is a fact that there is great difficulty, even with most careful parents, in keeping the heads of children clean—if they are afflicted with vermin the difficulty would be increased—the scabs prevent their being got at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A child suffering in that manner would require special care and cleanliness—soap and water would have to be applied with great care and frequency from day to day—it is no use doing it once or twice—I have heard the state of the child's head described by Mr. Freeman—the scabs irritated the vermin and the vermin kept up the irritation; there was action and reaction—I suppose some remedy would be applied which would destroy the vermin; something beyond soap and water would be advised—vermin would be frequently found after 
death—we find that patients treated with the greatest care have vermin—suppose the vermin obvious, ordinary cleansing with soap and water would prevent it from coming to such an extent; with poultice, medicine, and soap and water, it ought to improve the condition in a well<lb/>nourished child as this was in a few days; but sometimes these heads take a considerable time before they are amenable to treatment, some<lb/>times they recover very rapidly, sometimes they do not for a long time—if there be no constitutional disease I should certainly expect to see an improvement in a month or six weeks if properly attended—this is all on the assumption that this was a case of eczema—vermin do not generally produce eczema; they would obviously increase the irritations a child would scratch the head from the irritation; it is the vermin that produce the discharge—vermin of course would make a sore head sorer—its</p>

               <p>general health might suffer, or it might not; it would not tend to improve the health—not having seen it, I could not say whether it would do so—it is difficult for me, under the circumstances, to express an opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think I read that in this case some ointment was prescribed, a bread poultice would be of no use unless you got the scab off—in spite of ointment this condition of head will last a very long while—there would be some improvement in six days, especially if the child was healthy—the Home Office applied to me for my opinion, if the body was exhumed, whether it would be of any assistance in finding the cause of 
death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner at Earlsfield Road—I have been in practice about three years—I have attended the family of the Hallidays—on the Sunday after the 
death of this child I was called to attend two other of their children—one was suffering from eczema of the head—I believe eczema of the head is contagious—I did not see the deceased child—I never knew of a case of a child dying from convulsions following irritation of the scalp—I never heard of such a case—<hi rend="italic">eczema capitalis</hi> is a very common disease indeed—if that exists with the presence of vermin it is much more difficult to eradicate them—that condition of the head sometimes exists for years in spite of treatment; the eczema breaks out again and again in many instances—I saw the prisoner's home; it was very, very poor, but not worse than many of the houses round about—the child that I attended was plump and well nourished—if that child had <hi rend="italic">eczema capitalis</hi> there would be nothing ex<lb/>traordinary in the deceased having it too; that is just what would be expected.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Vermin is sometimes the cause of <hi rend="italic">eczema capitalis</hi>, by the scratching—I saw the house on the Monday after the prisoners were in custody; they had been on bail—I had never been there before; I had never attended any of them, and never saw the children before—one of them suffered from eczema of the head; I have attended it more or less since; that child had no vermin—I think my instructions were carried out; the child is not entirely cured, it is improving; I think it will be cured—it is eczema he is suffering from; he is a little boy—I saw no signs of vermin in its head, it was perfectly clean; I should say it was most probably infected from the deceased child—the bad smell in such cases is very common; you will find it every day in any of the large hospitals—soap and water in many cases will not be sufficient; you cannot, in many cases, eradicate the vermin—you sometimes have to cut off the hair in such cases among the better classes, but cleansing will be a remedy—I should say an antiseptic would be required—in the case of the little boy the eczema is not very much advanced—it is not a bad case; it is yielding to treatment.</p>

               <p>left the hospital on the 4th November at his own desire; he signed a paper, saying that he took the responsibility on himself—I never saw him again—there was a considerable amount of dirt in the eye, very likely to be from a heavy fall—a blow would certainly accentuate a fall—I should rather have expected to find a severe bruise, but I did not; he had not complained of any kick—I said at the inquest that I had been told of a man who had been going about with a fractured jaw—I did not know anything about it—I said if he had not left the hospital I should have been inclined to think he would have been cured.</p>

I practice at 44, Rodney Street, Walworth—on November 5th I was called in to see the deceased—he seemed very ill—he was suffering from a wound over the left eye, and his jaw had evidently been fractured, and had been wired to keep the fractured portion in position previous to his leaving the hospital. I attended him from day to day until the 17th November—for three or four days he appeared to improve, then he gradually got worse and worse—he made complaints to me, and I formed a conclusion—even<lb/>tually he was sent to St. Thomas's Hospital—I could not say that if he had remained in Guy's Hospital he would not have died; what he required was to be kept quiet.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner and house surgeon at St. Thomas's—the deceased was admitted there on November 17th—I examined him—he was drowsy—he could not give any clear statement at one time—he said at one time that this occurred three weeks ago, at another time three months—I found a sinus above the left eye, a small discharging wound, a lot of surrounding redness and cedema of the skin—I probed the wound and detected a gap in the frontal sinus—there was a lot of dead bone, resulting from the suppura<lb/>tion of the wound—at the time I put it down to erysipelas—he has ery<lb/>sipelas—I did not expect any cerebral mischief—the erysipelas got worse—it cleared up in about a fortnight, but he still remained drowsy—a more complete examination was then found necessary, and we decided upon an operation—I did not perform it—I was present when it was done—we thought there was some pus under the bone—the night after we decided to do this he became comatose and the operation was made at once—he improved after the operation, he recovered his senses—the improve<lb/>ment remained for two days, then he suddenly became absolutely comatose, unconscious, and died on 7th December—I assisted in making a post-mortem—we found an abscess in the left frontal bone and meningitis at the base of the brain; that was the cause of death—the suppuration spreading through the wound, and the fracture, caused the meningitis—the wound was the original cause.</p>

I then struck him in the mouth with my left hand, and he got up in the van and drove away. I and my wife then went into the public-house for a little while, and then went home; crossing the lane I saw Barnard walking lame.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not use a covered lantern every night—some<lb/>times I did when it was a bit darker—I never used any candle, only the lantern—when I came out the fire was in full swing; it was alight and burning in the farmyard—I did not see it for a minute or two till I got my wife and child out; then I saw it—I saw two women running down the stackyard at the same time, running out into the footpath—I did not notice whether they had bonnets on.</p>

One of the women afterwards woke up and said, 'The place is on fire' "—the prisoners were searched; a box of matches and a knife were found on them—the matches will only strike on the box—I afterwards traced the women to Guildford, and arrested them—they were discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Kirk, a fly proprietor, of Weybridge—the prisoner was in my service as nursemaid for five weeks prior to December 11th—on that day my daughter Lilian, who will be five next July, was in her charge—I have two other children, of whom she has also had charge at times—on December 11th, in consequence of Lilian crying and a communication she made to me, I asked the prisoner if she had beaten my child—she said, "No," but after a little hesitation she said she had—she promised me faithfully not to do it again—on the next Monday I noticed the child's left cheek and neck were swollen very much; the cheek was quite discoloured—I thought, perhaps, she had knocked herself—in combing her hair a very large quantity came out in one place on the left-hand side—I asked the prisoner if she thought Lilian had hit herself against a post or anything—she said she did not know anything about it—I took the child to Dr. Graham at once—in the evening the child cried very much and appeared very frightened, and begged to be taken into my room—on Thursday evening, December 13th, I put the child to bed about seven—the prisoner was there at the time—after that I went to the Queen's Head stables to do booking for my husband, about 8.10—the prisoner was then sitting in the kitchen doing some needlework—I got back about 8.50—the prisoner was then in her room, where she sleeps with the child—I sat in the kitchen for about fifteen minutes writing a letter—during that time I heard little noises in the prisoner's room like those of opening and shutting a box—I thought she was putting her box tidy—I went up-stairs to her room, and found the prisoner inside the door on the step—this box was on the bed on its side—I saw a pink flannel that the child's feet were wrapped in, but I could not see the child, and I said to the prisoner, "Where is my Lily?"—she said, "In the box"—I flew from the house as hard as I could, and ran down the Queen's Road for a neighbour—I called at Mr. Merscher's, and made a communication to him, and then ran on to the Queen's Head as fast as I could for my husband—the Queen's Head is seven minutes' walk from our house—my husband ran home, and I came back as soon as I could—when I got home I found Slaymaker, a neighbour, in the kitchen nursing Lilian, who was deathly white, and did not appear to recognise me—the prisoner was in the room—she began to cry when she saw me—I told her to go upstairs—Slaymaker said it was better that she should stop downstairs—after some time I put Lilian into my own bed—in about half an hour Sergeant Mears came, and then the Inspector, and the prisoner was given into their custody—I have examined Lilian since; she was quite black from thigh upwards—she is a very tall child for her age, and thin.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Railway Terrace, Weybridge, and am a gardener—on 13th December, about 9.10 p.m., Mr. Merscher, a grocer, of Railway Terrace, came and made a communication to me, and in consequence I ran to Kirk's house, about sixty yards from my house—I went upstairs and into Mr. Kirk's bedroom—I came out of that, and saw the prisoner in the passage, and said, "Where is the child?"—she said, "In the box"—I asked, "Where?"—she said, "In the other room"—I went in, and saw this box on the bed—I tried the lid; it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189501070109"/>
               <p>locked—I asked the prisoner if she had the key—she said, "Yes," and gave it to me—I tried to unlock it, but did not give time to do it—I put the box on the floor and burst open the lid—Lilian was in the box, lying flat on her back, with her legs doubled over her stomach—I took her out of the box, and took her downstairs—she was in a very weak state, very ghastly looking—I had to shake her to bring her to her senses—I think she was unconscious when I took her out—she was a very livid colour—I brought her to, and sat and nursed her till Mr. Kirk came in, and then he took the child, and I went home.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). Shortly after eleven p.m. on the 13th, from information received I went to Kirk's house with Mears—I saw Lilian in her father's arms—she appeared in a very dazed state, and ghastly white—the prisoner was partly reclining on a sofa in a corner of the same room—I found there two handkerchiefs tied round the child's neck, with the knots behind—both were knotted tightly—they were loose—the neck was not discoloured—I should imagine they had been tied round the child's mouth—they would have been tight round there, and would have prevented the child from crying out—I sent for Dr. Graham, and on his arrival I cautioned the prisoner, and charged her with the attempted murder of the child—she began to cry, and in reply said, "I won't do it again"—I sent her to Chertsey Police-station, and went upstairs, where I saw this box on the floor—I have measured it—it is 22 3-8 inches long, 12 5-8 inches wide, and 12 inches deep.</p>

I have only got to die once; I don't care"—I had told her where I was going to take her—afterwards she brightened up and began singing—she had only been in Weybridge five weeks—I did not know her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner at Weybridge—on December 13th I was called to Mr. Kirk's house a little before midnight, and I examined Lilian—I found some bruises on the left hip and outside the left thigh—in my opinion they had been there two or three days—discolouration was setting in—next morning (14th) I saw her again, and saw a bruise on the left side of the face—I should say that was caused on the 13th, probably by a blow or severe pressure—these injuries might have been caused to the face in pressing the child into the box—the child was in a dazed condition when I saw it—I saw no great evidence of nervousness—I should certainly think that if no one had come home for two or three hours, and the child had continued locked up in this box, it would have been suffocated; air would be practically excluded from the box when it was locked—a handkerchief over the mouth would have assisted suffocation, but it would have been suffocated without the handkerchief—if the box had been one-third full of clothes it would help the suffocation by reducing the quantity of air in the box—the child does not seem to be well; it is very restless at night—it has</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I had the prisoner from a home in St. George's-in-the-East—Lilian had a fit since this happened, on last Tuesday week; she had none before—the fit lasted about ten minutes, or a little more; the eyes, and mouth and hands were convulsed very much—the eyes and hands kept continually moving, and her whole body shook—the doctor was not called in—she never had anything of the kind before—she is at present very nervous—she is one continual trouble from four p.m., as soon as it gets dusk, till morning—Dr. Graham has given her soothing medicine—she fancies all sorts of things, and jumps up the whole of the night through now—it takes some time to soothe her to sleep.</p>
