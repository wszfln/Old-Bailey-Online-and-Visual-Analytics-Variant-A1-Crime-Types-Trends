                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Brunswick-square, Commercial-road. On Saturday night, the 29th of January, about ten o'clock, Ann Witherfield came to my house with a gentleman—her real name was Ann, but as that was also my name she was called Charlotte—the prisoner and his wife lodged in the house—Mrs. Taylor sent me to the Red Lion public-house, to fetch the prisoner home—Ann Witherfield went with me—I did not find him there, but about half-past eleven he came in, and said, "I understand you have been to the b—y public-house for me?"—I said, "Yes"—he said he supposed I came after my rent—I said no, I looked to his wife for that, and not to him—he was intoxicated, I was perfectly sober—he said he bad plenty of money about him, about 22., but would not pay me a farthing—he used rather rough language—I said I did not want the rent, but he bad much better pay a trifle out of 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which his wife owed—he then struck me on the mouth, and made it bleed—his wife said, "Oh! William, don't strike Ann like that"—he immediately struck his wife—Ann Witherfield then said, "Oh, you wretch, to strike a woman like that! you ought to be ashamed of yourself"—he asked what business it was of hers, and struck her about the head, and on the right side of her cheek—she received a bruise on the right jaw, and another bruise—he struck her with his doubled fist—he had nothing in his hand—I immedi<lb/>ately called out for the police—three policemen came directly, and I gave him in charge for beating us all three—Witherfield was rather poorly before this happened—she mostly suffered from rheumatism—there was nothing the matter with her head or face before—the prisoner asked his wife to go with him, but she would not, saying he would ill-use her if she did—I said she need not go, but out of the house he should go—he left with the policemen—I went out afterwards to get some vegetables with Witherfield—we returned about a quarter or half-past one, and heard the prisoner</p>

               <p>up stairs—I went up, and said he should not stop there—he said he would—I took the bed-clothes off, and <hi rend="italic">shyed</hi> them down stairs—he was not on the bed—he said, "You mean that, do you?" and said he would kick me down if I did not go down—he attempted to strike me, and Witherfield ran up stairs, as I had called out—she said, "Ann is not capable of taking her own part, you shan't strike her"—she got between us—he immediately said, "Oh, you b—y wretch, if you do not go out of this room, I will kick you down!"—he immediately struck her violently with his fist, about the head and temple, from the ear to the lower part of the throat—she fell against the washhand-stand, and bled violently at the mouth—I ran down stairs, and before I could get the street-door open she came down—I thought it was the prisoner—I ran into the parlour, and it was her—she said, "Oh, Ann, I fear he has murdered me!"—I had no time to answer her before the prisoner came into the parlour—I said if he offered to strike either of us again, I would cut him down with a candlestick—I took it up, and do not know whether I struck him or not in my flurry—we had a scuffle for the candlestick, and he took it from me—he went to strike me over the head with it—Witherfield held up her right hand to prevent him, and received two cuts across the knuckles of her right hand, and a bruise on the back of that hand—we both went to bed together about a quarter to two—I looked over her head, but saw no cuts—I found a bruise on the left temple, and a swelling from the ear to the throat—she wanted vinegar, as she said she could scarcely turn her head—I said I had none, but would get some in the morning—there was no cut except in the mouth—she complained of her poor head all night, and continued to get worse till she died, which was about a quarter-past eight on Monday morning—she had been drinking that night with a gentleman, and bad a little too much, but not so as not to know what she was about—she was rather tipsy—I was sober—she had a bruise on the right side of her cheek, her right jaw, and on the left side of the temple—she had none of these appearances before he struck her.</p>

               <p>Sunday night—I found her complaining of violent pains in the face, head, and neck—I examined her head, and found many contusions about the forehead, temple, and face—I attended her again about six on Monday morning—I then found her in a state of stupor—I applied external appli<lb/>cations only on the first visit, not apprehending them so dangerous as they appeared afterwards—on the second occasion I used no applications—I found the patient sinking very fast—I did not see her when she died—I saw her after death, about nine in the morning—Mr. Guraey and myself made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—on opening the head, under the mem<lb/>brane of the brain I found a large quantity, about four ounces, of congratu<lb/>lated blood on the surface of the brain, on the right side—I separated the hemisphere of the brain, and in the ventricle of the brain J found a portion of serum—a larger portion than usual—my opinion is, that rupture of the vessels of the brain was the immediate cause of death—the contusions were chiefly on the right side of the head—there were some on the left side, but they were comparatively slight—judging from the external marks of con<lb/>tusion, and the internal state of the head and brain, I have no doubt what was the cause of death—there was quite sufficient to account for death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you a member of the College of Surgeons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it must have been a very severe blow to produce such appear<lb/>ances as I found—this was the result of rupture of the blood-vessels of the brain—it does not follow that she would die immediately upon that rup<lb/>ture—I have opened a body before—if she had been bled immediately after receiving the injury she probably might have done well, bat I cannot distinctly state that—I should say the neglect that followed in a great measure caused her death—if immediate remedies had been applied she would probably have recovered—there may be some doubt about that—it would be presumptuous to say so positively, but it might have been the case if four or five ounces of blood had been taken from her arm, or if leeches had been applied to the temples immediately—I am aware that the body will exhibit sympathetic injuries from blows inflicted on opposite sides—her cheek-bone was broken, and the jaw bruised, but that had no<lb/>thing to do with the cause of death—I had seen her occasionally before—she bad not been a patient of mine—she came to my shop for trifling things which she required—I have heard that she was subject to rheumatic pains in her head—indeed she had been in a delicate state of health for twelve months, to my knowledge—I could not judge from examining the body whether she had been subject to rheumatic pains of her head—she, an unfortunate girl, and I have heard, of a violent disposition, but I never saw her in any <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—great personal excitement would account for much of what I saw, and if she was drunk it would rather have contributed to it—I should say blows inflicted by a fist on the head was the cause of what I saw, no other violence being used—I think it probable that the congratu<lb/>lated blood was accumulating for twenty-four or twenty-five hours from the time the injury was received—if it had followed immediately, she would have lost all consciousness at once—if assistance had been rendered to her within three or four hours, I think the great probability is that she would have recovered.</p>

               <p>contusions on the integuments covering the lower jaw—the fingers of the right hand were lacerated, and there were bruises on the shins—on remov<lb/>ing the skull I found the external membrane of the brain in a very vascular state, of a deep colour; and immediately under that, on the right side, was a large quantity of coagulated blood, from three to four ounces—I consider the pressure of blood on the brain caused death.</p>

                  </hi>. I was, up to last Monday, a carman, in the employ of Mr. John Reilly, of Maidstone-wharf—I live in Walker-street, Long<lb/>acre. On Monday afternoon, the 31st of January, between three and four o'clock, I was at Brook's-wharf-lane, Upper Thames-street, loading a cart' as I was about to leave, I found I was stopped by a cart which was loading at Mr. Leschallas' warehouse, in Brook-wharf-lane—before I noticed the cart standing there, I saw Smith come down the lane with the key, and another man with him—Smith unlocked the door of Mr. Leschallas' warehouse, and went in—after that I saw both the prisoners inside the warehouse—I knew Sheey as being then in the employ of Mr. Leschallas, and Smith as having been in his employ—Sheey was then delivering the goods from the loop<lb/>hole of the warehouse to another man in the cart—it was the man who ac<lb/>companied Smith to the warehouse—there were four persons there in all—they continued to load the cart till it was overloaded, and it broke the wanty,—the horse was hung up by the collar, and I took hold of the cart to prevent it—Sheey gave me a small piece of rope to make the horse seem (he appeared rather tipsy)—I told him the rope was not strong enough, and I heard Smith speaking to him, as if reproaching him for not exerting himself to get another rope—another man, a brewer, then came up, and wanted to get by—he held the horse, and I ran to my own stable, and got a piece of rope—another man and the brewer made it fast, and it was drawn out—I did not stop to see the prisoners fasten up the warehouse.</p>

On the morning of the 15th of February a man came to the shop, and brought I with him one camel-hair pencil—he asked if I would purchase any <hi rend="italic">of</hi> that pattern—I asked him the price—he said 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per gross—I took the pencil to Mr. Reeves, and told him the circumstance—he came out, spoke to the man, and five o'clock was appointed for him to bring the bulk—instead of his coming at five, the prisoner came with a bundle of camel-hair pencils, tied up in a pocket handkerchief—he asked me if the stout gentleman was in the way who spoke to a person about some hair pencils in the morning, meaning Mr. Reeves—I pointed down to the bottom of the shop, and said, "There he is"—the prisoner went towards him, and I went for a policeman—I had had instructions, as soon as he came, to go for an officer—the prisoner said at the station that he was standing outside the door when the other man came in, and that he saw the gentleman cut the quill of the pencil—I went to the eating-house, and picked up these three pencils in the place pointed out by the prisoner—some were under the seat, and some under the table.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at No. 54, York-street, Westminster. I had known the deceased nine years—her name was Mary Reed—on Monday, the 14th of February, about ten minutes before seven o'clock in the evening, she called on me, and asked whether my child was out—I saw the prisoner after that—he is a knife-grinder, I believe—when I first saw him he had a grindstone in his right hand, and two kettles in the left—he was then at the further end of the Crown pub<lb/>lic-house, in York-street, on the pavement—he was standing quarrelling with two women, using very bad language, making threats, and shoring them off the pavement—one of the women complained to me of his beha<lb/>viour—Mary Reed came by just afterwards, and the prisoner said, "Here is another b—old gin-drinker"—she had said nothing to him—she had no appearance of being in liquor—he then <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her several times, and as she went by my shop I said to him, "Don't use the poor old woman like that"—he was following her—she had not done any thing to him in the least—she said afterwards, "You would not serve me so if my husband was here"—there is a green-grocer's shop beyond mine in the way she was going to her home, and when she got opposite the window of that shop the prisoner <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her again—she had a pair of shoes in her hand, and she put up the shoes in his face—she hoisted them up in her hand in his face—I do not know whether it was to guard off the blow or not—I cannot swear whether they touched his face—he then struck her with the kettle on the hand in which she held the shoes—she directly ran into the Fortune of War beer-shop which is to the left of my place, and over which she lodges—it is next door to the green-grocer's—the Crown is next door to me, on the right, the green-grocer's on the left, and the Fortune of War next to that—after she had gone into the beer-shop I said to the prisoner, "Go on, that's a good fellow"—he said, "I will serve you in the same way"—he stood at the beer-shop door on the edge of the pavement—a young person then came up with his knife-grinder's barrow, I cannot say whether it was his daughter or who it was, and he told her to go on with it home—he said he would beat the old b—y b—brains out before he went away—he said that while he was waiting there—the deceased was an elderly woman—I should say she was in the beer-shop more than three minutes—there are two little folding-doors out of the beer-shop, and when she came out the prisoner took the grindstone, and struck her with it over the left side of her head—he had hold of the buff-end—there is a little wheel at one end, the buff, as it is called, on which they brighten the knife, and at the other end is the little stone—this now produced is it—he held it between the two wheels—this buff end is made of wood, and lined with leather—he struck her with the</p>

               <p>stone end, on the head, and she fell backwards right into the beer-shop—I sent a boy for a policeman—the prisoner was going to walk off, but the policeman came running across the road, and Mr. Reed, the deceased's husband, came down stairs, and he was taken into custody—the prisoner appeared to have been drinking, but was not to say drunk—the deceased was perfectly sober—she was fifty-five years of age.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the first of the affair this, that the kettles he held in his left-hand knocked against her in passing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I can undertake to swear it was not so, for she passed inside close against the wall—she al<lb/>ways walked close against the wall—he was outside of the pavement—she was very infirm, and she kept close against the wall—I saw her com<lb/>ing along close against the wall—he was standing still then, where I first saw him with the two women—she did not turn round, and say something to him on his rubbing the kettles against her, for that did not happen—I cannot swear whether she hit him with one of the shoes in her hand—she put up her hand, I think, to guard the blow from the kettle—at that time no blow had been struck, only his <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> her—on my oath she did not upon that strike him a violent blow in the face with the shoes—I would not swear they did not touch his face—they were a pair of heavy men's shoes—there is an alley between the green-grocer's and the beer-shop, and she used to go that way home—it was her way home—she did not run up the alley after patting the shoes up in his face—she ran into the beer-shop—she did not go up the alley at all at any period—she ran to the beer-shop—she was standing I should say three yards from the beer-shop when she was struck with the saucepan—she did not run up the alley, and return with one shoe in each hand, strike the prisoner a blow on the breast with either shoe, and then run into the Fortune of War—I never saw a blow—I can swear such a thing did not occur that I saw—she was above three minutes in the Fortune of War—I did not take out my watch to look, but I am clearly of opinion it was three minutes—while she was in there, the prisoner said to me that he would serve me the same—that was all he said to me—he held the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 1, York-terrace, York-street, Westminster; I am a lacemaker, and keep a stall. On the night of the 14th of February I saw the prisoner in York-street—my attention was first drawn to him by his using very improper language to two females, who were passing by—after those women had passed by, I saw Mrs. Reed, and he said the same language to Mrs. Reed as he had to the others—he called her an old b—, and asked if she was going to the gin-shop—she said, "Go along"—she was against a side door of the beer-shop, where she goes up stairs—she lives over the beer-shop—the side door is in the main street, not in the alley—after using this improper language to her, he kept still standing with her—she wanted to try to get away from him—she was going the opposite way from her own home, up the street, with a pair of shoes in her hand—she was coming out of her home when I saw her first, walking towards Mr. Crow's, and when the prisoner spoke of her in this insulting manner, and followed her, she turned round to go home again—he turned round to follow her, and stood in the doorway of the private door of the beer-shop, where she lived, so that she could not get in either one way or other—there is a public door to the beer-shop, for the people to go in at, and a private door for the lodgers—both doors are in the main street—she strove to get past him, he would not let her pass, and he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with the saucepans which he had in his left hand, and struck her a blow on the left hand—Mrs. Reed then turned, and went into the beer-shop—the prisoner said, "You need not go in there for protection, I will wait for <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> till <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> comes out, be as long as <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> like"—he said nothing more that I heard—she staid in the beer-shop about three minutes, or it might be four—he had this grindstone in one hand, and the saucepans in the other—as she came out of the beer-shop door, he lifted up his right hand, and struck her with the grindstone, as she was coming out at the door—she had not said or done any thing to him at that time—it occurred as soon as Mrs. Reed appeared—it was the stone part that struck her head—she fell back into the shop—while she was in the beer-shop the prisoner waited outside—he was not grinding or doing any thing, but merely waiting at the door, and he said he would give her a <hi rend="italic">topper</hi> whenever she came out, I did not hear him say any thing after—I did not know him before—he was rather in liquor, but not to say very much intoxicated—he had been drinking.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you a friend of Mrs. Reed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No parti<lb/>cular friend, only by knowing her—I had known her for about fifteen years, but was not acquainted with her more than other people—I was examined before the Coroner—what I said was taken down and read over to me—I am sure it was the stone end he struck her with—that I swear—I have no doubt of it—I never doubted which end it was he struck her with—I did not hear Mr. Crow's evidence to-day, or at the inquest—I</p>

On the evening of the 14th of February, I was in the Fortune-of-War beer-shop, about seven o'clock, when the deceased came in—she went into the tap-room door and called some men out to drive a man away, who she was afraid was going to strike her—nobody went on her call—they did not take any notice—she spoke to a young man who was asleep, and he took no notice—she then went to the door again, and took one door in each hand—they are double doors—she had been in the beer-shop from three to five minutes—she did not get quite outside the door before I heard a blow, and saw her stagger back on to a settle—she said the roan had knocked her down with a grindstone—seeing the woman bleed, I went to the door with her, and the prisoner said it served her right, he would do it again; and if she was drunk, he was not—I had not spoken to him—he could see her when she and I came to the door together—the deceased was not drunk, or at all in liquor—the prisoner was a little the worse for liquor, but not so bad as not to know what he was about.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stonemason, and work for Mr. Eyres. Chandler lodges with my mother—I came with him on the evening in question down Castle-lane into York-street—he left me at the Stag pub<lb/>lic-house, Castle-lane, to go to a place of convenience, and he crossed the road to me afterwards—I waited for him on the curb on the opposite side of the road—as Chandler was crossing the road towards me I turned my head to go where we were going to have a drop of beer together, and I saw the deceased and the prisoner in contact together—I had never seen either of them before—he had two large saucepans in hit left hand, and a grind<lb/>stone in his right—by what I could see, I think they were both going one way—they were close together, with the exception of the saucepans being between them—I did not see any blow struck with the saucepans—he was swinging them about carelessly, <hi rend="italic">singing,</hi> out, "Old tin kettles to mend," in a jovial sort of way—the saucepans rubbed against her as she passed, and the went into a little bit of a court between, a greengrocer's shop and the beer shop—before that she struck him on the left arm with a pair of shoes which she had in her hand—I cannot say to within two or three inches of where she hit him, but it was somewhere about there—they were <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> each other, talking very loud—she struck him once before she went into the passage, and twice after she came out—she could not have gone far up the passage—there is a bright light at the entrance of the passage—she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280046"/>
               <p>came down with a shoe in each hand, and kept <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> the prisoner—they kept <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> each other all the time—she struck the prisoner with the shoes about the arm or shoulder, and once on the breast, and they both called each other names—after striking him she ran into the beer-shop—she was not in there above a minute or a little more, I cannot exactly judge, and when she came out the blow was struck by the prisoner—I should think he was a little <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>—he had had a little, but not knowing his ways I could not exactly tell.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>book—notes received by Adams in this way are never paid away the same day, but are locked up and entered next morning—they are never paid away before that—Berry would not make up his clearing till after five o'clock—the notes would go into Boone's hands late that evening—he would lock them up, and in the morning they would be entered before they were paid away the next day—notes brought by Adams would not go into Boone's hands till business hours were over—this entry of the "2nd Feb<lb/>ruary," in the goldsmiths' receivable book is in the prisoner's writing—here is an entry of three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—one is "No. 27,341," dated 10th Dec. 1840—the notes are entered in order, according to their amounts—this is the last of the tens—the following entry is, "30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., No. 32427, dated 8th of October, 1841," and there is-another 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note entered next to it—the prisoner makes these entries at a desk in the front, near the window—another clerk sits next to him at the time—as the prisoner enters the notes, which are placed with their faces to him, he turns them down with his left-hand—they are sorted according to their amounts—here is an entry some pages on, under the same date, of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"27347 Port., 10th of December, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the only difference between that and the other is the word "Port." and the figure "7"—Port. meant the Portsmouth branch of the Bank of England, but if the word is "Post," I should read it, "Bank Post, bill"—I was present at five o'clock, balancing the account of the bank on the 2nd of February, and late in the evening, we were found to be 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—I and the clerks went through the books to trace it if we could, and after that went through it again to look through the notes received, and missed a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—we ascertained the number and date of it—the prisoner stood close at hand assisting in tracing the deficiency—it was announced that a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note of such a number and date was missed, and shortly after the prisoner left the spot where he was, and returned with that 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in his hand, and pro<lb/>duced it—it was of the number and date missing—I did not see where be brought it from—he said he had brought it out of his desk, he supposed it bad got in there with some papers he had before him during the day—his desk is at the end of the shop—that is not the desk at which he was in the habit of making the entries—very great surprise was expressed at what he said—I told him I thought it was rather improbable (as soon as he bad entered the notes in the morning, it was his duty to turn them down with his left hand, and either put them before the cashier, or the cashier would take them himself—he had no authority to do any thing else with them—if Boone wanted any notes which lay before him, he would take them away; in any event, the prisoner would not carry them from his desk to Boone at the counter—they were close together—the desk he spoke of is his private desk, and is quite at the further end of the shop—not near Boone—he had no authority whatever to change any of these notes, nor to get cash for them) the production of the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note did not set the account straight—we were then 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over, having missed only 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—we tried, but could not find out how it was that night—I have what we call the "daily ticket" of the 2nd of February, which is in the prisoner's hand—we ultimately found that we had got the first 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note but none corresponding with the second entry, "Port." or "Post"—we paid we first 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note into the Bank of England afterwards—these "daily tickets" are in the prisoner's handwriting, and are prepared by him—they represent a certain, sun of money to be included in the calculations of the day—the total</p>

Lord Dynevor is president and one of the trustees—there are several others—Lord Dynevor is not aware of this prosecution, but several of the trustees are, and the managers generally have sanctioned and authorized it—on Saturday, the 29th of January, Coleman came to the bank, repre<lb/>sented himself to be Philip Smith, a depositor in the institution, and ap<lb/>plied for payment of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I called out "Philip Smith," Cole man stood before me, and answered to that name—it is necessary, in order for depositors to get out their money, to produce their book at the bank<lb/>here is the genuine book of Philip Smith—Coleman produced it, and when I saw it, I called out the name of "Philip Smith," to identify the portly with whom I had to transact the business, and Coleman answered to that name—I filled up a receipt for the money to be paid, and handed it to Cole<lb/>man to sign—he first signed "Smith" only—I told him it was necessary to sign both names, and returned it to him, requesting him to add Philip to it—he then signed "Philip," and returned it to me signed "Philip smith"</p>

               <p>—I compared that signature with the original signature of Philip Smith, which be had given in to our institution when he deposited the money—I have that book here—on making the comparison, I was not satisfied with the identity of the handwriting, and I asked him if his name was Philip Smith—he replied that it was—I felt satisfied that he was not Philip Smith—I then cautioned him, told him my suspicions, and that if he persisted in stating that he was Philip Smith, and it turned out he was not, he would get him<lb/>self into trouble, at the same time I said, "What is your name?<hi rend="italic"/>"—he re<lb/>plied, "Philip Smith"—I said, "And the money belongs to you?"—he said, "Yes"—I spoke to Mr. Boodle, the comptroller, my superior, then took the receipt, and requested the prisoner to accompany me to Mr. Boodle, who was in an adjoining room—I stated my suspicions to him, but perhaps Coleman might not have heard me—I produce the book which has Philip Smith's writing in it.</p>

               <p>name—he said his name was Philip Smith—I put that question to him two or three times distinctly—I did not call his attention to the original signature-book—I merely called his attention to the place of residence out of it—I said the writing was very dissimilar, and his answers were very unsatisfactory, I certainly should not feel justified in ordering the money to be paid to him, unless some respectable person could identify him as being the true depositor—I asked whom he knew in the neighbourhood—he said, "Mr. Drummond"—I asked what Mr. Drummond, whether it was one of the firm at Charing-cross—he said, "Yes, Mr. George Drummond"—he said he had lived with him—knowing where Mr. Drummond lived, I asked where it was—he said he could not tell me, he did not know, he only remained with him one night—I then asked him whether it was in a street or a square—he could not give any answer to that—I said I did not wish to delay him, if he was the right depositor, in the receipt of the money, but I should feel it necessary to send him to Mr. Drummond, to see if he could identify him—I sent John Martin, our constable, with him for that purpose—they returned in a very short time, and Martin told me, in his presence, that he had confessed that he was not Philip Smith, and that he did not live with Mr. Drummond—I said, "Is that the case?—Coleman said, "Yes"—I said, "Am I to understand, then, that you are not the depositor?"—he said he was not, but his brother was—I asked him what his name was—he said, "George Smith"—I said, under all the circumstances, I must send him to the police-office to account for it—be then said his brother had sent him, and his brother was outside—Martin then went away with him—he came back again very soon after, accom<lb/>panied by the prisoner Smith, and said he had brought the brother back—I asked Smith if Coleman was his brother—he said, yes, that he had sent him in to receive the money—I asked Smith why he did not come in to receive it himself—he said he did not like—he gave me no other reason, than that—he said he was not aware he was doing any harm—the money had been deposited very nearly two years—I then said he had got his bro<lb/>ther into a very serious <hi rend="italic">scrape,</hi> that I should send him in charge for the forgery, and that he might attend at Bow-street, to explain the matter as he could—I did not give Smith into custody—he was not given into cus<lb/>tody at all—the Magistrate called on them both to find bail, but not on the first occasion—there was only one prisoner at first, and that was Cole<lb/>man—he was remanded from Saturday till the Wednesday following—he was brought up on the Wednesday—Smith then attended voluntarily—it was on a subsequent occasion that the Magistrate called on him to find bail.</p>

               <p>remand—between the first and third remands I made inquiries to see whether Smith was the party whom Coleman represented him to be—I beard a very good character of him from Mr. Drummond, for the short time he lived with him—I also inquired of Mr. Biddulph, but did not find his character so satisfactory there—I should say it was not good—Mr. Biddulph only said he did not feel satisfied with him—he did not enter into particulars—he made no complaint against his honesty—it did not seem to amount to that—he said he was a boy of bad temper—I in<lb/>quired of Mr. Seaton, and found his character was good there—I told the Magistrate that Coleman gave the name of George Smith—I believe information was given against him, as George Smith, and the depositions were taken against him in that name—he went by that name on the two first occasions, and on the third occasion, I found out that his name was Coleman—I have the letter in my pocket, which first informed me that his name was Coleman—the Magistrate recommended me to charge Smith with conspiring with Coleman to defraud the institution-r-Smith was dressed much the same as be is now—I cannot tell whether he had on the same clothes—be was certainly not in a tagged state—it has been the opinion of some persons that this proceeding arose more out of the ignorance of the prisoners than any thing else, but I can hardly reconcile that in my own mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever propose going into partnership with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was he who said, "Let us go into partnership"—perhaps I might have said so, because the prisoner told me he was about marrying his landlord's sitter, who would bring him about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never said I could procure 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go into partnership with him—he came to me several times while I was at Homerton, and said he had job goods to buy, by which 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. profit could be made—I partly consented to advance the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did agree to advance it—I paid 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner gave me bills for it—I did not advance 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. first—I advanced 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. all in one sum—I bought the goods for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and sold them to the prisoner for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me bills of long dates in payment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received by the prisoner on your authority as part payment of that 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I never told the prisoner that he had already had 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my wife from the savings-bank, part of the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it lever made any part of the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear that—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—this is my handwriting.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you prepared now to swear that you paid the whole 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one sum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I paid to Mr. Savin 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards, which makes 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Savin will tell you so.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you refer to in that letter, the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you had in the savings bank, and which was obtained by forging your name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was this 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I did not believe she was obliged to make a forgery to get it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing your wife had got the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the Bank by any means short of forgery, did you then refer him to her to get the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to make up the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—they made some story, and I answered them—I cannot recollect whether I got the bills for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner after I wrote this letter—when I wrote this letter I knew ay wife had got the money from the savings-bank, but I was not aware the had committed a forgery to get it, or that the prisoner had aided her in committing it—the bills for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are in the hands of Mr. Lewis, the soli<lb/>citor—I gave the prisoner 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides that referred to in the letter, as con<lb/>sideration for the bills for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot recollect when—it was after I wrote this letter—it was on the guarantee of a person named Rufel—I have had other transactions with the prisoner besides that of the 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have dealt together—the bills for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were renewed when they be<lb/>came due, and on their being renewed I delivered the old ones up to the prisoner—he never paid one farthing on the renewed bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you oppose the prisoner's discharge under the Insolvent act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did what my solicitor advised me to do, and it was him did it—it was as the holder of the renewed bills for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why was not Madame Bailey examined on that occasion on the same subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe she might have been examined—I do not know the laws of England, but it appeared that the Court declared itself incompetent—I preferred the bill before the Grand Jury the first Session after that—Mr. Lewis did all the proceedings—I did not stay till the last day of the Session before I took out a warrant—I do not know—I believe the prisoner was to have been arrested the very same day the warrant was issued.</p>
               <p>

The prisoner was in my employ in 1840, in Berner-street, and Madame Roret also—Madame Roret went home ill in June, 1840—about October, 1841, I had a conversation with the prisoner about Madame Roret—he never showed me 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me he had received 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Madame Roret—some time before that he told me Madame Roret held the book of the savings' bank, and that he would have the money—he said she had got the book from her husband, and that he would make her draw out the money from the bank—I asked him how he could do so—he said he would make her sign for her husband—I told him she could not do so without putting herself into trouble—he said, "Never mind, I must have it"—this was not a conversation about making up the sum of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was before—he said that Mr. Roret was a man of money, and had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and perhaps more, and he would have it all—I spoke in French to him—I told him, by Madame Roret signing her husband's name, she would get into trouble, meaning that she would be injured, and it would go against her, put her into prison, or any<lb/>thing, by the French laws—the expression I used was, that if it came to the knowledge of the bank they would proceed against her.</p>

The prisoner was our shopman—I got one of my servants to watch him, and, on the 1st of February, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I got an intimation that he had something belonging to me—there were some customers in the shop—when they were gone, I said to the prisoner, "I will thank you to let me see what you have in your pocket," and to my surprise, instead of taking out money, he took out this pair of stockings—he said, "Sir, I took them as a sample, think<lb/>ing no harm"—we then got the officer, who found the remnants of calico and a pair of mitts on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an outfitter, and live in Broad-street, Ratcliffe. In the morning of Friday week, Mead came to me, and said be was dis<lb/>charging a barge of sand at the wharf—(this barge was lying at a wharf nearly adjoining my house)—he said one of the people had got locked up, and was fined 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., would I lend him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on a sail, to prevent the man being sent away in the van—I said I would do it for him—he left, and in about fire minutes he returned with Watts and this sail—I was about giving him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "Lend me another 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., we shall want a pot of beer when we get the man"—I lent him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and this is the sail he left.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember the barge lying at Ashley's wharf that day—there was no cargo with her—I helped to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> her oat to anchor to save her from getting injury—I had heard previous to that of the sail going out of her, and I was blamed for taking charge of her—I was afterwards sitting in a public-house, smoking my pipe—a man came, and gave me information that so and so was taken out of the barge—I went, and saw Mead in a marine-store shop with the rope—I did not see where he took it from—I had seen such rope on board the barge, and lent a hand to put part of it down into the hold—this is the rope—a man in the marine-store shop said to me, "Have you anything to do with it?"—I said, "It is stolen property, don't you buy it"—Mead went out, and Watts came in—he said, "I am master of that barge, the rope is mine"—I said, "You nor nobody shall have it till I get an officer," because I took charge of the barge.</p>

On Saturday night, the 26th of February, I saw the prisoner running in George-street—Morris directed my attention to him—while I was pursuing him he turned down a turning leading to a main sewer—he went through there, and I lost sight of him till he got to the other side, and he said "Catch me if you can"—I went through the water, thinking I should catch him, but I could not—I afterwards took him to the prosecutrix—the meat was found the following morning, down an area.</p>

The next morning, about half-past six o'clock, I was looking down the areas in Sloane-square, and saw a piece of beef—I made inquiries, and found it did not belong to that house—I took it to the station, and found the prosecutrix had lost a piece.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, and live at No. 28, Saffron<lb/>hill. On Thursday night, the 24th of February, I went to the Coopers' Anna public-house, which is opposite my place—the prisoners and several persons were drinking in front of the bar—I put out my hand to one of the prisoners, and said, "Shake hands with me in friendship"—he spat on my hand—I asked what he meant by that, and he hit me in the eye with hit hand—I asked what he meant by that, and he struck me in the mouth—then there was a <hi rend="italic">scrummage</hi> with the quart-pots, during which I re<lb/>ceived a blow on the left eye, where there is now a scar—I did not see how that was inflicted—a doctor was sent for.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Coopers' Arms public-house between eight and nine o'clock on Thursday night the 24th of February—I believe the prisoners were there when I went in—I called for a pint of beer, and while drinking it a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> occurred with Coleman and Guiseppe Maestai, who threw a pot at me, which struck me on the hat—I had done nothing to provoke him—I believe it was levelled at me, and Pelagrias struck me down with a quart pot—I became insensible with the blows—I had several pots about my shoulders—when I recovered I was taken outside the door, and taken to a surgeon's—I had not done anything to him.</p>

I sold to Mr. Stephenson, on the 19th of February, five quarters of oats, all out of one sample—the oats which are here have the same appearance—there is a very great difference in the quality and growth of oats—some are mixed with darnel or chaf, and some are clear—ours were free from those defects, but they were Dot the best oats—I have not a large quantity of these oats by me—they are nearly all gone—I never sold any to the prisoner to my recollection—not such a quantity as those that are lost.</p>

On the 10th of February, the prisoners, Willes and Cun<lb/>ningham, came to me—I was ill in bed at the time—they called to know whether I could assist them in getting a couple of bills discounted—Cun<lb/>ingham produced two bills from his pocket, rolled up, and in a crumpled state—I said, "What a pity you should keep them in that negligent, care<lb/>less kind of way, for if the bills are ever so good, it throws a damper on them in introducing them in a respectable channel"—the remark was made that a hot iron would make it all right—to the best of my belief Willes said that—I copied both the bills, and have the copies here, which I took at the time—it is not a literal translation—the first is (<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>) "Madeira, 6th December, 1841, due February 20th, 1842. 30 days sight; first of exchange. Gordon, Duff, and Co. Order, Capt. Thompson, in full of my passage money hence to Demerara, Charles Heath. Drawn on Barton, Hasleham, and Higgins, Liverpool. Accepted, 18th January, 1842. Payable at Dennisons' and Co., London. Signed, Barton, Hasleham, and Higgins, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the other bill is for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated "Madeira, 8th December, 1841, accepted by James King, Esq., Bristol; due, 20th February, 1842. Accepted 18th January. 30 days sight, and payable at Robarts, Curtis, and Co."—I noticed that the last bill was endorsed to Mr. Ruffy—having examined the bills, I said on the first bill, according to the Continental laws, with which I was acquainted, there was an irregularity—the endorsement of Gordon, Duff, and Co. preceded, instead of followed, the endorsement of Thompson, and I remarked that, according to the Continental laws, that would vitiate the transfer, but I was not sufficiently acquainted with the</p>

               <p>laws of England to know whether it would have the same effect in this country, nevertheless I considered it an irregularity—I explained that to them, and I believe Cunningham said, "Well, I thought it was all right, Willes knows enough about bills to say they are all right," and I believe he told me at the time that he himself knew little about bills—I saw nothing wrong in the second bill—I saw it was specially endorsed to J. Ruffy Esq., and asked Cunningham whether his name was Ruffy—he said "No"—I asked whether he was the holder of the bill—he said "Yes"—I said "How does it happen then that that name is deficient?"—I made then re<lb/>mark to both the parties that the endorsement was special, and the name was deficient—Cunningham said it did not matter, it could be got—there was mention made of there being a third bill in existence—I could not take on myself to recollect who said that—they said the amount of the other bill was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, I understood, but I have not seen that bill—they said they had such a bill, but not with them—I desired them to let me see the other bill, because from the irregularities I perceived on this bill, I did not like to make my mind up as to the appearance, or the nature of the suspicious circumstance—they then left me—next day, Cunningham came to me alone, and brought the same two bills, but not the third—he asked me either to lend him, or procure him the loan of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on these two bills—I noticed that Mr. Ruffy's signature was still wanting, and made the re<lb/>mark to Cunningham—I said, "Where is that third bill you promised me to look at yesterday?"—he said he could not get it, that Willes would not let him have it—I said, "How does it happen that this bill is in the same state as when you brought it to me before?"—he said, "Well, but is not the other bill, (alluding to the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill,) where there is no special endow<lb/>ment required, sufficient for the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said "No, I will tell you what—I don't like the look of the whole of this case, because the third bill does not make its appearance," and then the young man being by himself I said, "I tell you what, I don't like the look of the whole case; how am I cer<lb/>tain those bills may not have been found?"—that was a suggestion of mine—Cunningham replied, "Supposing they have"—I said, "That is the reason I will have nothing at all to do with them, nor advise you to do"—previous to that I said, "If I was fool enough to meddle in this transac<lb/>tion, who tells me that these bills may not have been already advertised and stopped"—to which Cunningham answered, "No, I have looked at the paper these nine days"—that opened my eyes sufficiently, and I then addressed him in a manly style, saying, "I am older than to be your father, and I advise you to have nothing at all to do in this case, to meddle with the negociation of this paper—for, in the first instance, you cannot succeed without an attempt at fraud, and in the next without a forgery, and by attempting either, you run the risk of being sent across the water"—he then shook, and said, "Oh, I had better then destroy them"—I said "No, why would you do an innocent owner an injury without doing your<lb/>self any benefit or good by it? If you like to be guided by me, the only way in which you can even make an honest something out of it, and with out any danger to yourself, will be this; bring me the third bill yon have got, and I will do like I have done with the other two, make a copy of it and make a public advertisement for you, drawing it in the mildest man<lb/>ner, namely, that they had been found, and I will make an advertisement to that effect for you in the public papers"—I told him he would get a better reward that way than by any other means, and without any risk—that advice he seemed highly to approve of, and promised to follow—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280161"/>
               <p>then left me—before be left me he stated that he should hare tome diffi<lb/>culty in getting the third bill—I said, "No matter, you must insist on having it back, if it is in the hands of your own father"—this was on Friday, the 11th of February—to the best of my recollection in the middle of the day something near that, I cannot recollect exactly the time—I had no clock in my room—he did not leave either of the bills with me—he took them away with him, and I never saw any more of him, and never had a sight of the third bill—when I heard this matter was under inquiry, I went to the office of the solicitor for the prosecution, and told him what I knew of it, as soon as I was able to get out of bed—I did not know any<lb/>thing of it at the time, because I was ill, but I stated the circumstance in my house the very day it occurred.</p>

I occasionally go to the Old Rum Puncheon, which used to be kept by Packer—I remember seeing the prisoner Davis there—the first time I saw him there was about six months ago—I never saw him there on this affair at all—he called on me, as near as I can remember, six weeks ago come Wednesday—I cannot fix the date, as I paid so little attention, it having no<lb/>thing to do with my affairs—he had been once before to my house, but I was not in the way—he left word when I came home to stop, and in con<lb/>sequence of that I saw him—he asked me to read a note for him—I asked if be could not read himself—he said, "No"—he had not got the note with him—I asked him for it, and he asked me if I would step with him and read it—I accompanied him to a house just on the spot, I do not know the name of the street, and there found Saint, Clarke, and Davis—Clarke pro<lb/>duced some papers—they appeared to be bills drawn—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the bil for</hi> 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—I believe this is one of the bills I saw—I read the bills—I do not remember the particulars of any other than this—I read then to them, and laid them down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Willes's Defence.</hi> On the 10th of February, Cunningham brought there bills of exchange, and I went with him to Mr. Cobet; he said he either wanted to borrow some money on them, or have them discounted. Mr. Cobet and he had some conversation, what it was I do not know, respect<lb/>ing them; I had nothing more to do with the bills, and heard nothing more about them for several days, till I was informed by Mr. Packer, the landlord of the public-house where I met them, that they were put into his tap-room fire, and burnt. Some few days after, that 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was brought to me, and I mentioned it to Fletcher; I heard nothing of it for several days till I found it was in Mr. Wood's hands, who had it for the purpose of discounting or returning it; that is the whole of the knowledge I had either of the bills or these parties; I never saw them before to my knowledge in my life, and I should not have seen them had I not been</p>

               <p>applied to to inform them who would lend money on these bills. I have lived for forty years in the city of London, and borne a good character, and my family before me for sixty years, in the neighbourhood of London<lb/>wall; this is the first time I was ever in difficulty. I was not aware I was offending against the law, in saying such and such parties discount billls or lend money on them; I was not aware I was guilty of any crime in taking them to those parties—they did not tell me how they came by the bills it is not likely they would inform me—I heard no more of it till Mr. Wood was in custody; I was then given in charge, and taken to the station in Tower-street. Mr. Wood there recollected himself, that he did not receive the bill from me; I reminded him of the parties he did receive it of; and Inspector Waller, when I mentioned that, told me if I found the parties, they only wanted the parties who committed the burglary; that I should be taken care of. I was to meet these men on the Sunday night, between ten and eleven o'clock; this was on Saturday. I met them at twelve, two men named Pratt and Patteson, and on Monday, Tuesday, Wednes<lb/>day, and Thursday, I met them, till the parties were all in custody; and I believe Mr. Waller will prove, that as far as I was capable, I gave every information, after finding the bills were come by wrongly; on Thursday night I was taken into custody after having relieved Mr. Waller from all difficulty in finding the parties; as far as my information went, I acted as straightforward as any man could act under the circumstances. I had no bills or part of a Bank-note. I believe Packer went with Cunningham to the Bank to get it changed; he gave it to Lloyd, and Lloyd gave it to Fletcher to take to a Jew to get money or clothes, or what they could get for it. I advised Mr. Wood to have nothing to do with the bill, and so did Baker, so they tell me, and Wood was requested to give the bills back to the parties, that there might be an end of it. I have told you the whole truth, and the whole connexion I had with the parties; it is the first I ever had, and I will take care it shall be the last. I only acted in the capacity of an agent between them. Lloyd had all his things distrained on, and as bed to sleep in, and was greatly in want of money, or I should not have exerted myself in the matter. I leave it entirely to the consideration of the Jury whether I am guilty, in going with these two parties to borrow money on the bills, for I had nothing further to do with it.</p>

While I was inquiring into this matter, on the subject of the 521. bill, I saw Willes, on a Saturday, at the station—I said nothing then—I saw him again on a Monday, and he said he knew all about it—I said, "All about what?"—he said he could put me in the way of apprehending the parties that broke into the place, and did it—he said he had bills in his possession—I asked him what bills—he said he had the three bills in his possession—I had the 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bill in my possession at the time, and showed it to him—he said that was one of them—I asked him where the other two were—he said they were burnt—I asked him how he knew that—he said he saw them burnt, that there was a quarrel among them, and that was the reason the other two were burnt</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe Cunningham rendered you all the assist<lb/>ance in his power? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did. Willes was alone when we had the conversation.</p>

               <p>them—I mean assistance as to the charge of housebreaking—I had no conversation with Cunningham about the endorsed bill—I took the three into custody by his information—I told Lloyd he was charged with the rob<lb/>bery as well as the forgery—he said he knew nothing about the forgery—this was after the examination before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Willes.</hi> What I said was, that Packer told me he saw the two small bills burnt, and the 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill I only had about five minutes in my posses<lb/>sion. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That is not so—he said he had the three bills in his pos<lb/>session, and he saw the two bills burnt, and a lot more papers besides as much as a little basket would hold.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City policeman. On the evening of the 23rd, when Clarke, Saint, and Davis were taken into custody, I was going along Bishopsgate-street with Willes—it was raining at the time, and he voluntarily said, pointing to the umbrella I had, "I saw as many papers burnt belonging to Mr. Ruffy, as would fill that umbrella if it was in<lb/>verted"—he said he had seen two bills burnt over a b—y quarrel between the parties.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Willes's Defence.</hi> As regards the forgery, I know nothing about it. It was taken away either by Lloyd or Cunningham, to get endorsed, and brought back again to the Auction-mart; and Cunningham hesitated to leave it with Wood. I said to Wood, "Give him an undertaking that you will return him the bill or money." I left the place and went to Brixton, where I had business. When I returned, I understood I was wanted, and I gave them every information I could, being in the habit of getting bills discounted. It was not for me to ask them about the bills. I introduced the parties to the party to discount them, and I have nothing more to do. They learn from the parties how to get them. As to the third bill in question, it never went to Cobet, but to Wood. With respect to asking them how they come by the bills, I have nothing to do with that; the party who discounts makes all these inquiries, and takes all the responsi<lb/>bility. I had it not in my possession five minutes. There seems to have been a mistake as to my seeing the papers burnt. I did not. I was told so by the landlord of the house; and it must be a misunderstanding of the officers. I might not have heard distinctly, being deaf. While they were gone to get the bill indorsed I was on business with other people at the Auction-mart; and when they came back, I said, "Leave it with Wood; if be gives you an undertaking to return the bill or the money." I have a character to lose, and I acted in the way I have said. I was not in the secret of the transaction; I only had to introduce the men to get the bill discounted; and it is hard I should be considered a party who stole the bill. It was morally impossible for me to tell how they came by them, and I was not to ask them; that was the business of the party discounting them. They should have gone to Mr. Ruffy, and asked if it was correct. I have not the slightest knowledge who did endorse it, or of the parties who committed the robbery, only from hearsay, from the landlord of the house, and the parties with me. I do not frequent the house. Lloyd came with his brother, and asked if I knew where he could get money on the bills; that he was in distress at the time, having his goods seized for rent. They were introduced to Wood in an indirect manner by me. I thought the thing was straightforward, and acted upon that impression as innocently as possible. While they went to get the bill endorsed, I stopped in the Auction-mart, in the tap-room, with other parties on business. When Wood was in custody I gave every information I was able; but was not aware there was any thing wrong till the policemen sent for me. I was out four or five days with them, till the parties were taken; then they turned round, and I was placed in custody with them. I forwarded every information I was in possession of to the proper quarter. I leave it in the hands of the Jury to decide if I was wrong—I did not know I was doing wrong.</p>

I have known Willes fifteen years—I know he has been in the habit of getting bills discounted for parties—I have myself handed him thirty or forty bills in that period; some he has returned, not being able to get them discounted, and others he has got done—I know he was in the habit of going to the Auction-mart, to Baker's coffee-house, where a number of agents go—I have seen bills passed across there for the purpose of getting discounted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Thursday morning, the 9th of February, I was going up York-street, Bedford-square, Commercial-road; the clock struck seven as I turned out of the square into York-street, it was just day-light—I saw Germaine and Bruce—Germaine had a bundle on his right arm, in a blue handkerchief—they were close together, side by side—I was running up the street—just as they got to the top of the street I laid hold of Germaine—Bruce turned his eye over his left shoulder, and seeing me, ran away—Germaine said, "You have got me at last, you have long wished it; I cannot halloo, I have been very lucky"—I took the bun<lb/>dle, and took him to the station; searched him, and found a skeleton key in his pocket—I charged him with having these things in his possession and not giving a satisfactory account—the bundle contained a counterpane and two sheets—I do not recollect his making any reply—after he was charged I went to search for Bruce—I went to a lodging-house, No. 15, rose-lane, Wentworth-street, Spitalfields—I went up into the top room, occu<lb/>pied by Bruce and Proby, and found him there, with Proby's sister—Bruce took his coat off, hung it across a line, and threw himself on the bed with the remainder of his clothes on, smoking a short pipe—I said "Get up, Bruce, I want you"—I knew him before—he said, "What for?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280171"/>
               <p>—I said, "For being concerned in the robbery with Germaine, that you got away from me this morning"—Proby said, "Oh, George, I would see the b—d—before I would go with him"—he told her not to halloo—I then pot the handcuffs upon him, locked the door, and put the key into my pocket—I then commenced searching the room, and found three files in a cupboard—on searching further I found some duplicates, and asked proby what they were—she said they were all hers—one of them referred to a table-cloth pledged for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at Mr. Soame's, in Brick-lane—I searched another room, but found nothing—I took Bruce and proby to the station, and charged them with being concerned with Germaine—I could not find any owner of the property that day—the skeleton key that I found on germaine opened the door of Mr. Hunt, no. 6, Alfred-place, Alfred-street, Stepney, who had been robbed of a tablecloth on the 9th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Hunt, of No. 6, Alfred-place, in the parish of Stepney. On Wednesday morning, the 9th of February, I got up about six o'clock, or a little after—I perceived a light on the stair-case before I got up—I had just awoke, and my bed room door was open—I hallooed out, "Hunt, is that you?" thinking at first it was my hus<lb/>band up, but he said, "No, I am here"—I said, "there is a light on the stairs"—we got up, my husband went down first, and I directly after—I found the street-door wide open, which I had locked the night before when I went to bed—i and my husband had gone to bed together about eleven—I missed a table-cloth from a chair in the par lour, which I had folded up and placed there between ten and eleven the night before, after supper—it was there when I went to bed—there was 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the kitchen mantel-piece which was not taken, and a bundle on the stairs—I suppose my hallooing out "Who's that?" directly I saw the light, disturbed them—the street-door could not be opened from the outside without a key—This table-cloth now produced is ours—I know it by the way in which I folded it up and by a pickle stain on it—it is the one I have lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the plasterers employed in repairing Elm-cottage. The writing on this board is not mine—I never authorized the prisoner to go to get the beer, or knew of his going, further than that on Tuesday, the 22nd, there was some beer brought into the building—I was at work in the drawing-room, and he was at work for the men in front of the house—they gave him two days' work, as he had nowhere to go to—they brought some beer into the drawing-room, and I had some, but I did not know how it was obtained till next day, when Dyer came and inquired if I had sent this board—I said no, and what fools they must be to let the beer go—it is not an ordinary mode of sending an order for beer on a board in this way—I did not desire the prisoner to go and get some beer, nor express a wish that he should go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> On Tuesday, the 22nd of February, I was directed by my employer, Mr. Sims, of Mile End-road, to go to Elm-cottage, to finish the job he had commenced some time previous; Lane asked me if I had any objection to fetch a gallon of porter; I said none in the least, and asked him where from, being a perfect stranger to the man and the place; he sent his plasterer's boy for a pencil and a piece of board, and wrote that order in my presence; he gave it into my hands; I read it over, and asked if that was his name; he said yes, it was all right, and directed me to the house where the beer was to be fetched from. I went to the house, and saw Mrs. Dyer; I gave her the board, and after some conversation with a footman who was there, she gave me the beer, which I took back to the building, and Lane, and all the men, except one who was a tee-totaller, drank of it. When Dyer called next morning, Lane denied having written the board; at that time I was not at work at the building, but at my master's yard; in the evening be accused me of having done this act, and discharged me; next morning I went to Elm-cottage to inquire about it; Lane gave me a breakfast, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280184"/>
               <p>said he had seen Mr. Dyer, and made it all right, that he had agreed to pay him back on Saturday or Monday; consequently I stopped at the building till two o'clock; on my road home I met Mrs. Dyer, who asscused me of this and asked if I had any objection to be given in charge; I said, "Not the slightest;" a policeman was sent for, and I was taken before a Magistrate—Dyer called at Elm-cottage, to ask Lane whether he did write this board or not, and to come to the Magistrate; he said he would not go without a policeman; Dyer obtained one, and on his return found the garden-gate locked, and Lane spoke from the inside; the consequence was they were obliged to come away without him; the Magistrate directed him to be fetched to Bow next morning, but on the policeman going, he found the gate locked, and Lane said he would not come forward without a written order; one was obtained, and he was taken to Ilford on Saturday, where he stated that he did not write the order.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 31.) On Friend the 4th of February, the day that the king of Prussia was about to embark from Woolwich I was sent by the commissioners down to Woolwich in plain clothes—I was at the Bell public-house, at the Water-gate, at Woolwich, about four o'clock in the afternoon—I went up stairs in search of a person, and took hold of the handle of the first door I came to on the right hand side of the stair-case as I went up—it was closed—I observed two persons standing on the landing to the left of that door—I knew them both by sight—neither of them was the prisoner—one of them said something to me—I partly opened the door, and saw a bed to the right—I was in the act of pulling the door to again, when one of the persons made the observation to me, saying he had made a mistake—I then went into the public room directly opposite the bed-room—I merely looked round—I had to close the door after me to do so, to see who was there, as the door opened into the middle of the room—I then came out again—on again coming to the landing there were no persons standing at the bed-room door—the two men I had before seen, appeared to me to be coming into the refreshment-room—in consequence of suspicions I entertained I went and gave infor<lb/>mation to the landlord, who went up stairs—one of the men I had seen came down stairs and went out—I then heard the cry of "Thieves," and something else—I could not catch the other word—upon that I gave infor<lb/>mation to a constable outside to go into the house while I went after the person who went out—I followed the man I had seen come out, and took him into custody, also two others, but I afterwards found I was mistaken in one, and he was let go at the station-house—he was a respectable man living in Woolwich-upon the person of the man that I saw go down stairs was found a gold watch-chain, key, and some money, but having no reference to this case-after being taken before a Magistrate he was dis<lb/>charged, and the other two as well—one was permitted to go on his own recognizance.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Bell public-house at the Water-gate, Woolwich. On Friday afternoon, the 4th of February, about four o'clock, I received information from Goff, in consequence of which I went up stairs to my bed-room door, which is on the right-hand side, and about three steps from the top—it was open—I met the prisoner at the door, coming out of the room—I had locked the door two hours before—the plate was kept there, but the spoons in the knife-case were moved by my wife—when I last saw them safe, they were in the knife-case in the bed-room—there was a chest on a chest of drawers having eight drawers in it—the prisoner was at the door which was half open—I took hold of his collar with each hand, and called "Murder! thieves!"—my wife and servant ran up stairs and took hold of the prisoner—a man's arm then came out of the room—I did not see the man, because the door was on the jar—he came and hit me in the mouth, and tried to knock me down stairs—that was when my wife was coming upstairs before she got up—he hit me on the chin—it did not hurt me (after I had locked the bed-room door I gave the key to my wife) my wife and the servant-maid scuffled with the prisoner—one took hold of one collar, and the other of the other—I went into the bed-room and found all the things pulled off the bedstead on to the floor, bed and all, and all the drawers open but two—I missed my watches, which I had seen in the drawers that day or the day before—we had twenty-two spoons—we found five of them again—a man picked them up on the stairs and brought them to me—I missed two pairs of sugar-tongs, fifteen tea-spoons, a pair of salt<lb/>spoons, an old guinea, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, and several pieces of old coin, but I do not know what—I produced the five table-spoons before the jus<lb/>tice—the moment I got to the room-door and found the door open, I found the prisoner coming out—the drawers were all unlocked but two, and I could not lock them again with the key—they had been picked—these five spoons now produced are five of the spoons which were in my bed-room that afternoon.</p>

I am the prosecutor's wife—I remember my husband going up stairs on Friday, the 4th of February—shortly after that I heard a cry of "Thieves, murder"—I immediately went up stairs, followed by Ann Hayley, a young woman in our employment—she passed me on the stairs—I found my husband wrestling with the prisoner—Ann Hayley caught hold of the prisoner with myself—my husband, after giving him up to us, went into the bed-room—I was on the right-hand side of the prisoner—in struggling with him, I heard the sound of silver, or something broken—I could not discern which it was in the dark—it fell from his person—there was nobody else near enough for it to have fallen from—these five silver spoons are my husband's—we have had them four years—my husband had given me the key of the bed-room between ten and eleven o'clock in the day, at which time I put these spoons away between the bed and the mattrass—there is a dent in the bowl of one by which I know it—we lost a pair of salt-spoons, fifteen tea-spoons, and three watches—the spoons were in two separate drawers—two watches were in one drawer, and one in another—we lost seventeen spoons besides these, these five make up the twenty-two—the watches are worth 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a seal, a watch-key, and silver buckle were lost, also a coin, a guinea, a crown-piece, several half<lb/>crowns, and some fourpenny-pieces.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say the noise you heard in the struggle re<lb/>sembled something falling or breaking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it sounded something like silver—I did not see anything fall—I had hold of him on the right<lb/>hand side by the collar—Hayley had hold of the collar as well, as far as I know, my husband was looking for what he had lost—there were seve<lb/>ral people in the house—the prisoner was taken into custody—he did not get out of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of the prosecutor. About four o'clock on Friday afternoon, I heard my master call out from up-stairs—I immediately ran up and saw the prisoner come out of the bed-room—my master was in the bed-room at that time—I caught the prisoner by the collar as he was rushing down stairs—my mistress was with me—she did the same by the other side of his collar—the bed-room door is two Stairs down from a large landing which goes from the bed-room to the refreshment-room—you get to the bed-room before you get to the top of the landing—the prisoner was on the stairs when I got up—I saw him come out of the threshold of the bed-room door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you did not see him come out of the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did—we struggled down stairs with him—he was very resolute—further assist<lb/>ance came, and in the struggle I suppose the spoons fell—I did not see them drop—I heard them fell on the stairs—there was nobody near enough for them to have fallen from but the prisoner—the prisoner, my mistress and me, were the only persons on the stairs at the time—I am positive the spoons fell where we were struggling together—these are the spoons—I can identify this one that is dented.</p>

On Friday afternoon the 4th of February, about four o'clock, I was in the Bell public-house—I heard the cry and ran up stairs, and about four stairs up I found the prisoner running down stairs, and cries of "Murder, thieves, thieves!"—he had got away from the women—I laid hold of him by the hair of his head—I am sure he is the man—he said, "Let me go," and made a blow at me—I heard a sound on the stairs, but saw nothing fall.</p>

I was at the Bell public-house on Friday, the 4th of February, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, and heard cries of "Thieves" and "Murder"—I went up two or three stairs, and saw Portman there—he was before me, and had hold of the prisoner by the hair of his head—I took hold of him, and saw some spoons fall, some table-spoons, I suppose—I should consider they fell from the prisoner—there was nobody near enough from whom they could have fallen but the prisoner—I brought him down, and delivered him to the policeman, and I got a knock over the left eye into the bargain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener to Ann Redpath—we have an out-house at the bottom of the garden, which adjoins the house—the door of the house opens into the garden—there is a fence round the garden, part pales and part quickset, which separates it from the road—the dwelling house is inside the fence, and the out-house also—the out-house was locked with a padlock—on Sunday afternoon, the 20th of February, I found the prisoner at the station—he had a hamper containing seven ropes of onions belonging to my mistress, also a hat of my own, which I had locked up in the tool-house, close by the out-house, about six o'clock on Saturday night—I locked the tool-house up and left in it three ropes of onions and the hat—the hamper and four other ropes of onions were in an open shed—I went to the tool-house on Sunday morning, the 20th of February, after seven o'clock, and missed the property—I gave information to the police, and afterwards saw the property at the station—the tool-house was broker open, and the straw thrown out of the hamper—I can swear to the hat now produced, and know my own tying of the onions—I have no doubt they are my mistress's property—I cannot swear to the hamper, but it is similar to the one I lost—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoner at the corner of Connor-row, High-street, Woolwich, about eight o'clock on the Saturday evening, with a hamper on his shoulder—I asked what he had got there—he said, onions—I asked where he got them from—he said he bought them for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of a man on the other side Plumstead, with a horse and cart, and he was going to Woolwich-market to sell them—there is a mar<lb/>ket there on Saturday night—I said I did not believe him, and he must go with me to the station—I found he had a hat over his own—he had two hats on—I asked where he got the two hats from, and nine apples which were in his pocket—he said he had the apples from the man he had the onions from, that the hat was a covering, not a hat, and that it was his own—I took him to the station, and fetched Nicholls—I produce the property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a driver in the Royal Artillery. At a quarter before eleven o'clock on the evening of the 17th of February, I was in the tap-room of the King's Arm's public-house at Woolwich—the prisoner and five or six others were there—I pulled my purse out to pay for a pot of beer—I had then five halfcrowns and a sixpence, and enough halfpence to pay for the beer—in getting the halfpence out, the silver ran out into my hand, and the prisoner saw it—I put it into my purse, which I put into my pocket—I did not button the three lower buttons of my jacket—I then put my head on the table, and turned to speak to another young woman—the prisoner came to me—I found her hand in my pocket—I caught hold of her with the purse in her hand—she would not let it go—the was not drunk, nor was I—I had not been playing with her.</p>

I am foreman in the service of John Tosswill and hit brother, who are in partnership as tanners and hair-merchants, in the Neckinger-road, in the Borough, in the parish of Bermondsey. On Thursday, the 20th of January, the prisoner Dudgeon came to our premises—I was then at work by the side of the horse-hair factory—he asked who the curlers of the horse-hair were—I did not satisfy him—he said he was in the line, and had come to seek employment—he walked round the place, and had an opportunity of seeing the premises—I did not give him employment—I secured the premises about nine o'clock on Friday night—the prosecutors' house does not join the shed—there are tan-pits, a warehouse, the room where the horse-hair is kept, and other outbuildings—the front of the house faces Neckinger-road—it is surrounded by a brick wall, with iron palisades—Horney-lane runs up from Neckinger-road, and the wall goes round that lane, and surrounds the warehouse with the iron fence, and from the iron fence it is all wall—there is a doorway, which is kept locked—it is one continued fence, inclosing the house and the shed within it—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a correct description of it—at five in the evening I secured the warehouse where the horse-hair was, and took the key home with me as usual—I came to the premises at eight next morning, and found the house-hair-warehouse door broken open—the lock had been wrenched—I went in and found three bags of horse-hair gone—it had beep in bacon wrapper bags, which contained about 3 1/2 cwt. of foreign horse-hair, worth 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb.—it was un manufactured, and is never sold in that state—it</p>

I have been in Platt's service, and was so on Saturday morning, the 22nd of January—between half-past eight and nine that morning, I saw a sample of raw hair on the counter—it was before nine—Platt asked me if I could tell the value of it—I said I considered it was worth from 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb.—he went out with the sample, and was gone about ten minutes—after he returned, and, I think, before nine o'clock; Dudgeon came—master and him had some conversation—Dudgeon then went away, and came back about a quarter or half-past nine, with a truck containing three bags in bacon wrappers—they were full—Poarch was at the door with the truck and the bags—he took away the truck, and the bags were shot out on the pavement, and taken into the shop and weighed—I saw Dudgeon receive 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he gave a bill and receipt for it in the name of Bailey—the last bag remained in the scale—it all remained in the shop until it was moved into a donkey cart, and left master's premises in the donkey cart, not later than ten o'clock at the very outside—master went with it—Dudgeon came again about quarter of an hour after the donkey cart had gone away—the bags were weighed, they weighed nearly 14lbs., and then they were taken away into the back parlour—the hair was not shot at mas<lb/>ter's, it went away in the bags in the donkey cart, but master returned with the empty bags, and then they were put in the bark parlour—they were weighed with the hair in the first instance—when Dudgeon came, there was a dispute between him and Platt about the value of the bags, and it was decided that they should be cut up—I and Platt cut them up—they were of less value after being cut up—they were afterwards taken away by platt and another who I do not know—I do not know where they went to—they were cut into five or six parts.</p>

On the night of the 27th of February, about twelve o'clock, I was leaving a house in Ewer-street; I stood at the door and saw a female talking to the prosecutor in a very improper manner, because he would not go up the street with her—the prosecutor walked on towards the house, and the female stopped him against the door and began talking to him again—I heard her say some<lb/>thing very improper—he said no, he would be d—d if he would—he was going from her—she said something about she would make somebody—I saw three young men standing at the corner of a court or gateway, and heard one of them say "She cannot get him in;" and when the prose<lb/>cutor was leaving her, the three ran up the street—I saw one of them strike him—I called to my husband, "Come, here is a man will be killed"—we went up the street; the prosecutor and the prisoner were fighting as it were, and the other two struck him a blow—my husband tried to get the prisoner away—I hallooed "Police;" and one of them came up to me and said, "If you do not hold your tongue calling Police, I will kill you"—I ran to the top of the street, and called "Police" again; the police came down—I said several times that the prosecutor's hat was taken into the house, she was endeavouring to get him in too, calling watch; and it was at last thrown out of the door or window—he kept hallooing out, "My watch, my watch, mind my watch"—the female and the other two men ran away when the policeman ran down the street.</p>

On the 27th of Feb<lb/>ruary, between twelve and one o'clock, I heard the cry of "Police" in Ewer-street; I went up, and saw the prisoner holding the prosecutor's coat, and both struggling together—the prisoner was beating the prosecutor with his fist—there was several others about him—as soon as I made my appear<lb/>ance they ran away—I knew the men who were about the prisoner by sight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the B division of police. On the morning of the 17th of February, the four male prisoners were locked up in the cell at Queen-square office, and the two female prisoners brought refreshments to the four male prisoners—I desired two constables to take the two women to the station, and I followed in the rear—they gave their address as Nos. 10 and 11, New-square, Orchard-street, Westminster—Wells said No. 10—they accosted a girl on their way to the station, whose name I do not know, gave her the keys to open the apartments, and desired her to do something in the apartments—I took that girl into custody also—Wells said she was sister to Brown, and Dudley said Crawley was her brother-in-law—I went with the girl to whom the female prisoners gave the keys, to No. 11, New-square, to the first-floor, front-room—she un<lb/>locked the door with the key which had been given her by Well—I searched that room, and found there a pistol secreted in the mattress—I have since shown the pistol to the prosecutor's servants—I found nothing else there—I went with the same girl to No. 10—she unlocked the door of the first-floor front-room there with the key which Dudley had given her—I found this bead purse in a drawer in that room—I took this silk handkerchief from Wells's neck at the station—at that time I had not heard any thing of Mr. Pigeon's robbery, and I let the female prisoners go—after hearing of this robbery, I caused them to be taken again, on the 22nd—I went to their lodging on the 21st, and they were not there—I</p>

               <p>took from Wells's ears, at the station, these jet ear-rings—I have shown them to Kendall, and she claims them—Wells said she had had them fifteen months in her possession—both the female prisoners admitted lodging at No.7, Mint-street, Borough, on the night of the 21st—I have examined the state of the houses in Mint-street, with reference to Mr. Pigeon's pre<lb/>mises—from what I have observed, a person could go from the houses in Mint-street on to the roof of the distillery, and so in at the window of the knife-room—I did so myself, and saw there were marks on the tiles—I have no doubt a person could open the window of the knife-room by means of the broken pane of glass.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Davis.</hi> I had no refreshment; my friends did not know I was taken up; Harris and I sat by the fire, and we saw neither of the other prisoners till we were brought in before the Magistrate; <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That is not correct—they had to pass by the other prisoners who were waiting to go before the Magistrate—they had opportunities of speaking before, and I have no doubt they did speak together—I heard them do so—I could not distinctly hear what they said, but I heard them speak as they passed—they recognised each other—in going from the street to the office, they had to pass the prisoners Crawley and Brown, and after taking down their names and addresses in the officers' waiting-room, they had to pass them again—there is a room kept entirely for prisoners to wait in before they go before the Magistrate—Crawley and Brown were waiting there, and Harris and Davis when taken, had to pass them to come into the officers' waiting-room—then on the charge being called in against Crawley and Brown, Davis and Harris had to puss them again—they were nearly together in passing—it was quite momentarily—I am quite positive they spoke to each other.</p>

On Tuesday, the 22nd of February, I left home at one o'clock in the day, leaving no one in the house—I locked the door—I am sure, for I tried the latch of the door, and put the key into my pocket—I came back about six in the evening, and found the door had been burst open—the latch that the lock goes into was broken off—I went into the house and missed a handkerchief from a bundle which was at one corner of my bed-room, and contained other things—I missed a jacket, trowsers, and shirt from the dirty linen—I gave an alarm, and went out into the yard—my husband fetched a policeman—I then missed a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of trowsers, three hand kerchiefs, and a petticoat' from a box in the bed-room—they were there when I went out—they were my husband's property—I saw part of them at a clothes-shop in Kent-street, on the Saturday, as I missed them on the Tuesday—(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—this shirt belongs to a young man named George Harvey, whom I wash for—these trowsers and jacket are also his—this handkerchief be<lb/>longs to my husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Davis, the Emery-mills, and live at the Maze, in the Borough. On the morning of the 8th of February I went to my breakfast at half-past eight o'clock—I saw Mr. Rolls' cart standing near Weston-street, near the Rose public-house, and another small cart at the tail of Mr. Rolls' cart, and in the small cart were two rolls of oil-cloth—there was a man in the little cart, who I know by sight, receiv<lb/>ing another roll from Mr. Rolls' cart, and there was another piece in Mr. Rolls' cart which was packed in matting—to the best of my belief the pri<lb/>soner was in Mr. Rolls' cart-after that Mr. Rolls' cart turned up King-street,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280232"/>
               <p>Snow's-fields—the man who was in the little cart followed Mr. Rolls' cart, and stopped directly he got round the corner—Mr. Rolls' cart stopped when it got round the corner, and the other man followed, and put his hand into his pocket as though he was going to give some money—the carts then moved off—Cannon and Lee were with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you not tell Cannon or Lee that you did not believe the prisoner was the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never said any such thing—he was not pointed out to me on Mr. Rolls' premises—I saw him on Wednesday or Thursday—I went down by the wish of Mr. Humble—he did not mention the prisoner's name to me—I first heard his name at Union-hall—Mr. Humble took me to the premises to know whether I could show him the man—I saw fifteen or sixteen persons there—Day was not there—Mr. Humble asked me the description of the man, and I said I believed the prisoner was the man—I saw him three or four minutes on the morning he was in the cart—I was close to him—he did not leave the cart—I saw down as far as his knees—I have talked to the two men that were with me about it—I have not got a little more certain since that conversation.</p>
