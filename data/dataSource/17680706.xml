On the 10th of June I got up to go to my business between four and five o'clock; in walking a little about, hearing a noise in Jackson's-alley, by Covent-garden, I saw two or three women, the prisoner was one of them; she asked me to come in, which I did; she asked me to sit down, I did; she asked me if I would give her a glass of wine; I said I was a working man and could not, I gave her some halfpence; she sent a woman for what she chose, I believe it was gin; I was leaning my arm over a chair; she took hold of my breast and snatched my watch out of my pocket, and gave it to another woman, and held me while the other woman whom she gave it to ran away with it; I said I would not quit the place till I had my property; she made me believe she would soon get it again, and went out to Broker's-alley; I followed her; she went in at a public-house there, and called for liquor and some brandy; two men came and joined her, who followed us from Jackson's alley, so I dared not detect her; we drank the liquor and went out; she made her escape to Chimney-sweeper's-alley, I saw her go into a house; I went to the door and alarmed the people, and told them I hoped they would deliver her up; I sent for a constable, she burst out at the door and fell to beating of me; she tore my clothes and made her escape before the constable came, but we found her and took her before Justice Welch, and she was committed.</p>

               <p>Q. What was you knocked down with?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. I cannot tell whether with a stick or his fist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the boy before?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. No, I described him to the watchman, and told him how I had been used; the boy was taken up a little after, that very night, and carried to the watch-house in Wapping; the next morning he confessed the fact, and said one was a tall man, and the other shorter, in a brown coat; that one went by the name of Jack, and the other Castleton; he said they had desired him to go along with them, and he should have better clothes; that he went with them, and they desired him to come over the way to me as I was going along, and ask what I had got in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no other people going along at that time?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. I saw none.</p>
               <p>Q. from Craycraft. What house did you come out of at that time of the night?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. I came out of Mr. Jackson's house, the ship in Distress.</p>
               <p>Q. from Craycraft. Whether you did not go into any house where were women?</p>
               <p>Nicholson. No, I did not, I only had a pot or two of beer at Jackson's, and changed a nine shilling piece; I had been with a shipmate.</p>

            . I shall be sixteen years of age on the 17th of August next. On Sunday was se'nnight I was at the Black-boy on Saltpetre-bank; I went there with other boys that had been out to pick pockets, one of their names was Terry Tinley; there was Craycraft in that house cursing and swearing, in a lewd woman's company; she was got away, and he swore if he could come at her he would searify her face, so that she should never go into company again; he did not know her name, but I do; the other prisoner sat by Craycraft.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were in the house?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. There were one man and two women, the man was the waiter, and one of the women was the woman of the house's daughter; Craycraft called me Irishman; he said, here Irishman, drink; they had the Saturday before asked me to go with them; as soon as I had drank, Craycraft put his finger up to his nose and looked to the door, signifying I was to go out; I went out and staid at the corner of Blackboy-alley; he went out at the other door and made a noise after the woman, but could not find her; the other prisoner came out also; we all three went down Saltpetre-bank, about half way, a little below Terry Finley's, we met Terry, he asked me where I was going; I said, down the bank; said Craycraft, come along with us; we all four went down together, and went into Blackhorse-yard; there Craycraft told hold of my arm and searched me for money, and the other prisoner searched Terry Finley, but we had not a farthing about us; then Mr. Nicholson came by; said Craycraft, there is a sucking cull, that is, a drunken gentleman, go and ask him what he has got; he had something white in his pocket; I went up to him and said, what is that coming out of your pocket; he said, get away you little bastard; then Craycraft came behind him and knocked him down with his double fist; after he dropped, Craycraft put his hand to his eyes, and Bourn picked his pocket; the man said he had got but two-pence halfpenny in the world; then Craycraft said, hush, you thief, if you offer to speak a word, I'll cut your throat directly; the constable of the night was in the watch-house, which is close by the turning; I crossed the way, and we went up the bank to Mrs. Evans's at the Black Boy; I stood at the door while they went in and had a quartern of gin or aniseed, it cost two pence halfpenny; they had changed a six-pence, and they gave me the three-pence halfpenny; I returned it to Craycraft again; Craycraft told me the thief (meaning the man they robbed) had but a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Terry Finley?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. As soon as Bourn let him go to Craycraft, after he had knocked the man down, Terry ran away; we went after this towards Tower-hill, and met a sailor, and robbed him; after that we came to the watch house, near where we robbed Nicholson; Craycraft put his head into the watch-house, and said, d - n you, blast you all together; when he was at a little distance he said, if they were to come after him he would cut their throats directly; Nicholson was in the watch-house; seeing me, he said, there is the lad; I said I will not run away; the two prisoners ran away, and they took me into the watch-house. The next day they brought me to the bench of Justices in Whitechapel; I confessed the fact and had my liberty, and was sitting in the constable's house;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060012"/> last Monday se'nnight I saw the two prisoners go by, both their hats were flapped; I said there are the two men; I had told the constable one of them had a black patch on the left side his check, which he had when taken; there were two men singing ballads in the street; the two prisoners stopped and stood talking to two sailors; Mrs. Chapman sent for her husband, he came and took them.</p>
               <p>Q. from Craycraft. Whether you are hired, or had the clothes you have on to tell this story?</p>
               <p>Suilivan. I had not a shirt to my back, I was full of vermin; these clothes I have on were then in pawn, and they were got out for me; I worked very hard for this coat, but as for the money that bought the shirt and waistcoat, it was not got honestly.</p>
               <p>Q. from Craycraft. Whether the constable is not to put you apprentice.</p>
               <p>Sullivan. No, the Justices said to the constable, mind after this thing is over, do you take care of this boy, as he says he has friends in his own country, send him over to them, they live at Waterford in Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you followed picking of pockets?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. I have followed it about two or three months; I have been almost six years from my own country.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to St. John's; Wapping; last Sunday night was a week about a quarter before twelve, I was at the watch-house door; I saw two men and this lad come down from Saltpetre bank; then I went to the chair; one of them came to the watch-house and said, d - n you, blast your eyes all together; the lad said some bad word to that purpose; then I spoke to one of the watchmen to come along with me, thinking they were going about some bad work; we went down a thoroughfare into Nightingale-lane, and stood at a corner about ten minutes; hearing no disturbance at all we returned to the watch-house; I laid my arm upon the watch-house door, up came the lad and the two prisoners; the lad crossed the way and said, indeed, Sir, I did not go to run away, I did not go to do it, crying and whining, as much as to say he was an apprentice to one of them; one of them talked to him as though he was his master, but I cannot be positive as to the words; then they went up Saltpetre-bank; I said to the watchmen, these people have done something amiss, this was just as the watch was going out twelve; about five minutes after this, one of the watchmen found the prosecutor and brought him in; we asked him what was the matter; he told me he had been robbed; then I took two of my watchmen and went, and searched every corner about Saltpetre-bank, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060013"/> found nobody; then I went round Well-street and to the watch-house again, then to Nightingale-lane; coming back, one of the watchmen came running to me, and said the man has got the lad, that was one that robbed him; then I went and found him in the watch-house, and was told the other two were run away; I put the lad in the dark hole behind; I asked him some questions, he seemed to deny it at first; then I took him to the cage and locked him up about three. The next morning about eight or nine I took him out, and had him examined before the bench of Justices; he said one of the two men was named Cassady, that the tall one which is Craycraft, had a black patch on his left cheek, and the other went by the name of Jack.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sullivan. Do you remember what was said as you went by the watch-house after the robbery?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. I did sham a cry, and talk as if one of them was my master, that they should not mistrust us.</p>
               <p>Chambers. Then I had a warrant to apprehend them; the lad said he never had been concerned with them before; he told the Justices how the robbery was committed, that the two prisoners stood at a corner, and they said to him, there is a sucking call, go to him; that he went up to Nicholson and asked him what he had in his pocket, and that the tall man came behind him and knocked him down, and put his hand upon his eyes, and said if he spoke he would cut his throat; that Nicholson said, for God's sake, spare my life, take my money, and something about his saying he had but two-pence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was the boy taken?</p>
               <p>Chambers. I believe he was taken a little after one o'clock; I took the two prisoners the same day, being Monday; there were two men singing ballads about Wilkes; the lad was then in my kitchen; he saw the prisoners go by, he told my wife they were the men; my wife sent my apprentice for me, I had a cutlace under my coat; the lad had told me they were blood-thirsty men, and desired me not to go unarmed; I went, they were talking to some paviours and two other people; I with assistance secured them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the lad tell you any thing of another lad being with them?</p>
               <p>Chambers. He did, he said his name was Terry Finley of about twelve years of age, but he ran away when the man was knocked down; that lad follows picking of pockets; I do believe Craycraft was the man that looked into the watch-house and said, d - n you, blast you all together; they had the same coloured clothes on as now; one wore lighter clothes than the other, with flapped hats; I took particular notice of the boy, I can swear to him in particular.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you live when you were together?</p>
               <p>P. Ewen. A very unhappy life, he was a very bad husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend him to be in his senses?</p>
               <p>P. Ewen. I did, as much as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make proposals that time to you that he might come and live with you?</p>
               <p>P. Ewen. He did, and I told him I would sooner beg my bread.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you imagine he had made away with himself?</p>
               <p>P. Ewen. Because he must imagine justice would overtake him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall when he shot you?</p>
               <p>P. Ewen. No, I was supported by two persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he never out of his senses while he lived with you?</p>

            . I lodge in the house, I was in my own apartment, I heard a great cry of murder, I thought there were thieves below murdering the people, and if I go down they will murder me; I listened at the window, and heard Mr. Blake's voice, which I knew very well, I was at his wedding at Kensington; I hearing the maid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060015"/> cry murder in the garden, I went to the window; just as I got to the window I heard a pistol go off, I saw Mrs. Ewen's hair and cap all on fire; she cried, hold me, hold me, I am a dead woman, that wretch (or that poor creature) has murdered me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who fired the pistol?</p>
               <p>E. Freeman. I am sure it was the prisoner that fired it; I went down into the entry, she met me, and said, O Mrs. Freeman, he has shot me, he has shot me! I said, God forbid; she said, the bullet is in me, send for a doctor; I saw blood running down her neck: after this I heard another pistol go off in the garden.</p>
               <p>P. Ewen. It was not this gentlewoman that saw the prisoner fly from the window, she is gone into Essex, that was she that said she saw the pistol come out of his pocket; as soon as she heard he was coming out of the hospital she was in great terror, and would not stay.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>She came to my lodgings about three or four days before this happened; I asked her for a few things that were planted in the garden; she said I should have none; I desired to have a few of some that were mine when I married her; she would not let me; I made over some houshold goods to her, and have not had them to this moment; I also made over some houses to her, one at Hyde park-corner, and another at Knights-bridge, and the house she lives in; she has a silver punch ladle that was mine.</p>
               <p>P. Ewen. These were my houses before I was married to him, the ladle was bought with my money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not think of any such thing as firing a pistol; I went there and sat down, and asked for a little small beer; she would not give me any; I asked for a little water; she denied it me, and said she would turn me out of the house; I said I would not go out till she turned me out; I said, will you be friends with me; she said she would; I went to buss her, and going to put my mouth to her she snatched her head away, and the pistol went off accidentally; as for another pistol, I had never another about me; when she cried out, she was killed, I was so frightened that I did not know what I did; I intended to make away with myself, if she would not let me be with her, that was the reason I carried a pistol; when I married to her, the other woman was parted from me 26 or 27 years, and had married another man.</p>
               <p>The record of his trial and conviction for bigamy was read in court, and also his receiving his punishment for the same.</p>

               <p>Campbell. I had, she was sitting at her own door, and I went into the house with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been drinking that afternoon?</p>
               <p>Campbell. Why with company that I met with, I had been drinking a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what past?</p>
               <p>Campbell. There was a good deal past between me and her, I was not so stupid in liquor but I remember what she did; she took away my purse and four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What room did she carry you into?</p>
               <p>Campbell. The ground floor in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. What money had you in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Campbell. I had eight guineas and a half in my purse, she took four guineas of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you the rest again?</p>
               <p>Campbell. She dropped it on the floor, and went out to an alehouse opposite where she lives.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you discovered she had robbed you?</p>
               <p>Campbell. I soon discovered it, I went after her immediately, and charged her; she pretended she had given the money to another, and she would endeavour to find it out; she left me there, and ran away; I took her up, the next day I got a constable, and searched all over for money; she denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times had you visited this lady before?</p>
               <p>Campbell. I never was in her house but once before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of your going there the first time?</p>
               <p>Campbell. She pretended she knew me, I having been in the army last was she called me serjeant, so upon the account of that, and the effect of liquor, I went to see her again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you have not lost your money somewhere else.</p>
               <p>Campbell. I am quite sure that I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take the four guineas out of the purse.</p>
               <p>Campbell. I saw her working about it.</p>

               <p>The Tuesday before that the prosecutor came and gave me a quartern of gin, a pint of twopenny, and a shilling; after that he came again, and desired me to go to the Boot in Cross-lane to drink some hot; there he went with another woman, I never had a farthing of his money; that evidence once swore me a bawdy-house keeper, and kept me in Newgate six weeks out of spite.</p>

            . On the 18th of June I happened to be in liquor; I picked the prisoner up, I do not know the place she took me to; I met with her in Cheapside; I know my money was safe in a canvas bag, buttoned in my pocket, the same as laid in the indictment (mentioning the separate pieces) as we walked together talking of things in our way; I believe I had not been in her company above half an hour, it may be not a quarter of an hour, before my purse and money were gone; I told her she had taken it, she denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. What house had you been in?</p>
               <p>Slogden. We had been in no house, I told her if she would return it, I would give her half a guinea, and let all drop; she still denied it; I took her down to the corner of the street, I was so much in liquor I do not know the street; upon that a watchman that heard the dispute between us came, I told him I had lost my money; he walked back with me to the place in the street where I missed it; we took her with us, we could not find it; I then charged the watch with her, they sent for a woman to search her in the watch-house; the woman found the money and purse upon her; she kicked and scratched a good deal, and was very unwilling to be searched, it was not in her apparel.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had she concealed it?</p>
               <p>Slogden. It was found in her body, the bag and money was all turned out in the watch-house; then the prisoner did not deny taking it.</p>

            . I was twelve years of age the 20th of last month; I live with my father and mother in Windsor-street, Spitalfields; the prisoner is my father's brother-in-law, he married my mother's sister, and lives in Catherine-wheel-alley, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your aunt alive?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. She is; I went up to his house and asked for a bit of bread, he gave me a bit; then he shut the door and pushed me down on the bed, nobody was there but he and I; I asked him why he shut the door; he said nothing; I asked him to let me go, because I had been playing by the way going to school, and it was then past one o'clock; after he got up I did, and went home; I did not go to him for some time after; when I went again he served me the same as before.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he serve you?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. He put his hand up my coats.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is the first time ago?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. That is three quarters of a year ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. Because I told the quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. How?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. With chalk in my own room on a piece of board.</p>
               <p>Q. How many quarters are there in a year?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. Nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know to set the second chalk up?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. I asked my mamma when the quarter was, and she told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any thing on the bed to you?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. Yes, he made me wet on my private parts and on my shift; he said if ever I divulged it, or told it to any body, how he would serve me; the next time I sat in a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. He put his impudence into my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your aunt?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. She was gone out with old clothes; the last time was three weeks ago from this time.</p>
               <p>Q. What month was it?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has there been a difference between your mother and him?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. My mother has not spoke to him since yesterday was a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this all he has done to you?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. Yes, this is all.</p>
               <p>Q. How came your mother to know any thing about it?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. That was because I could not walk nor sit in a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. When did your mother find it out?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. She found it out yesterday was a week; he has given me a disorder, my mother and the doctor say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he done any thing to your body?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. With what?</p>
               <p>E. Watson. With his finger the first time, and a great many times after; that was the time he made my linen so wet, I was afraid to tell my mother.</p>

            .

               <p>Q. Did you look at her?</p>
               <p>M. Watson. No, I did not indeed; my sister came and was kind enough to send for a quartern of gin; when my husband came home I said, I am afraid something is the matter with your daughter, and told him what I suspected; my brother the prisoner came in, he was three halfpence and I the same, and we had a quartern of gin between us four; I said to the girl, now if you do not tell me who has been meddling with you, I'll cut you to pieces; her uncle took the whip and looked severe at her; she said, mother, I will tell you the truth, it is my uncle; I clapped my hands together and made bold to call her b - h; I said what uncle; she said that uncle, there he stands; I let fly with great vengeance, and asked him how he could be guilty to lie with that child; he went up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060020"/> to her and said, you wicked hussey, what do you mean by that, do you mean to take my life; she said, you may say what you will, for you are the man; he made great wishes that he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. was the prisoner ever searched to see what condition he was in?</p>
               <p>M. Watson. No, he never was.</p>
               <p>Q. How does he live with his wife?</p>
               <p>M. Watson. As well as other people, they jar sometimes as the best of people do; I never heard no harm of him, he is a working man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went in at her mother's, there was another woman drinking a dram; they said, brother, will you drink, my wife was there, (the father and mother have both had the misfortune to have the soul disease between them;) said the mother, what do you think, my daughter has got so and so; then said she, we are all alike; there lay the horsewhip on the floor; said I, if she has got that distemper I would take the horse-whip and whip all the skin from her bones; the girl sat a little while and said, uncle, if I must tell you, you gave it me; she lay along with her father and mother every night; had it been as she said so long ago, must they not have found it out; there is a boy of about eighteen years of age lives in a room above them, and whenever the mother stirs out they are together; the mother has catched him on the stairs with her, and licked him for it; I have told her mother several times the girl would be ruined.</p>

               <p>Green. Before this Justice Hodgson had these men under his direction; the circumstance of their first proceeding was, they were under a set of people called <rs id="t17680706-46-deflabel247" type="occupation">coal-undertakers</rs>

               <p>Q. Do you speak this from your own knowledge?</p>
               <p>Green. I do, I shall mention nothing but what I know of myself, I was in the denomination of an undertaker myself; the coal-heavers wanted sixteen-pence a score, the undertakers would not give it; they kept off from work three or four days, then the undertakers were willing to give it; after that the coal-heavers would have eighteen-pence a score, then in a day or two they would have nothing to do with the undertakers, but would have it under the act of parliament.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago since this disturbance began?</p>
               <p>Green. I think it began about the month of February last, several of the coal-heavers applied to me; then I got a recommendation to the Alderman, I was represented as a proper person, that I was in some degree master of it; upon which the Alderman sent me to Mr. Russel; in that time Justice Hodgson had taken them under his management: then Mr. Russel and I went down to Justice Hodgson, Mr. Russel made him acquainted that he was appointed agent by Mr. Alderman Beckford; they went into a room together, what discourse they had I cannot say; then Mr. Russel and I came home to my house, and to see for the most convenient place for an office for these men; it was our opinion Justice Hodgson's office was at too great a distance from the water-side; Mr. Russel naturally expected Mr. Hodgson would direct these people to him, as we let him know we had fixed upon an office at Billingsgate; the next day no coal-heavers came to be registered.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Green. I really cannot tell the day of the month, I believe it might be about the beginning of March; Mr. Russel then sent me down among these men, to let them know he was ready to register them at the office at Billingsgate, or any place where they should appoint; I went down and told them, several of them told me they had no objection to Alderman Beckford's appointment, but as they were under the direction of Justice Hodgson, they understood he was the Alderman's agent, and they would be directed by Justice Hodgson; then I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060023"/> sent to Justice Hodgson by Mr. Russel with this complaint, to tell him Mr. Russel would give him a meeting at his house, or in Whitechapel, at the Angel, to consult to bring these men over, that there should be no mischief done. Mr. Hodgson said he had no objection to it, he could not conveniently come, but would send his clerk; but said I have this to tell you, if he does not desist, he will meet with trouble, and I will give him a pretty dance to Westminster-hall, for the act of parliament is in so vague a manner any body may keep an office; it is just like one publican keeping a pot of beer better than another, and as we have the best men at our office we need not fear we shall have the business?</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Hodgson any deputy?</p>
               <p>Green. Yes, he had one Dunster, who had served him as clerk before, I have seen him in the Justice's office, giving receipts for ships loaded with coals, and likewise taking down the obligation for that payment, when the ship should be set to work; I have seen Dunster walking the streets with no less than 300 or 400 of these men.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Green. That was two or three days after that; then Mr. Russel advertised in the paper for men to come, still none of them came; then he advertised for them to come by such a time, or he would employ such able bodied men as chose to come; then many did come, and they were put in the gangs: this Dunster saw me doing this at Billingsgate, and he brought to my door I believe no less than 3 or 400 of these men; a great many of them threatened they would pull my house down; they said I had better be quiet, or they would do for me; this was one evening, between six and seven o'clock; they went away, some howling, some hallooing, and some pointing to me; I said, what I am doing is nothing at all; Mr. Alderman Beckford has appointed one, and I am accountable to Mr. Russel for what I shall do, and he will not suffer any mean thing to be done; Dunster was at the head of them; when they first came they did no mischief that time, several of them came back to the window (when it was coming dark) howling, saying they would have my life, and they would have my house down.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these?</p>
               <p>Green. They were coal-heavers, I knew a great many of them, my wife and family were very much terrified; I did not imagine but that they would act as they have; I had no arms in my house, only a brace of pistols; I loaded them, then I went to the Mansion-house to my Lord Mayor, in order to let him know the danger I was in; I did not see his Lordship, but I saw a gentleman that went to him; he said he could be of no service to me, and directed me to go to some magistrate thereabouts; they assembled four or five times before ever they attacked me.</p>
               <p>Court. Drop all that happened from this time to Saturday the 16th of April.</p>
               <p>Green. On that Saturday morning these men had put up some bills, a neighbour's servant went and pulled down one; the coal-heavers cried out, Green's maid has pulled down one of our bills; the girl ran over to her master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purport of the bills?</p>
               <p>Green. The purport was, that the advertisement was a libel upon Mr. Alderman Beckford, and that what was done was Mr. Russel's own doing; then directly they came running from different parts of Wapping-wall, and other parts, to my door; in less than fifteen minutes time I believe there might be upwards of an hundred at my door.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Green. It might be about nine in the morning, I asked them what they wanted with me; they cried, by Jesus they would have my life if I offered to meddle with any of their bills; I said I had not meddled with any, nor none had that belonged to me; one of them cried, by Jesus he shall have a bill put up at his own window; he took up a handful of dirt, and put it upon the window, and put the bill upon it; another of them laid hold of my collar, and dragged me off the step of my door; another said, haul him into the river; said another, by Jesus we will drown him; I got from them, and retreated back into my house; I then said, gentlemen, you had better go about your business, for you may bring yourselves into trouble, one way or other; it is very hard people cannot be at quiet in their business, for such a pack of abandoned rascals as you; after that I went to Billingsgate, and met several of them there; there they threatened they would have my life, it was my business to go there on my duty; when I came home it might be between four and five in the evening; I think in about an hour after that I saw a great many of these people running from their different habitations, some with bludgeons or broomsticks, and weapons of that sort; they did not collect themselves in a body, but were running to the head of New Gravel-lane, I believe about 4 or 500 of them came within 200 yards of my house; they went to Mr. Metcalp, a neighbour of mine, and threatened him; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060024"/> was one of them that was a pretended friend of mine, that had promised, when he knew of any thing against me, he would let me know, that I might get my wife and children out of the way, and be upon my guard; he came to my house with a great bludgeon; he said, if it had not been for me your house had been attacked some time before; I said, I see they are assembling, I hope you will not deceive me, but let me know if they mean to use me ill; he said he would be with me, and let me know before he slept; he said he be lieved they were going to get some man out of goal or spunging-house; I set up to guard my house, and I sent my wife and children out of the house; after that I prevailed upon my wife to stay in the house upon this man's intelligence; he came about twelve, and told me nothing was intended against me, that they had done their business they were about; I went to bed, and was asleep; I was awaked by my sister-in-law, calling, Mr. Green, Mr. Green, for God's sake, we shall be murdered, this was about one o'clock on the Sunday morning; I jumped out of bed, and ran into the next room where my arms were; I took and levelled one, and said, you rascals, if you do not be gone I will shoot you; they were then driving at my door and shutters, the noise was terrible, like a parcel of men working upon a ship's bottom, I could compare it to nothing else; I fired among them, I believe I fired about fourteen times, and when I had not any thing ready to fire, I throwed glass bottles upon them; they were at this about a quarter of an hour, when they all dispersed; they went away howling, as their manner is; I went down stairs, and found a pannel of my door broke, and two pannels of my parlour-window shutters broke, and I think five pannels of the different window-shutters of my tap room; this was the lower part of the house; I think below stairs and above there were twenty-five panes of glass broke, the sash over the door, the frame of it, was broke; they cried out, when I fired first (which was only powder) d - n you, Green, where is your powder and ball; I fired that morning only bird and swan shot, no ball.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen on the Sunday?</p>
               <p>Green. No, not in particular; I saw a flash of a pistol among the rioters, but it did not go off.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance might that flash be?</p>
               <p>Green. It might be about twenty or thirty feet from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was you in?</p>
               <p>Green. I was in my dining room in the front up one pair of stairs, the stones came in as thick as hail; I stood behind things as well as I could, to keep myself clear of them, from being knocked on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of them might there be?</p>
               <p>Green. It was dark, I cannot form any judgment of the number: on the Monday I went to Billingsgate about eleven, I saw several of them there; they threatened me there, I saw Dunster there; they told me they would do for me if I did not desist in my proceedings, that was to register such people as applied; there were always some of the coal-heavers about Dunster, he talked of the advertisement that had been in the paper, and said they were mine; for he said Mr. Russel had told him he totally declined having any thing to say in it, and it was my doings only; I said, do not deceive these men, that is very wrong of you; I asked him, if Mr. Russel did not tell him he would advertise to this effect; I began to be afraid, as many of them came about me, I left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the prisoners ever threaten you?</p>
               <p>Green. I cannot speak to any particular person that did, only the prisoner Cornwall and Flaharty; these two men were at Billingsgate among the others at that time; I knew Flaharty by fight before, he has a mole upon his face; I had seen Cornwall before, I know his person, but not his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of these two men use any threatning words to you at that time?</p>
               <p>Green. Yes, Cornwall did; he held his hand up and shook it, and said I had better be easy or I should be done for; I saw Grainger there, but do not remember he said any thing in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. How many coal-heavers might there be at that time?</p>
               <p>Green. I believe there might be between fifteen and twenty. Nothing happened after that till the Wednesday night, that was the 20th about seven in the evening; then I saw a great many of these coal-heavers assembling together about three, or four hundred yards from my house, going up Gravel-lane; I went into my house again and heard a body of people hurrying; after I had been in about ten minutes, I saw them coming from Wapping-wall, there might be about four hundred of them; they went up Gravel-lane after the others; I heard they had been threatening to burn

He had been an undertaker, and was likewise under Mr. Russel as a clerk; her house was shut up all but the front street door; she said to me, I believe they will be with you by and by, for they threatened you at my door; I came home again, and I think I had not been in my house above eight or ten minutes before my opposite neighbour came and said, for God's sake, Mr. Green, get your house shut up, for they are a coming; I shut up as fast as I could, and told my wife to get out of the house as fast as she could with her children; accordingly she went away with the child that was asleep in the cradle; Gilberthorp was in the house drinking a pint of beer, (I did not know his name then,) said I, brother tar-pawling, (he is a seafaring man) I am afraid I shall have a desperate attack to night from what I have heard, will you stand by me and give me all the assistance you can; yes, said he, that I will; when the house was secured backwards and forwards, I went up stairs, some stones had broke some windows there, I believe some of them had thrown stones and ran away; I heard them call out Wilkes and liberty; I saw the neighbours lighting up candles; I said to my maid, for God's sake, light up candles, for these people shall have no occasion at all to use me ill; I said to Gilberthorp and

               <p>Q. How many candles might be then lighted?</p>
               <p>Green.

             was in the other room upon the same floor backwards, I was in the front room; I don't know where Gilberthorp was at that time, he had left me about two or three minutes before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know now where that gun was fired from?</p>
               <p>Green. No, I do not indeed, it was not fired in my house as I know of; if it was, it was quite contrary to my orders; there was a very great mob assembled about my house; they came round the alley and threw stones into my first and second story windows; I went to the window and begged of them to desist, and said if they knew any thing particular of me, I was willing to resolve any thing they wanted to know; I seeing I could not defend myself, I disguised myself and put on an old watch-coat and a Dutch cap, and went down stairs in order to get a magistrate to come and prevent my house from being pulled down; I had one Dunderdale a shoemaker that lodged in my house, he went down with me; when I came down to the back door I heard them threaten they would have me and have my life; I then found it impossible to get out of the house; I ran up stairs then, fully dermined to defend myself as long as I was able; I spoke to them again in the street from the window, and begged of them to desist from what they were about, and said I could not think why they were acting against me in so violent manner; I desired them to tell me what I had done; they called out in the street they would have me and hang me over my sign-post; others said they would broil and roast me, and words to that effect; stones came up very fast. I used to shelter myself against the wall behind the window, and at different times put my head out and talk to them from the sides of the windows; I saw a pistol fired, but it did not go off, that was about the time I ordered the lights in the second story.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening?</p>
               <p>Green. That I believe might be about half an hour after seven, or very near eight; stones came up very fast, they calling out, d - n you, Green, why don't you fire; others called out, where is your powder and ball; they said they would do for me before morning; stones were coming up quick and fast as they could; I said, I find my good lads, good words nor bad words would not do for you, come have at you; I took a brace of pistols from the table and fired among them, loaded with powder only; I then had recourse to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060026"/> more arms; there was a great noise below of threatening; two or three of the first I fired had only powder; after that I kept firing away among them what arms I had loaded with bird and swan shot; they dispersed in the front then; I immediately ran backwards, they were heaving stones into the back chamber windows; I fired from the back chamber windows; after I had fired some few rounds backwards, they desisted from heaving stones into the back part of the house, but I did not find they had left the place; I stood and listened to hear if I could hear them say any thing backwards, I heard them say the bucks and the brothers would assist them on the back part all the night long; they did not do any thing; I went up to the window and found the alley backwards clear; I sent my servant maid out of the house to see who acted against me, that I might know them the next day; I bid her go to a house opposite the way, to have her eye about to see who she knew; she went over the way and did not come home that night; just after she was gone, I was again attacked both in the front and back part of the house; I fired among them sometimes from the front of my house and sometimes from the rear; I imagined they would have broke into the house presently, if I had not kept a warm fire upon them; I heard them call out several times, I am shot, some, I am wounded; still they said they would have me and do for me; after I had been firing upon them some time, they would go away and be a little easy, and leave off heaving stones; they generally howled when they ran off. I had various attacks in the night; I saw no fire-arms they had till eleven or twelve in the night; they were driving at the door about ten, but I cannot tell with what; I looked through the door and saw their hands moving, driving something hard against it. About twelve they fired into the house both in the front and the rear; the balls struck the cieling in the room where I was, sometimes close over my head, as they were in the street and I in the one pair of stairs, the balls went into the cieling and dropped down on the floor; I could not walk along the room with any safety, I was forced to place myself by the wall between the windows, and sometimes I would crawl under the window to the next, and sometimes I stood behind the brackets; then I would stand up and drive among them like dung; I have seen their balls strike the ceiling as I have stood under the cover of the wall, and as I have been going to fire they have come over my head, and some lodge in the cieling.</p>
               <p>Q. What size balls did they fire?</p>
               <p>Green. They were larger than buck shot, they were what may be called common musket ball; there were none came in at the rear of the house, the alley being narrow they could not stand to fire at distance enough to fire in to hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this firing continue?</p>
               <p>Green. It continued all the night and all the morning at different periods.</p>
               <p>Q. How many balls might there be fired into the room where you was?</p>
               <p>Green. I saw many balls about the room the next morning; I remember I fired four of their balls back again; I never did count the balls; I heard them say at the time of the firing they would have my heart, and they would hang me over my signpost; I could not affect the mob from the back windows, the alley being so narrow, what I fired there went over their heads; when I attacked them backwards, I used to crawl out of the window on my belly, and lie upon the wash-house leads with my arms; I have heard them say, you that have arms are to fire upon him, and you that have stones are to heave, and so many to break the door, and so many to climb the wall; if they got up there they could get in at the window from the leads; I had Gilberthorp below to guard the door, for part of the front door was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since made any observations about how many balls came into your room?</p>
               <p>Green. There is the appearance in the cielings in the first and second stairs, of about 260 shot in the front, that is bullet marks, the ceilings are torn all to pieces; there are several small shot lodged in the window shutters below, they are without number; the pannel of the door that Gilberthorp guarded was broke that night; I got off I believe about nine in the morning, they continued so long firing, the longer the more desperate; they fired from the opposite windows; I saw them firing likewise out of the street door of Axford and Maplan; I could see them come to the door, and hear them say, there he comes, this might be about one or two in the morning; Axford lives at the Swan and Lamb, and Maplan the sign of the Ship; they held a continual rendezvous in the street and in the houses; they would stand in the entry, they would say, now you will have him; then there was firing; the lights of the houses were of service to me, those that discovered them to me, they ordered the people to take their lights down; they shot from the rooms opposite me between six and seven very desperately, and on till towards nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How far are those windows from your windows?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060027"/>Green. I measured the ground, it is about twenty feet, (the mob took possession of these houses as I heard without the people's consent;) about nine I had no more ammunition left, only the charge that I had in my blunderbuss, except what were in the musket that would not go off, so I said to the men that were in the house, you see they are firing from every quarter, there is no help for me, they will come in, and I can make no return upon them to check their insolence; the best way to make them desist is for me to get out of the house, you will all be very safe whether I make my escape or not; Mr. Gilberthorp said, do what you think best; I said, they only want me, if they get me it is all over, or if they know I am gone they will desist; I took my blunderbuss over my arm, and my drawn hanger in my hand, and went out of the back window upon the leads; I saw several of them in the alley, I levelled the blunderbuss at them, and said, you rascals, be gone, or I'll blow your brains out, especially you, (that was to one under me) but I scorn to take your life; he said, God bless you, Mr. Green, you are a brave man; he clapped his hand on his head and ran away; I went over into Mr. Mereton's ship-yard, one of the shipwrights met me; just as I jumped, he said, Mr. Green, follow me; he took me to a saw pit, and shewed me a hole at the end where the sawyers use to put their things; he said, go into that hole, you will be safe enough; said I, don't drop a word but that I am gone over the wall; I got in, he left me; there I lay till the guards came; I heard the mob search for me; some said he is gone one way, some another; they were got into the yard, I heard one of the shipwrights say he is gone over the wall, and gone away by water.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been there before the guards came?</p>
               <p>Green. They came in about half an hour after; then one of the shipwrights came to me and said the guards were come, and desired to know what to do; I did not know what to do, fearing they might shoot me from one of the chamber-windows as I went along; he went and consulted, and said he would take their opinion; after that he came to me and told me it was Mr. Mereton's opinion, it would be best to surrender to the guards; my opinion was to lie there till high water, that it came up to the wharf, then to go and surrender to my Lord Mayor: I was told if I should be found there they would cut me to pieces; then I said, go and tell the officer to draw his men up and come into the yard, and I'll surrender myself to him; the soldiers came, and I came out of the saw-pit; I had nothing but my handkerchief about my head; I had been wounded between ten and eleven at night; I surrendered myself to the officer; Justice Hodgson said, Mr. Green, you are one of the bravest fellows that ever was, who do you intend to go before, me, or Sir

               <p>Green. I believe it was about eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Green. Davis never fired a gun the whole night.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times might Gilberthorp fire?</p>
               <p>Green. I believe he did fire five or six times.</p>

               <p>Green. I cannot take upon me to say whether it was or was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this was it that you saw the flash in the pan of a pistol?</p>
               <p>Green. I saw the flash of a pistol before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you took the resolution to fire among them?</p>
               <p>Green. That might be nine, I cannot justly say, it was after I gave them notice that I would fire several times.</p>
               <p>Q. How many balls might you fire away that night?</p>
               <p>Green. I believe I fired away 108, I fired at every opportunity I had, to keep them from attacking my doors and window-shutters; I told them I would do it, and bid them take care of themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was the pannel of the door broke?</p>
               <p>Green. I think that was broke about ten; sometimes they would cry, d - n the bouger, all his powder and ball is gone; as soon as I discharged my piece, I supposed the door was broke; I ran down stairs, intending to fire out at the hole; I placed myself under the broken pannel, then I saw it would not do for me there; I said to Gilberthorp,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060028"/> do you take them at one side through this broken pannel, so I went up again to guard my house there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they begin to fire?</p>
               <p>Green. I believe they began to fire about twelve o'clock; they flung a number of stones, there are a wheelbarrow full of stones of a heap now that were throwed into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you guess where that ball came from that struck the cieling just over your head, was it from opposite or from one side?</p>
               <p>Green. It seemed to be from rather on one side, it was from out of the street.</p>

               <p>Crabtree. He stood on the opposite side the street, and fired it upon an angle, or aslant, he stood about ten yards from Mr. Green's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing?</p>

               <p>Crabtree. That was about six o'clock; I heard firing before I opened my door, or got out of my bed; I saw Mr. Green fire several times, in order to drive them away, and I saw them attempting to break his door with an ax; there was a gun fired out at the door that did no execution; the second fire from thence I saw wound a man in the cheek; I saw him drop the ax, and run over the way; then he dropped himself.</p>

               <p>Crabtree. I saw him firing slanting, pointing towards Mr. Green's house, as by the levelling of the musket it seemed to be; I do not think he intended to fire up in the air.</p>

               <p>Anderson.

There are three houses between my house and his, I live on the same side the street; I saw Clarey fire several times at Mr. Green's house; he was sometimes by himself, right opposite Mr. Green's house, and sometimes nearer my house; he missed fire about three times, he stood watching for Mr. Green's head coming out at the window, a s I apprehended; at another time I saw him with a cutlace, and another time with a pistol that he pulled out of his pocket, but I did not see him fire it; I heard him say the rogue had shot his brother, and if he could have him out he would hang him on his sign-post; there were many people standing by my house, fearing Mr. Green should fire upon them.</p>

               <p>Clarey. This man is come to swear my life away.</p>
               <p>Cummings. There is no need to wonder at his saying that, he knowing I saw him; on the Wednesday night I saw him throwing stones and brickbats at Mr. Green's window, and I saw Peter Flaharty throwing stones or brickbats in; I saw Cornwall, Lynch, and Murray there on the Wednesday night, all throwing stones and brickbats at Mr. Green's windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of these five there the next morning?</p>
               <p>Cummings. I did, that was the Thursday morning; I saw Flaharty, Clarey, Lynch, Cornwall, and Murray, all on that morning firing at Mr. Green's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention what you saw of each separately.</p>
               <p>Cummings. I saw Clarey fire several times at a very little distance from the house; he fired into the house when he saw Mr. Green coming to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the morning was this?</p>
               <p>Cummings. This might be from near four in the morning till towards seven at times; he pointed his gun up to Mr. Green's window; I saw Murray fire several times at Mr. Green's house; I happened to be down at King James's stairs, and there saw him buy powder and swan shot that same morning a little before six; he bought them of Mr. Potts. I saw him load his piece as he stood cross the way from Mr. Green's with them; I said to the boy that had sold him this powder and shot, sirrah, do you know what you are about; he said, O dear, call him back again; I answered, do you think I want to be killed myself; he came to the corner of Wapping-wall, I followed him; he stood there some time to see if Mr. Green came towards the window; then he went a little farther to Murphy's door; when Mr. Green came towards the window, he called, d - n his eyes, I have him now, and fired his piece at him.</p>

               <p>Cummings. I saw him fire a dozen times after this, all at Mr. Green's house; when Mr. Green came towards the window, Murray would swear and blaspheme all the time; I saw Peter Flaharty fire at Mr. Green on that Thursday morning, between four and five o'clock; whether it was a musket or a fowling-piece I cannot tell; it was a gun, I saw him firing at his house, both forwards and backwards, and I heard him make use of such expressions as are not proper to mention; he said he would have his heart, liver, and lights, and hang them cross his sign-post; I heard Clarey,

               <p>E. Garret. I saw Lynch there, I saw him fire upon Mr. Green between six and seven; he watched Mr. Green's coming to the window, and then fired upon him; then he went round the corner and charged, and then came again, and kneeled upon his knee under the window to fire; I also saw

            . I am a constable of St. George's; I was there over night, and likewise in the morning; we heard there was a disturbance at Mr. Green's house of firing; I went there between ten and eleven; the high constable and I took a walk down, there we saw Mr. Green firing out at his window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any firing in the street then?</p>
               <p>Lecorn. No, there were stones throwing up, who they were that threw them we could not tell. In the morning about seven I came there again, then I saw Cornwall standing over the corpse which was in a shell, with a piece in his hand, and look up at the window divers times, and kept it levelled over the cove of Mr. Green's window; at last he fired, and I heard the shot slap against the window or sign-post; then he said, d - n him, I have done for him. I also saw

               <p>Lecorn.

I saw this rioting both over night and in the morning; I saw Flaharty and Grainger firing in at Mr. Green's window in the morning; they continued firing from the hour of five till seven; I saw Mr. Green look out at his window very often; there were orders given by the mob not to fire till Mr. Green looked out, then to level at him; that was after the man was killed at Mr. Green's door: some man among the rioters said he believed Mr. Green would kill forty, before they should be able to get at him; Flaharty and Grainger both fired after that order once, but I saw them fire more than once each before that order.</p>

            . My house is right opposite Mr. Green's house. On the Wednesday night about eleven o'clock, I saw the soldier named Wake killed by Mr. Green's door; I saw Cornwall and Murray there; I shut my door up about ten, and went to a room up one pair of stairs, and looked through a pane of glass that was broke, and between three and four in the morning I saw Cornwall from the street firing into Mr. Green's house; he stood on my side the street slanting, and fired at the one pair of stairs window, the lower sashes were up, it was the dining-room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you see him fire?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060032"/>Burk. I saw him four or five times; during that time I saw Mr. Green in his dining-room walking backwards and forwards; when Cornwall had an opportunity of firing he made a run of it; this continued till eight o'clock; Mr. Green looked and pointed at me, meaning (I believed) if I could see any enemy coming, to give him a signal; I acted upon that belief, and gave him signals when somebody were going to fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any more of the prisoners there?</p>
               <p>Burk. I saw Murray fire in at the window in the same manner as Cornwall did; there were two men got into my house the back way, I did not know either of them; they came in with two pieces, and said they must go up stairs; they fired from the first pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here?</p>
               <p>Burk. No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the soldier killed?</p>
               <p>Burk. There was a man breaking Mr. Green's door with a hatchet; the soldier came and stood behind him, he made a motion to stop down, and seemed to have a mind to help him, and I believe it was Mr. Green fired down from a window and killed the soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Burk. This was I believe about eleven o'clock over night; he shot the soldier down right.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of a cobler being killed?</p>

               <p>Mr. Green at first did not know me because I had not any soldier's clothes on, I have not had a soldier's coat on since I have been in the army; that night when this affair happened at Mr. Green's, I was drinking a pint of beer at a distance in the same lane where he lives, at the Wheat-sheaf; we had nothing to do; we heard a great noise of men with cutlaces going along the streets, they knocked them against the sides of the houses and stones; we went to Mr. Blow's and drank a pint of beer, and eat a mouthful of victuals; there were four or five people came in with cutlaces and bludgeons, and told us if we did not come out directly we shall all be murdered, Mr. Green had killed two or three people; they drove us out before them, the landlord went with us; word came that the soldier was killed; when Justice Hodgson came I went to him and said, here is a soldier killed, will you give me liberty to go to the Tower and fetch a party of soldiers; he told me, no, it was too late; this was done I believe about half an hour after ten o'clock; I said, I knew if I went to the Tower they would send men, especially as there was murder committed; he told me he would give no order; I said, perhaps by the morning the murderer will be gone; he said, then let three or four surround the house all night; before I went up there that man was in the shell; when I was drinking at Axford's house I had never a sword, stick, or cutlace, or any other instrument as I shall answer it to the great God. I saw three men with muskets in their hands, one of them is here at the bar, the other two are not; they were loading them with something, I do not know what; I saw nothing but powder; one of them said, why don't you take a gun or pistol, you have been in the army, you see one of your brother soldiers is killed, you ought to have your brains blown out; I own I did put powder in a piece; I went over to the shell, (Mr. Green said to me he believed he had killed thirty, and that he believed they were buried in some hole,) I said that man shall never go so, I'll die by him first, I will stand over him till the guards come down; I went and stood over him with the musket in my hand till they did come; they asked me what I was doing; I said I was standing there that he should not be buried, as it was reported many had that Mr. Green had killed; I went home with the musket in my hand, and a man came and said it was his musket, who it was that brought it to Axford's I know not.</p>

We had information on the Friday before Tuesday the 10th of May last, it was in writing sent to Mr. Dingley, to inform him a number of people were assembled together with intent to pull down this saw-mill; I immediately went down to Limehouse and got assistance; I had not been gone above half an hour before one of our servants came and told me they had entered the yard; I met the mob of sawyers and other people pretty near the mill; I asked their demands, what they came there for; they told me the saw-mill was at work when thousands of them were starving for want of bread; I then represented to them that the mill had done no kind of work that had injured them, or prevented their receiving any benefit; I desired to know which was their principal man to whom I might speak; I was shewed one; I had some conversation with him, and represented to him that it had not injured the sawyers; he said it possibly might be so, but it would hereafter if it had not, and they came with a resolution to pull it down, and it should come down.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that man again?</p>
               <p>Richardson. I should if I could see him again, but I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Richardson. This was about eleven o'clock in the morning after they had entered the yard, when they were got pretty near the mill.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the number of the people be?</p>
               <p>Richardson. As near as I can guess there might be about 500 come into the yard; immediately they went to work and broke into the mill; they did not pull it down, but destroyed the inside; one man had a long adze, another a hatchet; I did not see a saw; one of our men says he saw a saw; I saw them at work demolishing the mill, they cut the shafts of the sail, and several other things; they destroyed all the saws and frames, and pretty near demolished the brick building, that is the counting-house; I cannot speak to the prisoner; they surrounded me immediately.</p>

            . I am a paviour, I am brother-in-law to the deceased Morgan; I heard of his being used ill, and I went and saw him the Monday following at his lodgings: I desired him to come home to the house where I lodge, that my wife might take care of him, his head was tied up; he came and continued at my lodgings till he died; he was very bad, and complained greatly of his inside and head; he worked but one half day after he received the hurt, he lived about three weeks after it; he told me he was drinking along with one Fanning, and this Fanning had occasion to ease himself; and that he, that is Morgan, went a little way up in the court to make water, and that Dunn came out of a house with some beer, and asked Fanning what he was doing there; he said he was easing himself; Dunn said, I will ease you presently; Fanning got up, and ran away without having time to put up his breeches; he could not catch Fanning, but he came up and hit him a blow over the head with a stick or poker, the blow almost stunned him; that he attempted to run away, he kicked his foot and fell down, and fell in attempting to get up again; Brannan knocked him down, and then either one or the other jumped upon him, and gave him several kicks on his side; we got a warrant for the assault about ten days before the deceased died; we took them up, they bailed it; I took them up a second time after my brother died, I cannot tell the day he died, but we took them up the day after; I did not see him for a day or two before he died, he was in such agony I could not bear to see him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheldon. I am a surgeon, the deceased came to me first the 16th of May, about four in the afternoon; he desired I would dress his head of the wound he received on the Saturday before at night; I found it to be a wound on the middle of his forehead, betwixt one and two inches long; it was pretty deep, as deep as it could well go; it was only through the flesh, it did not appear to have affected the scull; there was a good deal of clotted blood, it seemed to me to be a wound that might have been received by almost any kind of instrument by a cut, by a fall against wood or stone; I concluded it was by a fall, I dressed it; he came regularly I think for 14 days to be dressed, it mended considerably till about the last day of May, or first of June; he had some fresh symptoms; I found he had a fever, I desired he would not come out any more; I attended him at his home from I think Whitsun Tuesday to his death; I found him in bed continually with a very bad fever; he continued to grow worse and worse till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060038"/> the 16th of June, then he died; I was with him within a few hours of his death; I did not find in the course of the fever that the wound grew worse, it was a putrid kind of a fever.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never complain of any injury he had received.</p>
               <p>Sheldon. The first day he said he had hurt his back with a fall, and that was black and blue; the next day he said it grew better, I never asked him any thing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never complain somebody had done him any injury?</p>
               <p>Sheldon. I do not remember that he did; he gave me a very incoherent account, that I rather thought he was drunk when he received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not complain of his inside?</p>
               <p>Sheldon. No, not till he had the fever.</p>
               <p>Q. When he first came to you to have the wound dressed, how did he say it came?</p>
               <p>Sheldon. He said it was done by two men, but he did not mention what men to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was an incoherent account, I wish you would tell what kind of a story he told you.</p>
               <p>Sheldon. He said he had been hurt by two men.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to think that an incoherent account?</p>
               <p>Sheldon. Because he said he had a warrant in his pocket, and he never mentioned their names to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ask their names?</p>
               <p>Sheldon. I asked him if he knew who they were, he did not tell me then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you one way or the other?</p>
               <p>Sheldon. I do not recollect that he told me any names.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he knew them?</p>
               <p>Sheldon. He said he did know them.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall take it for granted, by your account, that you think he died of a fever.</p>
               <p>Sheldon. I think he died of the fever.</p>
               <p>Q. If the fever was occasioned by the wound, would there not be an alteration in the wound?</p>
               <p>Sheldon. I should have thought there would have been an alteration in the state of the wound much more than there was, or a swelling in the head or eyes, and there never was any swelling there; I looked upon him to be a man of a bad habit of body.</p>
               <p>Dunn's defence.</p>
               <p>I was taken up the day after he was dead, I never saw the man in my life before I saw him before Justice Welch; I have witnesses to prove I was in bed at the time this was done.</p>
               <p>Brannan's defence.</p>
               <p>I have witnesses enough to prove I was in bed when he was struck.</p>
               <p>For the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raney. Dunn has worked for me twelve months in paving the streets, and Brannan two years; they have behaved exceeding well, two as innocent men as ever I employed; I have reason to have a bad opinion of the witness on the other side.</p>
               <p>Magennes. There was a witness had three guineas not to come here to give evidence against them; I had a guinea myself, I did sign a note not to appear against them.</p>
               <p>- Tracey. I have enquired after Fanning, he has been bribed, and is gone to Ireland; he had but four shillings to take that Saturday, there have been several people after him, but he is gone.</p>

               <p>Butler. I can, I took them in change, and when I came to examine them again, I knew them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent them to be rectified?</p>
               <p>Butler. I saw the defect in them myself; it was my master I believe that sent them to be done.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any dearns in the knees of these breeches?</p>
               <p>Butler. Yes, there are.</p>

I marked the black stocking breeches, (it is now upon them,) I did it after they came from the taylor's, and put them up close by the window; when my fellow servant desired me to go up, I looked and they were gone: they were there at eight in the morning, and the prisoner at the bar<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060040"/> was the first man we had had there that day; it was past eleven I believe when my fellow servant desired me to go up and look; they were afterwards found in the prisoner's bag.</p>

On the 24th of May I saw them all about two o'clock; they came down outrageous, hallooing, with sticks and cutlaces, for the sailors to come on shore to engage them; there were some sailors in boats, they found they would not come on shore, they walked back again; then in about half an hour they gave them three chears, and desired them to come on shore; Grainger took a boat and went off, then a ship's boat put off to him; then he said, you shall not kill me, and he rowed on shore again; they stood about half an hour, hallooing and knocking their sticks and cut-laces against the wall; at last they laid down their sticks and cutlaces, and called out, they would not hurt them; then two boats came on shore, six in one boat and eight in the other; when they came on shore, the sailors asked what was their intent in coming on shore, why did they not stay on board and work; the <rs id="t17680706-57-deflabel308" type="occupation">coal-heavers</rs>

               <p>Q. Had the sailors stones with them?</p>
               <p>Beckett. No, they had not, I did not see them throw any; I saw the coal-heavers walk all away together after the murder; Murphy flourished his hanger, and some of the others did the same, I saw Doyle do it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had none of the sailors been on shore before they called to them to come on shore, and engaged them?</p>
               <p>Beckett. I do not know that any of them had, I am sure none of them had been on shore before the coal-heavers had called to them to come on shore; there had been no conversation between the sailors and coal-heavers as I knew of before; this was the first I ever heard or knew of; when they came on shore, I am sure none of the sailors made any attempt upon the coal heavers; they were talking about five minutes, then I saw the sailors run away, and in about six or eight minutes the deceased got upon a rast of timber; I saw Murphy upon the rast, he cut the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the raft from the causeway?</p>
               <p>Beckett. It was about ten yards from it; the timbers were masts, one end lay upon the shore, and the other lower in the water; it was about an hour's stood.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Dogan was there?</p>
               <p>Beckett. I am, he struck the deceased upon the timber; there were a great many people there out of curiosity,</p>

            , master, she lay in Shadwell-dock; there were a great many colliers lay in the river, and no coal-heavers to be got, then our master employed the ship's company to unload; the coal-heavers came on board, and were going to murder us, and opposed our working; this was on Monday the 23d of May; I cannot say I know any of the prisoners, we continued  to work. The 24th there came a gang on board, whether it was a false gang or not we did not know, and therefore we would not deliver the ship up to them to work; they went on shore again, there were twelve or thirteen; some of us went on shore between three and four o'clock in two boats, to know why they left off work; we wanted them to go on board their ships where they were at work; they called us to come on shore from our vessel, which lay 2 or 300 yards from shore; Beattie, the deceased, was with us in the boat I was in, he belonged to the Freelove; our ships lay in one tier close together; when we came to the shore I got up stairs, and shook hands with many of them; one of them came and ran a stick at my gullet, I had given no provocation for it; three or four words passed, and I went down again directly, we had no arms with us; in about ten minutes after that we were all attacked and knocked down by the coal-heavers; a great many of them had sticks and cutlaces, there were none on shore but myself as I know of; the rest were in the boats, one end of the boats was on shore; they came and got hold of them, and drawed them farther on shore; I was taken up for dead, being wounded on my head, and all over my body; they hoved us out of the boat into the water; I got into a sculler, and got off into a lighter, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060044"/> I lay for some time before any body came to assist me; I could not observe what was done to the deceased.</p>

Codling, I remember there were a good many coal-heavers on shore; the 24th of May I went in one of the two boats, Beattie was in one of them; we went to see what was the matter; the coal heavers had left off working in the ships that they had been at work, they were standing on the shore; as soon as they saw the boats coming they laid down their sticks, and shook hands with some of us as we were near shore; several of them ran into the water, and with a cord hauled the boats on shore;

            . I was between Shadwell-dock stairs and James's stairs, I saw all the prisoners there; on the 24th of May, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; I was frightened, seeing stones throwed at the sailors at coming to the shore; Murphy and Hammond were so severe in flourishing their cutlaces, and striking the poor lad that lay upon the raft; I saw Murphy strike him several times with a cutlace, he had a stick in one hand, and a cutlace in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Which did he strike him with?</p>
               <p>E. Moncoe. I do not know with which it was, there were a great many people throwing stones, there might be 20 or 30 of them throwing stones and brickbats; I saw Hammond among the crowd, flourishing a stick, saying, he would have the first sailor's head that came on shore; there were a great many of them upon the rast with the deceased, I cannot say I saw Hammond upon the rast; I saw Murphy several times on shore, I have seen him several times and in different dresses, I knew him before, though he changed his clothes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grindal. I am a surgeon, I attend the London-hospital. On the 24th of May in the afternoon, between six and seven, to the best of my remembrance, the young gentleman that attends to take in accidents, sent me word a very dreadful one was just come in; I went to the hospital, and found John Beattie there, he was very sensible; he had received a blow, which he said was by a broomstick that broke his nose; he said there were several of these men set upon him; he said one knocked him down with a broomstick, another cut him cross the head (the wound began at the temple, and went quite to the back part of the head through the skull) done with a cutlace; it had broke a piece of bone in about the bigness of a shilling, which I took out, it went through the scull into the brain; he said he thought they left him for dead, but seeing him struggling another came up, and gave him a cut cross the shoulder ( which went into the joint of his shoulder;) he languished ten or twelve days in a deplorable situation, and then died.</p>
               <p>Q. To what do you impute his death?</p>
               <p>Grindal. I impute it to that wound on his head, they were either of them enough to have killed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention who they were that did him this injury?</p>
               <p>Grindal. He mentioned no names, but said they were coal-heaver, and that there were a great many of them.</p>

            . I am a waterman, I was at Shadwell-dock on the 24th of May last, I saw from the beginning to the end of this affair; I saw the two boats come on shore, I believe there were three, they seemed to be very sociable together while the watermen were in the boats, that is, the coal heavers and sailors; after they began, which was in half an hour, I saw the coal-heavers beat the sailors in such a barbarous manner they were obliged to jump overboard, whether they could swim or not swim; I saw three of them jump over board, one Ashley and I were in a boat together, near Shadwell-dock; I saw several people on the timbers, with sticks and cutlaces, using the deceased in a most cruel manner; I saw a great number of cutlaces, I saw the deceased struck several times with cutlaces.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the prisoners?</p>

               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Andrews. I believe this was about four o'clock in the afternoon; I cannot say who struck the deceased, nor who did not; I was at about 100 yards distance, the chiefest man that I took notice of was

               <p>Andrews. It was four or five times as big as this table in the court (that is, near four yards long and one over;) I was obliged to keep off, searing the brickbats which were throwed; the coal-heavers went huzzaing, daring the sailors to come on shore, some crying 50 l. for a sailor's head, some threatening they would rip them open; there might be 2 or 300 of them all.</p>

            . I have known Murphy about 2 or 3 months; the day the fray happened, which was Whitsun Tuesday, I saw him a little before it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060048"/> began, I believe about a quarter of an hour before, crossing Shadwell-dock-stairs, going downwards between three and five o'clock, where he went I cannot say; I never saw him afterwards that day, he had a stick in his hand, no hanger as I could perceive; I know it was not Murphy, nor never a one here that killed Beattie with the hanger: the man that killed him was in a white fustian frock, an old hat with a bit out of the edge of it, he had the hanger in his left-hand and a stick in his right; whether his breeches were cloth or leather I don't know, they seemed to be white.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour were his stockings?</p>
               <p>Magoury. I did not observe his stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the deceased?</p>
               <p>Magoury. I believe I was about thirty yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you had seen Murphy?</p>
               <p>Magoury. It was not half an hour I am sure; there was nobody on the raft but the deceased and that man that cut him, he made several blows at him with the hanger and stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased standing or down?</p>
               <p>Magoury. He was down before the blow hit him; he crawled to shore and came to me, and leaned on my shoulder, and asked my help: I helped him a little way and then left him with some women; the man that cut him went thro' the yard and out upon the raft; I can't say I ever took notice of the man that cut him before.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Magoury. I am a lumper, and go to sea sometimes; after this I saw the man that cut him going along, I said that is the man that cut the man upon the raft; the other said, it is a shame for him to kill him, I could kill a thousand of him; this was one Smith Owen that said so.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the man was cut?</p>
               <p>Magoury. This was not an hour after.</p>

             M'Daniel. I was standing at the landing place at the back of the Noah's Ark; I had seen the people going down upon the causeway, Murphy had a stick in his hand, and I saw him after the fray; he then had nothing else but a stick; I saw him on the causeway at the time of the fray, it was a black stick.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. This was the 24th of May between three and four in the afternoon; the sailors and coal-heavers were engaged in a battle, I saw them during the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the battle?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. It was about low water mark; there was a man wounded at the time of the fray; first the sailors got the better of the coal-heavers; before they got into the water, the coal-heavers got more force, then they got the better of them; three of the sailors jumped overboard, two were taken up with a boat, one jumped over on the other side and got upon the timbers, and two men followed him; one of them cut him with a cutlace in one hand, and a black stick in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the time the sailors got the better?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. That was when the coal-heavers were in the water; at last they knocked them backwards and forwards; then three jumped overboard, and there were two in a boat wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man wounded upon the raft?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him afterwards?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. He was carried up afterwards by some people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not walk at all?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. He crawled in a manner, then he was assisted by other people.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing or lying when the man struck him?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. He was standing upon his legs; the man had a cutlace in his hand, but he knocked him down with a stick; he cut him when he was down with the cutlace, he struck him again with the stick.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men were upon the raft?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. There were two men, but the other was not close to him; there were three upon the raft in all when the man was wounded; I did not see the others do any thing; the man that out him on the raft was the beginning of the fray, he was dressed in a whitish coat and a flapped hat; he came down the stairs swaggering with the sword and stick in a terrible manner; he made them sheer off; they hawled this man in the water by his coat; one man got in up to his neck and catched hold of the boat, and I don't know who had the first blow; I am sure and certain I saw Murphy on the causeway at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. I am a publican; I was coming from Wapping Old-stairs at the time to my house; I live on Cock-hill, at the sign of the Pewter Dish.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your landlord live?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060049"/>M'Daniel. He lives in College-yard, his name is Stimson.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the arms the sailors had?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. The first man had a cutlace, the rest had broomsticks; they reasoned the affair before they began; the man leaned his elbow over the bow of the boat, they asked what was the matter; the coal-heavers said they did not want to hurt never a person; then the fellow came down with a cutlace in one hand and stick in the other; I guess the sailors were in dread of him, and shoved the boat off; then another ran and hauled the boat in.</p>

             was the same; he lived in High-street, I have lived next door but one to him 18 years; he and I went from home about two o'clock in the afternoon on Tuesday the 10th of May, we were going to Westminster, we went over London-bridge through St. George's-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your nearest way?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop any where in your way?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, we light of a couple of acquaintance the Borough, and drank a couple of pots of beer with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your acquaintance go with you?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, we went into St. George's-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get there?</p>
               <p>Taylor. It might want about a quarter of three o'clock, the horse-guards were just come; they were clearing the people out of the fields, for that reason we staid.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you stop?</p>
               <p>Taylor. We stopped in the causeway towards the Hay-market.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the King's-bench prison?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I believe fifty yards or better from the soldiers when they fired.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is, how far from the King's-bench prison?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I believe it may be about an hundred yards or more.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might you be from the foot-soldiers?</p>
               <p>Taylor. About fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the horse?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I cannot tell, they were mixed, the horse had been in and cleared the people out of the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any stoppage there?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, we stopped about five or six minutes, and in that time there were two or three of the foot-soldiers fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any rioting?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I saw no rioting, nor nothing done in the time I stood there; I was not there above five or six minutes before the firing was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue there in the whole?</p>

               <p>Taylor. When two or three of the soldiers fired off, he said to me, Taylor, let us go; we came out of the causeway into the road, our backs were towards the soldiers.</p>
               <p>Q. What road?</p>
               <p>Taylor. The road that leads to Westminster from out of Blackman-street; we turned our backs, and in that time he received a ball.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean he received the wound the instant he returned back?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060053"/>Taylor. I cannot say the exact time, because a great many people were running; when he stopped he told me he was wounded; I looked down, and saw the blood upon his stocking.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he wounded?</p>
               <p>Taylor. In the hind-part of the thigh.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he running or walking, or was it at the time he was turning?</p>
               <p>Taylor. At the time he was running I believe, but I cannot justly say, I did not know it till the time he stopped; I had not power to help him along, though a great many did; he went to a surgeon in Blackman-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the wound examined?</p>
               <p>Taylor. The surgeon probed it, it went in behind and came out before; I was told the ball was found in his breeches, but I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of people might there be?</p>
               <p>Taylor. A vast many, a great concourse of people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what the people were doing of?</p>
               <p>Taylor. They were standing, looking on, I saw nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the defendant, Mr. Gillam, at the time.</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you looking at?</p>
               <p>Taylor. At the soldiers and the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing you saw between the soldiers and the mob previous to the firing?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, I did not see any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the mob do any thing?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I did not see them do any thing, I did not see any body make any disturbance during the whole time I was there; it was but a short time I was there.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any guess what number of people might be there?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there five or six thousand?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I cannot tell, there was a vast number.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard before you set out that this mob was assembled?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I did hear there was a mobbing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you hear of this disorder?</p>
               <p>Taylor. I was at home when I heard it.</p>
               <p>Council. So you chose to go that way?</p>
               <p>Taylor. We did it for a walk, we did not mean to stop.</p>
               <p>Council. What only to pass through this five or six thousand that were looking at one another in your way to Westminster, and you did not see the least rioting, no mischief done, no stones throwed, no indecent expressions of any sort, but the people all civil and obliging to one another?</p>
               <p>Taylor. All very quiet while I was there.</p>

            . I am a rope-maker by business, and am a constable of St. George the Martyr; I was posted at the King's-bench prison the 10th of May, I came there at half an hour past two in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was you posted?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. Near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you near Mr. Gillam?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an account what number of people there were, and what was going forward, as well as you can, at the time you came there.</p>
               <p>Nicholl. I was there between two and three, but that was not the first time I came.</p>
               <p>Council. I mean to ask you the first time you came?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. I came first between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep pretty much in the same place?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. No, I was walking about.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of people do you think there was?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. There was a vast quantity of people.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there five hundred, or a thousand, or five thousand, speak as near as you can?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. There were a thousand or more for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts were the soldiers when you first came?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. They were up against the King's-bench, they were foot-soldiers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember when the horse came?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. About two in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Endeavour to give an account, as near as you can recollect, of the general behaviour of the people?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. When I first came down before the King's-bench I went nigh the brick wall, Mr. Ponton said, there was a paper stuck up against the prison wall, he desired the paper might be taken down; Mr. Latham the constable took it down; soon after that the people cried out, give us the paper, and throwed stones at us.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. This was between eleven and twelve, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did they throw stones at?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060054"/>Nicholl. At the Justices and constables as they went towards the marshal's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that throwing of stones continue?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. It continued from the time of the taking dow n the paper till they got to the marshal's house; the Justices and constables went in there for soldiers, as I believe; after they had got into the house the people kept on throwing stones, I stood at the door, the people kept throwing stones very much, some of the stones passed me as I stood on the step, and went in at the door as the door stood open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go in at the door or window, or how?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. Them that I saw went in at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might the throwing of stones continue?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. About four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not some windows broke?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. Not at that time, I did not see any, they just went through; there is a way through the house, and there was a guard of soldiers, they came from behind the house, and the guard of soldiers came after them; they came from behind round to the front of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many Justices were there?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. There were three there I believe, Mr. Ponton, Mr. Gillam, and another, I do not know the other indeed; when they came round the house the people began to holloo, and cry out for the paper, and kept throwing of stones.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know how long they kept throwing stones after the Justices retreated into the house?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. They kept throwing stones till they came round again from behind the house, and after that they threw stones again; upon that Mr. Gillam, Mr. Ponton, and the other gentleman, drawed up to read the riot act, and while they were reading it, or were going to read it, the mob of people heaved stones at the Justices; I saw one stone cut a serjeant's lip, and another struck Mr. Ponton on the breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was endeavouring to read the riot act?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. Mr. Gillam was; after that they came from there, and marched the soldiers half way down the brick wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him read the riot act?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. I cannot say I did, there they halted; there was a man hallooing out, Wilkes and liberty for ever! he was in the field facing the brick wall, about five yards from it; upon that I was ordered to take hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who ordered you?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. I believe it was Mr. Ponton's voice, it was one of the Justices; I went towards the man; getting within ten yards of him I saw him run, I looked over, my left hand, and saw an officer and some soldiers running after him; I saw them as far as the Hay-market, then I lost sight of him; that is all I know of that part, this was near twelve o'clock. About one I was standing near the road, where were some soldiers posted; the people behaved very riotous, they throwed stones at the soldiers, so that the soldiers could not keep their posts for them; Mr. Gillam was there, he begged of the people to disperse and go about their business, he told them the riot act had been read; some people there said, d - n you, we do not believe the riot act has been read; Mr. Gillam said, if I thought that would appease you I would read it again; upon that he took a pocket-book out of his pocket, and called out silence, and read it again, I heard him read it; the people came round about him, they were pretty silent at that time, and afterwards he begged of them again to disperse.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might this be from the King's-bench prison where he was reading the riot act the second time?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. It was about three or fourscore yards from the prison door.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the wall?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. About forty yards from the wall, this was about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this about?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. In talking to them and reading the act might be about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of people might be collected together by one o'clock?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. There might be eight or nine hundred people round him for what I know, there was a vast many.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any general cry among the mob, did you hear any general expressions made use of?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. None in particular that I know of, except the men crying out, d - n you, we will not believe you; between two and three o'clock, as I was standing by the King's-bench, Mr. Gillam said to me, constable, go with me; I went with him to the soldiers, they were posted near a road; when we got there he begged of the people to disperse, he told them the riot act had been read, and they were every soul liable of being taken up; while he was begging of them to disperse they threw stones at the soldiers, Mr. Gillam, and me, as we stood all together; Mr. Gillam said, then,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060055"/> for God's sake, good people go away, if I see any more stones throwed I will order the guards to fire: while he was so saying a stone came and hit him over the head, about the temple, it caused him to reel three or four yards backwards; and when he recovered himself, or soon after, I heard him say, fire; the soldiers were then in two rows, they fell back a few paces into four rows, and then fired.</p>
               <p>Q. How many in front were there then?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. I do not know whether there were four or six; after they had fired the horse rode down and fired, some of them were at the farther part of the field, they came riding up to the same place where the foot had fired.</p>
               <p>Q. from a juryman. How long had the riot act been read?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. It had been read above an hour the second time; it was above an hour and a half after the second time, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any order for the horse to fire?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. No, I heard none; after they had fired I saw a man set upon the ground wounded in the path-way, he held his hand upon his thigh, and I saw blood in his hand, and it ran down.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that man dressed?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. I do not know, they said he was a weaver.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you pretty near the soldiers when they fired?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether all the soldiers, or only the front row fired?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. The two first rows fired first, then afterwards the two second rows fired, there might be a quarter of a minute between.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was there from eleven till towards three, do you recollect at any time between that time, any attempts to apprehend any of the persons?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. A good many were taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body rescued that they had apprehended?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. None that I saw.</p>
               <p>Court. Yet they would not disperse?</p>
               <p>Nicholl. No, they would not.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Olave's, and live in the Maze-pond, Soutwark; I was at the King's-bench prison on the 10th of May, there were a great number of people gathered together; I came there without my staff, Mr. Ponton asked me where my staff was; I went home and got it, and came back about one.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell your own story.</p>
               <p>Abbot. There was a stone, or something or other, came and hit Mr. Gillam upon the head, between two and three; I was in the fields near Mr. Gillam.</p>
               <p>Q. Who appeared to throw it?</p>
               <p>Abbot. Some of the mob did, I cannot say who, the stone made him stagger; presently after that somebody gave orders to fire, I heard it, but who it was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who it was?</p>
               <p>Abbot. No, I did not, I was looking towards the people at the same time.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Council. You had been there during the whole of the day?</p>
               <p>Abbot. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the people behave?</p>
               <p>Abbot. They hallooed Wilkes and liberty, and wanted to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done?</p>
               <p>Abbot. There was nothing done but throwing a parcel of sods and stones, the Justices desired they would go about their business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this continue?</p>
               <p>Abbot. This continued a long time; I saw Mr. Ponton struck in the morning before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What with?</p>
               <p>Abbot. It might be a stone for what I know; Mr. Gillam was struck on the head, and a serjeant was cut on the lip; the throwing stones was several times repeated, I heard the Justices desire them to disperse a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the proclamation read?</p>
               <p>Abbot. No, I did not, I was in the other part of the field, desiring the people to disperse; the Justices gave us orders to disperse the mob as much as we could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to do it?</p>
               <p>Abbot. I did, I gave them good words, but it all ended in nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not many of the mob go off?</p>
               <p>Abbot. No, no, no, no.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you tell how many people were there?</p>
               <p>Abbot. There were fifteen or twenty thousand.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was present on the 10th of May when the firing was; I don't think there was upon my soul any provocation, for there was no attempt made to take any prisoners; there were a great number of people in the fields, it was a general thoroughfare, and I believe every body that went through the fields stopped there; there was a great party of horse-guards came and rode among the people, and caused a great disturbance; the goal is railed round, and the people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060056"/> were leaning upon these rails; the horse rode among them and dispersed them to the out borders of the fields; when they came to the road and causeway they buzzaed and bissed the soldiers, that was all the provocation I saw; the horse occasioned a great disturbance, and the whole disturbance I believe; the people buzzaed and bissed, but no farther riot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see nothing else?</p>
               <p>Allen. I saw two or three people that fell with their wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time do you remember any orders given to fire?</p>
               <p>Allen. No, I was not near enough to hear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the time there was a firing?</p>
               <p>Allen. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the manner of firing?</p>
               <p>Allen. The body of soldiers were within about forty yards of the causeway, the way that people walk in; they call it platoons, I believe they were separated, not all together; they fired at random, half a dozen at a time, more or less; a great number of them loaded three times, and seemed to enjoy their fire, I thought it a great cruelty.</p>
               <p>Q. What appeared to be the behaviour of the people?</p>
               <p>Allen. Nothing but hissing at this time, and hissing the soldiers as they rode backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no outrages?</p>
               <p>Allen. I saw none at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Allen. This was about three, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing thrown?</p>
               <p>Allen. I cannot say I saw a stone throwed the whole day to my knowledge; I was in different parts, I was not there at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the weaver as was talked of?</p>
               <p>Allen. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you come first?</p>
               <p>Allen. About two o'clock, some little time after Mr. Allen was murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was you not there sooner?</p>
               <p>Allen. I am a peruke-maker and hatter, my business would not admit me sooner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Justices?</p>
               <p>Allen. I did; the commanding officer came up and said, I believe we have dispersed the mob; Mr. Gillam said, I hope there is no mischief done; this was a very short time after the firing; the commanding officer said, you may depend upon it there is no mischief done, because we always fire in the air; there was a great number of people afterwards reporting there was murder done.</p>
               <p>Q. What officer was that?</p>
               <p>Allen. That was the horse officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with Mr. Gillam yourself?</p>
               <p>Allen. I had some little conversation with Mr. Gillam, but I suppose that is no way necessary in regard to the examination now, it is not worth mentioning, I think it will not avail any thing; there was one Boddington, a ball went through his thigh and shivered it; they were going to order me into confinement for saying it was a cruel thing; I said, gentlemen, as you have ordered this fire, it is very proper you should order this man away; Mr. Gillam said, why don't you go and take him away; I said it was not in my power to take him away.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was you not there before two o'clock, was not you ordered to be there?</p>
               <p>Allen. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was not you there?</p>
               <p>Allen. The hazard of my trade and family, it was not in my power to have come sooner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you a constable at this time?</p>
               <p>Allen. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to know of you where you was at the time the firing was ordered?</p>
               <p>Allen. I was in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Mr. Gillam when the order was given?</p>
               <p>Allen. I was by the Justices almost all the whole day.</p>
               <p>Court. You said you was at a distance?</p>
               <p>Allen. I was not near enough to hear any order for firing.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know where your duty was, how far distance?</p>
               <p>Allen. Sometimes I suppose forty yards from Mr. Gillam, and sometimes close to him; at the time the firing was ordered, I suppose I might be about forty yards distant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you was not near, how could you tell these people there was no occasion to order a firing?</p>
               <p>Allen. I was amongst the general body of the people.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the people upon whom the firing was?</p>
               <p>Allen. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe of their behaviour?</p>
               <p>Allen. Nothing but hallooing, I did not observe any thing of the whole body of people but hallooing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see a stone throwed?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060057"/>Allen. I did not the whole time I was there see a stone flung.</p>
               <p>Q. from a Juryman. Was you no relation to this Allen that was killed?</p>
               <p>Allen. No, none at all.</p>

             Flowers. I live in St. Olave's; I was present in St. George's-fields the 10th of May, I came there a few minutes after twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the field did you go into?</p>
               <p>Flowers. Into the hay-market; I continued there a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there any part of the day besides that quarter of an hour?</p>
               <p>Flowers. Yes, I observed the people a good deal dissatisfied at the death of Allen; I did not come till after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Gillam there?</p>
               <p>Flowers. Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular during that quarter of an hour?</p>
               <p>Flowers. I did not see any thing but dissatisfaction at the death of Allen, they expressed it in words; I did not see any sticks or any thing throwed; I went to Mr. Allen's, and from thence down the Borough to enquire for a Justice of the peace, to have an evidence made of that young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what time you came back again?</p>
               <p>Flowers. I came back near two; I went along the wall of the King's-bench between two and three; I passed from thence to the King's-bench, and from thence to the marshal's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe during that time?</p>
               <p>Flowers. There was a great tumult among the soldiers, I believe the people were fleeing and the soldiers fleeing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the foot or horse?</p>
               <p>Flowers. I was not in a situation to observe the foot, this was the horse; I was close by the prison wall.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you there the time the foot fired?</p>
               <p>Flowers. I did not observe that I was, I did not remain, but passed along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Gillam at that time?</p>
               <p>Flowers. I saw him a little after, but not immediately; I was waiting to obtain a warrant for a soldier that had killed Mr. Allen; Mr. Gillam took off his wig and rubbed his head, he said he had received a blow with a brickbat or something, but he thanked God, he said that his skull was thick it had not hurt it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Gillam give any reason for firing?</p>
               <p>Flowers. He did not in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Redburn that day?</p>
               <p>Flowers. Not to my knowledge; I had some conversation with Mr. Gillam in the evening, he said he had had something throwed at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether Mr. Gillam at any other part of the day gave any reason for firing?</p>
               <p>Flowers. He did nothing but what I have mentioned before.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Gillam?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember this 10th of May?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Mr. Gillam about the accident that day?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any reason why he ordered the soldiers to fire, what time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. About one or two o'clock, this was after the murder of Mr. Allen's son.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the killing of Redburn?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Yes.</p>

               <p>Council for prosecution. Then that has nothing to do with this matter, we will not ask you any farther questions.</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Then what do I come here for?</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. Can you prove any thing?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Yes, I was there from twelve till nine at night, I saw the whole behaviour of Mr. Gillam.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I am a bookseller, and live in the parish of St. George's, Hanover-square; I came into St. George's-fields, and went into the King's-bench prison; I came a little before twelve o'clock, I did not go the usual way that I was going; I went to the prison for safety indeed, I went into the coffee-room, and met with two friends, and we drank part of a bottle of perry; I staid there about half an hour, then my friends and I said we had no business there, and it would be our best way to leave that place, and go to our respective homes; I saw a great many of the military there, there was a disturbance from the military riding among the people; I could see into the fields, because there were glass-windows there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any ill behaviour in the people?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. No, not the least, nor I dare say there was none intended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then quit the prison?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I did; when I came out of the prison I was going into the city, and at the end of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060058"/> wall there were people crying out, there was a murder committed; this was a little before one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. This being before one o'clock, it has no relation to the death of Redburn. You set the accusation against Mr. Gillam is for being instrumental in the death of Redburn.</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. My Lord, I am going to tell you the whole of Mr. Gillam's behaviour from first to last.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. Keep yourself to the behaviour of Mr. Gillam.</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. After the murder I turned to the King's bench prison, by the desire of Mrs. Allen, to see after the murderer, this was about one o'clock; I applied to the Justices for a warrant to apprehend the murderer or murderers; the Justices would not grant any; I then applied to Justice Gillam; he said -</p>
               <p>Court. It is to be understood that we are not to let evidence be given that is not applicable to the case in hand, this gentleman is charged with a crime relative to one Redburn; this man is telling you about his conduct about one Allen; it is the duty of the bench, where there is no council in support of the prosecution, to see that proper evidence be given, and if the council for the prosecution does not confine the witnesses to the proper matter, to take care that improper evidence is not given.</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Mr. Gillam told me he had orders from the ministry to fire upon the people, and that there must be some men killed, and that it was better to kill five and twenty to day than have an hundred to kill to-morrow; this was in the field opposite the marshal's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that Mr. Gillam said this?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. It was between one and two o'clock; the other evidences have been admitted to speak, he said he had orders from the ministry to fire upon the people, and that there must be some men killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at the time?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. This was in the presence of the soldiers, and that they had better kill five and twenty to-day than an hundred to-morrow; all the afternoon there were people taken into custody, and put into a cellar under the marshal's house.</p>
               <p>Court. What place was this where you heard those expressions?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. It was near the marshal's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Name those persons that were present.</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. What the soldiers. - I am not so well acquainted with them, I believe it was said twice in the house, and out of the house, and with a snear, as if murder was a thing of no consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was without or within the marshal's house?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. It was without, as near as I can remember.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any body that you knew that was near or by at this time?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. There were some people, but I don't recollect who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Ponton there?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Yes, he was - I do not know whether he was in hearing, but I saw him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you recollect whether he was near at the time?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. No, I cannot, there were people there, but I do not recollect particular persons what their names were.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you say Mr. Ponton was there, but you are not sure whether he was in the hearing or not?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I do not know whether he was upon the spot at that time, I saw that gentleman several times in the course of the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Council. You mention twice such a conversation past.</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I believe it was spoke twice, but I am not certain; I am not certain only as to once.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it spoke the first time?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. To the best of my knowledge that was opposite the marshal's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Fix the time?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I have told you I believe it was about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Name if you can any persons that were present that you know that at that time were within hearing?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it, if there was a second time when it was said?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I do not recollect exactly the time; there was a good deal of discourse in the marshal's house, they talked of it as a thing of trifling concern, a matter of no concern.</p>

               <p>Q. Repeat the words again.</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Mr. Gillam upon my application to him for a warrant for the murderers, said he would grant no warrant, he said it was no murder, for that he had orders from the ministry to fire<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060059"/> upon the people, and there must be some killed, and it was better to kill five and twenty to day than a hundred to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this second time, how long do you fix hat to be after the first conversation?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it three hours or half an hour?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at night or any part of the day?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. It was not at night, I was in bed at night; I do not say the very particular words were said, but there were several things said.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you as to the time?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. You asked me before, I have answered it, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Council. You cannot tell whether it was immediately after the first, or five or six hours after, was it in the marshal's house?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I am not certain, I believe it was, but I am not certain; you will not draw any thing from me.</p>
               <p>Council. You do not fix any particular time or place for the second conversation, you do not recollect any particular person that was present in that second supposed conversation?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I told you that before, you ask me the same question three or four times over.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say there was a second conversation for?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Because I was asked if there was any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard it a second time what did you hear?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. It was not the same words, but to that purport; it was with great difficulty that any warrants could be obtained; if you will let me go on I shall say a good deal more than I have.</p>
               <p>Q. In this last case do you mean to give the words the Justice used?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. The words the Justice used.</p>
               <p>Q. Then mention them again, because I did not understand whether they are your sense of the conversation, or the words he used?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Gillam said it was no murder; I did not hear the other Justices say any thing in particular; I imagined that this gentleman was foreman on that most glorious day.</p>
               <p>Council. In this second conversation you understood Mr. Gillam to say, they were determined to grant no warrants to apprehend these persons that committed what you call murder?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Mr. Gillam said if their names could be procured he would grant warrants.</p>
               <p>Council. Then what you mean by this is to say, Mr. Gillam said he would not grant any warrants till he knew their names?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. This was in the marshal's house, but the words were used on the first application for warrants.</p>
               <p>Council. Then he said the reason why he did not grant warrants was, because you did not name the names of particular persons; how long have you been acquainted with Mr. Gillam?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. The 10th of May about 12 o'clock was the first of my acquaintance with him, I did not know there was a Mr. Gillam living before, and I wish I had not seen him then, because I saw such acts of cruelty I never saw before.</p>
               <p>Council. Mr. Gillam was in company with you in some room in that second conversation?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Many hours.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you together as acquaintance if you had never known him before?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Because I was applying for warrants, endeavouring to bring the murderers to light; I was there and drank there, I believe out of the same glass, but I am not sure of that, I think that is not material.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Mr. Flowers was in the room, there was the cow-man in the room, whose name I do not recollect; I saw Mr. Ponton there several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he there at the time you was discoursing upon these warrants?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. The application was particularly made by Mr. Flowers and another gentleman, Mr. Horne.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is he?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I believe he is a clergyman.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I believe at Brentford.</p>
               <p>Q. from a juryman. Did not you say you had something else to say?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I have; the Justice's clerk (I imagined him to be one,) he acted as such upon taking the deposition of one of the people for the murder of Allen, beginning with what happened from 12 o'clock; when he came to that part wherein he said he heard Mr. Gillam order the military to fire upon the people, Mr. Gillam said, hold, hold, do not take his deposition from that time before that, but what happened in the cow-house; I imagined Mr. Gillam was conscious of his guilt.</p>
               <p>Q. I desire you would explain one particular transaction -</p>
               <p>Court. You see, brother Glyn, this is not evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060060"/>Serjeant Glyn. No, it is not; only the jury desired to hear what he had to say.</p>
               <p>A juryman. We thought he might know something more of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other Justices present except Mr. Gillam?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. At the time he said it was no murder, no, not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you that the Justices said they thought such a transaction no murder.</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. That was only Mr. Gillam and no other Justice at that time, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether the words you mention were spoke without the marshal's house or within?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. I have told you my Lord it was without the marshal's house, in the hearing of the soldiers.</p>
               <p>Court. And that it was about two o'clock?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. Yes, I believe it was, I cannot judge to a quarter or half an hour, I believe it was after we went into the marshal's house, I think it was.</p>

Yes, I made repeated applications for a warrant to Mr. Gillam in the marshal's house; about three o'clock I saw Mr. Darbyshire several times, he said a great many things to me; the Justice ordered me into custody for helping the woman, he ordered depositions to be taken; he said they were all alike, and would not have them, he would have them otherwise; I did not get a warrant, Mr. Pardon was taking depositions, he said he could not help it, it was as they gave them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said after the firing at that time?</p>
               <p>Flowers. He said it was owing to their throwing at his head; Justice Capel was there, he said he had an order from the ministry to kill twenty-five of the people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Gillam say any thing to that effect?</p>
               <p>Flowers. Mr. Gillam did not, Col. West was there, he made some slight apologies, and said, it was owing to the gun going off; he said he could have drove them all away without breaking their shins, there was no reason to hurt none of them; Mr. Gillam in the evening was very urgent to have them fire again.</p>

            . I am turnkey at the King's-bench prison, I was minding the prisoners on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing that happened without?</p>
               <p>Penrith. No, I saw a number of people on the outside, my charge was very heavy, I was busy in looking after the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any particular attention required that day?</p>
               <p>Penrith. There was such great numbers of people coming in and out that required my attention; I took in a many that day for misbehaviour, they were brought and delivered into my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any stones throwed in?</p>
               <p>Penrith. There were none that day as I know of, there were some throwed in the day before</p>
               <p>Q. Was there none throwed in the marshal's house?</p>
               <p>Penrith. I could not see that if there was, the door of the prison was broke the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not afraid of their breaking the prison the second day?</p>
               <p>Penrith. No, I was not, because I had a sufficient guard with me on the inside, I had half a dozen people.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they soldiers?</p>
               <p>Penrith. No, they were not; I mean a sufficient guard for my own safety, that people did not rush in too fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know of the mischief done the day before, there was a guard sent for, was it not sent for for the security of the prison?</p>
               <p>Penrith. I did not send for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know the marshal did?</p>
               <p>Penrith. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know it was a guard to protect the prison?</p>

               <p>Penrith. It was on the outside, you are asking me what was done without side, I did not see that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make affidavit of the riot and disturbance the day before?</p>
               <p>Penrith. I did the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not think it necessary, in your judgment, to have such a guard?</p>
               <p>Penrith. The day before it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not more people assembled that day than the day before?</p>
               <p>Penrith. I think there were, but as to their transactions I can say nothing to that.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose there had not been this guard without the prison to protect it, do you think your half dozen within could have been able to have kept out this multitude?</p>
               <p>Penrith. We kept them out the day before; when they had broke the outside door we put the bar up; I cannot say if people had pushed in that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060061"/> we could have kept them out, if they had all come and pushed in together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you yourself tell the marshal the day before, that you thought you could not hold out any longer?</p>
               <p>Penrith. I sent word to the marshal, and to the Justices, that it was impossible for us to hold out any longer; we had barricaded the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt whether it was necessary to have a guard the next day?</p>
               <p>Penrith. I had no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. from a juryman. Did you think the prison safe when the bar was put up?</p>
               <p>Penrith. I got my arms ready, and thought they should not come in till they had broke the second door.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. Was there any force used the second day?</p>
               <p>Penrith. No, there was not, a number of people forced in, and we kept half a dozen men to push them out again.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. Do you mean the people came in by force and outrage?</p>
               <p>Penrith. They came in against our inclinations.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to know what number of prisoners there are?</p>
               <p>Penrith. Upwards of 300 within side.</p>
               <p>Q. What amount may the charge be upon the marshal at that time?</p>
               <p>Penrith. I believe about two hundred thousand pounds.</p>

            . I am a glazier, and a constable of St. Olave's parish; I was in St. George's-fields on the 10th of May, I went there about twelve o'clock, there was abundance of people there besides me, the Justices were there; I saw Mr. Ponton, Mr. Gillam, Mr. Russel, and several others, whose names I do not know. At the time the horse-grenadiers came there was a sad disturbance, the people cried out, Wilkes and liberty, and throwed stones; the guards were ordered to the field-gate, Mr. Gillam was along with them; I went with them, Mr. Gillam desired the people to disperse, and for God's sake to go home; he said, if he saw any more stones throwed he would order the guards to fire; just at that time something came and hit him on the side of the hand, he fell back about two or three yards; he came forwards again, and said to the officer, if this be the case we shall be all killed, you must fire; he said, fire: upon that the soldiers fired immediately, I saw the horse-grenadiers fire; then I thought myself in danger, because they fired into the path where we were.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how they fired?</p>
               <p>Wills. I cannot say, there were three rows, I believe they fell into six, but I cannot be positive, I looked upon them to be 35 or 36 men.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there in a row?</p>
               <p>Wills. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the riot act read?</p>
               <p>Wills. I did not, Mr. Gillam told the people it had been read, and the time was nearly expired; in the evening it was read again, it was read three several times afterwards, that I remember.</p>
               <p>Court. Then according to your account of the matter, Mr. Gillam spoke in a very friendly manner to them?</p>
               <p>Wills. Yes, he said if they throwed any more stones they must order the guards to fire.</p>

            . Last Monday se'nnight between twelve at night and two in the morning, I was in the house of Mrs. Mills in King's-court, facing Drury-lane Play-house, I had been spending the evening with some friends; coming home I met with two girls by Drury-lane Play-house; I took them into this house, they showed us up into a room; after we had been there a little time the girls and I did not agree, so I went down stairs again; I said to Mrs. Mills, as I did not make use of the bed, you should return my money, I had paid a shilling before I went up; she would not; I said as she would not return it I had a right to make use of the bed; I whipped up stairs again, and was going to bed with my clothes on, she would not let me; in the time we were talking this girl at the bar came up, how she came I cannot give any account; the landlady complained she was dry, and proposed having a pot of beer, so she was two-pence and I three half-pence; this girl went for it, and in the time she was gone the landlady said, if you want a girl I would recommend that girl to you; I said, is she clean; she replied she would be bound for her cleanness and honestly; she said if you have 50 l. about you, if you leave it with me I will take care of it; I offered the girl the same price which I gave for the bed; the landlady told her that was a shilling, the girl agreed to it; so I undressed myself and she undressed herself; the landlady left us when we were going into bed; my coat and waistcoat I put in a chair or in the window by the bed-side; the money mentioned in the indictment was in my breeches; I put my hand in my pocket and felt it in my pocket, I laid my breeches under my pillow on that side I intended to lay; the girl swore she would not lie down if she did not lie on that side; I let her lie on that side, but moved my breeches to the other side; when I had done what I wanted I went to sleep; I desired the landlady to call me when she said her husband got up in the morning; I got up and saw my breeches lying on the pillow, the girl was gone; I put my hand in my pocket where the silver was, and found very little there; then I put my hand in the pocket where the gold was, and found there was a 27 s. piece left, and three guineas and three half guineas were gone; just as I missed my money the girl put her head in at the door; I hallooed out to her, and said I wanted to speak with her; I ran down without any more clothes on besides my breeches; there was the woman's servant in the passage, I asked her if she saw the girl that went to bed with me; she said she was gone out; I said she put her head in at the door where I lay; I asked her where her mistress was; she said she was gone to Convent-garden market; I went into a room and saw a bed and a man; I asked him if he was the master of the house, I am not clear whether he made an answer; I told him I was robbed of so much money; I went up and dressed myself, and waited till the mistress came home; then I told her I had lost so and so; she said she would not believe that I had lost any thing; another girl came in afterwards, they called me fifty names; then the prisoner came in while we were arguing about it, she abused me the same; they threatened me if I did not go about my business, they would send for their husbands and they should baste me; I told the mistress of the house, that I have been robbed in your house, and the girl that robbed me is in your house, and I would have you take care of her till I get a warrant for her; as soon as I had an opportunity I went and got a warrant, then the girl was not there; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060063"/> Justice granted a warrant to take up the woman of the house, he committed her to Newgate; the same night this girl was taken she confessed to part of the money, and that she gave the landlady of the house a guinea; this I heard her confess before the Justices in Bow-street; she did not own she took all that money from me, I am not quite clear whether she said she took two guineas and a half or three guineas and a half; the landlady upon her examination denied it; the girl was committed to Newgate.</p>

               <p>I had but a shilling of his money; and he had two girls before; I was very much in liquor when I was before the Justice, I don't remember what I said.</p>

               <p>Mr. Way. About eight o'clock in the evening of the 9th of May, going from Swithin's-alley to Batson's coffee-house, I saw a croud of people carrying a gibbet, on which hung a boot and petticoat, going down towards the Mansion-house; I stopped to observe whether they made any stand at the Mansion-house, I observed they halted there; there were great hissing and hallooing; I went to the Mansion-house, and had not been there above a minute or two before I saw my Lord Mayor come out of the gates of the Mansion-house, making his way towards the people that supported this gibbet; I believed when I saw them in Cornhill, there did not seem to be more than fifty or sixty; seeing my Lord go out by himself I made my way up to him; before I got to him, I saw the prisoner laying about him with a stick, which I afterwards observed had some nails in it; he had struck one or two people, which afterwards I found to be my Lord Mayor's servants; they had hold of him, endeavouring to bring him into the Mansion-house at the little gate by Charlotte-row; while the scuffle was between him and my Lord's servants, I heard several people cry, knock him down, knock him down; the prisoner had disengaged himself from them, and was making towards the corner of the Poultry by the linen-draper's; I stepped very briskly cross the kennel and laid hold of him by the collar; I drew him back; and with the assistance of the other servants he was lodged in the Mansion-house; the mob was by that time increased to I believe 150, making a noise, hollooing and hiffing.</p>

I am servant to my Lord Mayor; I was attending my Lord Mayor on the 9th of May about eight o'clock in the evening, my Lord and Lady were going out in a coach; some persons brought in notice that there was a large mob coming down Cornhill; I was standing in Charlottle-row with a flambeau in my hand, I went to see who they were; my Lord Mayor in the mean time came down the steps, as the gibbet was brought to the Mansion-house; there might be 150 of the mob, the street was all full from Cornhill to the Poultry, they were hissing and crying Wilkes and liberty; I observed one in particular had a blue cockade in his hat, the same as Mr. Wilkes gave at the election; my Lord Mayor said, bring back that thing, throwing out his hand; I believe there might be a dozen or fourteen had hold of it, carrying it along; it was a pretty formidable thing when it was together; they turned their heads many of them, but made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060064"/> no halt; I followed the gibbet as far as the pastry-cook's; I got hold of it and gave it such a shake, they were obliged to quit it; I turned with it in my hand, and was pulling it back towards the Mansion-house; there was one man came to me, I believe not the prisoner, and catched the slambeau out of my hand (it had not been lighted) and laid it about my head, and broke my head in several places; I let drop the gibbet which I had in my left-hand, in order to defend myself against the mob; I twisted the flambeau out of the man's hand, and I believe I did return it, I believe I did not strike above once; I believe there were two or three about me striking of me; I thought I must make a retreat, fearing they should get me down, which if they had, they certainly would have murdered me; I made my way into Charlotte-row, I thought some of my fellow-servants might see me, and I might be relieved; just as I was turned the corner they fell upon me again; I received several violent blows on my head, I did not see from whom I received them; my coat was torn; I turned and saw the prisoner on my right-hand, the stick flew out of his hand, and my fellow-servant picked it up; he defended himself with his hands as well as he could, but I pulled him I dare say twenty yards through the mob; the mob had hold of him and me likewise; when I got within ten yards of the Mansion-house the mob rescued him from me; I catched at him again, but missed him, and I believe I was not three yards from him when Mr. Way took hold of him, then we brought him into the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing throwed?</p>
               <p>Pyle. No, I did not; then after that the windows were broke; that was an hour and a half or two hours after this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the croud disperse upon these people being apprehended?</p>
               <p>Pyle. No, so far from that, they said they would have them out again; there was a single pane in one window, and another in another broke, when the prisoner was in the Mansion-house; he said he was coming by and had not touched any body, and that he did not think of any riot at all.</p>

            . I am servant to my Lord Mayor. On Monday the 9th of May about eight in the evening, my fellow servant and I were standing at the Mansion-house back door in Charlotte-row, waiting for my Lord and Lady who were going out; the people were coming down with a gibbet, with a boot and two petticoats; my fellow-servant said, here is something coming, we will go to the corner and see what it is; my Lord came out from the steps and called out, what is that, bring it back; they had halted, but were moving on; my Lord said something to my fellow servant; he went to the gibbet and pulled it down; I saw the people take his flambeau out of his hand, and give him one or two blows with it, I could not see who struck him; afterwards the prisoner Hawkins took a piece of wood from the gibbet and struck my fellow-servant, (produced in court a large piece of timber about four feet long with nails in it;) he struck him with it more than once, twice, or three times; I received one blow upon my head and shoulder with it; I received a blow or two from some other person, but do not know who: as we were conveying the prisoner Hawkins to the back door, the people came on so fast, if I had not had this stick the prisoner would have been rescued from Mr. Way and my fellow-servant; I struck at one or two, one I knocked down, I believe in the kennel; when we got the prisoners in, I was left in a room with them; all that I know of Wild, I did not see him before he entered the door, I can give no account of him; I asked him how he could do so; Hawkins said he was sorry for it, but said he did not know he had struck any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of you see where my Lord Mayor was in the time of the scuffle?</p>
               <p>Woodward. I saw him on the steps, and afterwards I saw him out in the mob near the pastry-cook's; I think he had a scarlet coat on and green silk waistcoat.</p>

            . I am also a servant to my Lord Mayor; my Lord Mayor stood upon the steps of the Mansion-house; he came down and desired the mob to disperse, and not breed any riot; he said he wondered what he had done that he could not rest in his house; he came out at the front gate, and came round upon the broad stones, the gibbet and boot were taken down then; I with the rest ran into the mob to see that nobody used my Lord ill; I saw a stick throwed at him, it came within two or three yards of him; I heard the prisoner Wild say, there he is, pointing to my Lord Mayor, knock him down, knock him down.</p>
               <p>Q. What was my Lord doing?</p>
               <p>Stinton. He had desired them to disperse.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might Wild be from my Lord Mayor?</p>
               <p>Stinton. About half a dozen yards or more from him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176807060065"/>Q. Was there a number of people round Wild at the time?</p>
               <p>Stinton. There were a great many; I laid hold of him, and I think I said, d - m you, what do you mean by knock him down; he said, I did not know who to knock down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Wild again?</p>
               <p>Stinton. Yes, very well; I took him in myself, and my Lord was at the door at the same time.</p>
               <p>Pyle. When Hawkins was examined at Guildhall, he acknowledged he took the stick from the gibbet, though before he had denied having any stick at all.</p>

               <p>Wild's defence.</p>
               <p>I saw a man in a white coat in the croud; I asked what he had done, I was told he was a pick-pocket; I heard others say, knock him down, and I believe I said so; they laid hold of my collar and asked me who I would have knocked down; I said, nobody, friend; he said he heard me say, knock him down; I said, I said no such word; he said he did insist upon my going into the Mansion-house; I made no resistance, but went; I am very wrongfully accused, I was not there three minutes; there was no gibbet, no boot, no nothing when I came there.</p>

            . On Tuesday the 10th of May there were a great many riotous people assembled by the Mansion-house, between nine and ten o'clock at night; after they had broke a great many windows and lamps, I took my hat and stick and went out among the mob; I stood to see if I could apprehend who broke them; for half an hour I stood near the prisoner Woodcock, I stood rather behind him; I saw him take a stone out of his pocket and look at it several times, and fling it directly at the second lamp on the right hand; I saw it go part of the way to the lamp, and heard it break it.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of people might be assembled together?</p>
               <p>Hale. It is impossible to give an account; they were very riotous in flinging stones and d - ning my Lord Mayor, wishing they had him out, saying they would kill him; they broke several windows more that night than the night before; we did expect we should have been in more danger than the first night; the furniture was damaged the night before, but not that night; after he had flung a stone, he would say that was well done when a window was broke; then I went and told the constables I had made observations of a man that broke a lamp, and if they would assist me we would take him; the people were hallooing and hissing; the constables came out with me, with intent to take him; at last they grew very outrageous, and demanded money of several coaches; I did not see the prisoner demand any, but he would make the people say who they were for; I kept close to him; the mob cried Wilkes and liberty; I said, you had better not stop coaches and demand money, that may be termed a robbery; I then gave Woodcock a shilling; after that he kept close to me and seemed friendly; I did not see him do any thing after that, only make people say who they were for, and call Wilkes and liberty.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take him instead of giving him the shilling?</p>
               <p>Hale. I feared the mob would be too strong for us; we took him about half an hour after</p>
