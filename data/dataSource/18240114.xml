I was once Commander and Colonel in a battalion in which Serjeant Medley was ensign; I procured him that rank. He had a female child, who afterwards married the prisoner - after his death, I procured his widow a pension, and the child a pension of 8 l. a year. I had not seen the child from two years old till she was eighteen or nineteen years old; I think it was about December, 1822 - I have seen her perhaps seven or eight times between that time and the present, and have seen the prisoner three or four times - he desired me to get him some information respecting his wife. On the 1st of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon, she was sitting in my parlour with me, and about five the servant came, and said Mr. Reynolds was at the door; he immediately followed the servant in - the servant left, and shut the door, leaving us three together. I said,</p>
               <p>"Pray take a chair;" he sat down about two feet from the table, with his back against the wall - I sat on the opposite side of the table, which was between us; his wife sat at the opposite corner, by the fire. I said,</p>
               <p>"Shall I give you a glass of wine?" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes." I immediately took up the decanter (which was on the table,) in my right hand, and the glass in my left - I poured the wine out, and handed it over to him, keeping my eye on the glass to avoid spilling it; he had approached nearer the table and nearer to me. I was leaning over the table, handing the glass towards him; his hand was under the table. I heard a sort of tick, which I now suppose to be his cocking the pistol, and just as I sat the glass down he fired a shot at me, putting his hand across the table - I did not see the pistol, and felt no bodily hurt from that; the ball had gone through my coat on the left side; I have the coat on now; it was buttoned; the hole is near the waistband of my breeches. I immediately got up, went round to him, and put my hands on his, not to hold them - I merely said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Reynolds, for God's sake moderate your passion, or you will do something serious; consider what you are about, you will do something serious presently if you don't moderate your passion." My temper was not rough in the least. I thought at that time that he had fired at his wife, and not at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in the line of the pistol - A. We were at a triangle; he might have fired at either. I got up to pacify him, thinking he had fired at her, and while I was close to him, he fired a second pistol on my right side - I immediately felt that I had been shot; his wife at that time had pushed her chair about two feet further from the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. In the manner he directed the pistol, could it be intended for her - A. I do not think it possible. That ball perforated my coat, and went through my waistcoat. I went and sat down, and asked him if his pistols were loaded with ball; he immediately answered Yes, he was sure they were loaded with ball, for he had loaded them himself. I then asked where he got them - he said he bought them in Norton-falgate, on the Tuesday, (this was Thursday;) I asked of whom; he said he did not know - that he was sure the balls were in me, and he hoped they were in my g - ts or bowels and said,</p>
               <p>"I am very happy, I am now quite easy" - he repeated that three or four times. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Reynolds, I think it was the second shot that hit me;" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, it was the first;" and then he added,</p>
               <p>"I took a very good aim at you;" I replied,</p>
               <p>"You certainly had a very good opportunity." The report of the pistols alarmed my servants, who came running up - his wife was alarmed, jumped up, and ran to find the bell, but could not. She opened the door and the servants came in - my man servant called a watchman, who came in. The candles were out when the servants came up, but I had not observed it before, and cannot tell how they came out. I sent oyer to Mr. Lock, the surgeon, who came immediately, and said,</p>
               <p>"Let me examine the wound;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Stop a moment" - I then said to the prisoner, (as he had only said that the pistol was loaded with ball before his wife)</p>
               <p>"Sir, were your pistols loaded with ball?" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I loaded them myself; they are in you, and I am very glad of it, I am sure they are in you." Mr. Brodie came in eight or ten minutes - the prisoner still sat in the same chair; he either threw the keys of the pistols down, or put them on the table, I do not know which; I was as collected as I am now. Mr. Brodie looked at my wound. We found the ball had gone through the wooden part of the fire skreen, hit the wall, and fallen down on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140004"/>ground, where it was found. I got up, and felt something run down my side, and took the ball out of my breeches - it had gone through my coat and waistcoat, and lodged in my breeches. The prisoner took out a letter, and threw it on the table; his wife got up, seized it, and crammed it into her pocket. I afterwards said,</p>
               <p>"By the bye, where is that letter?" The prisoner immediately said, looking at her in rather a spiteful manner,</p>
               <p>"Oh! I suppose you have burnt it" - she said, No, and threw it on the table. I took hold of it, and said,</p>
               <p>"I presume I may read this letter;" she said, Yes. I took it up; it was rather dirty and torn; I could scarcely make it out; he looked across the table, and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! No, to be sure you cannot read it, you never saw it before." I never had seen it before, so help me God. I gave it to Mr. Locke. He repeated several times that he thought the bullets were in me, and seemed mortified when they were found, and said he knew very well he should suffer for it. He said to me,</p>
               <p>"You are a serpent, you have stung me in the most vital part." I said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, you do me an injustice, I never did you an injury." I never had the slightest intercourse with his wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. However innocent you may have been, you are quite sensible that he was under the influence of jealousy, however improperly excited - A. From his observations I presume he was. I have seen his wife seven or eight times within the last twelve or eighteen months. I am now unmarried, and was so at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen her between Christmas-eve and the 1st of January - A. She called on me on the 26th, about eleven o'clock in the morning. I had told him before that if I saw or heard of her, I would acquaint him, and did so, and he came about five o'clock on the 26th - I said,</p>
               <p>"Good God, have you received my letter already?" he said, Yes, and asked me if she was inclined to come back to him; I said,</p>
               <p>"I really cannot say, she seems frightened." I did not see her from the 26th to the 1st of January. I live in New-street, Dorset-square, and he near Finsbury-square. He said he had got on the stage and come up. I was never at his house but once in my life; he was present then. His wife had left him twice I believe. I know of nothing to make him have any ill-will towards me. When I procured his wife the pension, she was between seven and eight years old.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was fetched, and got to the General's house between five and six o'clock; several people were then in the parlour. The General said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Locke, I am shot; that man has shot me," (pointing to the prisoner.) I desired him to sit down, for me to examine the wound; he said he wished first to put some questions to the prisoner, and asked him to be candid and acknowledge if the pistols were loaded with ball - he replied that they were; I then examined the wound, and found the ball had passed through the coat, waistcoat, and shirt, and considerably grazed the side, directly over the left ribs, for about an inch and a half - if it had struck a little above it would have entered the lungs and produced death. I was convinced that the ball had not entered the side, but the General said he thought it had, and the prisoner said he hoped it had. I proposed examining him to see if he had more pistols - he took out seven or eight balls, and declared that he had no more pistols; he had given up two to the watchman. Both balls were found while I was there; one had passed through the wooden part of the fire skreen. I have the letter.</p>
               <p>(Read.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Reynolds, No. 2, Little Peter-street, Sun-street, Bishopsgate, December 21.</p>
               <p>"Sir, There is scarcely a newspaper comes out of press, but somebody's wife has left them, and it always happens that it is without any provocation - now it does not stand to reason so many women would leave their homes without a reason: - the truth is, there are so many men, nasty beasts, drunken, discontented, gambling wretches, who neither care for wife nor family, so that they get their g - ts filled, and I do not doubt but you are one of that sort.</p>

I saw him do something to the window, and go away three or four times, and then saw him put something into his pocket; he went away, and stood by a dead wall for two or three minutes, then went to the window again, and as he came back, I saw him putting something more into his pocket; he put something into his jacket and trowsers' pockets, and could hardly get it in - he returned a third time, and put his arm half into the window - Wales came out, and he ran away. I told Wales what I had seen. I was about six yards off, and am certain of him.</p>

I have known the prisoners about three years; they were never at my house before the prisoner James came, which was last Saturday three weeks, about seven o'clock at night; I was at home, alone - I had seen him three months before. He knocked at the door, and asked if I would go and have something to drink; I never drank with him before; I refused to go three or four times, and said my husband had just gone out, and would be in in a few minutes, and I could not think of leaving - he said I might as well. I said I was going for some potatoes, and went with him. I told him when I was in Orchard-street, that I could not stop many minutes, for I had double locked the door and left the key in, and that my husband's watch hung over the fire-place, and if it should be taken it would be a terrible thing. I went to the Castle, public-house, Strutton-ground with him, into a back room, as he said his brother and two other friends were there - we sat down and had a glass of rum and water; he put it on the table, and told his brother he was going out after a man; he whispered in his brother's ear, and went out. I said I would go with him, as I could not stop; he said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! no, stop and drink, I shall not be many minutes," and so I stopped. He returned in about eight minutes. I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140007"/>home immediately; and found the room door shut, but not locked - I had double locked it. I missed the watch from over the fire-place; it had three seals, a ring, and a steel chain to it. I immediately went back to the house, and found James only there - I told him somebody had taken my watch, and it could be nobody but him, for nobody else knew that the key was left in the door; he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I have not got it, perhaps your husband has been and taken it, to frighten you;" I asked for his brother - he said he was gone out. I said it was a planned thing between them to make away with it; he said,</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, so help me God; I could not go up into your room without making marks with my shoes;" it was dirty, and there were no marks - I said he could pull his shoes off, and there was a mat at the door. I went home, and found my husband there; he had not got it. I returned to the public-house, and found them both there; I told James he must have it - his brother jumped up, and threatened to kick me out of the room, and I came away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been married - A. Eleven months. I never lived at Chelsea. I thought it no harm to go and drink with him; he persuaded me to go. I never drank with him before. I was not out a quarter of an hour. It struck me before I opened the door that somebody had been in. I never gave the prisoners anything to pawn. The street door was always ajar; there are lodgers. I was married at St. Martin's Church; my maiden name was

            . I am husband of the prosecutrix - we were married at St. Margaret, Westminster, ten months ago. The watch and seals are mine. When I went out, the watch hung over the mantle-piece - I returned in half an hour or three quarters; my wife was then out, the door locked, and the key not in it. I never saw the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you did not know of their being in your room - A. No. When my wife returned, she asked if I had been and took the watch; she said that she had been out for a quarter of an hour for some potatoes, and a person came to the door, and asked her to have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she had just been questioning that person about the watch - A. No. She said she had been with a friend, who she had seen before, and suspected him of stealing it. She was in service in Dean-street, Soho before I married her. I did not ask what public-house she had been to.</p>

The prisoner came up - I knew him before about the neighbourhood, and cannot be mistaken in his person - he came up and snatched the pickles out of my hand; I had seen him and Benjamin talking together before he came up. I knew them both before. I turned my face to see what he was doing with the pickles; Benjamin immediately knocked me down - I kept hold of the box, and Benjamin snatched it from me while I was on the ground; this was not half a minute after Allen snatched the pickles. I got up as quick as I could, saw Allen, and asked him where Benjamin was gone with the box; he said down the Minories. I called my uncle, and ran down the Minories with my uncle, but could see nothing of him, or the box. I saw the box afterwards at a house in Gulston-street - I did not know where Allen lived; he was taken up the same evening, and taken before the Lord Mayor, and discharged on a second hearing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was he examined twice - A. Yes. I knew his name before. He took all the pickles, saucer and all and when I asked him what had become of Benjamin he returned me the pickles - he did not ask if they were for sale, but ran off directly towards Petticoat-lane - towards Tuson-street, not towards the Minories.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Gulston-street. On the 1st of December, my son came home and said he had been robbed of his uncle's box. I went out to look for it - I went to my own door, and in about ten minutes I saw Benjamin come along with the box, wrapped in a green baize and a blanket - he came from Petticoat-lane way, not from the Minories. I stopped him, and told him he had got my property; he d - d me, and said he would have my life unless I let the box go. I followed him about twenty yards, and said I would have the box; I did not care for his threats. The prosecutor is my brother-in-law - he came up; I said,</p>
               <p>"Here is your property;" he went to take the box off Benjamin's shoulder, but Benjamin threw it down, and knocked him down twice, and got off before we could get an officer. We had Allen taken in Petticoat-lane - he said he knew nothing of it, and before the Lord Mayor, he said he only took a bit of pickle. Benjamin and him are constant companions; I frequently see them go out together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you open the box - A. Yes; it was empty. I had seen it a day or two before; it was well stocked then. I have spoken to none of Benjamin's family. The Minories are about a hundred yards from Gulston-street - a person coming from the Minories might come the way he did.</p>

            . I live in Little Ayliff-street, and am a hawker. I was with Hassan, and gave him my box to take home - I had packed it up myself; it contained the articles stated in the indictment; it was locked; he carried it for me, and had the pickles in a saucer. I went with him to the corner of Houndsditch, and told him to stop by the church while I went into Wright's shop, and in about ten minutes he came in, and said he had lost it. I went with my nephew into the Minories, and in Gulston-street, found Hassan's mother had stopped Benjamin. I laid hold of the box - he knocked me down twice, and ran away, leaving the box behind, with a blanket and a green cloth, which did not belong to me. I examined it directly - found it broken open, and the drawer of it empty. The silks, coral beads, silver, and my license gone; they left some spices in the box. I went to the Mansion House, and got an officer, who took Allen.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JUDGE. I am a Thames Police officer. On the 30th of December, about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner at the end of Tooley-street, with something wrapped in a piece of old bag; I asked what it was; he said a piece of lead. I found it was part of a pig of lead, and appeared fresh sawn off. I asked where he got it - he said he was watching Mr. Illman's craft at Dowgate-wharf, and a man gave it him - he could not tell who the man was; and said he was going to sell it. I made enquiry, and found out the prosecutor's wharf. It matched with a piece which was afterwards produced with four pigs.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Deacon. On Sunday, the 7th of December, my master employed me to watch the prisoner, who was also in his service, and about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I concealed myself in the shop, and at half-past nine, the street door bell rang; the female servant let the prisoner in - he had no orders to come on Sunday. He went up into the kitchen; then immediately came down into the shop, and took up a tin scoop, went round the counter to a canister of green tea, and took the scoop out full; he walked into the warehouse with it - he returned and took a second, and then a third scoop full, which would be about 4 lbs. together. He came through the shop in a few minutes, and went out - I followed him into the street, collared him, and brought him back. The officer found the tea, sugar, and chocolate on him - the sugar and chocolate were not in sight where I was concealed.</p>

On the 24th of December, about five o'clock, the prisoner came in, and again about six - he had been several times before. He asked for a pair of shoes; there was a pair on the counter, with two pairs of stockings, a necklace, and a handkerchief, and while I went to get him a pair, he snatched these things up, and ran out with them - I went after him; he crossed the road, and got into some of the courts by Jacob's-wells, and got off. I described him to Harrison, who took him on Sunday. I have not found the things. I saw him going out with them.</p>

On the 6th of January, I left home between seven and eight o'clock, and left nobody at home; my wife went out before me - it was quite dark. I fastened all the doors and windows. Between nine and ten o'clock, in consequence of an alarm, I returned home, and found people outside the door. Turner, went to the back of the house, and I to the front door, which I found fastened as usual - I opened it with the key. I had seen a light up on the first floor before I got to the house; I had left a light on the ground floor myself. On opening the door, I held it in my hand - two men came rustling down stairs; I said,</p>
               <p>"You are not coming out this way," holding the door fast; they then ran to the back part of the house - one escaped, and Turner took the other, who was the prisoner; we brought him into the house, searched him, and found a picklock key, matches, a piece of wax candle, a phosphorus bottle, and 13 s., but nothing of mine. I went up stairs, found the drawers all pulled out, and all the best of my wife's wearing apparel sorted out, tied up, and taken into the shop below. My clothes were taken out of the back room, and carried into the shop. Seven spoons were taken out of the cupboard down stairs, and one from up stairs, and taken away entirely - they have not been found. Those clothes which were not so good as the rest were thrown on the floor and trampled upon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The persons who got into the house must have entered at the back - A. No, they must have got in in front, with a picklock key. I did not find my back door open - they opened it when they ran to the back of the house. Several persons followed after me into the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could any of those persons remove the property down stairs - A. No, my Lord. Twelve or thirteen picklock keys were found on the premises. I tried one to the street door; it unlocked it. They opened the back door as they went out.</p>

            . I joined the prosecutor opposite his own door. I went round to the back premises, and when I got to the door, I heard a great bustle, and before I got up to the door two men came out; the first had a dark lantern, nearly shut, but sufficiently open to shew a small light. I attempted to seize him, but did not succeed. I took the second, which was the prisoner. The lantern was found in the back ground afterwards. I pushed the prisoner into the back parlour, searched him, and found a picklock key on him, also some matches, a phosphorus bottle, and 13 s. I assisted in taking him to the watch-house, and when I returned I got a light, searched further, and close to the back parlour door, I found six more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140011"/>picklock keys, laying in the wash-house, inside the house - the back door comes from the wash-house. I found a crow-bar and hat in the garden. Till and I applied the picklock keys to the front door; one of them opened it. I went up stairs, and found the drawers broken open, and things in disorder - there were marks on the drawers and boxes, which matched with the crow-bar.</p>

            . I went out before my husband, and came home a few minutes after him, and found the prisoner in charge. A bundle was in the shop, containing two shawls, two tablecloths, and other things, which I had left locked up in the drawers; the boxes in the back room were broken open and robbed.

I immediately ran over to Tylcoat, at the corner house, called him out, and while he was coming, I ran to Ingleson's door. Tylcoat joined me - I went to the window (the other man had gone down the street and returned - he ran away); we waited while the prisoner came out at the private door. I heard the parlour door unlocked, and then he opened the street door and came out. I collared him, and asked if he lived there? he said Yes. I think he had seen us at the window. We took him into Tylcoat's house, and fetched a constable. He was searched, and nothing but one shilling found upon him. I am sure the window was shut down, for I saw him push it up. Mr. Ingleson was not at home. I saw nobody belonging to the house.</p>

About two minutes; he was walking away, but not out of my sight, and could have run away if he had liked; he turned out of Russell-street, into Museum-street. I am certain of them both.

            . I was in Russell-street, and saw Jones come off the step of Mr. Bacon's door, with the picture before him; he was dressed in a light jacket. The shopman came out after him directly; I saw him give it to Slade, and go up the street; the shopman caught hold of Slade - I took hold of the picture, and minded Slade while he pursued Jones. Slade stood by my side, and did not offer to move. Shorter ran up Museum-street, and brought Jones back directly. I am certain he is the man who brought the picture out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. COOK. Q. How far were you from the shop when Jones came out - A. Close to the shop; he walked gently. Slade stood at the corner of Duke-street, about twenty yards from the shop. I do not think a word passed between them; they never looked at each other. Slade could not get away, as I was by him, but did not hold him; there were people about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Jones could have ran off if he liked - A. I think so; he got about two hundred yards before he was taken.</p>

On the 13th of December, I made six loaves of bread, and put them into the pantry; they were safe at ten o'clock at night. About eight in the morning, I found the window broken open, a buttock and loin of beef, two loaves, and part of another gone. I saw one loaf in the possession of Baldwin next day, and am sure it is one of those I had made and baked. I had pricked it at the bottom and top, with a three pronged fork.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 23d of December, in the evening, in consequence of information, I followed a coach from the neighbourhood of the Mansion House, with Jones and Wilden; it stopped at Mr. Angus's, chemist, Whitechapel. The prisoner got out, with a basket in his hand, containing these chests. I asked what he had there - he said, two medicine chests and a roll of oil-cloth, and was taking them to Mr. Angus. We all went into the shop. Mr. Angus said he expected such things. The prisoner was asked where he had got them - he at first said that was not a fair question, but afterwards that he had them from one Hardwick, of No. 36, Compton-street, St. Giles's, a general dealer, and had no doubt but he would shew us black and white for them. We took him there. Hardwick was not at home. Dynan said, he thought we could find him at the Coach and Horses, public-house, Belton-street; and, in the way there, he suggested that one of us should go in, and ask if Dynan had had the boxes that were left there by Hardwick. Jones went in, came out, and said the landlord told him that he had. I immediately went into the house. Hardwick and the landlord were at the end of the passage. I afterwards asked him, in Dynan's presence, if he had had the two chests from him. He denied it. Dynan said,</p>
               <p>"How could you say so?" He still denied it, and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. What became of Hardwick. - A. He escaped from Wilden. I saw him and the landlord in private conversation. Dynan said he had commissioned him to sell a brace of pistols, and I found a brace in Hardwick's house. He was admitted to bail, and went with me to find Hardwick, but we could not.</p>

            . I was with Hesketh. His account is correct. I went into the public-house, by the prisoner's desire, to ask if Hardwick had left any cases there for Dynan. The landlord said he had, and Dynan had fetched them that evening. In about a minute Hesketh went in and brought Hardwick out - he said he knew nothing about them. The landlord then came to the door, and said he had never told me a word of the sort.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner was bailed. - A. Yes; and attended on the three following days at Bow-street, and accompanied us to different places to find Hardwick. Prichard's is a flash house.</p>

            . I keep the Coach and Horses, public-house, Belton-street. Hardwick is frequently at my house. I never saw him with any medicine chests in my life - he never left any at my house, or said anything to me about medicine chests or cases.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell the constable so. - A. It is his mistake. He asked if Dynan had fetched any away - I said yes; Dynan had left them at my house, tied in a handkerchief. I have frequently seen Dynan and Hardwick together. I said Dynan had left two boxes - he left one on the 22d, and one on the 23d - a little girl left the other. I was to take care of them for Dynan. When he left the first, he said he would call in a few hours for it, but he did not till the 23d, about three o'clock in the afternoon. Hardwick was never near them. I never spoke to him about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140014"/>them. The constable did not mention Hardwick's name to me, to my knowledge - I was busy serving in the bar. We did not talk together in the passage, only in the bar, so that anybody could hear. He said nothing about the boxes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Then you mean to swear that the constable is mistaken, in saying that you said Hardwick had left them. - A. I swear positively that I did not say so. I might have spoken to Hardwick in the passage, but I had no private conversation with him. I have had dealings with him - I have lent him money - I owe him 4 l. now. I never appeared here to prove an alibi. I was here twenty years ago, to give a man a character.</p>

            . I live in George-alley, and am street-keeper of Walbrook. Mr. Collins shewed me where this parcel was. I secreted myself in the doorway. About a quarter to seven o'clock I saw the prisoner coming down in a great hurry - he took the parcel up from the area as quickly as possible, and went off very quick, and unless I had been on the alert he would have got off. I sprung out and stopped him. He said a fish-woman told him it was laying there, and he thought he had as much right to it as anybody else. Mr. Green identified it at the Mansion House.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you seen the fish-woman since. - A. Never. The area has four steps, but he stooped over the rails and took it up. Anybody passing by could see it, if it had been daylight. It might be two feet from the pavement. There is a gas light about two doors off. The area is within one hundred yards of the wharf.</p>

            . I am cellarman to Mr. Hobson. I was loading the cart, and went into the cellar for another basket, and on coming up saw the prisoner, and another man, (who looked like a coachman,) take a basket out of the cart; the prisoner put it on the other man's shoulder, but the man seeing us, let it fall, and ran off; we detained the prisoner; he did not try to go away; master came out and sent for a constable; he gave no reason for doing it.</p>
               <p>Mr. HOBSON. He gave no reason why he took it.</p>

             and others. On the 2d of January I saw the prisoner walking out of the tavern with this hat in his hand. I called to him three or four times - he quickened his pace, and ran as hard as he could; I ran and collared him about one hundred yards off, with it in his hand; he had his own on - it belonged to a guest, but we are responsible for it. He said he would answer questions at the proper place.</p>

On the 9th of December, between eight and nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for some hinges, which I shewed him; he said they were too large, and asked for nails - I went to fetch them, and on returning I found this paper of fender feet moved. He said the nails were too small; I went for more, and on returning the hinges were entirely gone. I went round the counter, collared him, and asked for the paper parcel; he said he knew nothing of it. I felt his left hand pocket, and told him they were there - he said they were not; I said I was positive of it; he then took them out, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do you say these belong to you;" I said they did, and took him to the watch-house. He made a great struggle to escape.</p>

            . I live in Red Lion-street. I was working at Mr. Phillips's, in Holborn, at the back of the house, and could see into the prosecutor's yard, and saw the prisoner go up his steps - he pushed the door open, went in, pulled the door too, and came out - he looked about him, went in again, and brought the coat out in his apron. I went down stairs directly, and caught him in Brownlow-street, and asked what he did with the coat; he threw it down and ran away; I called Stop thief! Lowe stopped him. I gave the coat to Lee.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far off were you - A. About fifty yards from the spot. I lost sight of him in coming down stairs. I swear to him positively.</p>

I had observed that the windows were shut down at half-past six o'clock, and at a quarter to seven, I observed two men near the house - I turned round, looked at them, and they looked at me, and crossed over to Bulstrode-street - I got right opposite her Ladyship's house, and saw the parlour window sash open. I rang the bell, and informed the servants; I then went after the two men, but not overtaking them, I returned to the house, and was informed that there was a man in the parlour; they unlocked the door, and I found the prisoner standing at the door, inside the room. I asked what brought him there; he said he had hardly any shoes to his feet or victuals to eat. I took him into custody. The window was shut down when I passed, half an hour before.</p>

I then received a violent blow at the back of my neck by the right fist of the man, it knocked me down, and they all ran away; they then ran down Fox-lane. The blow stunned me; I went about half a mile, and then returned to the Fox, and had a woman and a man taken, who I thought to be the party; but it was done in a moment. and the night being dark I could not recognize them. I cannot be certain of the prisoner, for dress makes a great difference. I can swear to the party if she had the same dress on now. I was not at all inebriated.</p>

Between twelve and four o'clock in the day my bed-room lock was picked, the chest of drawers broken open, and this property stolen, with the duplicate of five silver tea-spoons, pawned at Chappel's, and other trinkets; they were all together in a bag; the value of the whole is near 20 l.; I had seen nobody in the house, and do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Do you occupy all the house - A. It is a large house divided into two, and has only one common stair case to both. I rent one half, and a baker the other. The landlord does not occupy any part of it.</p>

I was called down stairs about eleven o'clock, and left her alone for about ten minutes; nobody else had been there in my absence. Between seven and eight o'clock, I missed a 5 l. Bank note, which I had seen in my drawer two days before; it was No. 4799. I had twenty of them, and the numbers ran regularly, and were all dated the 1st of September. Ratcliff, who is her mother, called for her about eight o'clock that night, but did not come up stairs - they went away together. When I missed it, I said, I should certainly endeavour to find it out; she said she knew nothing about it. She went to dinner at one o'clock, and returned at two.

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of December I went to the prisoner's house, in Albion-street, Commercial-road, and found them at home. I asked Thompson where her hoop and ring were - she said on the mantle-piece. I searched the house over, but did not find them. She then said, the hoop her mother gave her was pawned in the Commercial-road. I asked if it was the hoop and ring which had been bought with the 5 l. note, at Murray's - she said, No; it was one her mother had given her. I said I was come about the 5 l. note which was stolen - that it had been stopped at the Bank, and traced to Murray, and from the description he had given, her mother had paid it. Ratcliff said she did not know where Murray's was, nor East Smithfield - that she was never there, and would go with me; but when I asked her to go she refused, but at last went with me, and begged she might have a fair chance. I said no improper advantage should be taken; we went; I asked Hall if he knew Thompson - he said not. I then asked if he knew Ratcliff, and rather think he at first said he did not. I then began to speak to Mr. Murray, and said,</p>

I passed on, and returned, they immediately came out, and all three drove it off.

I followed him to the end of Cock-lane; the other two were behind and gave a whistle - he immediately threw it down, in Smithfield, and ran away. I followed and took him, without losing sight of him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2d of January, about a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening, I was fetched. Mr. Barnard sent for the prisoner to come to the counting-house, and asked him if he had any idea of any person having taken silver polishings; he said, No. Mr. Barnard then gave him in charge. I searched him, and found the polishings in his breeches pocket; he said it was his own, that a man gave it to him. I asked, what man; he said,</p>
               <p>"You have taken me unawares, I cannot tell you." Mr. Barnard examined it, and found these tickets, with his initials, among it.</p>
               <p>MR. BARNARD. Here are the tickets I put among it. He lived fourteen years with me, and had a good character. I believe he was in distress.</p>

He came to me some time before the 30th of October, and asked if I had any silk handkerchiefs. I shewed him what I had; he chose a piece, and gave me two half-crowns on it, but did not take it away. He called again in four or five days, and desired me to get him seven or eight pieces more, of a good pattern. He called again in about three days, to know if I had them ready - I was not in the way, but on going home was informed he had been, and went to the public-house and met him. He asked why I did not let him know that I had got them - I said I had called on him several times - he appointed to see me at eight o'clock that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come at last to fetch the goods. - A. On the 30th of October; another man, called Neary, was with him. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Well, Heavens, I have brought my friend." I said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose it is your friend to buy the handkerchiefs?" He said Yes. I got them and shewed them - they were tied in a handkerchief. He said to his friend,</p>

               <p>"Bill, there they are - you may look at them." His friend examined the ends of them. I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't pull them about too much." His friend said, "Do you know that these goods are seizable?" I said, I could not say whether they were the right thing, but if they were, I supposed they were seizable. The prisoner said to me,</p>
               <p>"You be d - d; you know they are seizable." His friend said,</p>

               <p>"I am a Custom House officer, and must search your place."</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did you think him an officer - A. I did. He said,</p>
               <p>"Have you any more?" The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, get them out - you have." I had two single handkerchiefs by me, which I had shewn him the day before - I got them out by the prisoner's desire; he took them. I begged of the officer very hard not to take them, because the prisoner had paid 6 s. on them. I said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Dick, don't be so hard - you know the young man very well, who lives in London-wall, has paid me 6 s. on these, which I must pay if you take them." The officer said,</p>
               <p>"I must take them - my place stands at a stake - I must take the whole; that is your informer (pointing to the prisoner), he has lodged the information at the Custom House, and unless you can settle it with him, you will hear further of it." I said,</p>
               <p>"Settle it! - how do you mean?" He said,</p>
               <p>"You had better give him a few pounds." I said,</p>
               <p>"A few pounds! - what do you mean! - I have nothing to give him." The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Officer, I will not allow that - I will lock you up and the man immediately." The officer smiled, and said,</p>
               <p>"You had better ask him what he will take." I turned round to the prisoner, and asked what he wanted - he said he would not take a farthing less than 3 l. I said I could not give him that, but would give him a sovereign, sooner than go to the watch-house, and I must go and borrow that. He said he would not take a sovereign, and that I should immediately go to the watch-house. The man who acted as officer begged of him to consider my family; and my wife interfered, and begged of him not to be so harsh. The prisoner then said he would consider my family, and take 2 l. I said I could not give him 2 l., and could not afford to borrow it. He then jumped up, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, you shall go to the watch-house immediately, and your woman too, if you don't hold your tongue." I told him he might take me to the watch-house, I could not give him the money. I asked the officer for his authority to seize these goods; he said he would shew his authority next day, when he summoned me before the Commissioners, at eleven o'clock. I said,</p>
               <p>"I always understood officers had an authority to shew." He refused to shew any. The prisoner said I should go to the watch-house, and came towards me as if to collar me. I said then, rather than go to the watch-house, I would apply to my publican to borrow the money. They both went with me to Walter, the publican. I spoke to him, and he told me to call them forward. The prisoner came forward, and the other man ran out with the goods. I have not seen them since.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner saw the other man take the goods from your house - A. Yes. I then told the publican I wanted to borrow 2 l. He said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say you will take 2 l. from this man?" The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Heavens, are you dissatisfied?" I said</p>
               <p>"No; if my friend will advance the money I will let you have it, sooner than go to the watch-house." Walter said he would not let me have it; and told the prisoner if I had done wrong to take me up. He said,</p>
               <p>"I can take him tomorrow morning." Walter said he could not take me tomorrow any more than to-day; and if he had done wrong, to summon me before the Commissioners, and he would attend and trounce him for extorting money under false pretences. He then left the house. I expected to hear from the Custom House about my having the goods. He was taken up about a month afterwards. I should have taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140023"/>him before, but I expected to hear from the Custom House. I enquired at the Custom House for Neary, but have not been able to find him - he was not known there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You asked for Neary at the Custom House - A. No; I asked for Mr. Steel. I went to enquire if the prisoner or Neary were officers. I knew his name was Neary, because Wells, who was at the public-house, told me his name. I have dealt in handkerchiefs about four times. I never sold four pieces to one person. A friend of mine sent a person to me with them. I cannot say whether they are Foreign or British - I never asked what they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not believe them to be contraband - A. I cannot say what they were; I called them India. I live in Lovell's-court, Paternoster-row.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you began to look after the prisoner or Neary - A. It might be more than two months. Neary carried the goods with him to the public-house. I could not prevent his going away with them if he was an officer.

            . I keep the Crown, public-house, St. Paul's Church-yard. The prisoner and Heavens came to my house; another person was with them. When the prisoner was present, Heavens called me aside, and in consequence of what he said, I asked the prisoner what he wanted Heavens to give him 2 l. for - he said it was a matter of no consequence to me, and asked Heavens whether he meant to give him the money or not; he said he had not got it, and I would not lend it him. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"It is no matter, you will hear of me to-morrow;" turned on his heels, and walked off - I do not know what became of the other man; he had followed Heavens in in the first instance. I told him, in the prisoner's presence, that it was a scandalous shame to try to extort money from a man with such a family - he made no answer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what part of the transaction did Neary go away - A. They did not stop above five minutes - nobody came in while they were there. Neary went away first, and then in two minutes the prisoner went, saying he should hear of him to-morrow at eleven o'clock.</p>

            . I am an officer, and apprehended the prisoner a fortnight ago. I first took him in a public-house in St. Paul's Church-yard.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW to HEAVENS. Q. Do you know the prisoner's brother - A. Yes; I went to him and told him his brother had robbed me, and if they were not paid for nor returned, and it was proved they were not officers, the prisoner must take the consequence of it; but if they were paid for, or returned, I should not see any further into it.</p>
               <p>GEORGE O'CONNELL. I am an officer of the Customs. I know of no officer of the name of Neary.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Are there not many officers of different names - A. Yes. If a man is an officer, it is easily proved - even if the man is absent.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating himself to have been made the dupe of an artful man; he was induced by him to lay information against persons dealing in contraband goods - that he went to the Excise office, and saw a man in the passage, of whom he enquired for an officer, and he said he was one, and could make a seizure for him, and agreed to accompany him to the prosecutors - the officer agreed to take 2 l. to settle the business; they went to the public-house, and soon after he missed the man.</p>
               <p>C. H. LORD. I am a Revenue officer. The prisoner applied to me three or four times on the subject of contraband goods - it might be four months ago that he said he knew where some silk handkerchiefs could be seized, and he believed the man who had them was poor, but he thought he fetched them from another house. I was in St. Paul's Church-yard with him, and he said it was not five minutes walk from there, and he had better see if the goods were there, as I had told him. I must take my oath that they were on the premises. I never made a seizure through his information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You told him an officer must have a warrant before he made a seizure - A. Yes. I think he said he had been intimate with the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him since the 30th of October - A. I think I saw him in October, but not after - there are offices at which inquiries can be made for Custom House officers, but I have known people wander about the building for two days, before they could know where to lay an information - there is a room to apply for an officer to make a seizure.</p>
               <p>- NORMAN. I am a messenger to the Board of Excise. The prisoner has applied to me about seizures; he told me three or four months ago, that he knew of some goods; that is all. I referred him to Lord.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he ever ask you to make a seizure - A. No. He did not say in what street the goods were. We have a messengers' office; any one coming in there can get what information they want.</p>
               <p>- OWEN. I am the prisoner's brother. The prosecutor applied to me to make up the money for these goods, and said, on my not complying, he should certainly proceed, he thought it would hang him, and so forth.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He told you he must either have his money or goods, or he would prosecute - A. Yes.</p>

The goods were on view - the prisoner came and asked for a catalogue; I said we should have some in ten minutes. He went up into the drawing-room; I had put the timepiece on the mantle shelf five minutes before. I looked out of the second floor window, and saw him going down the court with something under his coat. I followed, and overtook him, and said,</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, I think you have a time-piece which don't belong to you;" he said he had not - I looked, and saw it under his coat, and said he must go back. He begged for mercy, said he did it from want, and had had no victuals for two days.</p>

On the 29th of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for a pelisse; she selected one, which came to 36 s. She was some time looking it out, and after choosing one, tendered me a 5 l. note. I asked her how she came by it, as I thought it strange, from her appearance, that I should take a 5 l. note of her. She said a gentleman had given it to her. I asked her whether she was certain of it, and if she could swear that a gentleman gave it her - she said a gentleman in Holborn gave it to her. I then took it, and went down from the shew-room into the shop, and gave the note to Mr. Smith. He went over to Mr. Perkins, a linen-draper, with it - returned and told me something, and gave her 3 l. 4 s. in change. I asked her where she lived, and what was her name - she said,</p>

I did not mark it before I gave it to Smith. I told an officer about it; and, on the 5th of December, Herring and I went to No. 6, Hartshorn-court, Golden-lane, and she was coming out at the door.

            . On Monday, the 1st of December, the prisoner came and purchased a pelisse - Sales tried it on. I told the prisoner the price of it; she took out a small dirty pocket-book, and gave me a 5 l. note. I directly took it to Mr. Pite, who was in the shop; he went out immediately with it. The prisoner sat down in a chair for a moment; she then rose from her chair, went to the shop door, and asked the price of a cloak at the door. I told Sales not to take it down, and she walked away - she could not hear me tell Sales not to take it down.</p>

On the 1st of December, in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, went into the shew-room, and after a short time my wife brought a 5 l. note into the shop to me; I suspected it was bad, and took it to Mr. Fleetwood, an inspector, who lives in Providence-row - returned in about ten minutes, and she was gone. - (Looks at a note.) - This is it; I have endorsed it</p>

            . I am an officer. I attended at Bow-street, and heard the prisoner examined, what she said was not taken down; I stood close to the clerk, and am sure he did not write it down. In the way to the office, she had hold of my arm, and asked me several times what she was taken up for. I did not answer her, and just as I came through Smithfield, she asked me again. I asked if she had had any 5 l. notes lately - she replied,</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, I passed a 5 l. note for a pelisse, in Cranbourne-alley, to that man," pointing to Sampson, and said she gave 36 s. for it, and had invited Sampson to come and see her. I asked how she came by the note; she said, if she must tell the truth, she had picked up a gentleman in Holborn, who was very much in liquor, and had robbed him of it, and she had no doubt, if that was bad, all the notes were bad, that the gentleman had a large roll of notes, and she took one out of the middle of it. When she got to the office she stated the same to the Magistrates. She was charged, at the second examination, with uttering a note to Pite; what she said was not taken down; she denied all knowledge of it, and said she never had a 5 l. note in her possession in her life, but the one she passed in Cranbourne-street, and denied having been at Pites, or that they had ever seen her there in their lives.

Clewley stepped forward at the same moment, and asked if I had anybody in the parlour - I went into the parlour, and found the prisoner at one corner, behind the blind; I asked what he wanted; he gave no answer; I asked him again; he said he did it from distress, and hoped I would let him go. The window sash was down before, and the blinds down; but the sash not fastened. I found it wide open; I had come in about five o'clock; it was shut then, and had not been opened afterwards.

I watched, and saw him go to Mr. Cathrow's house - the boy went up to the door and rang. I stepped on, and hid myself behind a weather board, to watch; the boy lingered about the steps. The door was opened and closed again. I came forward, and saw the prisoner standing inside, in front of the window, which was wide open - I had not seen him get in; I could not from behind the board.

On Christmas-eve the prisoner came into the room - we were having a pint of beer; I asked him to drink. (We always locked the room-door when we went out, and took the key). He paid me for three weeks' lodging which he owed, and for a week forward, which was 10 s., and when he came in at night we quarrelled - my friends threatened to turn him out. He said he should go when he liked, as he had paid his week's lodging. My wife threw down 2 s., and said</p>
               <p>"Take your money." I said we had lost a good deal; he swore he knew nothing about it. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why you took a razor out of my top drawer" - he said that was in his box, but he knew nothing of the sovereigns. On the morning of the 21st, I found a pair of men's gloves behind my drawers, I immediately called him, and said,</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on Christmas-day; he gave me his key; I found a razor in his box; he said he had frequently shaved the prosecutor with it, and thought it no harm to have it in his box. Archer said he had shaved him with it. I found nothing else. I charged him with stealing sovereigns, which he denied, and said he had received some sovereigns, and two of them were in the hands of Mr. Branch, a baker; that he had just received a legacy of 8 l. 18 s. from somebody in Broad-street, who he named, and put two sovereigns into Branch's hands. He produced two letters from the country, with the post-mark upon them, which stated that he was to receive a legacy; he said he never had any gloves, and never wore any - I produce a pair.</p>

On the 6th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, or rather earlier, I was at tea in my parlour, with my door open, and heard glass break. I went into the shop, and found a pane of glass broken in the window, and two men standing outside, at the broken pane. I pursued into the street, and seized them both at the window. I struggled with them, and one escaped; the other, who was the prisoner, I secured. During the struggle with the prisoner a watch fell from him, which I produce - I picked it up, called</p>
               <p>"Watch," and after a short time the constable came and took him. I examined my window, and found a piece broken out of the glass, and a watch gone, which had laid within an inch of the glass - a man could not get it without putting his hand through the broken pane. He said,</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken, I am not the man." I am sure the watch fell from him - it is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was it not light enough to discern a man's features - A. Certainly not - it was more than half-past five o'clock - my street door was open, but the inner door was shut - the watch was within an inch of the glass - a person's elbow could not knock it out; it fell from the prisoner after the other man escaped - it fell from the prisoner I am certain. The other man could not have dropped it, and the prisoner picked it up, for when I came out, I saw a hand come from the window, with the watch in it - I am confident that it was the prisoner's hand - the hole was hardly large enough for the hand to come out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw two people at your window, and on going out found two there - A. Yes, my Lord.</p>

               <p>"We do." They said a young man brought the bundle there, and they did not know who he was. I said that was very extraordinary. They said they did not know who the man was - that he brought it up, and asked to leave it there. Mrs. Stanton came into the room while I was questioning them, and immediately went out again. Stanton occupied the parlour only.</p>

             had a quarrel about jumping in sacks; Gibson had a sack of his master's (Fawcett,) and George's master was owner of the sacks they were jumping in. George claimed the sack Gibson had; words arose, Fawcett said,</p>
               <p>"If it is not his sack, you have no occasion to be bouncing about it, my man shall fight you for a leg of mutton and trimmings." one shilling was staked by each of them, they were to fight on the following Monday, but Gibson did not come forward. They met at the Bird-Cage on Wednesday, there was no malice or anger; about seven hundred people were present; the prisoner was there and took part in it. I cannot exactly say what the prisoner did, but he picked Gibson up at different times. Pell was the principal man, he was Gibson's second; it was a very equal match, and appeared a fair fight to me; only at the first round Gibson hit

               <p>"foul" - they fought an hour and five minutes; George had the best of it for the first half hour; nobody endeavoured to part them but Lloyd; he went to Gibson, and said, he had better leave off; but he said, he thought too much of his sovereign, and persisted in fighting; about the end of the battle, George struck a blow on the head and temple, and Gibson fell several times; he received several blows on the head, they were given fair; he fell at the last blow, and could not get up; Gibson was beat very much, and had one eye blinded; he died in about twenty minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner from the beginning of the fight, tell your brother he had better leave off - A. I cannot tell, because I was not near enough; I did not tell my brother, that if I was him I would fight till I died. I advised him to leave off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner do any thing more, than humanely assist your brother when he saw him down - A. No, he picked him up several times, and washed his face with a spunge.</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Collyer desired me to watch his house, and on the 28th of December, about twenty minutes past eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come out with a bundle. I stopped him five doors off, and asked what he had got; he said his dirty linen to be washed; I said if so it was all right - he said he had nothing but what was his own. I took him to the watch-house, and found 3 1/8 lbs. of sugar, and 19 ozs. of coffee in his bundle, which also contained dirty linen. I sent for his master, who said, "What, I have caught you at last, you have been robbing me." He said it was the first time he had taken anything.</p>

He was my porter, and boarded in the house, and had 16 l. a year.</p>

I gave information,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140030"/>and on the 11th of August, two shoulders of gold beaters' skin were produced. I went to the prisoner's house, Providence-place, St. Luke's, and found him there at last, in January. When we went on the 11th of August we found two crucibles with a portion of gold in one - it appeared to have melted about the quantity of gold I had lost.</p>

            . I am an officer, and accompanied Mr. Tyrer to the prisoner's lodgings on the 11th of August - I found a key on the stairs, which opened the door, and found two crucibles there. I have been looking for him ever since, but did not go to his house.</p>

            . I am a gold and silver flatter. On Sunday morning, the 10th of August, the prisoner gave me these skins to sell for him. I offered them next day to Mr. Dunford, who asked me if I had not heard of Tyrer's robbery. I recollected myself, and said Yes; and I would have nothing more to do with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. I work at a flatting-mill. Mr. Tyrer has had goods flattened at our mill, and had told me of the robbery a few days after it happened. I heard that he lived in Bridgewater-gardens, but did not exactly know the number of the house - I did not know what he had lost. I told Dunford I knew who I had them from - I did not mention his name. He said they were worth nothing. The prisoner said, as I knew the gold-beaters, I could sell them - that they were left at his house, and he did not know what to do with them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you known him - A. About ten years; he jobs about as a wheelwright.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. After you were apprehended did not you go to his house and tell his wife, that what you did was to serve yourself - A. No; she came to me, and begged me not appear against him.</p>
               <p>MR. DUNFORD. I told this witness they were worth nothing; and said I knew where to find him. He said he knew who he got them from.</p>
               <p>MR. TYRER. I received the shoulders from Tillott, and can swear to them - my private mark is on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Tillott was taken up himself - A. Yes, five or six days after the robbery; he was committed for a week, and his master gave his word for his appearance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about it. I have been at home ever since, and about the neighbourhood. On the Friday before Tillott was apprehended, he brought a piece of gold and silver to my house, and sent me to sell it; I received 1 l. 6 s. 9 d. for it. He gave me 2 s. for going.</p>

            . I am a commodore in the Company's service, and superintend the labourers. On the 26th of December, the prisoner came to work at eight o'clock, and was repairing a chest of black tea; at half-past eight he was sent on an errand - returned in half an hour; was sent out again at a quarter to ten, and should have come back in half an hour - he returned about a quarter to one o'clock, and appeared to have drank rather too much, but was sufficiently sober to work, or I should have reported it to the elder; he went to work, and in a quarter of an hour I saw him putting his right hand into a chest and take it out full of tea, and put it into his breeches pocket. I thought I must be deceived, but I watched and saw him do it again. I got within three yards of him; he came to me and said, "Master, will you come to-night and take something to drink, and smoke a pipe?" I said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will, Collins." He then returned to the chest, repeated it again, and I reported it to the elder; he was searched, and about 10 ozs. of Congo tea found upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you the least suspicion of him before - A. Not the least; he was a hard-working, quiet man. Three other men had been out with him - all four were drunk; he did not know that I saw him. I do not think he would have done it if he had been sober.</p>

            . I am a wheelwright, and live at Chelsea. On Thursday, the 8th of June, the prisoner came to my shop with the dashing-iron of a chaise. I first saw him on that day in a yard in Duck-lane; a man called me in, and I found the prisoner in the yard. I bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140032"/>a pair of wheels of the man - he said there were more wheels to be sold; that they belonged to the prisoner (who did not deny it). I asked the price; the prisoner said, 2 l. 10 s. for the axletree and wheels. I offered 2 l. - he said I should have them, and offered to sell me some springs and other things for 30 s. I paid him 5 s. in part. We each agreed to give a man 2 s. 6 d. to take them home, and soon after five o'clock they were brought. He came to the Cross Keys, public-house, and I paid him the rest. The splinter-bar was missing; he said it must have dropped out of the cart. The prosecutor saw and claimed all I bought of him - he said it was his own.</p>

On the 4th of January, I had been to Pall Mall, to see my aunt home; I lived with Mr. Beaufoy then, but lodged in New-road, South Lambeth.

               <p>"Stand, I demand your money, or else I'll blow your brains out." I told him I had got none; he said,</p>
               <p>"- You have." He still held the pistol to my face. Two more men came up instantly, and I stepped a foot or two back with my face to him; he followed me up, put the pistol to my temple, and said,</p>
               <p>"Positively I will blow your brains out, if you don't deliver your money;" they had all three laid hold of me, the man had his hand on my breast, when he said he would positively blow my brains out, but the others had not touched me at that time; they then laid hold of me, the man who presented the pistol having hold of my breast; one held me round the waist, and the other held me by the left arm. I said,</p>
               <p>"I will see you d - d before I give you money," and instantly made a rush to get away, and got loose from them. I cried out Murder, and the man who had the pistol immediately fired. I only called murder once; I did not see him fire; but saw the direction of the pistol, it was directed to me; the ball came so near as to brush against my hat, and knock it off. I caught it with my left hand on the top of my head; it knocked my hat up, the ball came under the hat brim; they all three ran off directly; the one who took hold of me behind, ran across the road - the other two ran through into Rochester-row, which leads out of the road. I followed them, and cried Stop thief! and saw one of them cross the row - they ran down the row; one crossed over the road - I believe that was the man who fired the pistol. I kept the other in my sight, and saw a soldier, who ran faster than me, catch him - it was the prisoner Raines; he is the man - I never lost sight of him. The soldier brought him back to the guard-house. Pace, the officer, came and searched him immediately, and found three or four pistol-balls and a powder-flask on him - he was searched within five minutes of his being taken. I saw Elliott in custody on the Friday following (this was on Sunday). I rather thought that he might be the person who fired, but when I came to see, the prisoner Wren (which was on the Tuesday following), I was satisfied that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140033"/>he was the man who fired; he was taken on the Monday night or Tuesday morning, early.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Elliott, you at first thought he was the man who fired - A. Yes; but on seeing them both together on the Tuesday following, I believed Wren to be the man, by seeing him with his hat on, and believe now that Wren is the man who fired. He had some black stuff over his eyes when he fired - it came half way over his nose - I think it came over his eyes; he was the tallest of the three at the time; they all had their hats on. Wren, I believe, had blue or dark trowsers on; and, I think, a dark coat, and lightish waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the means of observing the dress of the other man, who you now call Elliott - A. Yes; by his height, and his dress, and figure, I think it was him - his dress was nearly like Wren's, I do not think there was any difference. I believe, on my oath, that those two men were both present at the time; the other man was not out of my sight till he was taken. I had drank nothing, and was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were a good deal alarmed - A. Yes; it was a darkish night, but this happened just under a lamp. I never saw either of them before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Your attention was more taken up with your escape than observing the parties - A. Yes; one of them was behind me. I have the hat which I wore - there is no mark on it. I believe it was the swiftness of the bullet coming under it that knocked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. The pistol was so near to you that the wind of it could raise your hat without a bullet - A. Yes; I found no bullet - I thought there was a bullet.</p>
               <p>Q. One man being behind you, you had not much opportunity of seeing him - A. I saw him coming up - they both came up together. When I saw Wren, they put a hat on him, which was found that night, and I thought he was the man. It was not put on Elliott.</p>
               <p>Q. The hat made you form that conclusion - A. The hat and his appearance - it appeared to fit him the same as it did on the night in question. I could not see his forehead so well as, if it had been uncovered; they put nothing black on his face when they tried it on. He was about a yard from me when he fired - the muzzle of the pistol was within a few yards of me - it might raise my hat without a ball. Before they fired, I had said I would see them d - d first.</p>

            . I belong to the first regiment of the second battalion of the Grenadier Guards. On the 4th of January, a few minutes before eight o'clock, I was talking to my comrade, Harper, at the corner of the guard-room, in Rochester-row, and heard the report of a pistol or gun about two hundred yards off, and heard a man cry out Murder! I immediately afterwards heard somebody sing out Stop thief! Both the cries came from the spot where I heard the report. The corporal said something to me - I looked that way, and saw a man coming up Rochester-row, on the opposite side to me, running from where I heard the report. I ran after him - I saw no other man in pursuit. I did not see the prosecutor till I secured the man and brought him back to the guard-room. I pursued him about two hundred yards - he was running very fast; and as I ran after him he said,</p>
               <p>"What are you running after me for - I have done nothing?" I said,</p>
               <p>"There is a cry of Stop thief - run as hard as you will, I'll overtake you presently" - and took him at the corner of Vincent-square, brought him to the guard-room, and just as I got to the door, the prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"That is one of the men that stopped me in the Vauxhall-road." I gave him in charge of the corporal, and immediately sent for Pace - it was the prisoner Raines. Pace searched him, and found four small pistol balls on him, and a glass bottle with powder in it; he also found a small piece of cane in his pocket, which, I think, had been used as a ramrod.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. A ramrod is wanted whether you use powder only, or ball - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square, and live in Rochester-terrace, Vauxhall-road. I heard a call of Stop thief, about eight o'clock at night, as I sat by my fire; I immediately ran out; a man was coming up the steps, who said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake go down - there is a man stopped for a highway robbery!" and just as I got into the guard-room I saw Raines, and sent for my handcuffs - handcuffed and searched him, and found four bullets upon him - I do not think that they were moulded, but merely squeezed from the lead - a bottle with gunpowder in it, and a piece of cane, one end being rather forced up, apparently by pressure. Just after I had searched him, Stiff brought in a hat, and a piece of black stuff in it. I inspected it very minutely, and found the name of</p>
               <p>"J. Wren" in it; and knowing Wren well, and knowing that he wore such a hat, I apprehended him on Monday, the 12th, between twelve and one o'clock at night - I had been looking for him nearly every night - I have known him three or four years - I knew his lodgings, but could not find him there, nor at the places he frequented. I went to his lodgings once. I took him on the 12th, at twenty minutes to one o'clock in the morning, at a house of ill fame, No. 3, Almonry, on the second floor. I got in at the front of the house, broke two room doors open, and found him in bed with a girl of the town. When I got into the room, I asked who was there - he put his head out, and said</p>
               <p>"It is me, what do want with me?" He knew me very well - I had a light in my hand. I asked his name, and understood him to say Wilson, but will not be certain that he did not say Austin. I took him into custody. He asked if I wanted him for felony - I said I did. He dressed himself, and said he hoped I would not handcuff him, but I did immediately. I said,</p>
               <p>"Where is your hat?"</p>
               <p>"Here it is," said he, and put a paper cap on his head, saying,</p>
               <p>"That is all the hat I have got." And while I was taking him out of the room he said,</p>
               <p>"I know what you want me for now - I am sure of being topped," which means hanging. I took him to the watch-house. I went to Raines' room on the morning of the 5th of January, and knocked at the door; his wife answered, and in the room I found a large vice, which screws up. I had the balls in my pocket; I put one into the vice, and it exactly corresponded with the inside of the vice. On the same day (5th) I went in search of Elliott, and found him near Salisbury-square, Fleet-street, and told him I wanted him, on suspicion of a highway robbery; searched him, and in his left hand pocket I found three flints, a small key, 2 s. 6 d., and a quantity of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. - Q. Raines never admitted to you that they were his lodgings which you went to - A. No.</p>

On the 2d of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, or rather later - it was dark - I was going out, and observed that the shop window was lifted up; I had seen it down a quarter of an hour before - I had not remained in the shop during that quarter of an hour. I missed a spencer from the window; any one could have put a hand in and taken it. I immediately returned and told my partner, and we agreed to watch. I went into the street, and saw some trimming hanging from the window. I saw the prisoner in company with a young man; both walked up to the window - the prisoner went and took a piece of trimming. I immediately went up and secured him; the other walked off. The spencer has not been found.</p>
               <p>FREDBRICK STEVENSON. I was in the back parlour, and in consequence of what passed, we watched. I stood inside, and saw the prisoner come to the window at different times, and saw a man with him once, but did not see the trimming taken.</p>

On Thursday, I was waiting by the house, and met him with my coat, of which I had given him the duplicate - he said he had taken it out, for it was only running up to interest, and if I would hold it, he would go and redeem the rest of the things, which were pawned opposite the house, for 2 l. I called him back, and told him he was not to take them out, for I would pay him to-morrow. We went and had two or three pots of beer, and I saw him with three sovereigns.</p>

            . I am an officer, and apprehended the prisoner on the 22d of December, about eight o'clock in the evening, at a public-house in Ratcliffe-highway. I said I believed he was the man I wanted for robbing his lodging; he said he had not. I asked where he lodged; and he mentioned some name, not the prosecutor's; he had two waistcoats on. I asked where he got them, and how long he had had them: he said he brought them from home, out of the country. I found a purse, a sovereign, and seventeen and sixpence on him, which he said was his wages; the waistcoats answered the description I had received. I said,</p>
               <p>"You are the man, I shall send for the prosecutor;" he then said, those clothes did belong to his landlord's son, and he had brought them away that morning from Henry-street, and the money was what he had received for part of the things, at a shop at the bottom of the Minories; he took me next morning to Searl's, at the corner of Rosemary-lane; they denied buying any of the things.</p>

            , and one hundred by the Union. I had known the prisoner for years before that. After a certain time there is a rent to be paid for goods before they are delivered. I receive a delivery warrant when the Company are paid, and when we want the goods, we write receipts on the warrants, and change them for others in the Company's possession - they are delivered to the warehouse-keeper. I went to the prisoner, who was clerk at the office in Austin-friars. I have a cheque in my hand for 523 l. 17 s, 1 d.; here is our cheque-book - it tallies with the margin. I had to pay a large sum at the East India House that day for these goods - this cheque was given to me. I took it to Messrs. Lubbock's, and fined by, looking at the warrants, that it was on the 21st of October, 1813. I cannot recollect going to Lubbock's, but I have no doubt of it; for it was my province alone. No other person was entrusted to clear East India cottons. My usual practice was to have a cheque which I received at Lubbock's, and from there went to the warehouse to pay the rent on the goods. I had had other transactions with the prisoner; the course was for him to write on the warrants</p>

               <p>"D - d," which means delivered, with his initials - these warrants are so marked, and have his initials. I have seen him write a thousand times. I paid him upon these warrants, 479 l. 13 s. 9 d., with the same money as I had from Lubbocks, for I had no other means of paying it. I had other money to pay in Jewry-street, which I paid also.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the practice as to your taking change - A. If the change exceeds 10 s. we generally take it with us; if not, they give us change. I must have paid him 479 l. 13 s. 9 d. for during the whole fifteen years I have been in this situation I never received a bale of cotton without the rent being paid previously.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At this distance of time you do not rely on your memory, but reason from circumstances - A. Yes; but as soon as the prisoner absented himself I was called upon to inform the Company what I had paid, and this sum was among it. I have sent my son to receive cottons, but did not on this occasion, for the receipts are in my writing. I have done business to the amount of thousands with the prisoner; my constant practice was to go to the banker's for the money. I never recollect paying money there which I had not received for a cheque, but it may have happened. I never paid any monies but to the East India Company, except petty cash, and I never change a 100 l. note for petty cash. The prisoner always received the money at the office.</p>

The prisoner was employed in the office under me: it was his duty to receive money brought for warehouse rent. The warrants are brought by the merchants' clerks; the prisoner's duty was to receive them, search for the counterparts, see if they agreed, and then to receive the rent; it is necessary to calculate, to see if the merchant made it right, and then write a line on each counterpart, and place his initials at the end, as a guarantee to the Commodore to deliver the goods (looking at the warrants) - these all have the prisoner's writing on them, and his initials; it was his business to receive the money, and if he was at leisure, the very next moment, to enter certain items of it into a small book - this is the book he kept (looks at it) - it begins on the 25th of June, 1813, and ends on the 15th of October, 1814 - the entries on the 21st of October, 1813, are in his writing, and contain an account of warehouse rent received on Truemans' cottons; they may have been delivered on a subsequent day; there is a column for the rent due, the number of weeks, the amount, and the initials of the chief clerk; there is 378 l. 2 s. 6 d. entered as Truemans', in three different sums. I have examined the warrants with the entries; here are seven warrants included in the three entries, and three are entirely omitted, amounting to 101 l. 11 s. 3 d.; my initials, as chief clerk, are opposite the sums entered, by which I know that I received these sums from him, and no more, at that or any other time. I never received the 101 l. 11 s. 3 d. - I have looked through his book; there is no entry whatever of these three warrants, or of the rent being paid on them. I pay the money I receive over to Mr. Saunders's bankers, Martin and Co.; and did so on that day, with other sums, for other lots, amounting to 402 l. in all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner's duty given to him by the Company, or by the chief clerk - A. I cannot say - he accounted to me, and I accounted to Mr. Saunders, the deputy warehouse-keeper for it - he absconded on the 8th of December, 1814. I believe no discovery was made till that time; the warrants had been in a drawer all that time, and in his custody - he paid me only two other sums on that day - they were 7 l. 10 s. and 8 s. 6 d. - he brought me the warrants to compare with the entries.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had destroyed the warrants, would there be any trace left to find this out - A. By referring to the delivery book it would be discovered; those entries would be made by other clerks. I retired from the service in 1815, in consequence of ill health.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Did you retire voluntarily - A. I was pensioned, on account of ill health (looking at four notes) - here is</p>
               <p>"Trueman and Co. 21-10" on every one of these, in the prisoner's hand-writing, and his initials. I believe he lived on Tower-hill.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer, and a commodore to the East India Company, and was so in 1813, and knew the prisoner very well in the service. I did not see him, from 1814, till the 16th of November last, when, in consequence of information, I went with a warrant to No. 25, Wapping-street, Commercial-road, about halfpast nine o'clock in the morning. I rapped at the door; Mrs. Mason came; I had some conversation with her, and went into the front parlour, then into the back; the prisoner was not there. I went down stairs, and found him washing himself, and said</p>
               <p>"Mason, you are my prisoner;" he said,</p>
               <p>"On what account?" I said</p>
               <p>"The Company's." He said</p>
               <p>"Are Mr. Stockwell and Mr. Goodhall in town?" I said they were; he said,</p>
               <p>"If that is the case, I shall have all the law they can give me." I had done my endeavours to find him since 1814, but never could hear of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did he live when in the Company's service - A. I cannot tell. I went to where I heard he had been, but could not find him - I went after him a dozen times, but had not looked for him for the last eight years. I got the warrant on the 15th of November. I found a letter in his house - I asked for it before it was given me, having been informed, eight days before, that he had received letters to escape to America. I never said I had seen him about the City-road.</p>

            . I was in the Company's service in 1813. On the 7th of December, 1814, or about that date, the prisoner had been at the office at the usual hours, and left at two o'clock, and about eight o'clock in the evening I went to his house (in consequence of a message), in Postern-row, Tower-hill; he asked me if any inquiry had been made for him at the office - I said I had heard none. He then said he had misapplied some part of the Company's money, or had kept it back and not paid it in - I cannot recollect his exact words, but the substance was that he had made use of, or misapplied some part of the Company's money. I asked if he had the means of making up the deficiency - he said he could borrow it of a friend. I advised him to bring it, and pay it in on the following morning, or put it in his desk, that it might be there when asked for. I left him, understanding that he would attend, and he did, on the following morning; some money transactions took place between him and the chief clerk, and I thought from that that it was settled, as he said no more to me - but on the following day he left the office quite.</p>

             READ (looking at the letter produced). This is the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>This letter was here read; it was dated Ostend, January 17, 1815, and was addressed by the prisoner to his wife, giving her an account of his going from different parts of the Continent, to avoid persons who he suspected to be in pursuit of him, and stating his intention to go to America.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. For the last eight years the Company have known where to find me; and the officer who took me, told me that he saw me daily, as he lived within two doors of me in the City-road. I was never from home two nights for the last eight years and a half. I had received information that I should be apprehended, and could have avoided it if I chose. My friends had waited on the warehouse-keeper, who seemed satisfied there must be a misunderstanding somewhere.</p>
               <p>Several witnesses, who appeared to the prisoner's character, stated that he had lived in Fountain-place, City-road, for the last eight years, and went about publicly and undisguised.</p>

I found his hands very muddy. I took him to the chapel, where Barrs was, and in his hat found two matches.

            . I was with Almond - we have the keys of the chapel. I saw a light in the Vestry, went in, and found a piece of candle in a person's hand - it was puffed out in a moment. Thomas rushed out and was secured. I ran and saw Nugent getting over the wall, and cut at him with my cutlass; called Stop thief! and Almond brought him back. The Vestry-room shutter was broken to pieces, and by it I found a crow-bar, tinder-box, flint, steel, and matches, and an iron wedge under the door. - Some knives and forks had been moved, and laid by the door; a piece of carpet was taken up and thrown into the yard, several books were moved, and a strange bag was left there. Nugent was cut in four or five places by the broken glass on the wall.</p>

I secured him, and picked it up. He bears a very good character.</p>

            . I live with my father, in Juniper-row; the prisoner lodged with us, and sent me to pawn these things; he told me to pawn them in the name of Smith. I pawned one spoon for him in the name of Reynolds. The pawnbroker entered the table-cloth in my name, as he knew me by pawning for my mother. I gave the prisoner the money and duplicates. He gave them to me at different times.</p>

I never applied to him for money for my father; my father has borrowed money of him. I never knew them quarrel.

            . I am a Surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 24th of December, I was on duty, with another officer, near the West India Dock-bridge, and about a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners coming over the bridge in company; I stopped Denson, and found 28 lbs. of rope round his body, under his smock-frock. He said he picked it up on the bank of the City Canal, by the Isle of Dogs, in company with Kirkham. In a private pocket, down the seam in the leg of his trowsers. I found a knife, which had been cutting tarred rope. I asked why he concealed the rope - he said he thought it the best way of carrying it. I went and found the brig Pilgrim adrift, in the City Canal, with her head-rope cut at the water's edge; I cut a piece off the end - it corresponded with what he had.</p>
               <p>TROMAS CLARK. I was with Buckey, whose account is correct. I examined Kirkham, and found 22 lbs. of rope round his body, under his smock frock - it tallies with what the other prisoner had, and in his jacket pocket, I found a knife.</p>

I went towards them, and saw him let go of them, and walk away. I then watched, and saw them go two doors off, they looked round to see if any one was watching. I then saw them plainly, so as to know them again. I returned to the end of the shop - a gentleman came in, and asked if I had lost anything. I then missed the trowsers, and went out, but could not find them; but on returning, found Austin in the shop. They were both taken that night. I am certain of their persons.</p>

I then turned back, and met Mance and Armstrong, and went with them round a different way; we met Prosser with the trowsers, and secured him.

            . I am an officer. On the 10th of December, between five and six o'clock in the evening. I stopped the prisoner in New-road, St. George's in the East, with this beef concealed under his coat. He said he picked it up in the road. I said, if so, it must have been dirty, for it was a very dirty night. He said he had wiped it with his handkerchief - there was no appearance of dirt whatever. I said he had taken it from some butcher. He laid down - I could not get him on for some time, but at last he took me to Laws, and said he took it from under that window.</p>

I said not, he represented himself as Mollard's confidential servant, and said he was going to Wilson and Cutler's, Mincing-lane; to buy two dozen of claret. He returned, and said he had bought it. I had known him some years, and asked what he had paid for it; he said, 5 l. 10 s. a dozen. I asked him to taste my port, sherry, and Madeira; he said it was good wine, and asked the price. I think I said, 44 s. for sherry, 50 s. for Madeirs, and 36 s. for port; he said the price would astonish Mr. Mollard if he could taste it, and he should like him to taste it. I gave him a bottle of each, and told him to mind that Mr. Mollard must pay for it; he came again in a day or two, and said Mr. Mollard had tasted the port, and was quite astonished at the price, and would come on the following Tuesday and look out a pipe, and wished to have a dozen of Sherry and Madeira as a sample ready by ten o'clock next morning, as the cart was coming to town and must not be detained; and to leave the hamper out for him, if I was not in the way. I was out about that time, and locked it up. When I returned I understood he had been there, and about half-past four o'clock I saw him at my cellar door; he said he had called in the morning. I said I was very sorry, for I had sent it to Mr. Mollard by the carrier; he said he was sorry for it. I invited him into the cellar; he had a glass of wine, and I gave him the samples for Mr. Mollard to taste, as he said the carrier would not be down till ten o'clock at night, and he wished Mr. Mollard to taste it at dinner; he packed it up, and took it away.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. I told you I was out of employment - A. No, he said he was Mr. Mollard's confidential servant, and when he went away with the wine, he said I should see him next morning, with Mr. Mollard's draft for the amount.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you would allow me a commission for any wine I could sell - A. I might have said so; he said Mr. Tritton, the banker would come and taste a pipe of port; and a Mr. Lewis, whom he said frequented Mollard's.</p>

A man who she called her husband was with her. She said she came from the country; they stopped in the room about three hours, then both came down and went out; my niece ran up to the room. I ran out and overtook the prisoner - she had a large cloak on which covered her. I followed her some distance, and saw her drop the blankets. I picked them up and gave her in charge; I went into the room and missed the blankets, which had been given her to make the bed herself. There is no mark on them, but I have no doubt of their being mine.</p>

On the 27th of December, at a quarter past eleven o'clock in the morning, I missed this deal, which I had seen safe a quarter of an hour before, tied to a ladder at a house, to prevent people going up. The two ends were bound with iron, and it had two holes in it. Rohan has worked for me. I found it with one end cut off, and the other three parts off.</p>

            . I was looking out of window, and saw Rohan up the ladder before the house. He had worked for my husband, and I thought he might have been sent for it. He untied the rope, and brought the board down, and as he did not come towards our house, I went out and followed him to Blue Anchor-yard, and saw him push it down Macrae's cellar, which is about one hundred yards off; he staid down there about two minutes, then came out and went into Macrae's shop. I looked down the cellar, and saw Macrae sewing the end off; I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't saw that board, it is my husband's." He said he did not care for me or my husband. I sent an officer down, and he threw the board up, with one end sawn off, and the other nearly off. Rohan was so much in liquor, that, although I was close to him, he did not know me.</p>

               <p>Q. Somebody of your name has been prosecuted, and Macrae's relation appeared against him - A. My brother has been unfortunate, and Macrae's wife has insulted me about it. I have heard of one Watson being hung - he was not concerned with my brother; I do not wish to hurt her husband - I did not wish to bring Rohan to justice, but Macrae insisted on going before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner ROHAN. Q. What character have I borne - A. He was an honest upright man - my husband offered to take 2 s. 6 d. for the board, but the officer said it would be compounding felony; and when we got near the Office, Macrae was willing to pay the money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was willing to go - A. Yes; he said he bought the board of Rohan. I asked what he gave for it; he said that was no matter, they could not value it at more than 11 d. Macrae told the Magistrate that gave 6 d. for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the prisoners sign this paper (handing it) - A. Yes, (read.)</p>

On the 18th of December, in consequence of an alarm being given, I jumped over the counter, ran out, and missed this cotton off a pile at the door; it had been confined with a string. I went in pursuit into the East India-road, and saw the prisoner running with them under his arm. I called Stop thief! and he dropped them, ran thirty yards further, and was stopped by a sailor - I came up, and took him; two of the pieces have our mark on them, and were safe ten minutes before.</p>

He at first said that two men desired him to carry it, but afterwards that distress was the cause; which I think was the case, as I found only one halfpenny on him.</p>

He fetched a light up, and took me into the kitchen, told me to put the liquors on the dresser; and said there were some empty bottles in return - he asked if I had not a bill and change for a 10 l. note. I said I had - he said, if I would give him the bill and change, he would take it up to his master, and bring me down the note - he left me in the kitchen, and went up stairs, (as I thought,) to his master for the note.

            . I was in Mr. Johnson's service at this time; the prisoner came to give me this order at first on the 20th of December; he came one morning before to enquire the price of spirits. I saw him then, and am certain he is the man. On the 5th of January I was with my brother in Paradise-street, and he passed me; he saw that I noticed him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Ah! ah! how do you do?" I made no answer, he stood for about ten seconds looking to see if I would answer. My brother said,</p>

               <p>"He is the person who swindled Mr. Johnson," but not loud enough for him to hear; he then went away up a passage. I saw two persons standing at a potatoe warehouse, and asked them for an officer to take him; they laughed at me. I followed him into Paddington-street, he crossed over to Nottingham-place. I sent my brother to the office; I followed him into the New-road, and asked a butcher to lay hold of him, he put his hand on his collar, and I said,</p>
               <p>"You are the person who has swindled Mr. Johnson, and if you will walk with me to the office, we will have an explanation;" he said, certainly, I went on with him, and met my brother with the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not notice him - A. Yes, I did; and when he could not avoid me, he said, Ah! he walked pretty quick, and I kept behind him.

            . I am servant to Mr. Robertson, of No. 20, Argyle-street. The prisoner came about the 1st of December, and took the first and second floor of the house for his master's son, as he said; he looked at the apartments three or four times; he did not live there, but called six or seven times, and said his master would come next day; but afterwards said his master was ill, and could not come to town. On the day before the spirits came he called, in a great hurry, and said his master would be there next day; he desired me to light the fires; and said his master would pay a week's money for the trouble we had in lighting them - he never came, and nothing has been paid. He called next morning, and asked if we could lend him a dozen bottles, as a dozen of wine was coming in, and his master was a near man, and did not like to pay for bottles - he had a dozen, and about four o'clock in the afternoon he came again, and said he wished the wine would come, for he wanted to go; the porter brought the spirits; I ran to the door, but he ran up before me and received the spirits himself - the porter remained in the kitchen a long time, and then asked for my master. I did not see the prisoner afterwards.</p>

On the 10th of December, about twelve o'clock, I was at work, and saw the prisoner look over the yard wall; and in about a minute I came out of the stable, and he asked me the way to Smallborough-green; I told him, and followed him part of the way - he stopped at a public-house - I went on further, and as I returned saw him come out of the yard gate with a bundle. I hallooed after him - he said he had got nothing - I saw him drop it, picked it up, and called out to Cook, who took him without my losing sight of him. I found it was my coat and jacket which I had left hanging in the stable.</p>

On the 20th of December, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to our house, and asked me for a piece of linen for her hand, which was sore. I gave her some - she stopped till three o'clock. I sent out for a quartern of gin, and gave her some. She sat down - I offered her some refreshment, which she refused. She asked me to lend her 6 d.; I gave her one; my husband came home, and put down twenty-one sovereigns, three guineas, and a 10 l. note, on the table at which she was sitting, and said,</p>

               <p>"Old woman, here is part of the money you have been so long craving after." This was between five and six o'clock. I took it up, and put it into my pocket, and in a quarter of an hour my husband fell asleep. The prisoner said she wished me to go home with her to make an excuse to her husband, or she did not know what would be the consequence, as she had been out all day. I said I could not, as I had my children to put to bed. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Pray do, he won't say a word if you come;" and I at last went with her. I had my baby in my arms; we went down Crawford-street. She tucked my cloak up above my arms, to keep the baby warm. She asked me to give her some gin in Crawford-street, but I would not; I however stopped at a public-house; she brought me out two pennyworth of shrub, which she paid for. We went down Baker-street, till we came to Blanford-street; I said,</p>
               <p>"You are going further than you need, for that is your way home;" she said.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, we will turn up the next street." and at the corner of George-street, by a public-house, she came behind me, round to my right side, and forced her hand into my pocket hole, forced my pocket from my side, and tore it off - she turned me quite round with the force, and ran off through a mob, which was collected hearing some music. I turned round, and said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Gainham, you have got my pocket, you have robbed me." She rushed through the mob, and I lost her. I went straight to her house in Blandford-mews, and found her husband and a woman there, but not her - she came in in about five minutes. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Gainham, you have robbed me of my pocket; I will give you 5 l., and anything to drink, if you will give me the remainder." She said,</p>
               <p>"I dare say you would if I had it." I threw my child down, and went back to where my pocket was taken, as she said I must have dropped it. The watchman assisted me to look for it, but I could not find it. I went and told my husband, and in a few minutes, she came in - I said,</p>
               <p>"Master, this is the woman who has robbed me of the money;" she said he might search her if he liked. He turned me out of doors, and told me not to come home. I stopped next door all night, leaving her in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You had something to drink in your room - A. Yes; the prisoner did not go out for it. There was no tossing up for drink. I lost my pocket close to a public-house; I was not talking about going in there. I rushed through the crowd after her. I do not know whether any one heard me call after her. She afterwards followed me to my house - my husband told her to go about her business, for she was deeper than him. She was taken next day. My husband has not threatened me about this.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140053"/>Q. Do you remember being in the yard of Mary-le-bone Office, and your husband saying to you,</p>
               <p>"If you don't bring it home to Salt Gainham, I will have your life" - A. No; he said no such thing at any time. I did not stop in the yard, for I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the prisoner that you had lost your pocket, and she said,</p>
               <p>"Well, we will go out together and look for it" - A. No. I left my child there, and went out tearing my hair - she did not go with me. She tucked my cloak up several times.</p>

I went to Lovitt's house, in Barrett's-court, Oxford-street, and searched his place, having heard that they kept company, and in a drawer I found several parcels of money wrapped in paper, amounting to 33 l. odd in all, divided into parcels of 2 l. and 3 l. each; there were shillings, crown-pieces, and two sovereigns amongst it. Lovitt is a lamp-lighter, and has 24 s. a-week. I found a pair of silver buckles in the room, and some duplicates of property pawned in December, of small articles for 3 s. and 4 s. each. The money found was all silver but three sovereigns.</p>

            . I now live at Donly's; I was at the prisoner's place when this happened. She went out about ten o'clock in the morning, and did not return till eight. Mrs. Donly came in first, and said to Mr. Gainham,</p>
               <p>"How are you, old man?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Where is Sal?" She said,</p>
               <p>"Don't be angry, she has been with me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140054"/>all day, old man - we will have a drop of something to drink." She put her hand down to feel for her pocket, and almost threw the child out of her arms - I caught it; she said,</p>
               <p>"I have lost my pocket and money!" Mrs. Gainham said,</p>
               <p>"I hope not."</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Gainham had come in then - A. Yes; and said,</p>
               <p>"I hope not, for you had 30 l." They both ran out together to find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she accuse the prisoner with taking it - A. Not at all; she seemed quite confused.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. The prosecutrix was in the room some time before the prisoner came in - A. Yes; they did not come home together. The last situation I had was potgirl, that is twelve months ago; I have lived with Donly since this happened. I went backwards and forwards to the prisoner before, to nurse, but lived in George-street, St. Giles's. I have a person who pays my rent, and I get my living as I can - not in the streets. I am sure they both went out together to look for the money.</p>
               <p>- On the 20th of last month, I was coming down Blandford-mews, where I live, about half-past seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner and prosecutrix coming from the end of the mews together. I live at the prisoner's house. They stopped a long time at the door, talking; Donly went in, and Gainham staid outside.</p>

When I met him, he was struggling with a woman, who would not take him home; he then turned to me, and asked if I would, and followed me up to my place, and while I was getting a light he was talking to two other women. He was very drunk; I went to get him a quartern of gin, and when I returned he was asleep, and undressed. I awoke him, and said he could not be there till he had satisfied me; he pulled his trowsers out, and gave me this money - I took it to Marks to take care of, and when I returned, the officers, were waiting for me. I do not know what I might have said, as I was drunk.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. I gave her four sixpences when I first went into the room, but no sovereigns. I knew what I was about.</p>

I gave him the money I received from the officers.

In consequence of the directions of the officers, I accompanied Trotman on the 23d to the prisoner's lodgings, Marlborough-court, Petticoat-lane, and asked him for some shillings; he said he had none ready, and we were to call in the afternoon, or next morning; and on the 24th we went; his father and mother were there.

Trotman bought sixteen sixpences and a half-crown of him, as he had no more shillings ready.

I went into the skittle-ground, and saw him take a bundle from behind the water-butt. I followed him as far as Peter's-street, and there lost him; there was a hole in the handkerchief, through which I could see that it was brown leather; it was the shape of a pair of boots. I cannot swear what it was.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Jones. On the 8th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and bought the articles stated in the indictment; she told me to make out a bill, and take them to No. 9, Bidborough-street. I took them there, and she told me to make a separate account of what was for her mother, which I did. She said she would shew her mother the goods, and bring me up the money. I was up stairs; she took them down stairs, and absconded with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. She bought some for her mother - A. She said she would shew them to her mother, who was down stairs, and would bring me up the money. They were worth nearly 10 l.</p>

            . I live in Bidborough-street. The prisoner came and took my first floor, the parlour, and kitchen, for herself, her mother, and servant; and said she must go and enquire the respectability of my house; she returned in a short time, and said it was all right, and wished to come in immediately. I asked for a reference; she gave me one, at Clapham. I said I could not go there that night, and she could not come in that day. She said there was a death in the neighbourhood, which would occasion a hurry, and she wished her servant in on that night, but I would not consent. She then said she would go out and order some things; she came back, saying she had bought some, and when the young man brought them, to shew him into the drawing-room: and in a few minutes the witness brought the goods, and soon after I found the door open - she was gone. I have never seen her mother. She was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had she not paid you a deposit - A. Yes, 7 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Mr. JONES. I took her a few yards from the lodgings, and asked if she had paid for them; she said if I would go back I should find all right.</p>

               <p>MR. PLATT conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>HUTTON PERKINS. On the 1st of December, the prisoner Hamilton introduced me to one Schofield, and on the 4th of December he called at my house, and delivered an invoice of these goods to me, and desired me to attend at Lloyd's Coffee-house next day, to see Schofield, that we might enter into security for the amount of the deals; he represented himself as a broker employed by Schofield, and that he had a quantity of deals to sell for him. I went next day to Lloyd's, and saw him and Schofield; Mr. Mitchell came in shortly, and I agreed with Schofield to buy seven hundred and forty-five deals. A bill was to be drawn by Mitchell and accepted by me, for the deals. When that was done, a document of transfer was handed over to Mitchell to endorse; it was then handed over to me. The deals were at the Commercial Docks. I took my leave of Mitchell; and as soon as I got to the end of the street, Hamilton came up to me, and asked if I had got the transfer - I said Yes. He said it would be necessary to lodge it at the Docks that afternoon - I said that there was no occasion, that it would do when I was disposed to have them cleared. He said it was customary in the trade to lodge it with the Dock Company as soon as made out, and when that was done, the goods would be entered in my name. I went to the Docks with him, and lodged it at the clerk's office. The clerk said I must endorse my name on it, which I did, and then left. I wanted the deals to erect some machinery which is now in progress - their value is 156 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How often has Hamilton dined at your house - A. The fellow has frequently called at my house; he has dined there in the kitchen, never in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Never with you - A. I have dined with him in the kitchen. I had known him for about a month before this transaction. He frequently called just as I was going to dinner - I cannot say how often - he may have dined there ten times at my table - he frequently dined with my servants when I was out - he was introduced to me by one Wood. I am a silk-manufacturer, and live in Church-street, Spitalfields; I have just commenced business, and am getting machinery ready.</p>
               <p>Q. How much property had you on your premises at the time - A. Perhaps 50 l. worth of silk. Hamilton frequently left catalogues at my house, stating himself to be a broker. He was not my intimate acquaintance, but when he saw my dinner on table, from his shabby appearance, I could do no less than ask him to dine - we never dined in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Would your dinner go into the parlour if he had not been there - A. Yes; the servants dined with us. I never dealt in canvas. Hamilton said he knew a man who had some to dispose of - I referred that person to a Mr. Francis, who knew my affairs. I had 9000 l. left me in 1809, and was to come into possession of it in December; but about 350 l. has been advanced upon it - I cannot get it till that is paid.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you to pay for the deals - A. By redeeming the papers, by which I could get the 9000 l. - I have friends who would advance money. I did not employ Hamilton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140058"/>to make purchases for me, and to refer to Francis; I referred to Mitchell about the deals, as he was on 'Change at the time, and it was handy. I applied for some deals which another person had to sell, but bought none I suppose he was not disposed to credit me; I referred him to Mitchell. I never employed Hamilton as a broker; he was not to have a commission from me; he said he got one and a half per cent. from Schofield. I never saw him from the 5th of December till he was apprehended; he called at my house on the evening of the 6th, when I was engaged; I did not see him; he left no message for me; the servant said he called to borrow some money of the servants. I never called on Jury the carman, about moving the deals.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you, in the presence of your servant, direct Hamilton to get carts or barges to remove the deals - A. Never. I never said anything about turning them into money. I never paid 
               <persName id="t18240114-160-person1395">Hamilton</persName>
             any money - I owe him none.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not gone over and over again to persons on your business - A. He stated himself in their employ, and wished to make a sale for them. I found the canvas came into the market illegally, and would not buy it; I wanted it to ship in exchange for silk. I never went to the Custom-house with him. I never saw Booker till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. How old are you - A. Twenty-one. I had commenced business a month before I saw Hamilton. A stock of silk would be useless till I got my machinery up. I never employed him as a broker; he always acted as broker for the opposite party - he applied to me to buy the deals - I never gave him authority to get them from the Docks - all the expenses were paid by Mr. Schofield, the importer. Francis lives in Watling-street, Commercial-road, in a private house - he is now making machines.</p>

               <p>"Perkins," as if both are interested in the goods. While I was at dinner Hamilton came to my house, and said he had come for some deals, in the name of Mitchell - that his name was Mitchell, and he wished to get the deals out by that evening's tide. I went to the door, and saw Booker about a hundred yards off. I went down to my office with Hamilton. He asked me two or three times to come and mark the goods off. I went and marked them off. Booker was then by his side, and never left him. Hamilton told me what goods to mark off. I marked off three parcels of deals. Moreland's craft had been waiting in the Docks for them the day before; and two hundred and fifty-six were shipped. I had marked off as many more, but there was not time to ship them. Hamilton followed me into the office - I gave him a note and pass for what were marked; he said he should be down early on Monday morning for the rest - he said his name was Mitchell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If the transfer had been presented to you, signed by three persons, would you deliver the goods to that third person - A. If he had represented himself as that third person - no person whose name was not endorsed on the transfer could receive them.</p>

            . I have a wharf at Wapping. On the 6th of December, Moreland brought two hundred and fifty-six deals there. Before that, one Hornby had introduced Hamilton to me; he said he had a large quantity of deals, and had I convenience to land them. I asked if they were to go away immediately; he said it depended upon circumstances. I saw him there while they were landing. On Monday we did not finish landing, which he was angry at; and on Tuesday he came; they were all landed on Wednesday, and he brought one Brooford, and sold him a hundred of them; they were delivered on the 10th, to an order signed</p>
               <p>"J. Booker" - the one hundred and fifty-six have been delivered to Perkins by the Magistrates' order. Hamilton expected that there was a larger quantity in the barge.</p>

            . I was present at Lloyd's Coffee-house when a treaty was made between Schofield and Perkins for these deals; the endorsement on the transfer is my writing. I never authorised either of the prisoners to take the deals into their possession. I never saw them till they were apprehended. I was in company with Schofield and Perkins about ten minutes. I merely guaranteed the payment of the goods for Perkins. I am a surveyor at Lloyd's, and have been so for seven years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The bill was drawn by you - A. I signed it as drawer. I have no doubt of Perkins's ability to pay it when due - I have known him twelve months. I think it is drawn at three or four months date. I took a memorandum of it, but have not got it here.</p>

               <p>"I know nothing of the robbery; Hamilton came to me and asked if I knew any body who would purchase some deals; I asked if they were all right; he said they were. I went with him to the Docks, and thought they were all right - he said that all he got above 7 s. each was to be divided between us. I went to Mr. Brooford, who bought one hundred for 42 l. 10 s.; and out of the money I stopped 5 l." I asked if he knew where the remainder of the deals were - he said they must be all at the wharf.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Hamilton, in his defence, made an unconnected statement, the substance of which was, that the prosecutor's credit being bad, he had employed him to purchase goods of persons at credit, and sell the same for present cash at any price, in order to raise money to pay the 350 l. to get the documents from the attorney, which entitled him to 9000 l. That he had bought the deals in question, and was employed by the prosecutor to dispose of them.</p>
               <p>BOOKER'S Defence. Hamilton called on me to go to the docks with him to meet Perkins, to dispose of the deals, and employed me to sell them.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor; he has a woman servant occasionally, she sometimes makes the bed and cooks, and sometimes I do it. I remember when Hamilton first came to the house. My master generally dines in the parlour and I in the kitchen - he sometimes dines in the kitchen with me. Hamilton may have dined there eight or ten times; always in the kitchen. I understood that Hamilton had these deals to sell to my master, as a broker. I never heard my master tell him to dispose of them. They were bought to erect the manufactory. Francis has dined with us five or six times. My master has a maid servant now. I believe the last time that Hamilton called, he asked for my master. I said he was engaged. I told Perkins that he had called and asked for him.</p>
               <p>MR. SCHOFIELD. I have seen Hamilton and Perkins together. He never said in what capacity Hamilton was engaged. I never understood him to be Perkins's broker. I sold the deals through my broker to Mr. Mitchell, as I would not trust Perkins, not knowing him.</p>

He kept an iron shop at Paddington. Pratt stopped the cart at his door, by my order. I told Pratt that it was cast iron. I told Nash I had brought one of them up - he said he would weigh it, and I was to call in directly for the money. I went out, returned, and he said it came to 1 l.

I did not see who was inside the shop. I knew of no other name belonging to the shop but Mrs. Lloyd. I passed a fortnight after, and saw Nash's name up.

            . I am street-keeper of Cornhill. On the 9th of December the prisoner was given into my charge. He denied taking this parcel - I found the wrapper upon him. He then said he had sold the property at Ratcliffe-highway for 4 s. 3 d., and took me there. I found a pair of shoes and a waistcoat. The shopkeeper said he gave 5 s. 6 d. for them, and that he said they were his own. He said it was the property he took out of the smack.</p>

            . On the 23d of December, in the evening; I saw the prisoners in Crown-street, Baker was loitering about a marine store shop, Smith saw me and gave him a shove. I watched them, and saw Smith pushing Baker on. I crossed over and took Baker, and asked what he had; he said, a scraper, and that it belonged to him; I turned round and saw Smith running off. Baker said he picked it up, and afterwards said it would save me trouble, that he got it at the corner of Phoenix-court, Long-alley, from a door. I went to Mr. Slack, who claimed it, and as I returned from the office, I saw Smith, and told Ballard to take him.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Carlisle-street. Phillips is a dealer in marine stores, and lives in Crown-street, Soho. On the 15th of December, about nine o'clock at night, I was passing his shop; Mrs. Phillips called me in to ask a question about some boys who had been taken, and while I was there the prisoner came in, and offered two tea trays for sale; I asked where he got them - he said they were his own; I took him to the watch-house; he begged me to let him go. I said he had taken them instead of 3 s., for work he had done as a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140061"/>tailor for a young man, that he did not know where he was, and would not tell who he was; he said next morning, that he got them from Mr. Cousins, Duke-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields.</p>

The prisoner came on one side of me and snatched it from me; it contained the articles stated in the indictment. I could not swear to his person till he was brought to the office, which was on the Saturday; he was dressed quite different to what he was before; at the time of the robbery he had a brown coat and velvet collar. I pointed him out from several others at the office. He had turned round to see if I was pursuing him. I pursued him through several streets, and had him in view all that time, till I lost him in an instant. I have no doubt whatever of his being the man. I have found none of my property.</p>

The soles were marked, and my master put me into the back parlour to watch, and about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, of the 24th of December, I saw the prisoner rubbing the counter down; he left off in the middle of it, took a pile of soles down off the shelf, selected two pairs, and put them into his bosom. He finished the counter, and went to clean my master's boots, and when my master came down, I told him, and took them out of his bosom myself.</p>

When I returned, I found her in her bed-room, where there was a quantity of my things - I called her down, and next morning I went up stairs, and missed some lace caps, and other things from a bundle. I asked if she had opened the bundle; she said not; and next morning, I wished to discharge her - she would not leave me. This property was found in a bundle under the water-butt, in the back kitchen - she coloured up when I asked if it was her's - she said No. I asked when she put the things there; she would not answer.

On the 1st of January, the prisoner gave me a small bundle, and said it was some lace which her mistress wanted to buy of her, and she would not let her have it. I did not open the bundle, but put it in the stable, and when my mistress missed her property, I gave it to her. I was never in my mistress's room.</p>

            , patrol of St. George's. On the 12th of January, at half-past nine o'clock at night, I was in Parliament-street, Westminster, and saw the prisoners together; they asked me for relief, and begged me to give them something. I took them to a public-house at the corner of the street, gave them a quartern of gin and a penny loaf. I was going home to Portland-town, with a bundle, containing the articles stated in the indictment. We parted in Parliament-street, but they came up to me again in the Hay-market. Russell said they would see me home, as I had been so good as to treat them - I said I knew my way, but they would keep close by me, one on each side, till I got into Conduit-street. The watchman was then calling ten o'clock. They said nothing to me, but Harding dragged my pocket from my side, and Russell took my bundle. My pocket was sown to my side, but she tore it off the strings; it contained two sovereigns and a half, with some papers. A gentleman's servant caught hold of Harding, and another took Russell; they were both immediately given to the watchman.</p>

            . I am watchman of Conduit-street. I was calling past ten o'clock, and seeing a crowd on the opposite side of the street, I went over; a livery servant pointed out the prisoners, who were surrounded by people. The servant said, in their hearing, that they had committed a robbery on the prosecutrix; he gave me the pocket and bundle. I wanted him to come to the watch-house with me. Harding escaped out of the crowd; I sprang my rattle; two more watchmen came up and held Russell, while I fetched her back. The servant gave me the property, and went away.</p>

               <p>HARDING'S Defence. I was never near her in Parliament-street; she came up to us in the Haymarket, and asked us to shew her the way to Oxford-street; I asked her for some drink, which she gave us, and went into another house, and called for three glasses more. Her foot slipped; a gentleman's servant was behind; the bundle fell from her, and, with her stooping, her petticoat string broke. She called the watchman, who came up; we made no resistance. The gentleman's servant said he knew nothing about it.</p>

Bryan came and asked me to run away; I said I did not know where to go to; she then went to Kelly, who agreed to go, and I said I would go with them. We all went to bed at eight o'clock at night, and at twelve we all got up; we went across the yard, and got in at the little wash-house window into the laundry; Kelly set me to watch while they dressed themselves. We took nothing except what we dressed in, which was three gowns, three pairs of shoes, three shawls, a silk handkerchief, two flannel petticoats, two shifts, five caps, and two bonnets; they put a cap or two into their bosoms, and got out of window again, went to the gate, and found a ladder; got over the gate, dropped down the wall, and went into George-street, St. Giles's. Kelly took us there. She took out a purse of money, and said, there was eight or nine shillings; she afterwards felt for it, and said she had lost it. We staid two nights at Mrs. Pierce's, in George-street - it is a house of ill fame. They sent me to pawn a gown in Tottenham-court-road; I gave Kelly the ticket. We then went and lived at Allen's, in George-street, and slept there every night, all three together, for four months.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get your living - A. Kelly and Bryan went on the streets, and I was their servant for four months. I was then starving, and went back to the workhouse, and told the gentlemen the truth. Kelly paid Pierce for the lodging with a silk shawl and handkerchief. The things stolen all belonged to the paupers, except a shift and a pair of shoes.</p>

            . I am laundress at Mary-le-bone work-house; the paupers' clothes are in my care. The prisoners and Thorp went away in the night, about the middle of the summer; they had left the laundry between seven and eight o'clock at night. I locked the door and left all safe, and in the morning found the wash-house window broken open, and the door burst open, to get to the laundry. I missed the articles stated in the indictment; five caps and two handkerchiefs belonged to me. My husband's name is Robert. I have since seen a gown, a cap, and petticoat.</p>

On the 22d of December, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in the parlour, behind the shop, and heard a noise - went into the shop, and found the prisoner at the parlour door, just getting off his knees, and going towards the shop door - I followed him, calling Stop thief! he ran out as quick as possible. I gave the alarm, pursued him about sixty yards, and then left the watchman in pursuit, who secured him; and some time after he found the bowl with seven shillings in the mud - it was taken from my till, which contained more than that.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS PARKER. I am a watchman. I heard a cry of Stop thief! saw the prisoner running, and took him - I found no money on him, but six shillings in the mud.</p>

I asked how they came possessed of it. Stevens said he had taken it out of pawn that morning. I asked how he got it before he pawned it - he gave no answer.

Bennett was cleaning the bridle; he threw a handkerchief over it, and went out. I went over to Stevens and said,</p>

On Christmas-day I was crossing the fields, and the prisoner called after me; he had two white handkerchiefs, and asked me to buy them for 8 d.; they were wet, and he took them to my mother, who said if I did not take them back she would throw them on the fire. I went back to him in the field and asked for my money back. I knocked his hat off, and out fell another. I picked them up, and went to his mother and gave them to her, and said her son wanted to transport me.</p>

On the 7th of January I met the prisoner in Villiers-street, Strand; he went into Buckingham-street; I stopped him, and asked what he had got, and found the weights in his pocket; he said they were his mother's. I took him to her; she said she knew nothing of them, only that he had taken them out with him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoners about this shop a little before nine o'clock in the evening, on the 15th of December, standing together - Wells's arm was in the window, through a hole. I walked a few paces, then saw him take the handkerchief from the window and give it to Davis. I took Wells, and took him into the shop. Phillips said she had lost a handkerchief, and produced the piece it was cut from. Davis ran away with it. Gook brought him into the shop soon after, but the handkerchief was not found.</p>

            . On the night in question I observed the prisoners close against this window - we watched them, and saw Buckland try to take hold of one of them. Davis ran about three hundred yards - I attempted to pursue, and was knocked down in the road. I saw him throw something away at the corner of Moore-street. I was knocked down, and Ewer took him.</p>

On the 5th of January the two Segars came, and St. Piers walked backward and forward: they bought some small articles, and after they left, I missed a silk shawl off the counter. They came again two days after, and bought some small things; I was at my desk; they did not see me; my shopman was serving them. One put his arm over the counter, and pulled a shawl over; then engaged the shopman's attention, while the other unbuttoned his waistcoat and put it in. I jumped out and caught them both outside the door, unbuttoned Joseph's dress, and found it; St Piers ran away.</p>

On the 5th of January, between half-past six and seven o'clock in the evening, while I was loading my coach at the Bell and Crown, the prisoner was standing by, in the yard; two or three more men were there; he stood there for about twenty minutes. I then observed him on the coach; and when I got up, I touched him on the shoulder and said</p>
               <p>"Where are you going;" he said to Hounslow. The coachman and his brother were on the box. I had put a leather bag into the boot which contained sundry small parcels going to various places on the road; it was the last thing that I put into the fore-boot, which was not above half full - there was more space above it than would have held another bag of the sort. The boot is two and a half feet or three feet deep. I stopped at the Gloucester Coffee-house, Piccadilly, and put two or three deal boxes on the top of the bag, and nearly filled the boot. The coachman and his brother both got down, and immediately after that the prisoner got on the coach-box, and continued there while I was putting these parcels into the boot; and after that I went into the coffee-house for the weigh-bill, and called to the coachman that I was ready. I came round in a minute or two to get up behind, and saw a man standing behind pulling at the leather bag, on the near side, close to the fore wheel. The prisoner was assisting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140071"/>him; they had each got hold of the bag, the prisoner stooping down and raising it up with his left hand, to case it out of the boot. The man on the ground could not have got it out without assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Must it have been removed from the place where you left it - A. Certainly; they had got above half of it out - they must have got the whole quite from the place where I had left it. A deal box which was on the top of it was moved, and caught at the top of the boot. I sprang forward, pushed the man away, and put the bag back again - turned round, and the man was gone - the prisoner got off the box as soon as he could, and moved towards the tail of the coach. I stood before him, and asked where he was going, two or three times, but he did not answer. I said,</p>
               <p>"You told me you was going to Hounslow" - he said he had left a parcel in the City, and must go back for it. I said I thought he was colleagued with the other man, and gave him in charge - he said he was a gentleman. The boot of the coach has a wooden flap, and a leather cover over it. I had put them both down after putting the parcels in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are you responsible for the things in the coach - A. Certainly. I signed a deposition at the office. The prisoner asked me to pick up a glove which he had dropped, and I did so. The bag is three feet long; it is a soft leather bag. I cannot say whether it stood on its bottom, or its side. I twisted the top round. The flap opens against the coach - I do not know which of them opened the flap. I saw the bag partly out of the boot - it was certainly quite moved from the place I put it in.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How much space did the bag take up - A. It was about eight inches or a foot below the mouth of the boot; it could not be out of the boot at all without being lifted entirely out of its place, where I put it; or it could not have been so far out of the boot.</p>

            . I am coachman of this mail. On the 1st of January, the prisoner got on the coach-box to go to Hounslow, and when we got to the Gloucester Coffee-house, he got off, and said he should go no further, for he had forgotten a parcel and would go and fetch it. On the 5th, he came into the inn yard, and rode on the roof, and in Piccadilly an alarm was given, just as I got on the box to start; I saw him stooping down; he pretended that he had dropped his glove on the near side of the coach; the guard gave it to him; I asked him if he knew the man who was with him, assisting to take the bag out; he said he did: he turned round to me and said,</p>
               <p>"What is your fare to Hounslow?" I said, 2 s. 6 d. He said he only gave me 2 s. the other night. I said it was 2 s. 6 d., which he gave me, and was getting down. Kirk got down and assisted in stopping him: he was stopped on getting off the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he knew the other man - A. Yes, I am positive of that. I told the Magistrate so. I did not see the guard put the bag in; the boot was nearly full, and is about two feet and a half deep I believe. The flap opens towards my feet; a man on the box can easily open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say he pretended to drop a glove - A. Because I supposed he dropped it to take off our attention. It was dropped on the ground, not into the boot.</p>

            . I am coachman of the Bath mail. On the 5th of January, I was on the Exeter mail, and saw the prisoner stooping down, helping to pull the bag out of the boot; another person on the ground, with one foot on the wheel, was pulling it out as quick as he could; the whole of it was not out; the mouth of it was out as far as it could get; the bottom of it was moved a considerable deal, it was as far out of the boot as it could come, the box being on it; they were both pulling it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing the bag to have been put in after other luggage had filled up a space in the boot, might not the bottom of the bag be still resting on that other luggage - A. I do not think it possible; it must have been lifted from the place it had stood on, or it could not be so much out; the man on the ground pulled it down, and the prisoner put his left hand down to raise it up, to assist him.</p>

I saw her take 1 d. out of his hand, he pulled his money out to pay for liquor, and let some of it fall, she picked it up; it was a half-crown; she then snatched a half-sovereign out of his hand, and said</p>

               <p>"It is a farthing, old man go and look for it." I said,</p>
               <p>"It is a sovereign, give it him, or I'll fetch a constable;" she said she had not got it. Marshall was quite drunk.</p>

            . On the night Dynan was taken I was at the Coach and Horses, Bolton-street. The officers came. Prichard, the landlord, called the prisoner, who was in the tap-room, and said,</p>
               <p>"Tom, there is a screw loose about the boxes you left here for Dynan." He took him into the passage, and was in private conversation with him when Hesketh came in. I saw the whole party together - this was between seven and eight o'clock at night. I went out, and afterwards saw him in Broad-street. He told me to fetch Prichard over to him, and about half-past ten o'clock I was at the Coach and Horses; the prisoner came in; Prichard said he ought to have been ten miles from town.</p>
