                  </hi>. I am a Magistrate of Worship-street office—St. Matthew, Bethnal-green, is in our district—Mr. Grove is a brother Magistrate—I produce a summons issued from our office—I made on the back of the summons a few rough notes, merely calculated to fix my own attention—it was a summons in place of an information agianst Mr. James Standley—I can tell the Court the evidence the prisoner gave on that occasion—I think it right to mention that without the help of these notes, I could not have spoken to this case with any degree of correctness, it went from my mind entirely, but when I was spoken to, on looking at the notes, the whole was brought to my recollection—I recollect the prisoner perfectly—he was the witness to support the summons—I remember he said he went to the house in question at about five minutes before twelve o'clock on Sunday—the allegation was that Standley kept this house open on Sunday the 7th of April, during the hours of Divine service—I remember asking him what time he went by—he stated that he went by Shoreditch clock—that he found in the house ten men and three women in the tap-room drinking and smoking—some of them were a little fresh—that in about five minutes after ten o'clock, more men came in—they had some beer, and he said in answer to a question as to the mode in which they came in, that the last ten rushed in all together, making twenty-four persons in all, including himself—he described that shortly after there came a knock at the door—and upon this knock all these persons he described were all put out into the skittle-ground—he described the knock to have been from the visitation of the officers—he said, "After the officers left, a man came and called us all in again—I stopped there about twenty minutes, and then went away, leaving the greatest part of them there"—after that there was a cross-examination by a counsel or attorney and in that cross-examined he said the door was open when he came to it, but closed when the knock came of the officers—that is the substance of what he said, with the exception of an answer to a question I asked him, he said that the man who called them in was some servant of the house.</p>

I remember being summoned at the instance of Rawlings, the informer—I at<lb/>tended before Messrs. Broughton and Grove—I remember Sunday, the 7th of April—I think the examination Was on the Thursday after—it is not true that on Sunday, the 7th of April, there were in my house ten men and three women drinking and smoking; nor that between that time and the hours of divine service finishing, ten more came in; nor that, between the hours of twelve and one, there were twenty four persons in my skittle-ground—there were no one except the carpenter, who is here—we know when the church service is ended in our parish, by the tolling of Shoreditch church bell—I did not let in any persons between eleven o'clock and the time the bell tolled—the doors were not opened at all—I was in the house or skittle-ground all the time—there is not one word of truth in twenty-four persons having been there—the carpenter was backwards and forwards into the house ail fine time.</p>

Mrs. Dixat will thank Mr. Floyd to send by bearer four pairs of black stockings, large size; two pairs of kid gloves, large size, ladies'; and a bill with them.

On the 25th of June I was walking in Bedford-street, Covent-garden, at near six o'clock in the evening—When I got near the corner of Maiden-lane I heard something fall behind me—it seemed as if it fell from my coat pocket—it sounded heavier than any thing I had about me—I walked a step or two, and then turned and saw my key lying on the stones—I turned, and walked slowly back, put my hand in my pocket, and missed my purse—while I was walking towards the key, the prisoner came to me and said, "That is your key"—I took it up and the prisoner said, "There they go! there they go!" pointing to Maiden-lane—I then turned in the same direction I was before, and at the same instant the officer took the prisoner—the purse has not been found—there were several people in the street, and as near to me as the prisoner—I heard two or three window-sashes thrown up, and the people gathered a little—my purse contained a half-crown, and some other silver, about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in all.</p>

On the 28th of June I did not give out any corn to the prisoner, to be taken to Mr. Harvey's—this is the sample of corn which came from the sack—there was corn and oats of this description in the stable which the prisoner came out of—I firmly believe it is the same—I had on the Thursday before given him corn for his horses, to last him till the Monday following—he had no right to have this corn.</p>

I have known the prisoner some time by his living as footman with Mr. Morrice, my master's relation, in the Regent's-park—the servants at the two houses became acquainted with each other—since he left Mr. Morrice's service he has been constantly, for the last three months, coming to my master's house—on the 9th of May I put the plate Into the chest—it had been taken out on the 8th for a party which my master had—I found it all correct by the lists which were in the plate-chest—it was the plate which Mr. Farquhar's mother had sent, and the lists were in Mrs. Farquhar's hand-writing—the prisoner was there when I put it away, and helped me to clean it—I kept the key of the plate-chest in a writing-desk over the stable—I kept it in my pocket for several days be<lb/>fore I put it away—he knew where I kept it—on the 10th of June I went to the chest, and missed the things—I did not find the same lists there as I had left there on the 9th of May, but two fresh ones in a different hand writing—one of the two other lists was in a young lady's handwriting, and the other was Mrs. Farquhar's writing—the plate left in the chest nearly corresponded with the lists that had been substituted—seventeen large spoons, eleven small forks, and other things had been taken away.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 16th of June, about ten minutes before four o'clock, I was in bed, and was awoke by a noise in my yard—I got out of bed to see what it was, and saw Borritt in my yard, which leads into Mr. Whiting's at the beer-shop—I returned to the bed side, but could not awake my husband—I returned back to the window, and saw two men both in my yard with a bag containing something—Borritt was one—I cannot speak to the other—I went to open my yard door, and Borritt got over the wall towards Norton's-buildings, which are in Back-lane—he could get out that way—he would have to get over three walls before he came to mine—when I saw him getting over the wall I opened the street door, and called "Police"—the short man was standing in the yard—he had handed the bag up to the tall man, (Borritt,) who sat across the wall—I opened the side door, which opens into Norton's-buildings—a person coming from there must pass my door—I saw Borritt come past—he passed me close, and when I called police he said, "You b—fool, what are you making a noise about? there is nothing going to hurt you"—I said, "I don't know that, you had as lief hurt me as any one else, it is you, is it, sir?"—I saw who it was, and knew him when he spoke to me—I knew him by the name of Punt—I went out to the end of the court, and saw a policeman, and then Borritt ran round—the bag was dropped over the wall as Borritt jumped over—it fell on the outside in my court—I kept it till Barber the policeman came, and gave it to him—I swear Borritt is the man that spoke to me.</p>

On Saturday night, the 15th of June, I was on duty near New Gravel-lane—Hart's house is seven or eight doors from High-street, and West's-gardens about the same distance—a person coming from the beer-shop could get into Norton's buildings without going up New Gravel-lane by getting over a pigstye, and coming round Dockwall, then getting over into the beer-shop yard, and from there over some fences into Norton's-buildings without coming into the street at all—a man came to the door next door to the beer-shop, and called "Police," a little after three o'clock—in consequence of what he said I went up to him, and heard a cry of "Police" from Norton's buildings—before the man could hardly speak to me I turned round, and saw Borritt running as fast as he could—I immediately sprang my rattle, and followed, but could not catch him—they then said, "Here are some more backwards in the yard"—I went through a house into the beer-shop yard, and looked round—I saw a short man dropping from the beer-shop wall into Norton's-buildings—I went round to catch him, and in the court was Mrs. Clark, who gave me a sack containing property, and said Borritt had just dropped it—I searched for the short man, but he got away—about twenty minutes after as I returned from the station-house I saw Wiseman at the top of New Gravel-lane close by Norton's-buildings—I knew him, and said, "Wiseman, do you know any thing about the sack you lent Borritt?"—he said, "Yes, I lent him a sack, he said it was to get some tobacco out of the Docks, and I am very sorry I did now"—when Borritt was taken into custody, which was on the Monday week following, I went to</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Lower-road, Islington. On the 2nd of July the prisoners came into my shop, and Bond left two yards and a half of ribbon to be dyed pink, by the following day—a few minutes afterwards a person came and gave us information, and on looking round I missed a silk gown out of the window—I went to No. 36, Providence-row, and waited there several minutes—a witness went to the window, and called out to ask if any body was there—he received no answer, but we saw the prisoners crouch down at the side of the bed—they came to the window—we asked for the silk dress—Bond said if we would not send for a policeman they would give it to us—I said nothing to that, and they produced it.</p>

I saw the two prisoners come out of the prosecutor's shop—when they got a few yards they took to running—I thought they had stolen something, and ran after them—they turned into a house, and I lost sight of them—I went and informed the prosecutor, and went with him to the house in Providence-row—I knocked at the door—nobody answered—I opened the window, and saw them crouch down by the side of the wall—I said, "You had better give the dress up, and open the door and come out"—they both handed the dress out, bit by bit—it was in pieces.</p>

               <p>—she said, "Two coats"—I said, "What, old coats?"—she said, "Yes, rubbishing old things which were given to my husband; they are good for nothing"—I said, Where did this box come from which she had got?—she said, "I do not know"—I said, "Here are a pair of stays"—she said she had bought them—she said she was taken very ill, and wanted to go to the water-closet, but I found the back door shut—I allowed her to go to the bottom of the stairs—I afterwards took her to the station-house, where she was searched.</p>

               <p>one I gave him, but I gave him another for it, because I felt rather alarmed at his appearance, and thought I had better lose the shilling—I kept it distinct—on Sunday, the 23rd, he came again for the Dispatch newspaper, which comes to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him change, and he went out in a moment—Mr. Mason came in and spoke to me—I gave him the half-crown—he ran out, and brought the prisoner back—the prisoner asked me to take the money back, and give him the half-crown—he asked me not to give him in charge, and went down on his knees—I said, "Let the man go, as he has given the change back," but Mr. Mason would not let him go, and then he seemed to be resolute, and tried to knock the half-crown out of his hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Harrington, a cow-keeper at West-end, Hampstead. The prisoner assisted us for three days to make hay—on Saturday night, the 22nd of June, about twelve o'clock, I heard our ducks make a noise—I got up and came down—I saw one duck in the yard, and all the doors and gates open—the ducks had been in the hen-house, all safely shut up—I missed three ducks and one drake—one was sitting, and he took it off—the prisoner had slept in our barn, but he had finished on the Friday night, and we had done with him—the ducks were dead when I saw them again, but I knew them to be mine.</p>

On the 9th of June I went to this house in New-street—I got in first, and found the prisoner Blake on the top of the landing on the first floor—I told him I wanted him for the robbery committed at Mr. Reynauld's, in Bond-street—be said he knew nothing of it—I took him into the left-hand front room to search him, and there I apprehended the prisoner Syrett—I found some lucifer-matches on Blake, which are used by house-breakers—I took Syrett into custody, and found on him a satin waistcoat (he was wearing it) 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prosecutor claimed the waistcoat—I asked Syrett whose the things were in the room where I found him—he said they were all his—I found in that room this piece of shot silk and this shirt—I took a pair of trowsers off his person at the police-station, and the prosecutor identified them—I asked Syrett what he had done with the M'lntosh—he said it was down stairs, hanging across the bedstead in the parlour—I left him in charge, went down into the parlour, and found it on the bedstead in the room, Langley was in—I took it up stairs to Syrett, and he said, "That is it—it is mine"—we took them to the station-house—I had a small crow-bar delivered to me there—it had been left on the prosecutor's premises—when I was at Queen-square office I heard Agar say he had won the money, or <hi rend="italic">some</hi> money—he was in the lobby, talking to Blake.</p>

On the 1st of June I was there as house-surgeon—the prisoner was brought in first—I examined his throat—there was a cut just below the chin, an inch and a half or two inches in length, dividing only the skin, and not dangerous—I found no other cut about him—he was very soon the better of that—he was in a state of very great excitement, which myself and the surgeons supposed to be caused by passion aggravated by liquor—he exclaimed, "My wife, my beautiful wife"—he was very violent the whole day, screaming and crying the greater part of the day—we were obliged to put on a strait-waistcoat—he remained in the hospital, rather more than a fortnight—he continued in that state about three days—it then went off of itself—he had no more than one dose of opium, which was administered immediately on his coming in, and it was repeated at night—he had two doses—that was all the medical treatment to which he was subjected—we did not take any blood from him—he was very quiet during the other portion of the fortnight, with the exception of one evening, when some friends of his wife came and told him he would be transported, or something of that sort, and then he assumed the same state of excitement as when he first came in—it only continued that evening—he was in the hospital about a week after that, I think, and was tranquil during that time—his wife was brought in about twenty minutes after him—I found on her six stabs, one on the upper part of the chin, two by the side of the ear, and three on the back of the neck—I found paralysis of the lower extremities, and partial paralysis of the upper—I supposed that to be produced by a blow on the spine—the two wounds by the ear were dan<lb/>gerous—she is still suffering under paralysis, but is out of danger—she was under my care five weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you keep the man in the hospital a fortnight for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For debility and weakness—he was in a weak state when he was brought in—I do not know what it arose from—the cut was not cured for eight days—it is difficult to cure cuts in that position, from the motion of the head—he did not tear open the wound—a policeman sat up with him constantly, and a nurse was in the same ward—the po<lb/>liceman did not sit up to take care of him, he was in custody—there</p>

               <p>were several policemen—they changed and relieved each other—I never beard from the policeman that he had attempted to open his wound several times—I thought it was excitement—I did not know whether he was dis<lb/>sembling or not—he had not the symptoms of insanity about him—I kept the strait-waistcoat on him two nights, I think—that was because ha, was violent—insane persons are often violent—if I had been told he had tried several times in the night to open his wound, I should have considered that a reason for putting the strait-waistcoat on him—I gave him nothing but two doses of opium, and a small dose of opening medicine—that was all he had—he was kept on low diet for a day or two, and then on full diet—I heard when he came in, that he had been cupped in the morning.</p>

I went to the prisoner's lodging—I found the prosecutrix on the floor—the prisoner was there—I asked him why he did this—he said, "I did it myself, policeman, we have both consented to die together"—he was trying to open the wound, which I endeavoured to prevent, and he bit me on the arm—he bit through my coat—he said it was all very well while he worked for her, but when she had had a little money left her, she despised him—that he had done it that no other might have her—I saw him again that afternoon at the hospital, and he said he wished he could get a cut or two more at her, but he had lost his knife—he said, if they would give him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides what he had, he would leave this country, and go to Germany, for he would not be hanged, he would be tried by the Hanoverian law—I helped to put the strait-waistcoat on him—he was very violent then—I continued there with him till half-past nine o'clock at night—he was very violent most of that time—another policeman then took my place, and I did not see him after<lb/>wards—when in the hospital he made an attempt to enlarge the wound in his throat once—that was when the strait-waistcoat was on him—he struggled, and got his hands adrift—he was prevented from putting his hands to his throat—he said, "Oh, my lovely wife, I have not been the death of her."</p>

About a quarter before six o'clock, on the 20th of June, I went to the infirmary at Greenwich hos<lb/>pital, and the prisoner was given into my charge—I heard Lieutenant Rivers put some questions to him—he said nothing to him to induce him to con<lb/>fess nor did he threaten him—when he first went into the ward, he said, "How is it you came to do this job? I am ordered by the governor to give you over to the civil power"—he said he was greatly agitated, and Adams had called him names—Mr. Rivers then asked him what names—he said, "Irish rascal," and so forth—I asked the prisoner if they had attempted to strike him—he said they had done so—I asked who it was—he said they had not done it, but only threatened to do it—I bad the knife in my hand, and showed it to the prisoner—he said, "It is my knife."</p>
