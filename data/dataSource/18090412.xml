               <p>ROBEAT COOMME. Q. You are a soldier in the seventh veteran battalion - A. Yes. On the 28th of February I was a centinel at the magazine at the end of the white tower; I was stationed at the Tower; the prisoner was a labourer belonging to the Tower, he was employed by the board of ordnance. On this day, about twenty minutes before six in the afternoon, I observed the prisoner go behind some old ropes, I saw him take some paint up in a bladder and put it in his pocket; I took it out, I told him he should not have it; I kept the paint till the corporal came to relieve me; I let the prisoner go; I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH. I was corporal of the guard. I received the paint of the last witness; I delivered it to the officer of the guard; he delivered it to Gotty the officer.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to the Thames police. The paint I got from the clerk of the storehouse; I have had it ever since. I apprehended the prisoner in Brush alley, East Smithfield, on the 3d of March; I told him I must take him in custody for stealing the paint, and a pistol that he had taken from the Tower; he said he knew nothing about the pistol, he had not got it.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOPER. I am clerk in the storekeeper's office in the Tower; the prisoner was employed as an extra man in the different store offices.</p>

On this evening I went down to get a bit of wood to light a fire; this paper I saw there; I took it up, the centinel ordered me to put it down again; I put it down again, and then he said nothing to me, he was not thirty yards from me at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of November last were you disturbed at any time of the night - 
               <persName id="t18090412-2-person56">A. </persName>
            Yes, about four o'clock on the morning of the 20th I was awoke by a light in the adjoining room to my sleeping room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in your sleeping room - A. No; it is a small room which I sleep in; I keep the door open to let air in from the adjoining room; the adjoining room is a large room which I keep as a warehouse; the light from the adjoining room appeared by flashes. I saw two men.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not one steady uniform light - A. No. I saw the two men in a stooping position in the adjoining room, at the table in which the door of my bed room was open; the table was on the same side of the room as the door of the adjoining room I sleep in, and the men stood between the table and the wainscot, and in their hands was a jeweller's case open; the jeweller's case had been in a bureau; I had locked it up the over night myself about eight o'clock; the bureau was in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by a jeweller's case - A. It is a case that is carried about town to the jewellers' shops, it is covered with leather, but the substance is wood; the prisoner was the further man from me; the other man intercepted the sight of his face from me, I had a better view of the other man; instantly as I perceived the two men in the room I rose up, I searched for my sword, but from the alarm of the men I went without it: the instant I arose their light disappeared.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them - A. I saw them again on the stairs, but their light was so diminished I could only distinguish two forms of men on the stairs; I threw up the landing place window and called to the watchman; they went down stairs and out of the door; I saw them go up the court from the window; they went out of the court and escaped. I went to Roberts's lodgings as soon as I could dress myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was his lodgings - A. In a court in Holborn; he was not there himself, there was a woman in the room. I found none of my property in his room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine your jeweller's box, or was that gone - A. The jeweller's box was not gone, part of the goods were gone; I examined the jeweller's box when I returned from Robert's lodgings; I went to Roberts' lodgings about five o'clock in the morning; I returned home in about two hours, then I examined the premises; I found then that they had been in my workshop at the top of the house, and they had taken away some gold in an unfinished state. I sleep in the first floor; the workshop is over where I sleep. I missed from the workshop seals, broaches, and various articles in an unfinished state.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine your bureau in the room adjoining - A. Yes. I found it broken open; I had locked it about eight o'clock, before I went to bed; out of the bureau there had been taken twenty ounces of unwrought gold, besides several seals and gold net chains. I had seen them the over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the house below stairs to see how these people came in - A. I went into the kitchen;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120004"/>I found the window open, the sash was thrown up, and the shutters were removed from the window, and in their usual place in the kitchen, and the street door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. You have described the room which the two men were in being the room in which your bedroom door opened - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the table by which they were standing, how far was it from your bed room door - A. About a yard, and very close to the wainscot; the side of my bed was towards the door; it is a small room; the bed was close as could be to the door, only room enough just to undress myself; when the flash of light came I could see the men while I was in bed; the flash of light continued only an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. The only view you had of seeing the prisoner was only an instant during this flash of light - A. Yes; I only just saw him imperfectly, because the other man was between me and him. I do not know who the other man was; I had a better sight of him than the prisoner, but I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say the prisoner was one of the men - A. I could not swear to his face, I only speak as to his general appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before - A. He had worked for me a little while before; he had worked in the shop, and then I gave him work out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your goods out at any time - A. I found them out, but I could not trace them to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether you can now swear that the prisoner was one of the men that were in your room - A. To the best of my knowledge, I believe it; I cannot swear to him by his face; the other man intercepted the sight of his face from me; I only saw part of his whisker of one side; I will not take upon me to swear; by the appearance of the man altogether I believe him to be the man; but his face I could not at all swear to, I might be mistaken.</p>

On the 13th of February my wife and I were sitting at dinner; the prisoner at the bar came into the shop; my wife said there is Mary, shall I ask her in; she then said to the prisoner, Mary, will you go and order a pint of beer; the girl readily went for the beer and brought it in; my wife asked her if she would take a piece of beef, she said thank you, ma'am, no; at the time she came into the room a customer came into the shop. I went into the shop and left my wife in the room; when I was in the room my wife laid two seven shilling pieces on the table and a crooked shilling; at the time I was serving the customer another customer came in; then my wife got up and came into the shop, leaving the girl there; my wife had not been long behind the counter before she saw the girl coming out, she asked her some questions, but what I do not know; the prisoner then went out of the side door very quick; my wife went down stairs, she returned immediately and went into the room, and said the girl had robbed us. I then went and missed the money and my silver watch. I immediately went in pursuit of her, but could not find her; I had an accident - sprained my knee and hurt my thumb.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>MRS. SULLY. The prisoner was a servant with me about two years back, and upon my hearing that she had a cruel mother I always, when she came to me made her welcome. On the 13th of February the prisoner came to me, I put my hand in my pocket, took out two seven shilling pieces and a crooked shilling; a customer came into the shop, my husband went into the shop to serve the customer; Mr. Sharp, who was with us, followed him immediately into the shop; I said, Mary, will you have a piece of beef, and when the second customer came in I went into the shop and left the girl in the room; I am sure there was nobody in the room but the girl. When I was in the shop I heard the side door creak; I was rather surprised to hear the door; I said, Mary (she said yes, ma'am), I am going down stairs; I saw her countenance change, I thought she might not be well; I turned into the room and found the two seven shilling pieces which had been on the table, gone; immediately from there I went into the kitchen, I said Mary is gone, good God,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120005"/>she has robbed me; my husband said, robbed indeed! my watch is gone; I said go after her; the watch was a family watch. Mr. Sharp went after her one way and my husband the other; Mr. Sully slipped down; they could not find her; she was found on the Wednesday week following; she was brought by an officer from Mile End in a coach to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the watch - A. Never; I told her she had acted very cruel to me. I said Mary, if you will return the watch I will let you go; she told me not to talk to her, she should go before my betters, it was too late to talk about the watch, it was not in my power to liberate her.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known this young woman some time - A. Yes; she lived with me about five months. I never found any thing amiss while she lived with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. There was one lodger in the house - was there not - A. I believe there was.</p>
               <p>MR. SHARP. On the 13th of February, about half past one, I was in Mr. Sully's back room; the prisoner came in, Mrs. Sully asked her to get a pint of beer, she brought it; there were two seven shilling pieces on the table and a shilling, and two watches were in the room; we were in the back room altogether. After the prisoner had fetched the beer a customer came in the shop; Mr. Sully went to the shop, I followed him immediately, I stood outside of the counter; another customer came in; Mrs. Sully came out, leaving the prisoner in the room alone. In the course of a minute or two I saw this young woman get up from the chair and sit down again; about a minute after that she came out of the shop; Mrs. Sully and she talked together; Mrs. Sully went down stairs, came up and went into the room, she exclaimed, good God! she has robbed us. I went one way and Mr. Sully the other after her; we did not find her.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM REID. I am an officer. On the 25th of February I apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Sully's house: I searched her, and found nothing about her; I searched her lodgings, I found nothing there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

            . Q. On the 8th of March were you robbed any where in the highway - A. On Wednesday the 8th of March I was returning to town from Hendon. About ten minutes before six in the evening I was stopped by three footpads on the <placeName id="t18090412-6-crimeloc30">Hampstead road, near Chalk farm</placeName>

               <p>Q. Which of them asked you for your pocket book - A. I believe it was the prisoner at the bar, he was upon my left; I told him I never carried one. Afterwards the same person said there was no time to lose, the same person felt about me and felt my watch; he dragged the watch out of my watch pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was it - A. A silver watch, a steel chain, and a small silver seal. After they had robbed me they told me to return back from whence I came - to Hampstead - this was in the Hampstead road.</p>
               <p>Q. When they presented the pistols what did they say to you - A. They said nothing further than stop.</p>
               <p>Q. When the man had taken the watch from you, he told you to return back to Hampstead - A. Yes. When I went back towards Hampstead on the Hampstead road, one of the parties called after me and said, if any body stopped me, to say my business was done by a party on the road; I returned back some Distance, I met some gentlemen coming to town, I returned with them, and when I came with them to the Half way house we met some Bow street officers. I told them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the persons that stopped you before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a light was there - A. It was light sir, not very light indeed, there was no moon.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was a cloudy night - how was the person dressed that took the watch from you - A. He wore a velveteen jacket and breeches; they were all in velveteen or a dark brown thick set.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed in other respects - A. I took no other notice of his dress than he had on a velveteen jacket and breeches. I had never seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. What size man was he - A. Tall and rather stout; I saw him about a fortnight afterwards at Worship street office before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the person who robbed you, so as to speak with certainty - A. I cannot say any further than with regard to his dress; I think he is the person that took the watch from me, I cannot speak to his features; on the contrary, I was too much frightened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You say one of these men had a jacket on, it was a cloudy night, and you were under very great alarm - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>OBADIAH COOPER. I am a pawnbroker, I live with Mr. Cordy, 163 Ratcliffe Highway.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any watch pawned by the prisoner - A. Yes; on the 9th of February a watch, chain, and small silver seal.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner was the man - A. Yes, he pledged it in the name of

               <p>Q. You say that whoever it was that pawned the watch at your shop, you had never seen him before - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT, to prosecutor. Look at that watch - A. This is the watch that was taken from me on the 8th of February, and this is the chain and seal, it is my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120006"/>property; I am certain it is my watch, chain, and seal.</p>

               <p>Q. Now let Mr. Cooper see whether that is the duplicate he gave to the prisoner - A. It is.</p>

               <p>BARNARD GLEED. I am a patrol belonging to Bow street office, attached to Worship street office. On Saturday the 25th of February, I was at Mr. Perkins's, pawnbroker, Bishopsgate street, the corner of Widegate alley. Esther Newnham, a little girl, came in with a ring in her hand; she asked the pawnbroker what it was worth; I heard the conversation, and I saw her leave it; I came out of the shop and stood at the corner of Widegate alley, I saw the little girl come out of the shop, she went down Widegate alley into Petticoat lane; I followed her; she went from there into Artillery street, she went into Bishopsgate street, she went towards Shoreditch church; she then went up to

I took them both into custody, and took them to Mr. Mason's house, an officer of Worship street office.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the ring while the prisoner was talking to the little girl - A. No; I saw it on the counter at the pawnbrokers; they had refused to take it in of the little girl.</p>

The last witness brought the prisoner and the little girl to my house; I left the prisoner with Gleed for him to take her to the office; I went to the pawnbroker's; this ring was delivered up to me. The prisoner told me two or three stories, the last I believe to be the truth, that she found it in her master's garden in the City road; first she said she found it in Hackney road, then she said she found it in the City road, and then she said she found it in her master's garden; I asked her if she had shewed it to her master and mistress; she said she had not.</p>

Yes; I know it to be mine, I lost it from my dwelling house; at the time it was lost I lived in York place, St. Mary, Islington; the prisoner lived servant in the house at the time, she was cook. In the latter end of December Mrs. Whitmore took it off her finger and dropped it in the dining room accidentally as she was going to bed; Mrs. Whitmore looked for it but did not find it; Mrs. Whitmore spoke to all the servants when she went up to bed about it.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120007"/>Q. You did not know of it the over night - A. No; the next morning I came into the dining room, the prisoner shewed me two rings in the dining room of my mistress's house; she said she thought my mistress had left these two rings upon the piano forte; she gave them to my mistress; my mistress said there was another ring dropped, to both of us; we both searched for it; I went and shook the green baize in the front area, I shook the ring out; I gave the ring to the prisoner, she was the first that came into the kitchen; she gave it to my mistress; that was the third ring.</p>

Yes, against the area door; my mistress said there was another, she said there was four dropped, she described the ring to both of us; she said it was a gold ring set with diamonds: we both searched for it; I never knew of it being found.</p>

               <p>Q. Where had she put them - A. To the best of my recollection she had put them on the marble slab over the fire place.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the whole of them dropped - A. Yes; I believe two of them were found that night; I heard of one being found, I was not at home at the time. That ring has got children's hair in it, set with diamonds.</p>

               <p>Q. You said something about Brown's tavern - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not a house that was indicted - A. By the informers it was, and I took my trial by the informers.</p>
               <p>Q. You have denominated it a tavern - A. It was so called a long while before I knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. This poor girl has lived with you - A. That I have informed you.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe some application has been made to her to come back, has there not - A. That I do not know, I leave that to my housekeeper, I never heard of any solicitation.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect at any time the prisoner at the bar coming into your house - A. Yes, she came the 29th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the bar besides you and the girl - A. Not a soul. I received a ten pound note previous to her coming in, to take for three pints of wine out of it; I took from the till a five pound note, two two-pound notes, and the rest in small change to make up the ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they bank notes - A. Yes; I put them on the desk over the till; I received the ten pound note of a captain of a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. No person was in the bar waiting for the change was there - A. No. After I had taken the bank notes out of the desk, the prisoner came into the bar, she came from towards the kitchen; I did not know that she was in the house. Nearly at the same time that she came into the bar, a man that I am in the habit of purchasing eggs and butter came in and asked me if I wanted any thing, he came to a table that stood under the bar window; I stepped out of the bar one step, I bought two shillingsworth of eggs, I returned into the bar and took up the money, which I had placed before on the desk; I counted over the notes, I missed two two-pound notes; one of the two pound notes had writing with red ink, and the word Soho in black ink; the other was an old dirty note and torn. I said I had missed some money; I opened the till, I could not find any such money; I turned round to the prisoner and said I had lost two two-pound notes from off the desk; she seemed rather agitated when I mentioned it, she said there has no person been in the bar but you and I, and either you or I must have the money, rather impertinently, so I convinced her that I had got no such money. I rang the bar bell, and told the waiter to call his master; Mr. Griffiths came, he sent for an officer; I gave the officer, when he came, the description of the money that I had lost; the officer said to her, if you have the money say so; she positively denied it; before the officer came I saw her shuffling her hands in her bosom. The officer has the notes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. I understood you to say you had left the notes on the desk - A. Yes; they were both taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120008"/>together.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your waiter's name -

            ; he does not live there now.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the house sometimes passed in the name of the waiter who has lived in it - A. Not to my knowledge; the name of Brown is kept on the door. It always passed in the name of Brown.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday the 27th of March, I was sent for to go to Brown's tavern; I went there. I found the prisoner along with the housekeeper in the bar; the last witness informed me that she had lost two two-pound notes; she said there was nobody in the bar but their two selves; she said she certainly must have it; the prisoner denied having the notes; Mr. Griffiths came and insisted upon her being searched; the housekeeper said the notes are wrote in red ink, and in black ink was wrote Soho upon the same note; she said she thought she had them in her bosom, by her putting her hand up to her bosom; I told her I must search her, and desired her to unpin her clothes, which she did immediately; she unpinned her clothes by her breast, I saw the ends of the notes under her clothes; I took the notes out of her bosom; I shewed them to the housekeeper; on my examining the notes I found they were just as she described them; these are the notes I took from her bosom.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Havendon. These are the two two-pound notes, one has red ink upon it, and the word Soho; I can swear to the two-pound notes, because I had no other two-pound notes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, and called no witnesses to her character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in the shop - A. I am not certain of it, I was in the shop. On the 1st of April, between six and seven in the evening, I came to the door; we have got a large window inside of the shop, it has got a quantity of lace hanging upon it; on my coming there the prisoner saw me; she ran away;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120009"/>there was a number of women standing there. On her running away. I looked at the lace, I saw there was a deficiency of one piece of lace; I pursued the prisoner and caught her at the corner of the market; I found the lace in her apron; she said some person had given it her, or she had picked it up in the street, I do not know which; I am sure I had not sold the lace. I had seen it hanging on the window an hour before; there were others serving in the shop, but none near the lace; I was serving the lace.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any body standing in the street, take this lace off the windows - A. Yes, they could if they were to put their hand forward.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you, my lord, if it was the last minute I had to speak or breathe, I never entered the shop to buy, sell, or thieve; I happened to be going along the street on the other side of the way, I saw great number of people standing at his door, I suppose forty; I went over to see what it was; he had a great quantity of laces hanging out to attract poor distressed people, as he always has; you may know by the colour of the lace that it was never taken out of the shop, it was on the ground; a woman took it up, she said it was hers by her picking it up; she was going to lay it down; one of the women said do not lay it down again; she gave it me. I was very much distressed indeed; I thought he would never be the worse for it; I was out of work and very much afflicted with sickness - and as I stand here he has sworn false as God is true, what he has spoke against me.</p>

The day following he called, he told me he had not been to shew the pot, he was then going out with it in his bag to shew it to the customer, and was to call the next day; from that time I saw no more of him or the pot till I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Because he did not pay you for the pot so you took him up for a felony - A. I took him up before I saw the pot in pledge; he had pledged the pot the day he had it of me, and he sold the duplicate.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the whole house yours - A. Yes, I inhabit it. On Saturday last, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at home in the shop; at the same time I believe the whole family was at home - my wife and three daughters. Two or three persons came in, and wished me to go out and see whether I had lost any thing; on my going out I perceived a corner of a square had been cut, and some seals had been taken out, with some instrument; the watchman ran after the persons, and brought them back; one of them took the seals out of his pocket, and threw them on the counter.</p>
               <p>- SATCHELL. I am a labourer in the East India warehouse and watchman of Bridge ward. It is customary for us to receive our money on Saturday night at the watchouse by London bridge. On my returning back I observed the prisoners at Mr. Kidgell's shop window; their appearance occasioned me to look at them; I perceived the pane of glass before which they stood was broken across in a corner direction; I judged from that they were robbing the shop; I went to the stand of coaches opposite Mr. Kidgell's shop, and communicated my suspicion to the waterman who was standing by the horses, either watering or feeding them, I do not know which; we both stood together, looking at them for the space of five or six minutes, not more, rather less; finding they left the window, I went into Mr. Kidgell's shop; I asked him if he had lost any thing out of the broken pane of glass in the window; he expressed his surprize that it was broke, immediately looked, and told me that he had. I immediately ran out of his shop and called the waterman to my assistance, followed the prisoners up Nag's head court, secured the prisoner Carter, and directed the waterman to secure the other. I brought them back into Mr. Kidgell's shop; the prisoner Carter immediately turned out the seals from his pocket and put them on the counter; he said that he was the person but that he knew nothing of the other young fellow. As I brought them into Mr. Kidgell's door I saw Salmon, who is a constable; I called him in, I told him I thought I should want his assistance. We immediately conveyed him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first observed these men at the window were they together - A. They were very close together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to you to be connected - A. I judged that they must be connected because that I observed one of them taking something out, or forcing it out; I could not understand the other to be a bystander; if he was, he must have seen it, he was so close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you saw it, and you was at some distance - A. At first I passed close behind them, then I went into the middle of the street; they went away together and turned into Nag's head court.</p>
               <p>Carter. When I went up to the window the window was broken.</p>

I turned my head, I saw the two prisoners close together; the prisoner Carter was active with his fingers; I saw them together till they parted from the spot; then they went up Nag's head court. The moment Mr. Satchell came out I followed him up the court.</p>

            . I am an officer; I have got the seals and a knife; I took that from the prisoner Carter; that was every thing he had about him. I searched the prisoner Cooper. I found upon him several rounds of wire; I am not certain whether I returned it to the prisoner or left it on the counter; it was an iron wire, about the size of a knitting needle; when it was pulled out it was about a yard long.</p>
               <p>Q. to Kidgell. Now with respect to this window, was it whole before - A. Yes, I saw it whole in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them produced the seals to you, look at them - A. This piece of glass is half the glass that was taken out; the hole was as big again as that.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they taken out - A. I do not know, unless by that wire. These are all my seals; they are worth above twenty pounds - at least twenty pounds; they are gold seals.</p>

               <p>Q. to Salmon. Was there any hook at the end of this wire - A. I cannot say I perceived it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window cut or broken - A. Broken.</p>
               <p>COURT, to Satchell. Do you know whether these two prisoners were talking together - A. I did not hear them; they appeared to be so close together that one could not do any thing without the other seeing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Rogers. Do you know from the position they were in, whether they seemed to have any conversation - A. That I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not think that Cooper was an indifferent spectator, do you - A. No. They were standing nearly face to face, and when they were taken they were both together then.</p>

On the 2nd of March, about half past twelve o'clock in the day, the prisoner came into the shop; the woman that was with her asked for a pair of black stockings; I shewed her some at two shillings a pair; while the woman was looking at the stockings, I perceived the prisoner stoop down and pick up something and was putting it under her clothes; the woman that was looking at the stockings offered me twenty-pence; I told her I could not take it. The prisoner laid hold of the child that was with her, and said come my dear, and went out, and the woman that was looking at the stockings immediately followed her out; one turned down the street and the other up the street; I followed the prisoner and asked her what she had got under her cloak; she said only this; I found it was three pair of pantaloons. I sent for a constable and gave charge of her.</p>

On this day I was going along; a woman met me she said do not you get your living by charing; I said yes; she said will you go along with me and do half a day's work; I said yes. Turning up Sun street she said come in here with me, I want to buy a pair of stockings; I went in with her; that gentleman shewed her a pair of stockings, my little child was running about the shop; I took the child and said come, and went out of the shop; the woman came out with me, she gave me these things; the gentleman came up and said what have you got; I said these, the woman gave them me. I am entirely innocent of this theft.</p>

On the 15th of March I was in the Tower view room; it is the general place for all the guns to go of the Tower description; I had suspicion that Blowen had taken away some guns, I looked round the room and saw some of the guns of Blowen's marked with chalk standing close to Price's gun's; I counted them guns and found twenty nine standing there, including this gun that was chalked of Blowen's; in twenty minutes afterwards, or thereabouts, Blowen had finished all the business he had got to do, he went home; in about twenty minutes afterwards I had finished all I had to do, I counted these guns again, and counted but twenty six; I immediately went to

When I found these four I put them behind the bed that my brother might not have a beating for them, because the boy had brought four guns in before, and my master beat him severely for it; I meaned to send them back to the tower at the watering time, then my master would not have known it.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had done this did your master come in - A. Yes; I did not acquaint my master with it; I went out to get a side of brass, and while I was gone my master was taken up to the office for the four guns; upon that I went to the officer to deliver my evidence. I found my master locked up and his hearing was done with.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath had your master any knowledge of these guns being behind the bed - A. I do not believe he knew of it; the number to be returned was ten, and we had only nine.</p>

            . I am a constable of Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself find any thing, and where - A. Yes; in the dwelling house of Cane, the elder.</p>
               <p>Q. Then one of the prisoner's is Cane's son, is not he - A. Yes; he lived with his father; I found in this house two penknives; they laid upon a shelf in the house; that was on Saturday the 16th of March. A silver box the old man gave me himself, where he was at work, at Mrs. Johnson's; I had heard he had a box, I asked him for it.</p>

               <p>Q. What was his employment - A. Something in the sack way, either spinning or weaving.</p>
               <p>Q. This was before you went to his house - A. Yes, in the same morning; after I had been to the house I went after the boys; I did not find them till Saturday, they were brought from Brentford. On Thursday the old man had a bag with him; on the Friday I went with him from our cage to the justice; when he came back I examined the bag, I found a razor, and I picked up another razor that had dropped out of the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it drop -

               <p>Q. Did you see any body sign it - A. Yes; I think it was Mr. Arabin and Dr. Parry, and the two boys signed it; they made a mark. The prisoners were told by Mr. Arabin that they need not say any thing to convict themselves if they did not like, I had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120013"/>asked them any thing.

On the 9th of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner Weston came into the shop, he asked me the price of a coat in the window, which he took to be a blue one; I told him it was a green coat; he asked me the price of that; I told him four pounds; he them went out and called Morris by the name of Jem; they both came in, he told Morris what I said respecting the coat; Morris made answer it was too much money to give, he could not afford it; they then both went out - Weston, with a view of looking at other coats that were in the window. He came in again, he asked me if I had a blue one; I told him I had, but I could not sell it to him; I shewed it to him. He asked me what I would make a blue one for; I told him four guineas; he then called Morris again by the name of Jem, he told him I would make him a blue coat for four guineas; Morris made answer again, called him Bill, it was too much money, he could not afford it. Weston then said he would have one, and he would give me two pounds as a deposit; he desired me to take his measure; he had a great coat on; I told him he must take his great coat off, or else I could not measure him; he said, oh yes, I will pull both my coats off; he did. I told him I could not measure him in that manner, he must put one on again; Weston said, oh yes, you can measure me, and threw out his arm. Morris said, oh Bill, you must put one on, the gentleman cannot measure you in that way. At that instant I heard a noise at the door, it was as though the buttons of a coat were hitting against the door; I was looking at Weston, with my back to Morris; I turned round to see what the noise was, I found that Morris and the blue coat were gone. I then told 
               <persName id="t18090412-20-person217">Weston</persName>
             I should detain him; he seemed very willing at first to be detained. I had nobody with me but a little girl in the back parlour, I sent her for a constable. After the girl was gone, Weston said he would not be detained; a scuffle ensued between him and me, he got out of the door, I got hold of the skirts of his coat and cried out a thief; two country stage coachmen were coming by at the same time and secured him. I did not know how to act at that time, the constable was not come; he got away, and ran twenty or thirty yards; he was secured then by the persons that were gathered round, and delivered to a watchman and taken to Bow street. Before he was taken, he said if I liked to go with him, he would go and get the coat back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Morris is the man that was with him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see Morris - A. I saw him on Friday afternoon (the next day) on Ludgate hill, in company with two more; I then did not say any thing. On the Monday following I saw him at Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you, when you saw him on the Friday, not to stop him - A. I had passed him before I saw him; I was very fatigued, I had been walking near the whole day.</p>

               <p>Morris's Defence. I never saw the gentleman before with my eyes, and as to the coat it is my own property. That young man is innocent of the crime laid to his charge.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you put them there - A. I had aired them on the Sunday and put them in the drawers; I missed a silver hunting watch off the mantle piece, and two silver tea spoons from off the tea board in the buffet.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, John's Hill, St. George's in the East, nearly opposite of Mrs. Straffing's. On this Sunday, about eleven o'clock at night, I heard a noise, I opened my door and saw Mrs. Straffing, she said she was robbed, I went into her house and strait into the yard to see if any of the mould was disturbed; I observed two tracks of feet from the back door to the right of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How long these steps had been there you could not tell - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a window from the prisoner's house that looks into this yard of Mrs. Straffing's - A. There is a window about two foot wide. I found a bit of an old handkerchief in the yard in a tub of water, about two foot from Mrs. Straffing's window, and I found a bit of an old rag somewhat near the water tub. On the next morning, about six o'clock, I was awoke out of my bed by a knocking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Mrs. Straffing any where - A. No; I went over to her; Mrs. Gardener was with me; I found her in Gardener's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that you accompanied her there in your examination - A. Then there is a great error in the deposition; I found her at Gardener's along with the Thames police man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man and his wife there then - A. Yes, they were both present; Mrs. Straffing was crying bitterly for her things, with that I interceded as a neighbour, I said give the poor creature her things, and have done with it; the man said speak to my wife; the prosecutrix promised to forgive them over and over again, she did upon my oath, provided she got the things again; afterwards I took the wife up stairs with the officer and myself into an empty room and spoke to her; I said your sister has promised to forgive all, for God's sake let her have the things again; I prevailed upon her to tell me where the things were, and to let her have them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any where - A. I went with the woman; I was brought from one street into another; afterwards I was told it was No. 100, Chapman street, she knocked at the door, no answer was given; she said her mother and father was not up; we waited, and the door was opened; an elderly woman came out, she asked us what induced us to come there so soon; the woman prisoner said we had been out to get some milk; the woman prisoner gave the woman some gin; while the woman was gone she took me into the yard and there I found the watch; it laid by the side of some wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it covered over - A. No; it was within the wood, but very visible; and the two spoons were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not they concealed under the wood - A. They were very plain to be seen, I put them into my coat pocket that I have on now; from there, by her desire, I went to a house in Back Church lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman prisoner go with you - A. Yes; she took me to a house; we went into a two pair of stairs room; a woman was there; she said to the woman give me these bundles, I have got to make up some money for my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that woman's name - A. God knows what the woman's name was, I never saw her before; the bundles were brought out; I took the two bundles upon my shoulders and went with them and the woman prisoner to my house; according as I understood the nature of the business between the brother and sister.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with these bundles - A. They were taken by Mrs. Straffing and the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the officer the same bundles that you brought from the woman's house - A. I took the bundles away, and the officer took them; I cannot swear to the bundles. The very identical bundle that was brought from the woman into my parlour the officer had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. Were you ever present when any sum of money was proposed by the prosecutrix - A. I can swear upon my oath she said if she had a considerable sum of money she would not prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoners - A. Between four and five years. Gardener is a worthy honest man as ever the country produced; were I possessed of five hundred pounds I would give it him; I look upon this to be done out of design.</p>
               <p>- MORANT. Q. You are an officer of the Thames police, are you not - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday morning, in consequence of any application made to you by the prosecutrix, did you go with her and where - A. I went to her house. I examined the back yard, I saw no place where I could find any thing of the robbery having been done, except from the window of the prisoners. I went to Gardener's house, I knocked at the door, he opened it, I told him my business, that the next door neighbour had been robbed, and suspicion fell upon him; the wife was in bed. I asked him if he had any objection to my searching the house; he said none at all; by the time the wife was up I proceeded to search; I found nothing in the house. Cohen came in as a neighbour; he asked me if I would trust the woman with him up stairs, I told him I would; they went up, and they afterwards called for the man; some time elapsed. I was called, I went up stairs, Cohen informed me that they had confessed that they had done the robbery, he asked me if I would trust the woman with him to fetch the property.</p>
               <p>Q. You entrusted the woman with him - A. I did. I kept the man in custody, I wanted to see if I could find where the property was. I followed the woman and Cohen at a distance a little way, the woman prisoner saw me, she told me if I followed them the property should not come forth; I wanted to dog them, to see where the property was. I found I could not get the property any other way. I let the woman prisoner and Cohen go; I was upon the watch, I saw the woman and Cohen come back, Cohen had a bundle on his back; I followed Cohen into his house; the female prisoner was present; I saw a silver watch, two silver spoons, and the things that were contained in the two bundles. I took them directly to Mrs. Straffing to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120016"/>see if she could speak to them.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

            . Q. Did you at any time in last month meet either of the prisoners any where - A. I did, on the 17th of March. I had dined in the neighbourhood of the Strand, I quitted my party about twelve at night, I went to see a gentleman home that had lodged with me to Northumberland street. I live at Kennington.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you - A. An <rs id="t18090412-22-viclabel133" type="occupation">Italian</rs>

            , I believe in the Strand, I asked her if she would tell me the shortest way to Kennington, or to Westminster bridge, to put me in the right road; I told her I was a married man, I could have nothing to do with her; there was no carriage in the road, or else I would have taken it. Instead of putting me right, she led me up Catherine street; I thought she was leading me right. I got shoved into a court, I afterwards found, I did not know it at the instant; I was shoved into a house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who shoved you into the house - A. I cannot tell; the woman had hold of my arm; I got into the parlour in a minute, I said where is this, I said get me some one that will shew me the way; there was a candle in the parlour, the candle was put out, and I either got a shove or a push; I got a blow upon the nose, I bled desparately.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in she room - A. I believe she was, it was all done in a moment; my coat was taken off, and this watch taken from my pocket; when I felt the blood it brought me to my recollection. I made to the door, I called the watch, the watch came immediately, and afterwards three or four Bow street officers came; a light was had; they searched, and nothing was found.</p>
               <p>Q. When a light was got was any person in the room - A. No, the prisoner was gone; there was nobody but the officers and me in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the man at that time - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure whether any body pushed you, or whether the woman pulled you in - A. I cannot tell, the woman had hold of my arm; I cannot say whether any body assisted in getting me in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in a situation to take notice of her, so as to say that she is the woman - A. No, I will not swear that she is the woman.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Martin in the Fields. I and two men of the name of Limbrick were out on duty at half past twelve o'clock at night; we went about the streets; about a quarter past one o'clock, as we were coming down Catherine street, I heard the cry of Watch; upon which the watchman came over from Exeter street; he went up the court, and we followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the cry of Watch from - A. From Bedford court; it leads into Little Catherine street, going into Drury lane; it is on the left hand. We followed the watchman up to No. 2 in this court, where the gentleman was standing at the door without his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the gentleman - A. Mr. Williams, the last witness. We then went in to see if the coat was about the place, or the persons in the parlour; we found nobody there. We searched the house all over, and when I came to the two pair of stairs I found the witness, who is here. I got information; I went down to a night house in Burleigh street, the Horseshoe and Magpie; when we got in I looked in the bar; I saw the woman prisoner in the bar.</p>

             - A. Yes. I opened the door of the bar and went in, and close to where she stood I saw a watch lying, I said to the landlord is this your watch; he said no; the prisoner dropped it; the prisoner was sitting close to him; I took the watch and kept it till I went before the magistrate, then by the order of the magistrate I gave it to the gentleman, and marked it first. This is the watch that I took up close to the woman, and the watch that I gave to Mr. Williams; I marked it with the letter D, and here the letter D is.</p>

               <p>Q. What evening do you speak of - you say that evening - A. Yes; I saw him there the same evening when this gentleman was robbed; I lodged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120017"/>in the house then; I do not now. There are two rooms on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Q. In which room did you see Chisholme - A. He was in no room, he was in the passage. It was between twelve and one before the officer came.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman there at the time - A. I heard a noise below, I did not see the woman there then, she might be in the apartment, I did not see her. I heard a gentleman call out Watch; that was after I saw Chisholme; I was up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you saw Chisholme was it that you heard the gentleman call out Watch - A. It might be half an hour. The woman lodges in the house in the parlour. Chisholme did not lodge in the house as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave Chisholme in the passage when you passed him - A. I left him there; I went up to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before - A. I saw him before, in the same week; I saw him in one of the rooms that the prisoner lodged in; I only saw him in the passage that night, and in the course of the week I had seen him in her room, and no other time.</p>
               <p>Chisholme was not put on his defence.</p>
               <p>Curtis's Defence. I never saw the gentleman before I saw him at Bow street. I went out the same afternoon, and coming home between one and two o'clock, I put my foot against the watch; other young women lodged in the same rooms, and were in the habit of receiving company there; there were different men and women drinking at the public house. When I went in I asked the publican to keep the watch till the next day; he said stop till I draw a pint of beer. These gentlemen then came in, and took the watch and me to the watchhouse; I did not know who the watch belonged to, nor did I know what to do with it, I meaned to give it to the publican to keep till the next day, to see if there was any owner to it.</p>

               <p>Q. How is this shop part of the dwelling house, do you enter at the shop door - A. Not exactly so; the shop is a separate tenement, but we have a communication by a passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it part of the house - A. It has been a separate tenement for many years; it is not under the same roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what communication is there - A. Through the wall of the house there is a door that opens from the shop to the house; my father has bought the house and the shop at the same time; I slept in the house at the time the offence was committed; the house was undergoing some alterations; the whole of the family intended to come there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the communication been made between the shop and this house - A. About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What night was it that this happened - A. The 22nd of March, between eight and nine o'clock; we had lit candles about an hour and a half, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the shop at the time - A. I was, and my father was there; I was standing inside of the shop; there were lamps outside of the shop window. I heard a window break; I immediately ran out of the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this the window of the shop, or was it a shew glass - A. The window of the shop. I perceived the prisoner drawing his hand from the broken pane, and in his hand was two silver gravy spoons; I saw them, they had been hanging in the window against the pane which was broken; I seized him by the breast, and with the assistance of a neighbour we took him into the shop: The neighbour who assisted me took the spoons out of his hand. I went for a constable; the spoons were delivered to the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. When you heard the pane of glass break from the noise, was it like a person cutting a pane, or a person dashing his hand against it - A. Not like cutting it.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you have heard about the man, whether he has been deranged - A. I have heard so; but from what fell from his own mouth I should not suppose so.</p>
               <p>MR. HAMMOND. Q. Do you live near Mr. Chandler - A. I do, next door; I was standing in my shop on the evening mentioned; I heard a noise of glass breaking; I immediately ran out and perceived the prisoner standing by the side of Mr. Chandler's window, with the spoons in his hand; I took the spoons from his hand and dragged him into the shop; I kept the spoons and him till a constable came, and then I gave them to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had your candles been lighted - A. About an hour and a half. When I went out it was very dark.</p>
               <p>- CRESWELL. I took the prisoner in custody, I took him to the watchhouse. The next morning, as I was taking him to Marlborough street - the prisoner was handcuffed to another - crossing Wardour street, he knocked me down and stunned me for a moment; he could not get away on account of the other man he was handcuffed to.</p>

            , ESQ. - Mr. Curwood. I believe, sir, you are deputy surgeon general of the land forces - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he was assistant surgeon to the 35th regiment; he left that regiment in August last; from the official report he left that regiment on account of his being deranged in mind, and being incapable of attending the sick in that regiment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where was that regiment - A. In Sicily. I had no acquaintance with him till he returned. I conceived he was labouring under that malady when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120018"/>arrived from Sicily in August last. I saw Mr. Morgan within this last three weeks or a month; I observed he looked extremely aukward, and remarked it to himself. He lately has been appointed to the York rangers; I objected when he applied to be on full pay.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago - A. About two months; Mr. Morgan has frequently called at the office; I did not consider him to be perfectly sound of mind; I understood that he went into the country afterwards; about three weeks ago is the last time I saw Mr. Morgan; he appeared extremely heated and hurried. I mentioned to the surgeon general my regret that he had been recommended upon full pay.</p>
               <p>Q. Then somebody thought he was a fit person - A. There was a letter came from a relation and a medical man there, that he had been quiet during his stay there, six weeks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Did he appear to be a man that was not answerable for his actions - A. In such a state as that I was only sorry that he was placed in such a situation to have the charge of sick men; I did not think him fit for any thing in that line.</p>
               <p>COURT to Chandler. At the time that the prisoner was apprehended did you, from your own observations, see any thing that imported the least insanity - A. Not the least in the world. When he was brought into the shop my father asked him where he supposed he would go for this offence; he made answer, take me where you will, I have no place to put my head into. I perceived no symptoms in the least of mental derangement.</p>

               <p>Q. to Hammond. Did any thing occur to your observation with respect to the prisoner's mind - A. I should not imagine him to be insane; his conversation and language was quite different; there was nothing that led me to suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. to Creswell. When you came and took him in custody how was his behaviour - A. He appeared sullen all the way; he knocked me down the next morning; he wanted to run away; he wanted the other prisoner to run away; the other prisoner told me so afterward.</p>

               <p>MR. NEWMAN. Q. This man is in your custody - how has his behaviour been - A. His behaviour has been very extraordinary indeed; he has been in my custody from the 27th of March; he appeared sometimes quite stupid, and very indecent in his behaviour, so much so that he has been a disgust to all the prisoners; I have been obliged to lock him up by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. From the best of your belief do you think it proceeded from perverseness of temper, or from derangement of mind - A. I should rather think from derangement of mind.</p>
               <p>MARY EARLE. Q. You are chamber maid to the Bell Savage - A. Yes. I remember the prisoner coming there in August, he staid there ten nights, he very seldom went out of the bed room the whole of the time, and never dressed. What I saw of his conduct I believe him to be insane.</p>

On the 1st of April, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was coming down Robin Hood court, I saw the prisoner come out of Wellington's house with a bag in his hand; instantaneously a woman ran out of the house and called stop thief; I run after the man, in company with two more, for about twenty yards, and there we took the man; he threw the bag away the moment he was laid hold of; I laid hold of the bag and my friend secured the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a confectioner. On the 3rd of April, about ten o'clock, as I was observing the company going to the Mansion house, I felt a great crowd behind; on turning round I observed the prisoner snatch a watch from a gentleman; upon which I attempted to seize him, I could not; I observed there was only one way of his making his way off; on that way I observed him, keeping my eye upon him frequently; I was again going to take him in the crowd, at that moment he came off the pavement; I then attempted to seize him, but could not; he then run, I followed at the distance of half a yard. I suppose he ran between the carriages he had the start of me on the pavement: as I came on the pavement he passed me with the cry of stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you called stop thief before - A. I never called out at all; I instantly seized him, I never left my hold till he was put in the Poultry compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the watch - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Your curiosity was excited, like a great many more honest men, to see the company go into the Mansion house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the person of the gentleman at the time - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did you know when you saw him at the Mansion house that he was the person against whom the attempt was made - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. All you know you saw an attempt made by somebody on a gentleman - A. By the prisoner, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You supposed that the prisoner was the person that made the snatch - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was standing near the prosecutor - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The same impression might be in his mind; he might fancy he saw somebody snatch the watch from the prosecutor, and he might be calling out stop thief to have them taken - when he was searched you found upon him his own watch, and eight or ten pounds in money - A. When he was searched in the Poultry compter the watch was not found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect observing at the Poultry compter, that you was quite sure that he must have the watch about him, and you directed a strict search to be made - A. No, I was sure that he was not in possession of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The next day you attended at the Mansion house and saw the prosecutor - A. No, on the second examination I saw the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. And then, and not till then, you were not able to ascertain that the watch was lost by the prosecutor - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say before the watch was produced that it was a handsome watch - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not able afterwards to know whether the watch that was produced was the watch that was taken at the time, supposing the prisoner stole it - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. The moment you saw the watch snatched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120020"/>from the gentleman's pocket, you never lost sight of him - A. No. When we secured him there was a mob about him; he was taken down Walbrook; some said duck him, and some pump upon him; two gentlemen came up, and said take him to the Poultry compter.</p>

            . Q. You are a marshalman - A. I am. On Easter Monday I was on duty at the Mansion house. About ten o'clock a gentleman came up to me, saying he had found a watch, he believed it to be a gold watch, he would wish to leave it in such hands as the right owner might have it. I asked the gentleman his name, and I gave the gentleman my name; the gentleman's name is Sharp.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Are you certain it is the same watch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was out of your custody - how long - A. Almost four days; then it was locked up in Mr. Hoblers's box at the Mansion house; it was delivered to me at the Mansion house; I have had it ever since.</p>

            . I am at the Commercial docks. I was crossing Charlotte row, from that side next to the Mansion house, near ten o'clock on the day mentioned; just before I got to the pavement, I heard something fall down, and break like glass; there were several people passing at the time, they did not look at it; I put my hand down, I found it was a watch case. I looked a little further, I saw the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Charlotte row was this - A. Between the side door of the Mansion house and the one in front.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the crowd appear to be about - A. They appeared to me to be passing and repassing. I delivered the watch to Mr. Porter at the Mansion house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Then the impression on your mind was, that there was no robbery then - A. I did not see any thing at all; it certainly fell on the pavement; how it came there I could not tell, I heard it drop, and was rather surprised that they that passed took no notice of it; it appeared to drop from some of the people that were passing at the time; no person stopped to pick it up, which rather surprised me.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been down to Greenwich to get my prize wages; I found the office locked up; I came back by the stage. Coming by the Mansion house I came across the street, he came and laid hold of me by the shoulders, he said stay; I said I shall not stop. I was lugged by my legs and arms, and when they got me to the Poultry compter, then the constable came and searched me, and found nothing; then they would not let me go, this young fellow would not let me go, he said he was sure I had the watch, it was a pretty watch.</p>
               <p>JURY to Phene. When you saw the prisoner make an attempt at the watch, did you see the watch whether it was a white one, or what - A. I saw it all in his hand together, and part hanging out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take any notice of the gentleman that lost the watch - A. No.</p>

            . I am a custom house officer. On the 10th of March I was at the East India warehouse, Crutched Friars; about ten minutes after two I observed the prisoner, he was coming out of the iron gates that separate the premises from the outer yard; he came to me to be rubbed down as usual; on searching of him I found some loose tea in each of his coat pockets; he was in a very great hurry, he made a start to run up the steps with the delivery book; I immediately followed him up the steps and told him I had not done with him; he then begged I would let him go, he hoped I would forgive him; I told him it was more than my situation was worth. I took him into Mr. Saunders's office, and took out six ounces of tea from both his coat pockets; I asked him to unbutton his waistcoat, which he declined; I did it myself; I then found one bag of tea on his right side, under his arm; I searched on the other side, I found another in a similar direction on the left side, and another smaller one just at the pit of his stomach. I was then ordered by Mr. Saunders to see him to the compter; he said he was sorry for what he had done, and begged Mr. Saunders to forgive him. I have got the tea here; it has been weighed, the weight is three pounds. I looked in that warehouse on Saturday or Monday, I cannot say which day, I saw a chest in the upper floor that apparently had been plundered, which corresponded with this part that was in his pockets.</p>

               <p>Mr. Glass. That paper of tea is of the same colour and quality, one part of it, as is in the warehouse; the other part is blacker than any tea I saw in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a guard to a coach, to Mr. Bolton. On Sunday morning, the 12th of April, about ten minutes before three o'clock, I was awoke by something falling in the shop; I sleep in a room adjoining; about three o'clock I heard the watchman call the hour; about a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw a light go through the passage, as though somebody was going into our shop; I got up in my bed, I heard the drawer open and shut and halfpence rattle; I went into the passage to see if the foredoor was shut, it was shut; I looked towards the back door, it was open. I went and knocked at my mother's room door, up stairs, to get a light; I heard somebody try the fore-door. I came down, and who should I meet but the prisoner in the passage. I knocked her down. I felt something wet in her right hand; I halloaed out who is here, which alarmed my mother, a light was had, and this wet proved to be two pieces of pickled pork, it was left on the ground and the key of my mother's shop. The prisoner ran into her own room; I went to the watchhouse and got the constable, he took her in custody. The pickle pork weighed five pounds three quarters.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

            ; the prisoner has been in our employ about eight months. On the 22nd of March, from information of one of my men, I went to the warehouse; the instant I got there the prisoner came towards the door as though he was going out; he went back into the warehouse upon seeing of me; he came forwards, I asked him if he had found any of the loose things that had been lost; he said he had found the chain only; he then walked back again into the warehouse; he came forward again. I told him that I was very much afraid that there was a thief about the warehouse, we had lost a many trifling things, I could not tell what become of them; he said he felt himself equally surprized as I did to know what had become of them. I stood against the door post looking at him; he went to the back of the warehouse and came back again; I then asked him if he was waiting for any thing; he said no, and immediately walked out, passed me and went down the step; he got a little distance; seeing him look a little bulky I called to him and asked him if he had got any thing in his pockets; he made an evasive kind of answer as though he did not know what I meaned; I called to him again, he did not stop. I called to him again rather sharp, he then turned round and stopped; I told him I hoped my fears were not true, had he or had he not any thing in his pockets that he should not have; he answered I do not know what you mean, sir, by asking me such questions; I put my hand to his coat pocket and asked him what he had got there so bulky; he said only an old clout or two; I took his hat off his head, his hat was as full of rags as it well could be; I then desired him to walk into the accompting house; he said he was very sorry. I sent for a constable; he came and searched him in my presence, and found five pounds of rags in his hat, pockets, round his waist and in his breeches.</p>
               <p>- WOODMAN. I am a constable; I searched the prisoner; in the crown of his hat I found these rags, out of his pockets I took a great many rags, and about his loins and in the back part of his breeches. I then took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had such rags about my wharf.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had too much liquor; I do not find fault with any thing that Mr. Aylwin has said; if I had told Mr. Aylwin how I had come by them I should not have come in so much trouble; Mr. Aylwin has given us the liberty to take the sweepings of the salted goods to sell, and I thought if there were any of any other sort I might take that too; we had delivered some bags and I swept it up. The reason I concealed it was because the other men did not know of it; it was not worth while sharing of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in your shop when somebody came into it - A. I was in the parlour, my parlour has a glass door to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this - A. On the 1st of March, a few minutes after nine in the evening; I am sure of it, the watch was set.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any candles alight in your shop - A. Yes, for two hours or more; it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Your parlour is behind your shop, and separated from your shop by a glass door, is it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And none of your people were in your shop - were they - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the shop any time before - A. Yes, about three or four or five minutes, I cannot exactly say; no longer. I was in the shop, I let a customer out and fastened the door after them; I am sure that I shut the door myself and fastened it with the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop door one door, not a hatch at the bottom - A. No, it is all one door, a glass door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were in this parlour did you hear any thing - A. When I was in the parlour I heard somebody spring the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the latch of the shop door - A. I heard the latch of the shop door; I turned my head, I did not rise out of the chair; I looked through the glass door, I did not see any one come in, I saw the door go, I could see over the bottom of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether the shop door was open - A. It was perfectly open when I turned my head; I did not get off my chair till a gentleman came past; he sung out to me there is a thief in your shop; he was at the door; I believe he stepped in the shop; I got up and went into the shop when I heard the gentleman speak; the gentleman catched this man upon his hands and knees.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then tell me what yoo saw - A. I saw the gentleman had got the man by the collar; I saw a gentleman in my shop, he had hold of the prisoner Bolton.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had the gentleman come in the shop - had he got within the door of your shop, or was it at the door that he had got hold of him - A. He was about a yard within the door way; the gentleman had hold of Bolton by the collar, Bolton had been down upon his hands and knees; he gave the alarm to me, I catched hold of Bolton by the collar, half outside of the door; the gentleman said there was another; I did not see another in the shop, or looking in at the window. Immediately after that I left Bolton in the shop with my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shut the door, or any thing - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he staid quietly in the soop, did he - A. No, he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go to when you left him in the shop with your wife - A. I went to the gentleman that Tiffen insulted outside of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How far off did you catch hold of Tiffen - A. He run about a hundred yards, I saw him running; the gentleman said he was the man; he and another tried to strike the gentleman three or four times. I got him by the collar myself, and resigned him to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then come back to your shop - A. No. I did not; he got away from the watchman, he stripped himself of his clothes, I saw him pull of his clothes; he crossed Goswell street and went up Gee street. I followed him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him taken - A. Yes; Lewis, a black man, took him; I am sure he was the same man; he was brought back and taken to the watchhouse, from there, after he was put in the watchhouse, he was taken to Clerkenwell prison; I accompanied him there; he struggled, we were obliged to tie his hands. While I was at the watchhouse Bolton got away.</p>
               <p>Q. That you know nothing about - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find Bolton in your shop - A. No; Bolton came up to the watchhouse door while I was there present - I said this is the man that I had by the collar in the shop; then he went towards Whitecross street, he on the right hand pavement and I down on the horseway; I got before him and caught him by the collar, and brought him back to the watchhouse. I am sure he is the same man. I told him he was my prisoner, that he was the man which the gentleman caught on his hands and knees in my shop. Then I brought him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. In your shop you have cheese, butter, and bacon - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You go through the shop into the house to go up stairs - A. Yes. I have been robbed twice before.</p>
               <p>Tiffen. The gentleman says I was apprehended by a black man. Lewis can testily that he never apprehended me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Lewis is not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you sure he is the same man that was apprehended - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the person that came into the shop - A. Mr. Dennet.</p>
               <p>Tiffen. I would wish to ask the prosecutor if he ever saw me at his shop - A. I never saw him to my knowledge before.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120023"/>Tiffen. Nor you never saw me in company with this man - A. I never saw either of the prisoners before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>JOHN DENNET. Q. Do you know the shop of Mr. Salmon in Goswell street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect going by one evening, and seeing somebody in the shop - A. Yes; on the 1st of March, a little after nine in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What, were you walking along the street - 
               <persName id="t18090412-31-person333">A. </persName>
            Yes. On the 1st of March, a little after nine in the evening, just as I came to Mr. Salmon's shop, I saw something going up the three steps of the shop, it looked something black, like a great dog; I stopped to look, I thought it was a very large dog, I stood a moment, I perceived it was a man upon his hands and knees going into the shop; the shop door at that time was open, and it struck me that it was a man going to rob the shop. I stepped back just round the door post, there was a passage close to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You stepped back to watch - A. Yes, to watch. I cast my eye along the front of the window, I saw another man looking into the shop window; the other man then came from she shop window - Tiffen did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Tiffen the other man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know him before, did you - A. Yes, I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know his name to be Tiffen, did you - A. No; I never heard his name before; I was in the dark, I could see him plainly by the light of the window, I knew him by sight. The moment he came from the shop window by the door, he either said George or Thomas, I believe, I cannot say which. The prisoner Bolton, I believe, did not hear him; he passed the door a few yards, he returned again; when he came by the door, he said d - n you George or Thomas, or whatever name it was - you are done.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he said that, where was the other person that you had seen - A. About two yards in the shop, going forward in the shop upon his hands and knees; I believe Bolton then heard him speak, and then Bolton was withdrawing out of the shop; I stepped into the shop, and caught hold of him by the back part of his coat; I asked him if he was going to rob the man's shop - he said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any one else in the shop - A. No. I asked him what business he had there; in the mean time Mr. Salmon came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call him out - A. No further than my speaking loud; Mr. Salmon came out of the parlour, at least the back room; I then delivered him into Mr. Salmon's care; he was then off his hands and knees; when Mr. Salmon came to me, and I delivered him up to Mr. Salmon, I said to Mr. Salmon take him into custody, there is another concerned in it, I shall see him in a minute; in the mean time there came round ten or fifteen people. I turned round and saw Tiffen, I said you are the rascal that was concerned with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man you saw in the crowd was the same man that you had seen outside of the window, and who had spoke to him - A. I was sure he was the same person. As soon as I told him he was the rascal that was concerned with him he drawed himself in an attitude to strike me; I had a stick in my hand, and a bundle under my other arm; I struck him across the arm.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he did make a blow at you - A. Yes; with his fist; he then attempted the second time to strike me; I struck him with my stick; he would have struck me if he could, but he could not get at me; he ran across the street directly, I pursued him across the street; I struck him once or twice going across; he ran down Sutton street, just at the corner of Sutton street I struck him across the shoulder, he reeled and fell down. One of the watchmen came up to me and was going to collar me; I said go and take hold of the thief; then he was taken hold of by the watchman in my presence; the first watchman that came up could not hold him; the second watchman came up; he stripped himself out of his coat and he did make an attempt to run, after he was stripped out of his coat; he was stopped by a third watchman. I left him in the care of the watchmen; I never saw him any more till I saw him at Worship street. I went home after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Tiffen was the man that you have been speaking about - A. I am sure that Tiffen is the man that spoke to him, and the man that was at the window; he went as far as Gee street after he spoke to him, and there he stopped by the post; I saw Bolton go into the shop; I took him in the shop.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SPICER. I am an officer of the parish. I was sent for; I found both the prisoners in the watchhouse; I took them to prison.</p>
               <p>Bolton's Defence. I was going to Mr. Wood's in Aldersgate street with some work for my father; my shoe came untied coming home, I put my foot upon the step to tie my shoe; the witness said here is a thief in the shop; I had no occasion for stealing of any thing. I declare to Almighty God I know nothing of the young man.</p>
               <p>Tiffen's Defence. I was walking on the other side of Goswell street; I was very much in liquor; I saw a mob on the other side of the way, consequently I pushed myself into the mob; this gentleman was accusing one and another; he said, you were with him; I argued with him on the subject; he 
               <persName id="t18090412-31-person334">drew</persName>
             a large stick and hit me on the arm; I ran away and he pursued me and struck me. I never had any discourse with the other young man before this transaction.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a housekeeper - A. Yes. On the 6th of this month, about half past seven in the evening, I heard a window break, that was the first thing that attracted my attention; it was rather a private window that gave light to a desk; it looked into Drury lane; the other window was shut up, this was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a light was there at that time - A. There was no light but what was in the shop; there was no day light nor no moon as I know of; it was half past seven o'clock. I heard the glass fall; in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120024"/>about half a minute or a minute I went to the place from whence the sound proceeded, of the broken glass. I saw a man's hand had got hold of my handkerchiefs, that was fastened to a line; he was pulling them out of the window, through the glass that was broken. They were silk handkerchiefs, he was drawing them out of the broken pane of glass.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the pane of the small window that you spoke of - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe how these handkerchiefs were hanging before you heard the glass fall - A. They were hanging on a line of red tape, nailed on each side of the window for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they within the shop - A. Yes; within the shop; they were fastened with three large pins.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part of them drawn out of the house - A. Yes, as much as half a yard at least; he could not get them off; he gave them a sharp pull at the time I got to the window; I saw the handle did not get them off; he tore the corner of the handkerchief. When he saw I saw his face at the window, by the glimmer of light that was in my shop, and likewise his hand, he ran off.</p>
               <p>Q. What light had you in your shop - A. There were several candles in the shop, there were two lamps in the Broad street side, but in this window there was nothing but a candle alight standing on the desk.</p>

            There was light enough to distinguish him so as to know him - A. Yes; I saw his face and I knew it was the same man; when I saw him afterwards I suppose the prisoner saw me; I laid hold of the handkerchief, he ran off or walked off; he was gone very quick; I sent my boy after him, I did not pursue him myself; my boy assisted in taking of him;

               <p>Q. Where was he standing when you heard the glass break - A. He was standing close by the window; I saw him with his hand put on the glass at the bottom of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his hand touching the glass of the window - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the glass breaking what did he do - A. He walked off about two yards to the corner of Drury lane and looked up Broad street; he found nobody come out; just at that moment he turned back again to the window that was broke, he put his hand in through the broken pane, and gave the handkerchiefs a pull.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any handkerchiefs at that time - A. Yes, they were hanging outside of the window, about half a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the handkerchiefs hanging - A. Inside.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of this pull - A He drawed them out about half a yard; he then walked five yards away, he left the handkerchiefs there, about half a yard hanging out; he walked off five yards from the window; I crossed over the way, with intent to take him; he turned his head round a little, and seeing me behind him - I was about half a yard behind him - he ran away; I pursued him to the Coal yard, there I took him.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the water closet situated with respect to the kitchen - A. About three or four yards from the kitchen; the kitchen is under ground and the water closet is level with it; it is for Mrs. Mitchell's family, but not for Mrs. Standey's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was she absent before she returned to the kitchen - A. I believe about twenty minutes; when she returned into the kitchen, she went to the dresser; there was a great discharge of blood run from her; we made no observations to her, nor did she say any thing on the subject; she sat down by the fire; a little while afterwards she got up, she went away to go to bed in the upper room; between seven and eight o'clock in the evening I went up stairs into her room; she was in bed.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is the room where you and her sister and herself had slept the night before - A. Yes; I did not say any thing to her then; she slept there that night; when her sister and I went to bed, her sister asked her how she did; she said better. I got into bed and her sister; I did not hear any thing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What time did you get up in the morning - A. Her sister and I got up about seven o'clock on the Monday morning; she got up shortly after, she took breakfast with the sister and me.</p>

               <p>Q. Now recollect yourself and tell me whether or not any thing else passed between you and the prisoner after the prisoner returned, when she got up to leave the kitchen to go up to bed - A. I laughed, and she said if I was in such pain as her I should not laugh.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you next go into it - A. Monday morning, about eleven o'clock; I then found the pan half full of water; I threw more water in, because I thought it would wash it away. In about a week after, when the plumber had been to rectify the place, when I washed the floor, there was a place covered with mud, I took a knife and scraped the mud off; I observed a very large place of blood; then I told my mistress.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing the child, of which we have been speaking today - A. On the 23d of March I saw it at the public house in Wilmot street.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe, from the appearance of the child, whether it appeared to have come at its full time - A. Yes, I am certain of it, from the nails and all other appearances; I examined it minutely. I observed under the left arm pit a great laceration, which appeared to have been done with some blunt instrument; the upper part of the body had changed considerably from putrefaction. I cannot take upon me to say that the child was born alive. I called in two medical friends of the neighbourhood; I went with these gentlemen and examined the child again; I can only say the child went its full time. The laceration, if the child was ever alive, was after life terminated; the placenta was connected with the child, no ligature had been made upon the navel string, the umbilical cord was not tied or disengaged at all; the placenta of the child and the umbilical cord had not been separated.</p>
               <p>COURT. What conclusion do you draw from that fact - A. Supposing the child to have been born alive, no ligature having been made on the umbilical cord, had the child been born alive, must have soon expired from the loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You found the body of the child and the placenta connected by the navel string - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that just what you would expect to find if a woman had been delivered sitting on a water closet, and all would have fell down the water closet together - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the laceration under the left arm certainly had been caused by violence, it had the appearance to you the same that a poker would have made by working it down the water closet - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>MR. COOPER. Q. You are a surgeon - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the child at the public house - A. I did, in company with Mr. Faythorn. The child was in a putrid state at the time I saw it; the child came at its full time by all appearance. I cannot take upon me to say whether it was born alive or no; the after birth was attached to the child, it had no marks of violence, excepting the laceration of the arm pit, which I take to proceed from the poker that was used; we made no experiments upon the lungs, that is quite exploded; I examined round the neck, I saw no particular appearance round the neck.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the deceased, John Brown - A. Yes; he was a <rs id="t18090412-34-viclabel201" type="occupation">gardener's labourer</rs>

               <p>Q. Upon the beginning of this month were you disturbed while you were in bed by any noise - A. Yes; on Sunday the 2nd of April, between ten and eleven o'clock; I was in bed, but not laying down; upon hearing the noise I got out of bed and looked out of my window, I saw as many as six men; my window is as near as possible to the road; two of the men seemed to be in the act of stripping to fight; one, I believe, was stripped. It was a very moon light night<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120027"/>indeed.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there light enough to distinguish who the persons were - A. I did not know who they were. When I looked through the window the prisoner seemed to be in the act of taking part of one of the men who were going to fight; I knew the prisoner before, I have seen him about the town; when they were about to fight the prisoner made an observation that the man of the name of Baldwyn had got the upper part of the hill; in consequence of which Baldwyn came down the hill, opposite of his antagonist, a man of the name of Eversly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Eversly a man known to you by his person - A. Not till after they had been fighting. When Baldwyn came down they set to fight, Baldwyn knocked Eversly down, Brown, the deceased, was very near to Baldwyn at the time; the prisoner assisted Eversly to get up and set him to with Baldwyn; I will not be certain whether it was the second or third time they set them to; Scales made some observations, but what I could not hear. Eversley was down I believe every time he set to, he was very much in liquor; they were both down at times; Scales made some observation to Brown, in consequence of which Brown said I am no second, I wish to see fair play; Scales stood in the attitude of defending himself against Brown; the two men that were fighting set to again; while these men were fighting Scales struck Brown and knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. What had 
               <persName id="t18090412-34-person358">Brown</persName>
             the deceased done to the prisoner to induce the prisoner to strike him - A. I did not see Brown do any thing. The two men that were fighting continued fighting; Brown got up and followed Scales two or three yards and hit at him, whether he struck him I cannot say; I did not hear Brown say a word, only that he was not a second; that was before he was knocked down. Scales followed the men that were fighting; Brown stood opposite of my door, he did not go near them any more; the two men that were fighting had two or three more rounds after that; I considered them all in liquor; Scales was in liquor, he kept with the party that were fighting; they might be five or six yards down the road; Scales came from them and came up to Brown, leaving them fighting; he struck him somewhere about the upper part of the body, but where I cannot undertake to say.</p>
               <p>Q. What had Brown done - A. Nothing more than what I have said.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Scales returning back to 
               <persName id="t18090412-34-person359">Brown</persName>
             the second time had Brown done or said any thing to induce him to strike him that time - A. I never heard him move or say any thing. In consequence of this blow by Scales Brown fell down in the channel opposite of my window; he laid there some minutes; Scales returned to the men that were fighting; he never offered to return to Brown again, nor to take any further notice of him. The men continued fighting, they were not aware of the mischief that was done; nor do I think Scales was. Brown lay in the channel some time.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get out - A. He was moved by one of the witnesses present; I did not see Brown get up again; I thought he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Scales struck 
               <persName id="t18090412-34-person360">Brown</persName>
             the first time had Brown done any thing to him - A. Not any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Brown pushed me before I touched him</p>
               <p>Witness. I cannot undertake to say that he did no do it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Can you take upon you to say that the second time he struck him whether he did any thing to him - A. No further than following him to strike him.</p>

               <p>Q. You said after two or three rounds he came back - what I want to know is this - whether Brown had struck at Scales when he came back so as to provoke him - A. No; he never lifted his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was opposite of your door - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had lifted his hand should you not have seen it - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the deceased Brown - A. About twenty five minutes; I helped to carry him into the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the place where he was standing near the channel - A. Yes, about twelve inches from the channel; there was a strong oak plank against the foot path, he was standing on the road; he fell from the road into the channel, and possibly might fall against this oak plank. At the time I helped to carry him into the public house he was quite dead; I suppose so; Dr. Andrews was sent for immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you whether or no the deceased was in liquor - A. I should suppose he was; he had a very deep scar in his chin; three of his front teeth were knocked in, and I saw some blood coming from his ear, which we concluded came from his mouth or his nose; he fell with his face in the channel.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not examine to see whether the blood came from the ear - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there afterwards - A. Yes; he came from the Windmill on the common; upon his coming down the hill he came to them that were fighting; Brown was standing by at the time; he gave Scales a push by the elbow, because Scales was coming to take the part of Eversly; Scales asked Brown if he was Baldwyn's second; Brown said he was no second, but he liked to see fair play; with that Scales struck Brown and knocked him down into the channel; I did not hear Brown speak after.</p>

I attempted to bleed him and recover him, but without effect, he was perfectly dead. I found a deep wound on the chin to the bone, from whence a quantity of blood might have flowed; several of his foreteeth were knocked in and loosened; the head was opened. On examining the head, a blood vessel had given way about the pericranium, and a large quantity of blood was found in the cavity of the skull, which I have no doubt was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ruptured blood vessel that you have described the consequence of his falling - A. Yes, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have described that his chin was cut to the bone, and some of his teeth were knocked in, and consequently it must be done with great violence - A. Yes, he was a very heavy and powerful man also.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you that your opinion is, the rupture of this vessel was occasioned by the fall - A. Certainly, and that rupture was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to the Windmill, Bushy common, drinking part of the afternoon, me and a young man came from the Windmill a little after ten o'clock; coming from the place, I saw Eversly fighting with another man, I said what are you fighting about; he said he had been used ill by this other man, he had nobody to assist him; I said I will assist you; he was knocked down by the two men that he was fighting with; I was picking him up; the deceased pushed me away; I turned round and pushed him in return; whether I pushed him or hit him, I am not confident which; he fell.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. You saw them did you - A. I did not see them; I heard them talking at the door, in the mean time my young man came from the kitchen with two lamps; a man came in and asked for an ounce of coffee, and while the young man was weighing the coffee I heard a chest rattle; I was in the middle of the shop, a board had given way, I was putting a board there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the chest - A. There were four chests placed by the door, one on the top of the other; this chest was on the top of the pile; they stood on the floor; when I heard the chests rattle I did not know whether it was at the stairs or the door; there were chests also placed at the stairs; I called out to the servant to know whether she had gone up stairs; I turned round and missed the chest standing within the shop, by the door; I run out of the door and crossed the street and went into Francis-street; when I had got two or three doors up I heard something which I thought to be a chest pitching; I had gone beyond him; I turned round and saw the prisoner standing with the chest before him in Francis-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he holding the chest - A. I am not certain; the chest was on the ground. I laid hold of the prisoner by the collar, I said you rascal you have got my chest; I throwed him against the wall and kept him till Mr. Goding chanced to come by the corner, I called him to assist me; we took the prisoner back to the shop; a man coming by, we desired him to bring the chest of tea back. I am sure it was my chest of tea; it contained about twelve or thirteen pounds of tea; the cost price was about six shillings and eight pence a pound. The prisoner was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did the chest stand from the door - A. Close to the door; inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your young man here - A. No.</p>

            . I live in Titchbourne-street, Golden-square. I was crossing Marylebone-street at Francis-street, Mr. Crofts was calling out for assistance, he had got the prisoner; I saw the chest there; I took the prisoner back to Mr. Crofts' house; I asked the prisoner how he could do such a thing; he said he had found it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When did you weigh the tea - A. On the Saturday before I went to Marlborough-street the second time. I kept the chest of tea in the shop ever since; the chest is the same now as when taken from the prisoner; there is the same quantity of tea in the chest now as when I took it from the man.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120029"/>Q. When you took it from the man you did not weigh it - A. No; I weighed it on the 10th of March, it weighed about thirty nine pounds, chest and all; I took twenty five-pounds off for the fare.</p>
               <p>Q. But you took no pains to secure the chest, so that no more could be put in it - A. I put it up just as it was, the top was broke as it is now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. The offence was committed on Monday, and you did not weigh the tea till Saturday - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What any body else might do you do not know - A. I never suffer any body to meddle with the chests. I had not taken any notice of the chest for some time; I am sure there was tea in it when it was taken away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know no more of it than a child unborn, I was coming by when I saw a man chuck this chest off his shoulder; I thought he had chucked it away. I am a person that drives a chaise at Turnham green; I keep rabbits, I thought it would make a good rabbit hutch; I did not know where his shop was till he took me back. Had the chest been full I should not have been able to carry it.</p>

On the 13th of March, about four in the afternoon, I was serving two young women at the further end of the shop; I saw my young man waiting upon the prisoner; between us there was a pile of Irish linens on the counter; I looked over the counter; looking towards the door, I saw the prisoner, who had a little girl with her, move her great coat, I saw her strike her hand against the coat, I had no reason to suspect that she had taken any thing till I saw her going out of the door, then I perceived she had something bulky under her coat; I immediately ran after her; she had passed the next shop. I laid hold of her arm, told her she had got something that did not belong to her; she said she had not; I brought into the middle of the shop a piece of printed cotton, dropped from under her coat on the floor. Shephard came by the door, and took her in custody.</p>

            . On the 13th of March the prisoner came to Mr. Gray's shop; I shewed her several different patterns, but none of them she seemed inclined to purchase; I shewed her a pattern, which she took two yards of, she flung down a guinea; I went to the upper end of the shop to get change; there was a pile of Irish stood between me and her; at that time I suppose the woman must have took the print; she took the two yards of print at three shillings; I gave her eighteen shillings change; she went out of the shop. Mr. Gray went out of the shop and fetched the woman back, and after she got in the middle of the shop, I saw a print drop from under her clothes.</p>

I went up stairs, I found him concealed in the garret; Mr. Kelly gave charge of him.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Roberts. On the 25th of March I was standing in the shop, a short distance from the door, folding a piece of print; I thought I heard the door open, I looked towards the door, I perceived a piece of print move from its proper place towards the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How far inside of the shop was it - A. Very near the door; it hung up with several more. I instantly ran towards the door, I drawed one part of the print that remained within the door; I then perceived the prisoner drop the print. I ran and caught hold of him, and by the assistance of another witness brought him into the shop, and when we got him in the shop he got his back against the counter, and by pushing him against the counter we perceived a bag behind his back, tied under his coat; we took him into the accounting house; we found in this bag two pieces of gingham and shawls.</p>
               <p>Q. When you laid hold of this piece of print, was it entirely removed from its place - 
               <persName id="t18090412-40-person415">A. </persName>
            Entirely, about a yard from its proper place; as he was dragging it through the door I ran and trod upon it; he let the other end drop; I picked it up. When I first got hold of him he told me he was not the man, he said that he saw the man trying to take the print, and he run away, pointing down the street; there was no other man there at the time; there was a short woman. I did not see her till I had got hold of him.</p>

            . Q. You are the other young man that was with Mr. Williams - A. Yes. On the 25th of March I was standing in Mr. Roberts's shop, I observed the print was moved close to the door; I immediately ran and observed the witness laying hold of a man, upon which I laid hold of the prisoner; the print was between the shop door then, half in and half out; the prisoner said there was a man looking at it, and had ran across the way; I collared him and forced him in the shop; I asked him what he meaned by pretending to steal the print; he said he never touched it, it was a man that had run across the way; he was standing with his back to the counter. I supposed he was going to take something up to strike me, I shoved him down, and by his falling there was a bag rose up behind him; I took him into the accompting house; I asked him what was in that bag; I took out two pieces of gingham and a shawl; he first said he bought them from a shop in the Borough; afterwards he confessed that he took them from a shop in the Borough, and he confessed that he took the print from our shop; after that I told him I would sooner prosecute him for a lie than the truth.</p>

I did not touch the print; the reason that I owned to it, they told me if I would own to it they would forgive me; I told them I saw a man take it and run across the way, and after that I told them I took it, to gain my liberty; at the same time I knew I had not touched it, I thought I might as well say that as not, to gain my liberty.</p>

            's waggon. On Tuesday the 14th of March I had occasion to go to the stables at Tottenham about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of the mill as I returned from the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any occasion as carman to go into the mill - A. He had not; he was ordered the week before not to go into the mill.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him - A. He had a bag in his hand; I said what have you got there; I supposed it was flour; I said where did you get this, who gave you this; he said nobody; I took the bag from him, and took him and the bag into the house; I looked in the bag, I found it to be fine flour; I told him the short time that he had been in the mill I thought somebody might have given it him out of the mill; he said nobody; he persisted in it that he took it himself; he said he had taken it, having only received six pence for unloading a score sacks of flour; and it was a very hard thing they were not better paid for their work. We pay him eighteen shillings a week, and the bakers give him six pence for unloading the flour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was this part of the flour he had delivered - A. No; it was of a different quality to that he had delivered; that was the third and this was the finest. I sealed the bag and brought it here; I have every reason to believe this is Mr. Pratt's flour we never have any body else's flour there; the value of the flour is five shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on Sunday night the 5th of March any cart and mare coming to your gate - A. Yes, I had but one; it came about one o'clock or a little after.</p>
               <p>COURT. That was Monday morning rather - A. Yes. It was a very moon shiney, star light morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How many persons were in that cart - A. I saw but one, and that was the person which drove it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any toll of him - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that he was the man that you conversed with, and that paid you the toll - A. That was the man that paid me toll.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see whether there was any straw in the cart - A. A great deal of straw stuck up at the sides of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any enquiry made to you about the road to London - A. They never asked for the road to London. We conversed a little while, when I asked them for the toll, he said he would pay me when he came back; I asked him who the cart belonged to; he told me the cart belonged to Mr. Dodd; then I said you shall not go through without paying me the toll; he said I must give him change - what is your change - a shilling; I told him to hand me over the money, I would give him the change; he gave me the shilling; I put my hand in my pocket and gave him sixpence, then I released him and away he went. His toll was sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. From your observations of him, do you know that he was the person that drove the cart - A. Yes; he told me the cart belonged to Mr. Dodd. It was harnessed up in an odd kind of manner; I can say that I can swear to the horse and cart; I have seen the horse and cart through my gate three times a week; that is the horse that was in the cart that is in the yard, I have seen it; it was harnessed in an odd way, with rope under and over the back. I stood by the harness while I was discoursing with him, and put my hand upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. You have said you could not swear to the horse and cart - A. I can swear to the horse and cart; that was the horse and cart that went through my gate; I did not chuse to swear to it then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Can you swear to the horse - are you certain that horse in the yard is the horse that went through your gate - A. I am sure that is the horse that went through the gate; I did not mind the marks; I know that it is the horse that went through my gate, seeing it so many times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. You have but few horses come through your gate - A. Some nights none; I had just let a team through before, but not a horse and cart; only that horse and cart; I saw it next at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it that you did not know him again - A. I did know him.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it that you could not swear to it the first time - A. I did not choose to swear to it that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Why did you not choose to take your oath the first time - A. I did not like it.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you for not liking it - A. I was loth to swear to him; I was sure he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were you loth to swear to him when you saw him at the office - A. I never did take an oath before.</p>
               <p>Q. No doubt of that - if you knew he was the man why were you loth to swear to him, when you were sworn to tell the truth - if you had no doubt of his being the man why did not you not swear that he was the man - A. I did not choose.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us your reason for not choosing - A. I did not like to take an oath to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you like to swear to him if you knew him - if you had a doubt you did right, but if you had not a doubt, why did not you swear to him - A. I did not choose.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you for not choosing - why do not you answer me - A. Why to be sure I was rather afraid, being in the night.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing induce you to get out of bed - A. Yes; I was awoke between twelve and one on the night of the 5th of March; I heard the cart; I got out of bed; I knew the noise perfectly well, that induced me to get up.</p>
               <p>COURT. What made you know the noise of the cart - A. I have been in the habit of using the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a noise has your brother's cart - has your brother's cart a different noise from other people's carts - A. It went lumping along, it made a great noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not other carts make so much noise as your brother's - do you mean to swear that no other cart made so much noise as your brother's cart - A. I cannot swear that, but it made a lumping noise; I used it three or four times a week. I got up, I saw the cart, I had a great suspicion by the noise that it was my brother's cart; I saw two slimmish young men in the cart. It was moon-light, a; bright as day; I thought I knew it by the noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it by looking at it - A. I thought I knew it by the noise; there were two slight young men in it, one of them seemed to lay back in the straw; they seemed to be as near the size of the prisoners, as nigh as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your house nearer Cuddome than the turnpike - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Curwood. This is a comical cart, you thought you knew it by the noise - A. Yes; I thought I knew the cart.</p>

Yes; I was going to my horse up Maiden lane; I observed about half a mile up the lane, a cart drawed into the ditch and the horse of the other side, tied to a bush, grazing in Mr. Dennett's field.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Hatton Garden office. In consequence of information I apprehended the prisoner on the 6th of March, a little before seven in the evening, in Maiden-lane; I was in company with Davies, from whom I received the information; I came to the cart, one wheel of which stood in the ditch on the left hand side of the lane, it was pretty well full of loose straw; I felt in the cart and I felt these two prisoners legs, and a boy there was.</p>
               <p>Q. You felt the legs of three persons - 
               <persName id="t18090412-45-person464">A. </persName>
            I did, and it turned out to be the two prisoners, they were covered with straw; I first felt them and called out to know who was there; I said who have you got there; they jumped up and shewed their heads; I whistled for Davies; and the boy belonging to these prisoners attempted to get out of the cart; I made them get out of the cart, and I secured them; the horse was then in the field on one side of the cart, just a little over the bank, which the horse might get up, as there were very few bushes; I secured them; being dark I put some knives that I took from them in my pocket; I found a dollar and a few shillings on Ezekiel. After their examination they wished to have their knives; Robert owns one knife, and 
               <persName id="t18090412-45-person465">Ezekiel</persName>
             the other. They have asked me several times for the knives; yesterday I was down below in the yard where the prisoners were, I shewed them both the knives; Robert said the old knife was his, and Ezekiel owned the new one.</p>
               <p>Q. When you apprehended them did you ask them who they were and where they lived - A. I did; they told me that they lived at Mrs. Norris's, Porter's-buildings, Twister's-alley, Bunhill-row; and that they laid down in the cart for half an hour; I enquired according to that direction, I was not able to discover that they lived there; I went to the house that they directed me to; the people of the house told me that they did not know them. I searched the house there were only two rooms.</p>

               <p>Esckiel Lockleader's Defence. We were walking up the lane in the morning to meet my sister, she was gone up to Highgate, and we walked by the cart; I said to my brother we may as well sit down on the cart till my sister comes up; we sat down in the cart; it was very cold, we laid down in the cart, and throwed the straw over us, thinking we should hear her come by. My brother's knife was a round pointed knife; when Mr. Hancock shewed it us, I told him it was too far off, I could not tell.</p>

On the 17th of February I was in a little room adjoining my shop; the prisoner slept in the shop, his bed was under the counter, and his box was kept under the counter; as I came out of the room adjoining the shop I saw him at his box, when he looked up his countenance altered; I suspected him, I sent him out of an errand; he went and I searched the box; the box was left open, and the key in it. The first thing I saw was a paper parcel containing a piece of Irish; the prisoner came in in about ten minutes; I looked no further in the box then. I put the piece of Irish in the box as I found it. When he returned I told him if he wanted to go out he had better go soon - he had asked me on the preceding evening to go out as the next evening to the Minories - I went into my little room, in order to give him the opportunity of taking this piece of Irish cloth out if he chose it; I saw him go behind the counter, and I heard the noise of the box lid; he went out; I went to the box again, I found the piece of cloth was gone; I directly went after him, but could not find him; I returned back to my shop, and then I examined the box farther; my lad Thomas Stevens and Mr. Butler were in the shop. Upon examining it I found some squares of muslin, some squares of lawn, and a square of French cambric, then I told the boy to go and fetch an officer; I did not search the box thoroughly. The prisoner returned about half past nine o'clock; I asked the prisoner where he had been to, he said to the Minories; I told him I thought it was very odd I could not find him. I had gone in a direction to that way; he then paused and begged pardon, and said he turned up Union-street; I asked him what he had done with the piece of cloth he had taken out that evening, he said he had taken it to a woman to be made up, he said he had bought it before he came to me; I told him I must beg his pardon, I thought it was cut from a cloth that we had on the shelf, that I had compared that piece of cloth with the piece of cloth on the shelf, and the quantity of cloth and the fold corresponded with it; I had so done when the prisoner was out; he said it never was my property; then I called him into the shop to look at the other things, I had taken them out of his box and laid them on the counter; he told me he had cut these things off and put the money in the till; I told him that it was a thing very unusual in the trade, and what any honest young man would never have thought of.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find any stockings - A. The next morning; I had not searched the box thoroughly that evening; he was taken in custody that evening; the next morning I found about five or six pair of stockings; I asked him where he got these stockings from; he said he bought them in the country; I told him I did not think that possible; because they had my marks on them; but he had altered my marks; he said nothing to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get again any piece of Irish cloth that you had seen - A. Yes; I went the next morning to Mrs. Harris's with the officer, in Red-gate-court, in the Minories; Mrs. Harris delivered it to me; we found two other shirts at this woman's house that we had no idea of; the cloth he had taken out of our house to this woman's house, to make the shirts. The piece of Irish, she gave me, that he had taken the over night.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120036"/>We went to another person's house; Mrs. Harris sent her son after us with a shirt that was made up, that shirt had my private mark on it; the lad said I was desired to call at his mother's; on our return to Mrs. Harris she produced another shirt partly made up.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the piece of cloth that you got back in the same state as when you saw it in the prisoner's box - A. Yes, in the same state.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these shirts must have been from some other cloth - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The diaper, you have said nothing about that - A. That I put on the counter; I put all these things in the box again.</p>

            . I am a police constable; I was sent for to Mr. Hoskins's, the prisoner was given into my charge on the night of the 17th of February, about ten o'clock; I went the next morning with Mr. Hoskins to Mrs. Harris's; she lives in Wild-court, it comes into Red-gate-street; she produced a piece of Irish cloth and a piece of cambric, to make a frill; I went to another house, a little boy came after me with a shirt. I told him to take it back to his mother, Mrs. Harris, that was done; I went back to the mother, she gave me the shirt; she told me that she had another shirt partly made; I got that from Mrs. Harris, and I took a pair of stockings from the prisoner's feet at the office. Mr. Hoskins looked at them and thought they were his.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH HARRIS. I live at No. 15, Wild-court, it comes into Redgate-street. I knew the prisoner by living with Mr. Smith, a linen-draper in the Minories, about two months ago. The prisoner asked me if I knew any body that would make him some shirts; I told him I did; he brought me cloth to make two shirts. On the 17th of February, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, he brought a piece of Irish cloth, and a bit of cambric for a frill, to make another shirt; I never opened it; I delivered it to Mr. Brown in the same state as it was when the prisoner delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went to Mr. Hoskins's first I bought some stockings of him, whether it was one, two, or three pair, I cannot recollect now; at that time I gave him a profit upon these things; he mentioned at the time that what things I wanted in his shop I might have without any profit; and as for the Irish cloth, when I came from Mr. Smith he sold off his stock in trade, and when he was selling off his Irish by auction I bought a piece of twenty six yards; and the cloth which Mr. Hoskins claims is a part of that. Mr. Hoskings had a good character with me, that he cannot deny.</p>

On Sunday the 19th of February, about a quarter before seven o'clock, I was in company with Vickery and Gleed in Stepney fields; we met two men; Vickery was first, I was next, and Gleed was behind me; Vickery laid hold of the last man of the two, and said let us see who these men are. The prisoner passed me and Gleed; Gleed followed the prisoner and I followed Gleed; the prisoner walked five or six paces, turned to the left and ran away towards the Half Way House in the Commercial-road; I ran after him and passed Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you run after him for - A. To take him in custody, to see who and what he was; I ran fifteen or twenty paces after him; then he turned his face a little to the left; I had the sight of his face, I was within two or three yards of him, he put his right hand over his left shoulder and fired a pistol at me; then he ran five or six yards further and I after him; he turned half way round to the left and threw the pistol at me; it went over my head, struck the ground behind me, and went into a ditch of water just by; with his stopping to throw the pistol at me, I got near enough to reach him with this cane in my hand. I gave him two or three blows on his head and neck, he ran fifty or sixty yards further, towards the Commercial-road; I ran after him, crying stop thief; he jumped over a ditch and made his escape. I went to the Half-way house to Vickery, where he had the other man in custody; Vickery gave him in custody of another man; he and Gleed went to look for the pistol.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120037"/>Q. Who lodged in the room with you - A. Nobody but me and my wife; the prisoner's room adjoined mine; the rooms were separated by a partition and a door which was nailed up; the nails were of the prisoner's side.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been in possession of this room - A. Four days. On Wednesday the 1st of March I went out about half after two o'clock, my wife was out, I locked the door and took the key with me; I came home alone, about half past four; I found my room door locked; I unlocked it; on my going into the room I found my wife's box on the bed, I left it by the side of the door under another box, it had been wrenched open; it was left locked; there were two pictures, a child's cap, and a shirt left in it; I found a bonnet and a red gown gone from the great box, that box was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you examined the box what observations did you make about the room - A. When I entered the room I found the box on the bed; I examined the other box, and then I turned round and found the door between her room and mine open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lock upon that door - A. It was only nailed up with six or seven nails; the nails had been wrenched, and a bit of the wood cut off; I went through the door into the prisoner's room, she was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner afterwards - A. In about ten days after I met her in Beech-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been acquainted with her at all - A. I had been laid up with the rheumatism seventeen months - one night I laid myself down on the chair by the wainscot; I heard a moan, I said to my wife who is that, she said the young woman in the next room; I said go and see what is the matter with her; she went, she was laying on the boards without any thing over her; she brought her in; I gave her victuals, and kept her till eleven o'clock at night, thinking she was in distress. I met the prisoner in Beech-street, I said are not you a pretty creature; she said she would not run away. I brought her home to my wife, my wife asked her if she could tell her any thing about the things, she said she knew nothing at all about them; after keeping her from six o'clock to eleven, I went to Mr. Stanton the officer, he searched her, I saw two caps found upon her, a caddie spoon, two housewives, and one piece of gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of the other things - A. No.</p>

I put the watch under my head; in the morning, about five o'clock, he awakened me and asked me the way to the privy; I told him; he went down stairs and did not return; I went to sleep after that, I awoke about seven o'clock, I missed my watch and my velveteen jacket that was laying on my bed.

The prisoner came to my house for a lodging; I cannot exactly tell the time, it was four or five days before the 6th of March; he had a lodging for two or three nights; before he went away he said he had a watch in pawn, and as he owed me two or three nights lodging, and for a little porter besides, he said if I would go along with him and take the watch out of pawn, he would sell it to a jew for two pounds. I went with him to the pawnbroker by Well close-square; I redeemed it; I gave twenty eight shillings and some odd pence; I went with him to a jew in Rosemary-lane to sell the watch; the jew said he would give no more than a guinea and a half for the watch; the twenty eight shillings that I paid for the watch, and the odd halfpence, and two or three shillings he owed me for the lodging and beer, I thought I might as well keep the watch as let the jew have it. I kept the watch with his consent. Nettleton, the officer, has the watch.</p>
               <p>- NETTLETON. On Monday morning I went with the prosecutor to St. Martin's watchhouse; I asked the prisoner what he had done with his watch; he told me he left it at Mr. Jones's for twenty eight shillings, which he owed Mr. Jones; the jacket he said he had sold in Rosemary-lane for four shillings and six pence. Green and I went to Mr. Jones; he produced the watch directly; I have had the watch ever since.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

Yes; I was finishing my moving on that day; the prisoner came to me about a fortnight before this happened; I told him it was not in my power to do much for him; I would do what I could. About a week before I moved I gave him victuals and drink, and three nights I gave him a shilling to pay for his lodging. I consented to his assisting me in moving my goods.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he assisted you in moving your goods where was your watch hanging - A. On a nail by the window, in the four pair of stairs room; the prisoner took several parcels, and then he came to take a table, I said I will take this, you take something else down in your hand; I took the table and left the prisoner in the room; when I got to the street door he came, and I delivered him the table, and told him to make haste to my other apartment. I went up to my employ again, and as soon as I got up stairs I missed my watch; I ran after the prisoner; when I got to my other apartment the prisoner was not there, but the table was.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. In September last was the prisoner in your employ - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you in the month of March last, a debt of nine pounds five shillings and a penny due from Mr. Booth at Louth, for goods that you had furnished him with in March - A. Yes; it stands in our books now.</p>
               <p>COURT. What discount do you give - A. Five per cent for six months, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. That would reduce the debt to eight pounds sixteen shillings, supposing the money to have been paid to your rider - eight pounds sixteen shillings would have been your demand - A. That was what would he expected.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. On what day in September did the prisoner come to town - A. I believe the prisoner arrived in September, our cash book will tell.</p>
               <p>Q. First look at your own ledger - A The article in the ledger is only to goods nine pounds five shillings and a penny; that remains undischarged in our ledger now.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time your rider goes out upon a journey does he take with him a pocket journal - A. He does.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you now hold in you hand any pocket journal that the prisoner took out with him on that journey - A. I do; it is made from the general ledger that we have in our accompting house; it is extracted from the general ledger, to take out the general cases in the journey he is going to; this pocket lodger is all his hand writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. It gives him instructions what to do - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Turn to Mr. Booth at Louth, in that ledger - 
               <persName id="t18090412-53-person536">A. John Booth</persName>
            , Louth March the 31st to goods; nine pounds five shillings and a penny; this is the prisoner's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner had received that money from Mr. Booth, was it his course to make any entry in that pocket ledger - A. It would have been this course to have made an entry in that ledger after he had received the money, and he has a pocket journal to enter it in.</p>
               <p>Q. In other instances, in that ledger has he acknowledged of receiving the money - A. In some he has, and some he has not; there is a column there to write down debit and credit.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned from his journey was it his course to make the entry of that cash book into the ledger - A. He generally made that from the pocket journal of his own. That pocket journal of his last journey we have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now give me the cash book - has he in that cash book accounted to you for this eight pounds sixteen shillings - A. He has not.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he accounted for any money received of Mr. Booth - A. None whatever; on the 22nd of September 1808, he returned home and commenced accounting with me on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first learn that this money had been paid by Mr. Booth, how lately - A. I believe somewhere about the latter end of March, this year.</p>
               <p>Q. To this moment you have never received that eight pounds sixteen shillings - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted the only way for accounting was by putting an entry in the cash book - A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you write to Mr. Booth to ascertain the fact which you have stated in this court, or did you not know it from my information first - A. We discovered it by writing to other gentlemen in that journey; they stating that they had paid Mr. Spender on such a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not I previously stated that I had received this money from Mr. Booth, before you knew it from any other source - A. I have some delicacy in answering that question; Mr. Spender after being taxed with Mr. Bullman's money, admitted that he had taken up other money, among which was Mr. Booth's; it is imperious<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120040"/>necessity, calling upon me as prosecutor, to divulge that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not I offered to account for the balance - A. You have written several letters to me since you have been in custody, wishing me to take it as a debt.</p>
               <p>COURT. That cannot be allowed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was it not the prisoner's duty, as your servant, to collect money and receive orders for you, if so, was it not his duty to render an account of the money he so took - A. Most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ever allowed to him to conceal money from you which he had received of your customers, and without your knowledge to apply the money to his own use - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say in consequence of finding some of your customers in arrears you wrote to them, and finding they had paid, you charged the prisoner - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it upon that account he first confessed - A. It was; one of the letters was laying upon the desk, when he came into the accompting-house from the last journey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he upon that occasion give you this list of of money he had received - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bullman 12 l. 10 s. - Mr. Booth 9 l. 5 s. 1 d. he gave that to you as a sum he had received - A. He did, that was lately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Mawhood had no knowledge of my receiving the money from Mr. Booth till I informed him of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then he had the best information, that of your own confession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Consciously knowing that I had no intention feloniously to appropriate any private money of my prosecutors to my own use, I rely upon the jury's verdict - whether it shall be for or against me I shall be perfectly submissive. I have other vouchers - are we not to go forward? -</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Hughes. When you came to me at Liverpool, did I not press you to call upon all the customers - A. You certainly did.</p>
               <p>COURT. When - A. In the latter end of last March.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When we left the Swan and Two Necks. Lad-lane, did you at that moment suspect my honesty - A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not inform you that I had received the sum in question before you knew of it - A. Yes; that was after receiving Mr. Bullman's letter you delivered me this paper; there is Mr. Booth's name, and several other names, stated on the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not, Mr. Hughes, come and asked me to give security for this sum as a debt - A. I certainly have asked you to give security for the debt.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was that - A. A week ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Upon that you received advice that that would be improper for you to do - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You would be compounding of felony - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Greasley. Did not you, in company with Mr. Hughes, say; it was no more than a debt, and asked security - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not then say, I could not negociate security while charged as a felon - A. You did.</p>
               <p>Q. But if you considered it a debt, and I was placed so, I was ready to negociate - A. You did so.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was all this conversation - A. Last Monday, after he was finally committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. After you had done all this, you found it was very improper - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did it without Mr. Mawhood's authority - A. I did.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of August last, and some time before, was the prisoner in your employ - A. Yes, he had been in our employ between three and four years as clerk and rider.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return from a journey on the 22nd of September - A. I believe he might; I could tell by a reference to the books; I suppose that was about the time.</p>
               <p>Q. In August in that summer was he in Sunderland - A. Yes, we had letters from him.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time did Mr. Bullman appear upon your ledger as debtor - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time how much was he indebted to you - 
               <persName id="t18090412-54-person549">A. </persName>
            12 l. 10 s. 1 d. - he is credited for 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. as receive August 25, 1808.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when he went out that journey, Mr. Bullman appeared indebted to you 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. and 12 l. 10 s. - A. I must refer to the cash-book, I would wish to be correct - 1808, August 25, 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. before that; he was indebted that since by credit by the prisoner in the journey of August and September, in the cash-book; here is his hand-writing; this is the prisoner's pocket ledger, which he kept at that time, it is his writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It appears there was an article of 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. for goods supplied the 31st of August 1807 - he writes in the last column, bill 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. discharged - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive that letter from him in the course of that journey - A. Yes, we did.</p>
               <p>Q. This letter is dated 28th of August 1808, Bedal in Yorkshire - receipts since my last, Sunderland, S. Watson 3 l. 3 s. - W. Bullman 21 l. 4 s. 5 d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is that his hand-writing - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then three days after the money was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120041"/>paid, as he represented it, he writes received this 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. - A. Yes, he entered down in my cash-book as received on the 26th of August 1808.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. had not been accounted for as part of the March journey - A. Oh no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever account to you for the 11 l. 17 s. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your writing to Mr. Bullman for this 11 l. 17 s. did you receive that answer from him - A. We did; that is a letter from Mr. Bullman, dated March 1809; it was laying upon his desk when he returned, it was read by him (the letter read). Upon seeing that he went in tears, he felt himself much hurt, he mentioned many others; he said he would give an account of all the money he had taken up; he pleaded very hard for mercy; this was on the 25th of March; he was taken to the Counter on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he on that day, or on the next day, send you that letter that is dated the 25th, I believe - A. He did, that is his hand-writing. (The letter read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mawhood. You have stated that I never accounted for Mr. Bullman's money, and at the same time you have produced an account where I have stated it.</p>
               <p>COURT. He has stated that you accounted for the 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. but you did not account for the 11 l. 17 s. that you ought to have accounted.</p>
               <p>[A paper read, wherein the prisoner, after being charged by the prosecutors, accounted for different sums that he had received to the amount of 128 l.]</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Mawhood admits that when I stood charged with having received 11 l. 17 s. that I returned 21 l. - do you conceive that I acted with a felonious intention - Mr. Mawhood. When you entered the 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. you should have entered the 11 l. 17 s. and the 21 l. 4 s. 5 d. should have been entered six months before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Will you swear that you do not stand indebted to me for salary - A. Here are the books that will prove it - he is overpaid.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had not an opportunity of searching the books, hurried as I was before the magistrate; - even Mr. Humphries, the solicitor, has been to me to flatter me, so that I am left defenceless.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, to Mawhood. Were the books produced before the magistrate - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time complain that he had not sufficient time to look into them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you induced any body to flatter the prisoner - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Humphreys. The prisoner says that you have been to the prison, that you have flattered him, and he is left defenceless - is that true - A. I saw him once, when I once went to a young man; I asked him who was his counsel; I told him I had prepared the bill, most likely he would be tried that evening; he told me that he should defend himself, he did not doubt but that he should get through it; that is all, I believe, that passed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphreys. I think I did say that the prosecutors would not be rigid, they would be as lenient as they could.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have to state what I said before - that I had never any felonious intent to conceal the property. I was hurried off to a jail; I have been frequently promised that I should have assistance to retain counsel; not having that assistance, after being bereft of all my money, and in a prison, where I was filthy, I was ragged, I troubled no friend, still relying on the prosecutor for assistance. I lay to the mercy of the jury to find my verdict. The prosecutor has been and flattered me in jail; the other prosecutors have been and led me on that it was a debt, and I might discharge my attorney and my friends, that I needed no money of them, nor need I put myself to any expence; I have no wish now to deny any thing but my felonious intent. If I had been a desperate character, and intended to conceal any thing from my prosecutors, I could have done it from one to ten thousand pounds; that there is an error in my accounts I admit. I have been asked to give security in this unfortunate place; I said I will not negociate in this unfortunate place; I have a respectable family. Having said this, I believe I have nothing more to impress upon the jury; - if they acquit me of the felony, they perhaps will not acquit me of the debt, nor do I wish to be acquitted of the debt, if a debt arises upon the two accounts.</p>

            . I am a cordwainer, I live at No. 4, John's court; I was at work on the 16th of March, I heard the alarm of fire about twelve o'clock in the day, I went down stairs immediately, I found a great smoke in the passage of No. 3, I found the door fast, I endeavoured to open the door, I could not; then I tried the windows, I found them all fast; so I forced the door open; on my entrance there was smoke all round so that I could not see; my wife brought the first pail of water, and the other women assisted to bring water; we got the flame under. After the flame was extinguished I looked at the fire place, the grate had some coals, paper, and other things in it, that had not been lighted that day; it excited suspicion in me that it could not come by accident; I requested a candle, because in the part where the fire originated it was dark, it was where a bed had stood, but the bed being away the combustibles were all together; when I got a candle, I saw there were some lighted wood, a large book and some paper that had taken fire, and part of a birch broom, and two or three pound of pitch were all lighted by the flame. It had taken to that part of the partition that is over the stair-case, and the partition of the first floor it had burned; that part of the partition where these things lay we knocked out with our feet, it was on flame; had it been burned through it would not have been in my power to have got it out. There was a small cask that had held white lead or white paint, there was an hamper that had a large oil flask, a large oil glass bottle, it was contained in an hamper; there was some gunpowder and shot at the fire place; there was some shot, I believe, I did not inspect much into it, being away from where the fire was. After we had extinguished the fire a driver belonging to a fire engine came in and looked at it, and others came in; I thought it must be done on purpose; and this person in court, came in; I desired them not to touch it. One of the firemen, in court, had the inspection of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What fire office took this man up - A. The Eagle fire office; Mr. Beetham is the solicitor of the Eagle fire office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. At this place where the fire was, was there not a hole so that a man might put his hand or a candle there - A. No, there was no hole there till we kicked it out.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18090412-56-person569">Q. </persName>
            Were there not two fires in this house, before this happened - A. I do not know that there were two fires in this house; there was a child that set her clothes on fire.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not see any such a place in which a man might have put his hand - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that a person without could not remove the boards and so have put his hand in and set a light there - A. I do not conceive that any man or child could.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in this court - A. Six years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this poor man lived there - A. I do not know that ever I saw him above three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some property of that poor man's found in the room - A. There was some little property found in the room; a bird cage, a grate, and a flap of a table.</p>
               <p>Q. Then certainly if the house had been burned down the property must have been gone - how long after the fire had been discovered was it that the poor man came home - A. At dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. His brother was sent to, was not he - A. A woman went to his brother's to enquire after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that as soon as the woman went to his brother's, the man came - A. I cannot say what past from twelve o'clock till night. The man came in the court that night, I took upon myself that night to lay hold of him; he came about eight hours after the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he come and remain, did he ever abscond - A. No, he could not abscond; as soon as he came I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Some property was found in this room after the man came home - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was the property - A. There was a bird cage, an old mop, this cask of colour, a jar, the grate and the flap of the table; there was only one parlour below stairs.</p>
               <p>- EDWARDS. I live in John's-court, No. 6, I was up in my room in the morning till near twelve o'clock; I heard the alarm with the women and children; I immediately went down stairs; just round the corner I saw the women and children at the door; I entered the door, Mr. Harrison was endeavouring to break open the parlour door; I came before the parlour door was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he break it open - A. With our strength, I had nothing in my hands; after we broke the door I saw on my going in the room, at the right hand, that it was on fire. Then by the assistance of the women and the water I endeavoured to put it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there much flame - A. Not much at that time, but it would have been in a few minutes; it was on fire, but not much blaze; I went to that part which I perceived most in danger, which was over the stairs leading to the kitchen, and broke in the pannel; I returned into the room again, and exerted my power in throwing the water to all parts that were in danger.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120043"/>We put it out with water.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in what state did you find the room when it was out - A. I then looked to see how the fire could happen; I perceived there had been no fire in the stove apparently that day; I looked round the room, I perceived a small piece of candle and a flask, which contained some oil; these were placed by the combustibles, which were some pieces of paper, bits of wood, and pitch; on the top of that there were some bits of birch broom; I said to Mr. Harrison and another gentleman, that this candle had been placed there to keep the flames in; and there stood a keg there, which I think was placed there to throw the heat among the combustibles.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the keg - A. It appeared to be white paint, or white-wash; I cannot say what it was, it was one or the other; I did not take particular notice. I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge till I saw him at Marlborough-street office.</p>

No, not without forcing part of it in; on the mantle-piece over the fire place was a packet of gunpowder and some shot, and the fire place was laid ready to kindle, but never had been kindled for that day; the stove was drawn out of the situation of the place it had stood in; I do not think there had been any fire in it from the time it had been drawn out.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods were there in the room - A. kind of a table, a bird cage, an old chair, and this stove; no other furniture.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have told us there was some powder that was on the mantle piece - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a considerable distance from it - A. Not a considerable distance from it, the sparks might have jumped to it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was mixed with shot - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being asked whether he knew of the gunpowder being there - A. He never accounted for any one thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a lock was on this man's door - A. I did not see it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he give any account how these combustibles came there - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say there was an oil bladder there - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not examine the lock - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was the bladder from where the fire happened - A. Close by the place where the fire had kindled; the pitch and every other article had been extinguished when I came there.</p>

I believe a quarter after twelve o'clock; I saw the wainscot burned of the stair-case, I saw some pitch and some tar close to where the wainscot had been on fire; I went to see that the people were safe in the one pair of stairs room; when I found they were all perfectly safe I went away. About four or five foot square of the wainscot was burned each way, the wainscoting that parts the parlour from the kitchen stair-case.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, John's-court. On the 16th of March I saw Mr. Ward go down the court, about a quarter after eleven, with a small bottle in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he - A. They call him a painter, I do not know any thing of the man, I know no more than seeing the room on fire, and bringing several pails of water to extinguish the fire; I saw the wainscot burning and the room all of a smoke; I live in the second floor, next door to the house that was burning. On the evening of the same day he came to the end of the court, he asked me whether I had heard any thing of a fire, I told him I had, I supposed that he had, it happened in his apartment; I said he knew something of it; he said he knew nothing about it. I told him there was a person that wanted to speak to him; then he stopped. I saw Mr. Harrison coming down the court, I called to him; Mr. Harrison was not above two yards from him; he came and took him immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You said you supposed that he knew something about it, you meaned to insinuate that he did the thing - you thought so then and do now, do not you - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he knew nothing of it, meaning that he did not do it, when you said to him that he knew something about it - all I wish you to tell me is this, whether you did not mean by that expression that he had done the deed - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. His answer was, that he knew nothing about it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time of the day was it when you saw him - A. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The court is a poor wretched place - A. No, not wretched, the houses are inhabited by poor hard working people, and no other person insured but the ground landlord, Mr. Hobbs.</p>
               <p>COURT, to Macdine. You and your wife live at No. 3, you live in the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else lives in the house besides you - A. There is a lodger in the house, he is a broker; I cannot tell you the name; I occupy the first floor, the broker lives over me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day this gentleman has mentioned, I was taken in custody, I had been out; I returned to my brother; my brother told me the house had been set on fire; I said to him, go down with me; he said he had been down; I said if he would not go with me I would go myself. When I got to the court eight or ten people caught hold of me, one of them said put him in the parlour and set a light to it; I catched cold there, that is the reason I slept away from the place, because it was damp. As I went up the court I did not see any of the house burned. Respecting the gunpowder, I had it about three weeks or a month in paper on the mantle piece; I took it from my brother; and respecting the house being set on fire, I know nothing of it; and with respect to the combustibles, the greater part was straw, it was all swept up together.</p>

            . - Mr. Alley. What are you - A. I am a painter and glazier.</p>
               <p>Q. That unfortunate man I believe is your brother - did he work for you - A. When he applied for work I gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard about furniture being removed from this wretched lodging that he had - A. Yes; about the worth of two pounds was all the furniture that he had in the world; and what was left in the lodging was worth about twenty-five or twenty-six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What situation of life has he been in before - A. He was a tallow-chandler.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a man of property lately - he has been under the necessity of living by labour - A. I have given him work.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the value of the articles left in the apartment - A. There was a fire stove worth a guinea, a carboil worth six or seven shillings, and there was an old chair and white lead barrel.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard about some gunpowder - A. About Christmas he was shooting with me and one of my men, being bad weather we could not work; he took the gun and powder home; the shot and powder were altogether, which I saw on the mantle shelf in paper; it had not been taken away then; I am sure it is the same that he had; there was about two or three ounces.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a housekeeper - A. I have been a housekeeper seven years back; a master painter and glazier; sometimes I have seven men, sometimes ten, and sometimes fifteen.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the time of the fire - A. I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you known any other fire there before the prisoner came there - A. Yes; I was once there myself when a fire broke out, and the house was in danger of being burned; then there was another fire there; the first fire was eight years ago; the other I cannot say how long that was.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a carpenter - do you know what situation the wainscot of the stair case was in, and of the room, where this poor man had the furniture - A. I do. There was a window on the stair case without a sash or shutter, only some rough boards across it; between these rough boards there was a vacancy that a man's finger, or a child's hand might go in.</p>
               <p>Q. That communicated to where this fire happened - A. It was right over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at any time repaired it - A. Yes; the last repair I did was last Christmas: I mended the floor and ceiling where it was broken.</p>

I am an officer of Lambeth-street office; I received information that the prisoner was on board a ship at Gravesend; when I got there I saw him coming on shore in a boat; I saw him searched; I saw this watch found upon his person; he was searched in the mayor's house at Gravesend, by one of the mayor's officers; I believe the watch was taken from the inside of his sash; these articles were behind him in a window seat, this ten yards of blue woollen cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was in possession of it or not - A. I do not. It was a pinchbeck watch, the chain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120045"/>is gold.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no duplicates - A. No; all that I speak of is the watch, and the cloth; these trowsers were taken from his person, and one pair of small clothes from his person, and one pair in the bundle.</p>
               <p>[The prosecutor being a foreigner was examined through the medium of an interpreter; the prisoner also had an interpreter.]</p>

               <p>SIDY HADGE ABEDELINZED BONHALEL. Q. to interpreter. Ask him what he is and where he lived - A. He is a <rs id="t18090412-57-viclabel342" type="occupation">Mahometan</rs>

On the 28th of March, he lost a watch, chain, and seal; he saw them the night before; he missed them on the 28th of March in the morning when he came into his apartment, and he found the prisoner was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Ask him whether the prisoner used to visit him in that house, or how the prisoner could get at them - A. He took him out of the street, to give him provision out of charity.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been with him - A. Five or six weeks; he slept in another room with his servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him whether he slept in his apartment on the 27th of March - A. He slept there the night before the morning of the robbery, he saw him; the things were not locked up, they were on a chair, and me watch hung up in the room; he never saw the prisoner after these things were missing till he was brought before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. Ask him if the prisoner had given him any notice of leaving him - A. No; he gave information to the public office, and published hand-bills.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose these books - A. In the morning of Saturday the 8th of April the prisoner came into the shop and asked if my master or mistress were at home; my mistress's little boy was in the shop, I sent him up to call his mother; he said my mistress would be down presently; I stood at the door; he said, oh, I cannot wait any longer; he went off; I saw no more of him. On the Thursday morning following I saw him walking backwards and forwards at the door, looking at me; I and my master's girl ran after him, and called stop thief; I told him my mistress wanted to speak to him; he said he was going up Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday, when you sent the little boy up for your mistress, what did he do - A. He staid in the shop; there was nobody else in the shop but him, I was outside of the door putting out the books; he said I cannot stay any longer; we missed the books the minute he was gone from the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many - A. About half a shelf full. I am positive he is the same man.</p>

            . I am a bookseller in Broad-street, Bloomsbury. On Saturday morning, the 8th instant, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought these books to sell, he asked fourteen shillings for them; I bid him half a guinea, as they were odd volumes; I told him they were not worth fourteen shillings. He would not take half a guinea at first; he went away and returned; he said I should have them for the half guinea; I took the books and gave him the money; about half an hour afterwards, the books were standing on my counter, Mr. Laycock came in and claimed them; I described the person that I bought them of, which turned out to be the same young man that the lad had described being in the shop. This is the man that I bought the books of; on Thursday morning, in the forepart of the day, the lad ran over to my shop, saying, we have catched the thief; I went over and saw him. These are the books; two volumes of Shakespeare, and two volumes of Biblical Researches.</p>

In consequence of information on Friday the 3rd of March, between the joists of the floor of the shop, and the ceiling of the cellar; I there saw an ox tongue; I took it out, made an incission and put a card in it with my own name on it; after I had marked it I put it back to the place, after which I went to dinner; after I sat down to dinner, I heard the door of the cellar either open or shut; I left my dinner and found that Levy and my other servant were both gone out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they leave the house together - A. That I cannot say. I went into the street, and took the direction that went to Harris's house; I got sight of the man, which I suppose was Levy; I did not see his face, it appeared to be Levy from the size of him; I followed the same person into Harris's house; after he had been in the house perhaps a minute, I put my ear to the keyhole, I heard some voice, I cannot say it was either Harris or Levy, nor could I tell what they said; I went to get an officer, he was not at home; on the second consideration I thought I would leave it alone till the morning. On Saturday morning I went to Harris's house, he is a butcher in Petticoat-lane; I asked him if he had any tongues to sell, he said he had four or five; I requested him to let me look at them; he said he had sold them to another butcher. I took two tongues out of the tub.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Collier's-court, Golden-lane; as I was sitting by the fire with a baby in my arms, I heard somebody run up stairs in a great hurry; I opened the door, I saw nobody, I heard the people talking; the first I saw was a little boy, Christopher Wright, I said what is the matter; he said you know what is the matter, I want the young woman in the pink gown; I said there is no young, woman here; I went up stairs to see, she came out of my room; she said give me the way, she went by and slipped down all the way. A man that was there, that I thought to be an officer, came up stairs, I desired him to go into my room to see if she had lodged the lace there; the lace was not there; I said it must be on the garret stairs; he went up and found it on the stairs; he said it is all right now, do not frighten yourself.</p>

            . I live in Chiswell-street, opposite of Mr. Brown; I was sitting at the three pair of stairs window, I observed two young women, one was standing at Mr. Brown's shop window and the other at the door looking through the glass; the prisoner had get her arms folded up; she went and spoke to the other woman and then they both went into the shop; the prisoner had a red shawl, and a check apron on, and as soon as she went into the shop I observed her take something and put it into he pocket, it was white; the moment she took it she walked off; the prisoner folded her arms and came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other take any thing - A. I saw the other take something and put it into her apron; the prisoner walked away, and the other one ran; they did not join together as I saw; they went towards Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. At the distance you was could you see into the shop, it is a wide street - A. I could perfectly see into the shop from where I was.</p>
               <p>- BROOKE. I am an officer; I heard the alarm of stop thief in Beech-street; I ran and saw the prisoner go up Golden-lane; when she turned up Collier's-court I lost sight of her; I went up Collier's-court, I said where is she; they said in there; just as I was going into the house a man came out; he said leave her; I told him I should not, and just as I got on the door step she met me, I took her out of the house. She said I have got nothing, I shall not go, I won't go; I told her she was my prisoner; she resisted and hit me three times over my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lace ever found - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Burton. What was that man that took the lace - A. I do not know, I never saw him before; I thought he was an officer.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. She is a bad person. On Monday the 13th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, me and my husband were coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120050"/>home with another soldier, we met this prisoner in Rope-maker-street; she asked me to have something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before - A. Yes; we went to the Jack of Newbury the corner of Bunhill-row, to drink with her; we had half a pint of gin between four of us; I told her if she would go along with me I would give her a drop in return. We went to the White-horse in Old-street; we had half a pint of rum there; then there were three of us; just as I called for it I fell down in a fit, I am subject to fits; when I came out of the fit I was very cold, and while I was putting my hand in my pocket to pay for the rum, I went into another fit; the purse fell out of my hand; when I came to I called for my purse; the landlord gave it me; when I went home, this good body went home with me; she held my left side, where I put my purse in. I went into my own house, this body was with me, and when I arose in the morning my purse was gone; I did not feel for it on the over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse her with it - A. Because there was nobody in my company when I left the public house; my purse contained seven shillings in silver and a meat ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your purse again - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Are you really married to this man you call your husband - A. Yes; at Shoreditch church.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this you were coming home - A. Between ten and eleven at night; we had been to East Smithfield, where we had two pots of beer before.</p>
               <p>Q. I should like to know how much you drank that day - can you tell me how a decent woman should go with your husband, invited by a bad girl to drink - A. She asked me to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whatever a person is, if they ask you, you drink with them, good or bad - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are subject to fits - you put your hand in your pocket, and took out your pocket-book to pay for the rum, and down you fell dead drunk, and when you had recovered from your fit you was obliged to be led home by this good body - this woman was living in the neighbourhood - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were in fits the whole night - what do you take generally for your fits - A. I never go to the doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Now if you were so bad in the fit, how could you tell that you put the purse into your left-hand pocket - I know I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not walk steady, was not that the reason of your being led home - A. No, it was the fit.</p>

            . I am a constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watchhouse; I took the purse from her pocket, it contained a seven shilling piece, a shilling, and a few halfpence; the prosecutor claimed the purse.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man asked me in Whitechapel to take a walk with me in an indecent manner, and behaved very indecent; he said take the purse if you will go up any turning; I did not choose; he gave me the purse and a seven shilling piece, and because I would not be indecent in the street, he asked me for it again; when I came to the watchhouse it was found in my pocket - then I said if you are wicked enough to have me locked up after giving it me, you shall be locked up too - I gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Partridge. The prosecutor had no charge given of him; he living at Poplar, staid with me to go before the magistrate the next morning to substantiate the charge.</p>

            . I am a police officer of Hatton-garden. On the 16th of March, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner was coming down Cow-cross with another man, with a bag on his back; he went into an old iron shop, kept by one Newman, he acted very cautious before he went in, and turned round to see if any one was looking after him; I do not think he could see me, I was standing in the door-way of the public house opposite; the prisoner went right in the iron shop; I followed him. The other man went away then; when I got into the shop I laid hold of the prisoner, I said my friend what have you got here; he said he had only got some bits of iron; I said I must see what it is; he said it was his own property, he brought them from home; I saw it contained copper and brass, I told him he must go along with me.</p>

               <p>Q. You had a disposing power over these things - A. Yes; on the 16th of March, the sale was to finish in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. to Brine. You say you was in the possession of this yard, were Mr. Scrimshaw's things there for the purpose of sale - A. Yes; I saw this backband; when I was there I observed that this backband was not in the catalogue, to the other porter; these bolts I recollect, and all the things were like what was there; I told the other porter I should purchase them myself.</p>

            . I am the principal superintendant of Messrs. Severn and King's sugar manufactory. On Thursday the 13th of April, I stood at my door, I saw the waggon stop in White-horse-lane, Stepney; Barnes was driving the waggon, Cannon was with him; it was about a quarter past seven in the evening; Barnes had to bring the bags from Mr. Severn's and King's house in Queen-street, Cheapside, to be washed to get the sugar out; on my seeing the waggon stop I went to the waggon, the two men were by the waggon; I remonstrated with the carman for being so late, he ought to have been there at half past four; he was completely drunk; I requested him to take the horses and waggon into the yard; I asked Cannon whose bags they were on the pavement; he gave me answer that he brought them from over the water, he said they were his; I said I was afraid they were the property of Messrs. Severn and King; he said how could I think of such a thing, knowing him so long; I requested him to take the bags into the yard, which he did; I sent for an officer, I gave charge of him; he said he was innocent. The bags were on the pavement by the waggon when I came up. As far as the proof of these papers, these bags correspond with these papers; we found twenty bags with the marks on them, they correspond with the warrants.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you miss it - A. On the 17th my young man got up about five o'clock, he missed it; I missed it on the 17th at seven o'clock in the morning.</p>

Yes, he was there about half past twelve at night, he signed a specimen that night. On the morning of the 17th, about eleven or twelve o'clock, I obtained a search warrant, and with the officers, I went to the prisoner's house in a court in Gray's-inn-lane; we found him at home, and made a search; we found the whole of the two quires of paper; I had marked them. The officer asked him where he got this paper, and I think his answer was, that he got it from my manufactory; I will not be certain of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. You have not a very great partiality for excise officers, have you - A. If they conduct themselves with propriety we do not dislike them.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you were under this man's survey, had you any dispute with him - A. About three months before he had made a false survey; I had no words with him.</p>

               <p>COURT. You was displeased with what you call a false survey - A. Yes; he alarmed my family, and I thought he came for what I found him; he had no occasion to come that night, we did not expect him; my wife was very much alarmed indeed.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Harris. On the morning of the 17th I let the prisoner in at the gate, I suppose it to be about half past twelve o'clock; on the beginning of the 17th at night I let him in, gave him the key of the workshop, and went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went there he had access to the place where the paper was - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any paper in the warehouse before you went to bed that night - A. Yes, I had seen the paper there between ten and eleven o'clock that night. I left no one in the shop when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How early did you rise in the morning - A. About five o'clock in the morning; I went in with an excise officer named Pyrke; there was no person had been except the prisoner at that time; none of the workmen had come to work before I went in, I am certain of that; I went in at five o'clock with that excise officer, and missed the paper.</p>

            . I am an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the morning of the 17th of March go with the prosecutor with any search warrant to the prisoner's house - A. I did, about eleven o'clock in the middle of the day; the prisoner's house I think is in Bull-head-court, Gray's-inn-lane; the prisoner was sitting in the house; he acknowledged he was the person. I searched the bottom part of the house, where he was; I did not find any thing there. I told the prisoner my business, I had come to search for some paper that he had stole from Mr. Harris; I went up stairs; seeing the one pair of stairs door open, I said to Mr. Harris we will go in here; I had searched below, and left the prisoner in my brother officer's custody; the prisoner's mother and Mr. Harris went up with me; I found it in a one pair of stairs bed-room, laying on a chair, just as it is now; I took it down stairs and shewed it the prisoner. Mr. Harris told the prisoner it was his paper, there was his hand writing on it, and the day of the month, and he must have stolen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Harris's hand writing upon it - A. Yes; the prisoner said nothing, he seemed in a melancholy way; after he sat a little bit I asked him who had put the paper in the room above, he said he did himself; I said there is Mr. Harris' hand writing on it; he said it is his paper; he was silent then for some time. I said if you put the paper there you must know who you brought it from; he then said, I suppose I must tell; no said I; you are not bound to tell unless you please; he then said he took the paper from Mr. Harris, and begged Mr. Harris not to be severe with him; the paper is marked J. Harris, March 15th, on six of the sheets, in small characters, on the back, inside the sheets.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to Harris. You know, sir, you are upon oath - what quantity of paper do you swear to - A. To the quantity found.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Can you swear to that hand writing - A. Yes; on the 15th of March, about eleven o'clock.

               <p>Q. During the time this man has surveyed do you remember any quarrel - A. No quarrel between them at all. Mr. Harris wrote in the specimen a wrong survey.</p>
               <p>Q. To your knowledge has any complaint been prefered to the board of excise, or to a justice of peace by this man - A. I never heard of any complaint being made by this man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 1st of day of October I came to the division where Mr. Harris now resides; I commenced surveying him on that day. It was about five months ago, or better, that he attempted to get a brother officer,

            , discharged, for making a false survey; that was reported to the surveyor, it proved an unfortunate case for the young man, but for the character that Mr. Harris bore with the excise - Mr. Harris has been before that time fined for running the duties of the excise twice, but ever since he has had an antipathy to excise officers, for their preventing him robbing government of the duties. It was about four months ago I was surveying candles at Mr. Harris's; when we were weighing them there was sixty-eight pounds draft in the scales, I called out sixty-eight, he cried out sixty-three pounds; Mr. Harris turned his heel and went away; Mr. Harris paid full duty for that. It is my turn every third week to survey the house of the prosecutor day and night. It was in the month of February, about three weeks ago, I waited near an hour at the door, it rained very hard, it was between two and three o'clock, I was wet through; I rung the bell very hard, then in about ten minutes I got admittance. When we make a survey at the house it is common for us to sign a specimen, a book hanging up in the house; I made a survey then; I wrote upon the specimen, between two and three o'clock in the morning; Mr. Harris came into the factory in a very great passion, he wrote upon the specimen that I had made a false survey, that it was about half past twelve when I went there, which was more than he ought to have done;

             let me in, I made my usual survey, I was five minutes in the premises altogether; after that I went and made my survey at Mr. Benjamin Hall's and Mr. Scrimshaw's, I believe they are in coalition together, one of whom the honourable gentleman standing up is a relation to; I leave it to these people, if they are here, to know whether I had any paper about me at the time; after I left these premises I had no paper with me; I did not go back to Mr. Harris's premises again.</p>

               <p>COURT. There is nothing in the size of that paper that you might not carry it without observation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. After six o'clock I went home and cleaned my regimentals, I was going to attend parade in the excise corps. Between twelve and one two officers came in with a search warrant; they asked me if Mr. Berresford lived there; I said yes; they asked if he was at home; I said I was the person in question; they said they had a search warrant; no search warrant was shewn to me, nor did they tell me what they were come for; they made their search in the room below where I was in; there they could find nothing; they went down stairs, searched the cellar, they could find nothing there; and as I am informed they searched the top of the house next, up in the garret, they could find nothing there that they wanted; they went into the apartment on the first floor, which was a ready furnished lodging. They came down stairs afterwards with the paper in their hands; I wanted to go up myself, I was refused, my wife was refused, and my children was refused.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean that no one of the family was permitted to go - A. Yes, at first; afterwards my mother went into the room to them, but that was after they had got the paper in their hand; when she went up stairs they were searching a chest of drawers, and the officer wanted to take out two half crowns out of the drawer belonging to one of my children; she refused it, and said they had no right to do any such thing; when they found that they called her a d - d fornicating b - h, and used such language which frightened the poor creature, that she hardly knew what she was doing of. The officer came down with the paper and asked me if I knew any thing about the paper belonging to Mr. Harris; I told them no; there was some threatening language used to me (I never was in a court before); I did not know what I said not any more than what I said the first time, that I did know any thing about it. Then the officer handcuffed me; as I was being handcuffed I turned my head and asked to kiss one of my children before I went; the answer made was if I was not quiet they would knock out my brains. I declare to God in Heaven I do not know by what means it came in my house no more than a child unborn; I really believe that there were some illegal tricks practiced against me; yet I have every reason to believe I shall meet with that justice in this court that every Englishman expects.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney, to Harris. The prisoner has said that you are a fraudulent trader - I believe you were once fined, what was that transaction - A. I had a young man that was unaccustomed to making candles; it is six years ago; he moved six pound of candles from one box to another; my men told him it was wrong; I was absent, I paid fifty pounds for it; it was totally without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. He says that you have taken some dislike to him because upon weighing some candles you called sixty-three,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120058"/>when they ought to be sixty-eight - A. No such a thing; I never weighed them; my man weighs them; I never spoke one word when he was weighing of candles.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to believe the excise entertain any suspicion of you - A. I know they have no reason, and I do know that they do not; I never went to make any complaint to the surveyor, nor caused

When we got to his house the officer went in first; I never went in the house before I went in with Trott.</p>

The prisoner made no request to go with us as I heard; when we got to the first floor the officer perceived the door to be open, he said we will walk in here; the old woman was on the stairs close behind; as soon as we got into the room I saw the paper laying in the chair; I said it was my paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search any chest of drawers - A. It was searched by the officer; the officer asked her whose property it was; she said it was Mr. Berresford's; the officer opened a little box, found two half crowns; the old woman said that is the children's; the officer replied we have nothing to do with that, he put it in the box again; there was no ill language passed whatever; the officer said he had done a bad thing, it was a chance but he would be transported; there was no reproachful language made use of whatever.</p>

Not untill the 17th, about eight or nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did you either of your own accord or by the desire of your master go to that house, or send any person till you went with the officer to execute the search warrant - A. No; nor do I know of any person going there by the consent of my master before the search warrant was executed; I was present when the search warrant was executed; he never expressed a desire to follow us, as I know of. The old woman went up with the officer; she was before me, but not before the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. to Trott. Did you acquaint the prisoner with every thing that you came to search for, when you came into the house, that you came to search for paper - A. I did, I am sure of that; and when his mother attemped to get out of the room, if it his mother, I desired my brother officer not to let her go; I learned from the prosecutor where the prisoner lived, a little time before the warrant was obtained; we went instantly we had the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the opportunity of going to the prisoners house before you went with the warrant - A. No; I had something particular to do, I was glad to go and come back again; I will swear that I never went to the prisoner's house before I went with the warrant; and I did not know it then till the number of the door was pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were below with the prisoner did he express any desire to accompany you up stairs, when you made the search warrant - A. He did not, that I swear positively, if he had I should have permitted him; but the mother went; if he had gone I should have left my brother officer below with the rest of the family. The mother denied that being his room before the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the chest of drawers - A. Yes, and she pretended she had not got the keys; I said I should break the drawers open if I had not the key. I saw two half crowns, I said whose money is this; she said it belonged to one of the son's children; I said how came that money to be here when you told me the room is let out to another person; she had said that in the presence of the prisoner; I believe, I told her she was an old liar for telling me it was let out to another person; she then confessed to be that they were his things in the room; I wrapped the money up and put it in the same place; I went to lock the drawer, she said never mind locking it.</p>

On the 14th of January the prisoner lodged in the same house with me; she asked me to come and nurse her child while she went to market; she asked me if I had locked my door; I told her yes, but I had left the key in it; I asked her to leave the door ajar, that I might hear if any body went up stairs; she returned in about half an hour, and said she did not get change for a one pound note, would I stop a little longer; I said I would; then she was about three quarters of an hour before she returned again, and in that time my husband came home. I went up stairs to my room, leaving her room; my husband was never out of the room, nor I was never out of the house after that. On Sunday morning my husband asked me to give him a waistcoat out of the drawer, I went to my drawer, it was stripped. I lost all the articles contained in the indictment.</p>

On the 10th of this month, about one o'clock, the prisoner came to me with two planks on his shoulder, and asked me the way to Limehouse; I went out of my box and shewed him the way to Brook-street; when he came there he throwed the boards off his shoulder; I laid hold of him and called another watchman to my assistance; we secured him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Is it usual when persons have stolen things about them, to come to a watchman - A. No, I never saw such a thing before.</p>

On the pay day of the second week I went into the room, she was laying upon the sacking, and all the articles were gone contained in the indictment. The first thing I missed was the looking glass, I asked her what she had done with it; she said she had pledged it at Mr. Wadmore's.

            . I am sixteen years old, I am son of the last witness; I recollect the prisoners coming on the 19th of February, and going away on the 20th; they said they would come back in the evening and pay. As they were going away, I saw a sheet put round Key's body, and his coat buttoned over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop them - A. No, I told my father; he got up, and he and I joined in pursuit of these men; we caught sight of them in a field; Mr. Saunders laid hold of them; I saw them throw the sheet into the ditch. I picked it up.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, sir, in the course of the day had you drank so as not to be sober - A. I had drank a little, and the liquor affected me.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the night did you pass Catherine-street - A. I did; I had been to Tothil-street to buy tallow; returning home I met with the two prisoners, they began hustling me about my breast pocket, they felt so as to ascertain I had a pocket book there; they followed me; I was going to the alamode beef shop; this was about half past eleven o'clock at night. In Nag's-head court they asked me to treat them; I took them to a public house, I believe, I treated them, I went home with them to their lodgings; I felt the pocket-look safe not five minutes before I went into their lodgings; I did not count the notes, I saw the bulk of them, I thought they were safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, when you went into their lodgings, lay down on the bed - A. I did, and went to sleep; they were both in the room when I went to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they lay down on the bed with you - A. They did not: I did not pull off my clothes; I awoke in the morning between three and four o'clock, the women were gone; my pocket-book was in my pocket, but the notes were gone; upon that I raised an alarm.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where was this house that you went to - A. No. 3, Nag's-head-court, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Upon your alarm, did Mr. King, the constable, come to you - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you see the prisoners - A. In the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them again - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the notes that you had lost - A. I did; I went before the justice, I there saw the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any note that you could swear to - A. Yes, the thirty-pound note, I wrote Blackit upon it.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you to go with a couple of women - A. I did not know who they were.</p>
               <p>COURT. You do not mean to be believed, because you cannot think the jury will believe you; if a man got into a scrape, he ought to tell the whole truth - who can believe that you did not know what these women were, and that you went there to lay down on the bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I only know him by making and mending my shoes. On the 26th of February, I went to my sister at Fulham; she asked me to bring a parcel for her; a tea caddie, a counterpane, a piece of linen cloth, and a silver watch, the watch I locked up in the cadie, and all which I left at the prisoner's room till I called for them; it was Sunday half past two o'clock in the afternoon I took them to his house, as I could not get into my master's premises, nor did I like to carry them about on a Sunday. On the 6th of March his wife came to me, said they had quarrelled and separated, and that the things were left at the landlord's house; he had a room there, No. 8, Silver street, Clerkenwell; and when I called they were locked up in the prisoner's room, the prisoner had the key; this was on Wednesday, the 8th; on the following morning, the landlord came down to me with the constable to inform me they had broken open the room, and they found the things had been taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your property - A. Yes; they were at the pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave the things from the 26th of February, till the 8th of March - A. I knew the prisoner very well; they were left there for my sister; he had always behaved very well, I do not want to hurt him.</p>

               <p>SARAH SAXBY. I am a widow; the prisoner was a neighbour of mine; I <rs id="t18090412-117-viclabel705" type="occupation">go out charing, and take in needle work</rs>

               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. She is a <rs id="t18090412-117-deflabel706" type="occupation">married woman</rs>

On the 6th of March she came into my room as a neighbour, it was about half past five o'clock; I took out a half-crown piece and eleven shillings and six-pence, she saw me take it out and put it in a housewife, and I put the housewife in a box; the box was not locked; afterwards she saw me put the money and housewife in the box; she bid me good evening. I went out for a quartern loaf; she left me, as I thought. When I came back I met the woman on the stairs; I had been gone about ten minutes. On my going up stairs I heard somebody running down very last; I said who is there; she made a stop, and did not answer; I put out my left hand, and felt her hand in her pocket; finding it was a woman, I said who is it, why not answer; she said Bailey. I asked her why she did not answer when I first spoke to her, she said that her husband and her had some words; I asked her why she did not come and stop in my room and not stop there. When I went into my room, she asked me if I would come down stairs and take a drop of something to drink; I told her no, I was obliged to to her, I did not want any thing; I was going up to my box to put some money in, but I had forgot some butter that I wanted; I came down and went for the butter, and when I went into my room, thinking to put the money in the box, the housewife, instead of being folded as I left it, it was unfolded, and eleven shillings and sixpence was taken out; there was only the half crown left; I said to my child who has been here, and what has become of my money.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the child - A. Eleven years old; - the prisoner is the only person that had been in my room that day.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see where she put it - A. Yes, she put it in the housewife in the box; Mrs. Bailey saw my mother put it in the housewife and put it in the box; Mrs. Bailey bid my mother good night; my mother went out for a quartern loaf, I laid across the foot of the bed because I had the head-ach; Mrs. Bailey came up again, and came in without knocking at the door; she asked me what I laid there for, I said I had the head-ach; she said that is a good girl, lay still; she took something out of the box, kept it in her hand two or three minutes, and then put it in again; I was getting up to look to see what it was; she said lay still; she went out; my mother came home, met her on the stairs, and asked who is there.</p>
               <p>EDWARD THREDWAY. I had a warrant to apprehend<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120065"/>the prisoner. I went to her house, she was not at home; the prisoner came down to the office in the evening.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About six months ago this woman lodged in my two pair front room; then she took a room opposite of my house; she came on Saturday, and asked me to lend her a guinea, to get a gown out of pledge; I could not lend it her. On Monday she said can you lend me your great coat and bonnet, for me to go and receive a pound note; I did; when she came in, she asked me to have something to drink; she came to me in the afternoon, she said it was very cold, and she had sent her little girl to the pawnbrokers with a pound note; I asked her whether she was not afraid of sending her little girl for fear of taking bad money; she replied, she should only have three shillings out of it; and she came in the evening very much intoxicated; she said, I am robbed, I said by whom, she said your daughter, then she said me; I went up to her room and asked the child if she saw me, the child did not answer, the mother answered yes; hearing the officers had been after me, I went up to the office, knowing myself innocent. Every time she is in the habit of taking the money, she always loses the money, she is so much in the habit of drinking.</p>

            . I was going down to Portsmouth to see my husband, with Mrs. Butler; we gave our bundle containing all the things mentioned in the indictment to Mrs. Thompson to carry. When we came to London Bridge. I left Mrs. Butler; I asked them to stop at the church, I went to buy a bottle, and when I came back, I did not see either of them. I went on the road, thinking I should overtake the waggon, thinking they had got in; I overtook the waggon, they said there was no such person in the waggon. I came home, I did not see the prisoner till I heard she was in Whitechapel watchhouse; I knew her a great many years, I never knew any harm of her. The shawl that was found on her neck, had every appearance of one I put into the bundle, but I cannot swear to it.</p>

After being served with what he wanted, he went out of the shop door. I followed him, and told him to come back, that he had some of Mr. Ward's property; he came back, and the legs were taken from him.</p>

On the 27th of February, about half past eight o'clock, I was going up my yard to look after the horses, on my return I went to shut the warehouse door it opens inwards, I put my left hand in, I caught hold of the prisoner, I said who is here, twice; the third time he said it is me; I said who is me; I caught hold of his collar, he had the parcel under his left arm; I brought him out of the door. The parcel was to go to Rumford; I called for assistance; my partner came to me; we secured him; I immediately put my name on the parcel.</p>

            . On the 12th of April, about three in the afternoon, both the prisoners came into our shop together, as if they were acquainted with each other; the man asked to see some silk handkerchiefs; I shewed them a great variety of patterns. After they had looked them over, they fixed upon one, which I cut off; in the mean time I saw the man prisoner put his hand underneath something on the counter and take out three silk handkerchiefs; I perceived him put them under his apron; this was while the woman engaged me in conversation; it was done in a very sly manner, he did not suspect that I saw him do it; I took no notice of it. The woman asked to see some calico; she bought half a yard of calico and paid sixpence for it; the man gave seven shillings for the silk handkerchief. Then I called my partner down; I whispered to him that this man had got some silk handkerchiefs; the prisoners were then in the shop. In consequence of that the prisoners suspected that I had discovered them stealing the handkerchiefs; he put his hand under his apron, and I saw him drop them on the floor; they both went out of the shop. Mr. Ingram immediately called the man back and desired him to stop, which he did, and the woman together came back.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the shop did he drop these handkerchiefs - A. Where they were buying the calico; that was as far from where the handkerchiefs were as from here to the window; ours is a very large shop, I charged him then with stealing the handkerchiefs; he denied it; at the same time I saw the handkerchiefs on the floor, which he had dropped. We set for a constable, and they were sent to Hatton Garden Office.</p>
               <p>- HAINES. I know nothing more than apprehending the prisoners. Going to Hatton Garden the prisoner was rescued from me; the court were sitting; we were obliged to go to Hick's-hall, and get Read to assist us.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Cassee's Defence. He served me half a yard of calico; I gave him a shilling and he gave me a sixpence. I came out, and I soon perceived a great many people about the door; I went back to see what was the matter, I went into the shop, that gentleman said I was in the shop likewise; he gave this man and me in charge of the constable; I never was in company with the man in my life.</p>
               <p>Brown said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>
               <p>Cassee called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

             - A. Yes; I saw him on the 4th of April, about one o'clock at noon, I was serving my customers with bread; I had a large basket on a wheelbarrow; I had occasion to go home to my master's shop for a crusty loaf; I left my basket. On my return I saw the prisoner with four quartern loaves, two under each arm; I pursued him and took him; I never lost sight of him; I brought him back to my basket, he threw two loaves down in the basket and two down in the dirt; I took him to the shop, he was sent to Marlborough-street; he was a stranger to me, only seeing him the week before taking two quartern loaves from Mr. Hardy's man; I am sure they are my master's bread.</p>
               <p>Q. Are four quartern loaves worth four shillings and eleven pence - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He never saw me take the loaves out of the barrow; it was not his bread at all.</p>

On the 22nd of March, soon after nine o'clock at night, I had a black velvet spencer pinned inside of my shop door to some calico; I believe a little after nine o'clock I had seen it safe; as I stood inside of my shop I heard the calico tear; there were three youths in Cranbourne-passage, I searched them all; I found the spencer under the prisoner's coat, I brought him back and sent for a constable. When I overtook them they had got three doors up the passage going into Newport-street.</p>

               <p>Q. In December last did you quit the service of Mr. Britten - A. Yes, on the 24th of December I left Mr. Britten, and on the 27th I went into Messrs. Hodson and Hager's service; they have a warehouse in Mark-lane, and another in Cooper's-row in the Minories.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Biggs, Kingsbury, and Laremouth work for Messrs. Hodson and Hager - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to work on the morning of the 31st of December did they either of them. or all of them, say anything to you - A. Yes, Biggs, Kingsbury and Laremouth told me that they could not and would not work with me, it would subject them to a guinea fine if they did, by a new rule of the society; and while they were talking about it Mr. Hodson came in; they said if I staid there they should leave the employ; this was on Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know from them what night the club met - A. They told me on the preceding night - Friday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you what had been done at the club - A. Nothing more than they could not work with me; they said if I staid they would leave the employ; if I would wait another week for the decision of the club, most likely the club would decide it favourably for me; then they told me they would issue summonses for the week following, for next Friday night.</p>
               <p>Q. You said while you were conversing with them, somebody came in - who was that - A. Mr. Hodson: He remonstrated with them on the impropriety of their conduct, and requested they would go to work; Mr. Hodson heard the particulars what they told me; Mr. Hodson asked them what court of justice would sanction their conduct; they said they did not know that that the law had any thing to do with it; Mr. Hodson then asked them if they were going to make laws of their own, or something to that purpose; they said no, they did not know that they were going to do that; then Mr. Hodson left them, requesting them to go to work.</p>
               <p>COURT. What did they say to that - A. They said they would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they assign any reason why they would not - A. They said a guinea was of consequence to them, they would not do it; then Mr. Shaw came after Mr. Hodson was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that they said that they would issue summonses for the club to meet the next Friday night - who was to do that - A. I suppose by the stewards; they said it should be done; they did not describe by what authority it should be done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You say Mr. Shaw, the foreman, came after Mr. Hodson was gone - A. Yes; he requested me to go to the mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that in the hearing of the three - A. I believe he did; they were in the same warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak in a voice that they were likely to hear - A. Yes, I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. However they were there - this was Saturday, the last day in the year - A. Yes; I went to the lord mayor on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did they say any thing to Shaw when he said that to you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You went to the mansion-house - A. Yes, on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the Monday go to the warehouse - A. Yes, on Monday the 2nd of January, I went to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the three again - that is Biggs, Kingsbury, and Laremouth - A. Yes, I did; I told them that I had been to the mansion house to seek for redress; one of the clerks at the mansion house told me that if I would bring witnesses that these men had resisted working with me, something good could be done for me.</p>
               <p>COURT. What reply did they make - A. They laughed it off with a joke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass at that time, or before the next Friday, respecting the club - A. I went to the warehouse two or three times; I saw them once or twice; I learnt from them that the business would be brought forward on Friday night at the society; they requested me, one and all, to attend the society on Friday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Then from Saturday, when you had quitted the warehouse, until the Friday that you went to the club, had you done any work at Mr. Hodson's warehouse - A. Not any; because there were other men in Mr. Hodson's employ who belonged to the society, they all declared they would leave if I continued in Mr. Hodson's employ.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard any of the other men make these declarations in the hearing of these defendants - A. Not any.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There were other members of the club working there, you understood also they would have left if you continued working there - A. Yes; Mr. Hodson did send me into his employ into Pickle Herring, over the water. That was on the 14th of January.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. You left on Saturday the 31st - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You now come down to Friday night, the 6th of January - on the 6th of January, in the evening, did you go to the Crown and Cushion - A. Yes; I went to the house the society is held at.</p>
               <p>Q. The house where the society meets - at Moorgate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there see either of the defendants - A. Yes; Biggs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to Biggs - A. Yes; after waiting in the tap-room about an hour. I went at eight o'clock; I was coming out of the house, I had not seen any of them; I met Biggs in the passage; I asked him if the society had discussed the business; he said no, not yet, they were going to proceed upon it directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where they were - A. No, he did not; they were in a room over my head; I believe he went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again in the course of that night - A. No; I waited there till eleven o'clock at night. On the next morning I called upon Biggs to know the determination of the society; he told me that the society had agreed to allow me seven shillings a day for my loss time, until the Friday following. I went to the warehouse, Cooper's-row, then I understood from Mr. Hampton that it was for a week only.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what could you have earned in that week that you were idle and out of work - A. I could have earned upon an average three pounds ten shillings, if I had been in Mr. Hodson's employ; I received two pounds for the week before; I had worked four days; that I received on the Saturday night when I left work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after that see either of the other men of the society - A. Yes; I went to Mr. Hodson's on the 14th of January and told them how the society had settled it; they said they could not work with me; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120071"/>told them Biggs told me if I did wait till next Friday night they would allow me seven shillings a day; on Saturday sennight after the 6th (the 14th) I went to Mr. Hodson's, Cooper's-row, I saw Biggs, Kingsbury, and Laremouth, the same three; I told them that Mr. Hodson had, sent me to work. - I must recal that if you please.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of them there when you went on the 14th - A. No, I do not believe I did. On the 8th of January I saw Biggs at my own house, the day after he told me about the seven shillings a day, he told me that Mr. Hodson had given him notice, and the other two defendants, to quit; but he should not have the week's notice, he should not go to work again.</p>
               <p>Q. Why - A. Because he found himself much hurt that Mr. Hodson should give him a week's notice on this account. On the Monday following, the 9th of January, I went to Mr. Hodson's house and told him these three men had left.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that conversation did you see either of the defendants again - A. No. He desired me to go to Cooper's-row to work on the 9th of January; Mr. Shaw, the foreman, said it would turn the house into confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of the defendants there at the time - A. Not either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact Mr. Shaw did not admit you to work - A. No; he said it would throw the house into confusion again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Were there at that time other members of the packer's club present when Mr. Shaw spoke - A. There were two or three, I am not certain which.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. You quitted on Saturday, the 31st of December - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Before any meeting of the club had taken place upon this business - A. There had been some meeting before that.</p>
               <p>Q. These defendants told you something had passed, and that they hoped it would be got over in another week - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you was discharged from Mr. Hodson's employ - A. The 31st of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Who discharged you on the 31st of December - A. I believe I may say Mr. Shaw.</p>
               <p>Q. He paid you when he discharged you - A. No; it was not the usual custom to pay before the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You were paid in the evening and then you were fully discharged - A. Indeed I was discharged in the morning, because these men would not work with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you go to work for him, or do any work any where - A. On the 14th of January; Mr. Hodson said he would try me a second time.</p>
               <p>Q. These defendants were not there - I do not want to know what passed between you and him - have you continued working for him since then - A. No; I went to work on Saturday the 14th and quitted on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you have not worked for Mr. Hodson since - A. No; I went to work for Mr. Britten on the 16th.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you work for between the 31st of December and the 14th of January - A. If I may call it work, I was at work for Mr. Britten.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost a fortnight's employ, and for the three first days you were working for Mr. Hodson - there was no dispute about your working - A. Yes, there was; there had been some alteration before.</p>
               <p>Q. You went working on till the morning of the 31st - A. Yes; I worked at Mark-lane one day; they carry on the same business at both; there was members of this benefit club there. On the 31st of December I was working at Mr. Hodson's, Cooper's-row, with Pearce, he worked with me at both places; I did not work with either of the defendants.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You say that for three or four days that you had been at work for Mr. Hodson, there were alterations - A. Yes, they said they had; it would turn out favourable to me; they said I was not a packer, whereas, it may be said, two thirds of the society had worked with me at packing; the objection was made because I had not served my time to a packer only; because Mr. Britten was a packer and presser.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say on the morning of the 31st of December, you considered Mr. Shaw as discharging you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been suffered, was it not your intention to come to work on the Monday morning following - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to believe they should not have continued you in their service - A. No other than it was of consequence to him, so many in his house, that they should all leave his work on my account.</p>

            . You are a packer, in Mark-lane - A. Yes, my partner's name is Hager, in Cooper's-row.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the defendants - A. Three of them I do; Kingsbury, Biggs, and Laremouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in your service in December last - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing take place with these men; on the 31st of December - A. On that morning I was going from my house, in Crutched Friers; on my journey there; I met Mr. Shaw, my foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you did in consequence of what Mr. Shaw communicated to you - A. I went on to Cooper's-row, and heard what these men had to say; they all three alternately spoke in turns; Biggs was the chief spokesman; they told me they had a law in their society, which prevented them from working with Barret, they were liable if they did to the forfeit of a guinea; and if they repeated it again, they were liable to be expunged from the society.</p>
               <p>COURT. Does that society still exist - A. I believe it does; I told them not only that they were acting imprudently, but unjustly, and in a way that the law would take cognizance of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where this house is that they meet at - it is very proper that the house should be noticed by the magistrate - A. They said there was such a law in existence, and they must abide by it; I further remonstrated with them, and wished them coolly to reconsider the matter fairly over, and told them they were wrong; I believe their answer was exactly the same; I believe I further added, they would see if they considered it fairly, that it had the effect of a direct combination and conspiracy again this individual, to starve him to death; they seemed to be totally inattentive to any thing said, and continued to alledge that he was not a packer, that he served his time to Mr. Britten, who was not a packer by trade, but a presser; I made answer, that I had worked myself with Mr. Britten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120072"/>thirty years ago at the packing business.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this remonstrance of your's, meeting with no attention from them, what did you do - A. I was compelled, under the necessity of the case, and if the fact had been ten times worse I must have submitted; I was compelled to discharge him, I desired Mr. Shaw, the foreman, to do it; I said if you persist I will discharge him, but mind, you compel me to it, I shall not do it of my own will. I did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Through their compulsion Barret was discharged on Saturday - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time after employ Barret - A. I did; although I did not consider myself in a situation to employ him in the packing business in the city of London, yet as we had some hops to press down for the merchants; I said he would do this surely, without giving offence, in the county of Surry; he was there a day or two, he did what there was to do in a day; there was nothing said to him that applies to these men; there was by others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him to work on the 9th of January - A. I should have observed that our foreman is at liberty to take in men and discharge men without our knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have discharged Barret without you had been desired by the men - A. No, I should not, most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. What day was it you discharged the defendants, these three men - A. Whether it was that Saturday sen'night, or that Saturday fortnight, I cannot tell; it was not the fortnight; I said I would give them a week's notice.</p>
               <p>COURT. How many men had you working with you, members of this club - A. I think we had five or six others, besides these three.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that makes eight or nine men who were members of this club - how many men were there in your employ at the time - A. There were these three that I have named, six, and five others; those five are out of the question.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that you should have lost these six men if Barret had continued there - A. I did; they saying that we must leave; I believe I may add that it was by compulsion, thy must leave.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you would have lost nine men out of the fourteen if you had not discharged Barret - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any thing in the conduct of Barret that made you wish to discharge him, or would you have continued him if they had not done this - A. I was entirely satisfied with him; I should not have discharged him only on this account.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember while he was working there any objection being made to his working - A. Yes; the objection was made because he was not deemed a packer by the society, called the society of packers.</p>

               <p>Q. And you said just now you believed Smith was a steward, and he was there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Why do you believe that Smith was a steward - A. Because I have heard it mentioned since by one of the trade, I do not know who.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard it mentioned by either of the defendants that are here, or in their presence - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the stewards keep the books - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How are these books kept by the society - A. The accounts of the society are kept in a book, and a book for the articles; the books are kept in a box.</p>
               <p>Q. How many keys are there to that box - A. I believe three.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the keepers of the three keys - A. The three stewards; the society has three stewards, who have each a key of the box, containing the books.</p>

               <p>Q. Who stated the question - A. One of the stewards.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether Barret was a packer, and should be allowed to work; you do not remember which of the stewards said this - A. No; all the three stewards were there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many spoke before the ballot was taken - A. I believe four or five; I am not clear of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Biggs speak - A. I believe not. I do not remember Laremouth being there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Slade speak - A. He did, I believe; he rather<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120073"/>approved of his continuing working.</p>

               <p>Q. Who took the ballot - A. One of the stewards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember which of them - A. I am not positive whether it was one of the stewards or not; it is the custom of the society for the stewards to take the ballot - the ballot was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the result of the ballot - A. A majority against Mr. Barret to work; I think the number 31 against him, and I think 10 for him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you had forty-one journeymen meeting for this purpose -</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Shaw, remember you are upon your oath - I know I am upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Have you heard what are the sums in the funds - A. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no belief on the subject, have you - A. I do not know - it may be six or seven hundred pounds; I cannot tell; it is only speaking at random.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. I believe you are foreman to Messrs. Hodson and Hager - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The society does not consist of journey men only, but some masters, and some foremen, and some journeymen - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the steward an office that is taken in turn - A. Yes, taken in rotation, they must fine or serve; they change every quarter.</p>
               <p>COURT. How do you know that they change every quarter - is that one of the rules of the society that is in writing - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. Has it been the rule and practice ever since you have been a member of the society, to change stewards every quarter day - A. It has; and to relieve sick members, and to bury their wives.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the business the stewards are to superintend - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when these men made any objection to Barret, and in consequence thereof he was discharged - A. I do not recollect discharging of Barret at all; I think he went away of his own accord, at Mr. Kingsbury and others saying that it would be settled in the society.</p>
               <p>Q. You think he took himself away, and went to work at his business of a hot-presser - A. I do not recollect who discharged him, but he went away from us to work at Mr. Britten's, I believe. I heard that after he had been to work at Mr. Britten's.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us that you were at the ballot - A. Yes; I was only at one meeting; I should not have gone then, only at the request of Mr. Hodson and the young fellow, it was by their desire.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 14th of February this man came to work again - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the day after the ballot he came to work a single day - A. He came to work after the ballot, but I cannot remember the day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I understood you to say that Slade spoke in favour of this man's continuing at work - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. He is one of the parties that is indicted for keeping this young man from his work - you do not know the fact that Smith was a steward - A. I do not speak positive, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that neither Smith or Paxton at this moment are stewards - A. They are not stewards at present, because they serve only a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not stewards last week, of course, because they only serve quarterly - you of your own knowledge do not know that ever they were stewards - A. No, except Slade.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are all these defendants members of this society - A. I have no doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You went to the meeting where the ballot was, at the desire of Mr. Hodson and Hager, to make observations - A. I went there by their desire, but it was never said to make observations; I went there to hear what they had to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect a little now what they had to say - A. What I say is a fact.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the practice of the society with respect to any of its members that work with a presser that is no packer - A. They are to pay the fine of a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. And if he works a second time what is the practice - A. I think an erasure.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it - A. No, not in my own mind.</p>

I can tell by myself: the first offence was a fine of a guinea, and the second time an erasure - he was expunged from the society. I was a member of the society, and employed a person of the name of Wilson; this person was six or seven years in my service, and had been a foreman over these men, but when I removed into Suffolk-lane, they had a ballot on it and fined me a guinea; they wrote to me that I was fined a guinea for employing Mr. Wilson. I paid my quarter-age. This was somewhere about July or August last.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen upon your not paying that fine - A. They expunged me; and to this hour, no man of the society can work for me.</p>

            . Q. You are a journeyman packer, are you not - A. Yes; I have worked for Messrs. Hodson and Hager seven or eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the Crown and Cushion when the ballot was held respecting Barret - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the stewards at that time - A. I do not know the stewards; Mr. Slade was one; I believe Mr. Smith was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of it - A. I think there is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Paxton one - A. To the best of my knowledge, but I will not be positive; I do not recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120074"/>seeing him in the room that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. He might be a steward without being in the room - A. Not having looked at the books, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the steward now, and has the custody now - A. I cannot say - the stewards were changed at Lady-day.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubts that Biggs is one of the stewards now - A. I have not; I think there is no doubt of that, Mr. Biggs is one. I cannot answer to the other men.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You were present at the ballot, were not you - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Kingsbury, or Laremouth there - A. I cannot say, I do not recollect seeing them; I was there one night when the subject was discussed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Laremouth a steward now - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is 
               <persName id="t18090412-134-person1150">Paxton</persName>
             a steward or not - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the question that was discussed - A. About Barret; there was a difference of opinion about Mr. Barret; some looked upon him as a packer, others as a presser - whether he was to be continued as a packer or a presser that was the question, and if he was to be continued as a presser, then he was not a packer; it went to a ballot - thirty against him and ten for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the resolution - A. He was not a packer.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the three stewards present at the meeting of the ballot - A. I answered that question - I doubt of Paxton being present.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of Smith and Slade being present - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was 
               <persName id="t18090412-134-person1151">Paxton</persName>
             a steward when the ballot was taken - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was to be done with Barret after the resolution, that he was not a packer - A. There were different opinions about it; it was nothing to me what others do.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he allowed to work as a packer - A. He was not, as I understood it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. Was every thing done by the society by a ballot - A. Every thing that arose to a dispute, be it what it will.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no contrivance of ballot upon this subject, but every thing of all kind was settled by a ballot - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Then I understand you to say that Paxton was not there - do I understand you right - A. I cannot undertake to say I saw him there; I noticed Mr. Slade more than any of the rest, because he was of Mr. Barret's side.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to Smith, you do not undertake to say he was there - A. Smith and Slade were present.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not mean to be positive that Smith was there - A. I believe so; when a thing is doubtful I put my believe to it; I think he was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Have you any doubt that there were two stewards present - A. It remains rather a doubt in my mind, because I cannot answer it upon oath.</p>

            . Q. You are a packer - - A. Yes; I worked for Mr. Hodson seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Barret working for him - A. I do; he left on the 31st of December last.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know why he went away - A. Of his own pleasure, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Hodson talking to him that day - A. Not particular to him; I saw him talking to Biggs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Biggs, Laremouth and Kingsbury work for Mr. Hodson at that time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own knowledge about Barret's going away - A. He was told by Biggs that it would be settled the next meeting in his favour, and went away on that account.</p>
               <p>Q. What was meant by being settled in his favour - A. That he would be continued a packer by the society.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had made any objection against Barret not being a packer - A. Some persons in the society; he had served his time to Mr. Britten, who was not considered a regular master packer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear Biggs, Kingsbury, or Laremouth, make any objection to him - A. No further. than there was a fine if they worked with him, or any person who was not considered a packer.</p>

            Were you there both nights when Barret's case was taken into consideration - A. I was there the first evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were your stewards, were they there at that time - A. There were three; I do not know all of their names; Slade was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Smith one - A. I believe he was one; I have some doubt, because I have not the pleasure of knowing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was 
               <persName id="t18090412-134-person1154">Paxton</persName>
             a steward - A. I believe he was; I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these three stewards was present at the first evening of the debate - was the ballot the first night or the second - A. The second night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Paxton there the first night - A. I do not know whether he was there or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Smith there - A. I believe he was; Slade was there, and Biggs; I do not think that Laremouth I think was there; Kingsbury was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the debate of the first night - A. No particular debate; some said he was a packer, and others said he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. The society met again, did they not, upon Barret's business - A. Yes, they balloted; then the question was, whether he was to be continued a packer or a presser; he was thrown out, he was not considered as a packer, the number was about thirty against him, and nine or ten for him; then he was not continued a packer.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that affect Barret - A. That he must work at the pressing and not at the packing, and if any man worked with him at the packing they fined him a guinea, and excluded him the second time; I believe there was only one instance of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. You worked for Messrs. Hodson and Hager at the time the other men did - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the question originated with the society - A. It originated with individuals; some person called for a ballot; I cannot tell who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that you heard Biggs and Barret talking together - tell us what conversation passed between them - A. I heard Biggs and Kingsbury say that in all probability it would be finally settled in his favour, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120075"/>he would be considered as a packer.</p>
               <p>Q. I would now ask you whether he went away upon that intimation, or was he turned away - A. He went away upon that intimation.</p>

               <p>Q. You say this man went away of his own accord - A. Yes; he went away without stopping to be dismissed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you heard what Mr. Hodson has said - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you all paid on Saturday night as well as this man - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Marriot. Had Kingsbury, Laremouth, and Biggs been discharged from Mr. Hodson's service - A. They were discharged the following Saturday night that Barret left; Barret went on the 31st, and they were discharged on the 7th; the ballot was held on the 6th; I believe it was finally decided on the 6th.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it decided the first meeting or the second meeting after Barret quitted - A. I cannot tell that; I went on the first club night.</p>
               <p>COURT. You said they told him that in all probability it would be finally settled in his favour, on the next Friday - do these questions usually take place whether a man shall work or not - A. I never knew such a question take place before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I do not understand you to speak to any of these three men, who were stewards, being present, excepting Slade; with respect to Smith you say you cannot be positively - A. No; I cannot undertake to say he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. And with respect to Paxton you do not know him, and therefore you cannot undertake to say whether he was there or no - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You say that Barret went away of his own accord - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that he went away of his own accord - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard what Mr. Hodson has stated - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when Mr. Hodson had an occasion of remonstrating with these men - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Upon the oath you have taken do you believe that Mr. Hodson dare to employ them after this - A. I think he might have run the risk of these men paying the fine.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to have it understood that you could believe that the workmen would have gone on with paying the fine of a guinea, and the second time they would have been excluded - do not you know that - A. I know it now.</p>

               <p>THOMAS COWPER. I am a journeyman packer; I work for Mr. Hodson. The reason for Mr. Barret leaving us was because the club had not settled in his favour, whether he was a legal person to work as a packer; if a packer works with a person that is not legal they will be fined a guinea. I have not been to the club since that fine has been made; I never knew any one fined excepting in Mr. Eastman's case; it is a modern rule.</p>

On the 6th of March, in the fore part of the day, the prisoner came to our shop for a pennyworth of candied horehound, I gave it her; she gave me a six-pence, I shewed it to Mr. Fletcher, he kept the six-pence, and I gave her the change, and she went away. On the 8th of March she came again; she asked for a pennyworth of Spanish juice, I gave it her, she gave me sixpence, I gave her the change; I put the six-pence in the upper part of the till, where there was not any other money. Mr. Fletcher has the six-pence, I saw him take it. On the 14th of March she came again, and asked for half an ounce of cream of tartar, that came to two-pence; she gave me another six-pence, I took it to Mr. Fletcher, he nipped it with a pair of scissars; and there I saw the copper; he came and told the woman this was a bad six-pence, she must know of it, he had given her warning. I went for a constable.</p>
               <p>COURT. The three six-pences were given to Mr. Fletcher by you - A. Yes.</p>

             a six-pence, he gave it me; that sixpence I put into a box by itself. On the 8th the prisoner came again for a pennyworth of Spanish juice; she offered another six-pence; I looked at it; I compared them together, I thought they were both of one stamp. On the 14th the prisoner came again for half an ounce of cream of tartar; she offered another six-pence; I cut it with the scissars, I saw it was a bad one; I told her she must be aware of it being a bad six-pence, for I had told her that the first she offered was a bad sixpence.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you to take them - did you know it to be a bad one on the 8th - A. Yes; I meaned then to have her taken up, but having no person in the shop, I could not. When she came on the 14th, then I was certain that she was an utterer of bad money; then I had her taken up. I have kept the sixpences ever since; these are the six-pences.</p>

               <p>JOHN DYER. I live at East-Ham in Essex, I live on my means. On the 2nd of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was walking up Fish-street-hill; I felt something against my thigh, presently afterwards I felt something pulling at my coat; I turned suddenly round and caught the prisoner's hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing in your pocket - A. A silk handkerchief; it was dark; he slipped down, and snatched his hand away from me; I caught him by the collar and challenged him with attempting to pick my pocket; he said he had not, and he hit me on the bosom; I hit him, and he ran away from me; I ran after him and knocked him down three times; he then begged for mercy, and said he would never do the like again if I would let him go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming over London-bridge, coming into Gracechurch-street my foot slipped of the curb-stone; I fell against this gentleman, he struck me three or four times; I strove to get out of the way.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, I live near Mr. Moon. On Tuesday the 4th of April, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner was holding his coat of one side to prevent any body from seeing, and one of his hands was inside of a pane of glass in Mr. Moon's window; he was looking to see if any body observed him; the window was broken, and a piece of glass out; I was at that time speaking to Mr. Lloyd, I said, Mr. Lloyd look at that man; he saw us, and ran off; I pursued him, he ran up a court, where there was no thoroughfare, and got over a wall into Furnival's-inn-court; he ran up a one pair of stairs, and there he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was apprehended were you quite certain that he was the person that had his hand in Mr. Moon's window - A. I am; we took him back to Mr. Moon's shop; I observed the glass out, the putty had been cut away and the glass starred by a knife.</p>

            . I was in conversation with Mr. Obee, near this shop. Mr. Obee drew my attention, I observed the prisoner had a great coat on; he was standing at the corner of the window, he held the flap of his coat up; I saw him put his hand in the window and I saw him take it out; I supposed he was alarmed at seeing me look at him; he ran off; I pursued him, I never lost night him, till I saw him in the garden; I ran round to go into the inn, and then I saw him in custody; I said this is the man that put his hand in Mr. Moon's window; I am positive it is the same man.</p>

            . I am an officer, the prisoner was delivered over to me at Mr. Moon's. I saw the widow something had been done at the bottom with a knife, and the glass broke out. I handcuffed him; he was rather desperate; I saw the prisoner rubbing his knee against the other ham; I immediately caught hold, and said what is here; it turned out to be a gold ring and a penknife, they were under the ham. The ring has been claimed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from home, going into the city to look for a job; going by the shop, I had the curiosity to look at it; I had got my hand against the shop window; some persons coming by knocked my elbow, my hand broke the glass; I run a- away for fear they should make me pay for the glass, as I had no more money about me; having been out of work twelve weeks.</p>

On the 17th of February I left my house about a quarter before six; at the time I got into Lawrence-lane the day light was gone. As I turned up Lawrence-lane, I noticed the two prisoners, and four more, in the act, as I considered them, to rob the warehouse of the prosecutors. Nightingale was at the window, and particularly active; and Lawrence was watching at the door; I stood opposite about eight minutes; I could see them from the reflection of the light within. It was evident they were attempting to make an entry. Nightingale was trying to make a hole in the shutter; I afterwards found a hole there, and the pin out. I saw them active; and from their motions, I concluded the job was done. I went over to Mr. Hixon, he and I went towards the warehouse; at the very instant as we came out of door, we walked towards the prosecutor's. Lawrence left the door of the prosecutor's and walked over the away; and when I had come to the door, a clerk of the house had opened the door; I said to him, are you robbed; I pointed out the prisoner Lawrence, I said that is one, we both collared him. I told the clerk to hold fast, as I saw there was going to be a rescue attempted. Three of them from the corner of Cateaton-street were coming up in a menacing posture, I let go Lawrence to take hold of Nightingale, he was one of the three that came; he put himself in a position for fighting, I said you are one, I will have you; he went by me to rescue Lawrence, he struck the witness who had hold of Lawrence, I closed with him; in the scuffle he fell, and I rather went over him; another of the party came up to rescue Nightingale; I then said I would have them both; the short one ran up Castle-court; I followed Nightingale into King-street, there I lost sight of him; he was brought back in four or five minutes to the warehouse. I have not the least doubt that he was the man that I had the conflict with. Lawrence never escaped at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When Nightingale came back did you examine the state of his clothes - A. Before I looked I said his knee is dirty, as a corresponding proof of it. I am positive he is the man without that circumstance; I have seen his face before many times; and I am positive that Lawrence is the man that watched the door; when I went into the warehouse I found the window open, and I saw it open in the street. They had made a hole in the window frame; the pin had fell on the counter.</p>
               <p>MR. HARKER. Q. You are clerk to the prosecutor's - A. I am, On the evening spoken of I heard an unusual noise at the window; at first I thought it was our private door; I sent my friend first, and then I came to the door, Mr. Hinckesman pointed out Lawrence to me, I went over and collared him, and brought him into the warehouse; he was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. What species of goods were in the window that might be taken away -

               <p>The case was stated by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TUFFIN. Q. You are an apprentice to Mr. Self, the plaintiff - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two letters - did you receive them from the postman - A. Yes, on the 28th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. The post-mark is the 28th of November, four o'clock; they are both marked the same way - at the time you took them were they both sealed - A. No; the one with parchment in it was sealed, the other was unsealed; I did not take them in my own hand, my mistress took them in; I saw it; I was in the shop at the same time; my master took one out of her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her read it - A. I did not; she went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. They were both put in the same post office.</p>
               <p>MR. SELF. I am a sign-painter, No. 60, Sun-street, Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect on the 28th of November last receiving these two letters in question from the postman - A. My spouse received them of the postman, and while she was paying the postman the four-pence I took one out of her hand, which was sealed and had an inclosure in it. She took the other into the parlour with her; she is near sighted, she could not read the whole, she could make out a few words; I opened one, and when I saw this inclosed I immediately went in; there was no writing on it, but only the inclosed; it contained a little slip of paper, I believe the words Michaelmas term upon it, with the Exchequer process; I read part, I did not read the whole; I went into the parlour and took the other letter out of her hand, and read it.</p>
               <p>Q. That letter produced to you to day is the same letter - A. The very same.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that process and see whether that is the same - A. It is the same inclosure as when I received it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now is this the other letter - A. It is the other letter.</p>
               <p>[The Court was of opinion there was no occasion for reading the letter containing the libel, the whole of it being very vulgar and indecent, and written by some bad man, the jury should have an opportunity of looking at it themselves.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This little slip of paper contains on it, Exchequer, Michaelmas term - you have seen the letter, and you have seen the writing on it, are you able to say from what you have seen of the defendant's hand writing, that that is his hand writing - A. I believed it directly I perused it - I mean the libel, and the superscription on the other.</p>
               <p>COURT. You believe both to be the hand writing of the defendant - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley to jury. Gentlemen, if you put the quarters of the sheet of paper together - the two letters together - you find they form one whole half sheet one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120078"/>has been torn from the other - A. JURY. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to plaintiff. Do you remember the day he was taken in custody - A. It was on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it you received this - A. I cannot say whether it was the Saturday following, or that Saturday week that he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where was he taken in custody - A. In London, and as he was coming into this court to plead or to find bail, he said I was a false swearing villain I wanted to seek for his life, but he would do for me some way or other, if he got clear of this; they were the very words.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I suppose there were some officer in the coach - A. There were two.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a large family of children, I understood by my learned friend - A. I have none, but my apprentice and servant.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 27th of December had you any conversation with the defendant on this subject - A. I had; I saw Mr. Sherman at Sadler's repository, Goswell-street; I remonstrated with him on his conduct to Mr. Self; I asked him how he could send such an infamous writing to Mr. Self; he said he knew nothing about it. I told him that he had been discovered, for the Exchequer process had been served upon him; he then said that it was through Mr. Self, the defendant, that it was served upon him, that Self was a perjured scoundrel, he would swear any thing; this was previous to the indictment being prefered.</p>
