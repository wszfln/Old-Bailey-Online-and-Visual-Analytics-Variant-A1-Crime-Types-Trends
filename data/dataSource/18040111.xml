Liptraps, and might have gone that way to Houndsditch; they went on a few yards, and were knocking at a little brazier's shop, kept by one Newberry I think the name is; I observed each of them had something heavy wrapped up under their arms; I asked them what they had got there; they said, what was that to me; I told them I was an officer, and insisted upon seeing what they had; I immediately laid hold of them both; there is a public-house next door, I endeavoured to get them to the public-house, when the tall one, Davis, rescued himself from me, and got away, throwing down this solder, which weighs 26 lb. (produces it); I called out, stop thief! and he was brought back in a minute or two; I kept the other in custody in the public-house; he had this piece of solder wrapped up in his working jacket; this weighs 25 lb. (produces it); the largest piece, when I picked it up, was warm; they said they had been at work for Mr. Liptrap; Norman was very much frightened; I went the next day to Mr. Liptrap's, and found two ladles that correspond with the solder. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. They both told you where they had been at work? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And told you who their masters were? - A. Yes, at the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Oakes.) If these men had brought home the solder to your house, you would have weighed it, and accounted for it to Mess. Liptrap's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Davis's defence. I had not worked at Mr. Liptrap's for six years before, and I did not know the custom; I have taken it home to my master from other places.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Norman called four, and Davis five witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

I then went to Old-street-square, where the prisoner worked; I went into the work-shop where he was at work, and informed him I wanted him to come to see his master that he had just left; he asked me what it was about; I told him his master was below, and would inform him; when we came out of the house, Mr. Smith was in the square, and he said let me go and speak to my master; I told him it was a charge of felony, and he must go before the Magistrate; he placed his back against the wall, and swore he would not, and forced himself from us, but we caught him again.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 8, Silk-street, Cripplegate; the prisoner lodged in my house, he slept with another young man, he had part of a bed; I shewed the officer the room and the box belonging to the prisoner; it was my box, which my wife lent him; the other young man was a shopman in the jewellery line; I had known him some years, he had lodged with me near a twelve-month, and a very respectable character he is; the prisoner had lodged with me five weeks, he kept very regular hours, but I can swear to his bringing this hammer into my house.</p>
               <p>Smith. This is my hammer, and the other articles are mine.</p>
               <p>Jones. I never saw any thing but what was very honest in him.</p>


               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Smith was very badly off for tools, and I took my own tools, and his apprentices worked with them as well as myself; Mr. Smith and I had a dispute about the sort of work he gave me to do, and I left him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

                        targets="t18040111-22-off136 t18040111-22-crimeloc138"/>? - A. Yes, and in April last I employed Mess. Wild to bottle off three pipes of port for me; the prisoners came to do it; they had been at my house before; I saw them at work bottling the wine in my cellar; I asked them to be careful in taking away all the ullage, or thick part, into bottles; they said they had, and in order to draw off the wine clearer, they turned the pipe edgeways; they pointed out thirteen bottles, in which they said they had put the ullage of the three pipes; I saw Miller particularly officious, and thought it was occasioned by drinking too much wine; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110013"/>pipes were taken out of the cellar before me, and Miller locked the door, and brought me the keys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. You gave no particular directions as to the manner the wine was to be drawn off? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When the men went away, did they give you the quantity of wine in the binns? - A. They marked it with chalk on the binns.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since that time had an opportunity of examining those binns? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found the quantity correspond with the numbers? - A. With twenty-two broken bottles found in the middle of the binns, it corresponds with the number; the twenty-two broken bottles might be accident.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How much did you find in the binns? - A. One hundred and fifty-one dozen and nine bottles, including the twenty-two broken ones.</p>

             sworn. - I live in Halfmoon-street, Bishopsgate-street, opposite Miller's: On Saturday the 30th of April, I was cleaning my windows, and saw Sellwood bring a cart to Miller's house, with two or three pipes in it; I saw the name of Wild on the cart; the cart came in a hurry to the door, and at a single knock the door was opened in a moment; they were all in confusion; one of the pipes was removed a little way by the cops of the cart, and a thing with a cock was put into the bung-hole; two pails lined with copper were then brought; Miller filled the first; they were all assisting as fast as they could; Pugh took in the second in a hurry, and Miller scolded his wife, upon which a pan was brought to the door in the passage, and a pail emptied into it, while Pugh was drawing another; a knock was made at my door, and I was obliged to go down, but I think I saw four pails drawn full, but I will not speak to more than I know; as soon as it was over the things were hurried into the cart, and it drove off as fast as possible. Sometime after my husband sent information to Mr. Wild, as I had seen the cart there several times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. How long have you lived opposite Miller? - A. About four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always go by the name of Parish? - A. No; our real name is Parish; my husband's mother sent to him to inform him that he was by a former husband, and his name was Parish.</p>
               <p>Q. You went before the Lord Mayor in December? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And this took place in April? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - A. For a particular reason, which I suppose I am not obliged to state.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you write? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might the cart stand from the door? - A. There is a corner, and our house is in a nook; but the horses heads were towards Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there two or three pipes in the cart? - A. There were three no doubt, but I will not be positive.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not, in giving an account of some former transaction, stated there were only two? - A. Not to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said there were only two? - A. I was not positive to be on my oath that there were three, but I think there were.</p>

               <p>Q. You have a great number of fronts in your warehouse of the same colour? - A. Yes, but not of the same make; this is of a peculiar make, and I should be able to distinguish it from any other; we never made one in that way before.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was it not the prisoner's duty to assist about the Portsmouth mail-coach? - A. It was his place to push the coach out after it was unloaded; he had no concern in unloading the coach.</p>
               <p>- BROWN sworn. - I am clerk to Messrs. Mastermans, bankers, in White-Hart-court, Lombard-street; I believe the prisoner is the person I changed ten Portsmouth notes for on the 24th of November, they were payable at our house; nobody was with him; I paid him ten ten-pound Bank of England notes, No. 2706, dated 4th of October; No. 7923, 11th of July; No. 3882, 17th of September; No. 8285, 12th of October; No. 5657, 5th of October; No. 3149, 9th of November; No. 6907, 15th of November; No. 9131, 20th of July; No. 5089, 11th of July; and No. 8485, 11th of November; for ten Portsmouth notes; I saw the prisoner afterwards at Bow-street, and believe him to be the man; I took notice of him, because on the same day a woman came with ten Portsmouth notes, and was asked what others she would have in exchange; she said, it was a matter of indifference; the clerk gave her one hundred notes, of one pound each, and desired her to count them, which she declined, although he pressed her to do it; she said, she dared to say they were all right; she went out, and no other person came in till the prisoner, about five minutes after, and tendered me ten of the Portsmouth Banknotes of ten pounds each; I thought it extraordinary that two persons should come to close together, having the same quantity of Portsmouth Banknotes; I asked him what notes he would have; he said, it was immaterial; I gave him ten ten-pounds.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110020"/>From the vast number of notes we pay, we do not take person's names; it frequently occurs that sailors have a quantity of those notes, and I thought it possible the prisoner might be one, and I did not ask him his name. About half an hour afterwards, a gentleman came in, and asked me if I knew that a parcel containing Portsmouth Bank-notes had been lost; I said, no. In the course of the morning, Mr. Burrage came to stop them, and I told him I had paid ten of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The man coming with ten notes so immediately after the woman excited your attention? - A. Yes, it did very particularly.</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 20th. I set off about a quarter before four o'clock; I followed the tail of the waggon, till I got off the stones, with a candle in my hand; I then got into the waggon, with the candle alight open in my hand; I rode on to the Peacock, I believe the sign is, between the Angel and the weigh-bridge. I am sure the box was there then; being very dark, I wished the man that goes with me, to stand at the door while I had my purl; then we went on till we came to the weigh-bridge, I did not get into the waggon again; when I got there, the candle blew out; I went in where the man stands at the gate, and lit it again, the waggon might stop there about a minute; when I got over the stones at Islington, I missed the box; I went back, and met the patrols, who told me, they had got the box, and the man; I am sure the box was there when the waggon stopped at the weigh-bridge; I found the box at the watch-house, and the prisoner in custody; they asked me if I knew the box; I told them, yes; the sheet of the waggon was cut about half a yard in length, and three or four strings that tied it down were cut.</p>

             one of those constables? - A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to any public-house there? - A. Yes, I first went to the Cock and Bell public-house with Coltman and a number of other constables; when I went in, I saw Corneilly taking a pint of beer from the bar; though I knew him, I thought it was not proper to take him when he was only in the act of taking a pint of beer; there were several loose idle characters, some of whom I took into custody, and others I took the neighbours' bail, and the publican's bail, for their appearance; I sent Coltman and four other officers to the watch-house in Old-street with five prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those five persons of the description of idle and disorderly? - A. Yes, they were so deemed at the Mansion-house the next morning; with the remainder of the officers I then proceeded to the Oxford Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the Cock and Bell? - A. It is in the same street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner, Corneilly, after you saw him at the Cock and Bell? - A. Not till he was taken, to the best of my knowledge, at the Oxford Arms; I saw Newman and several other characters that I knew to be reputed thieves, in a box in the tap-room; I saw Draper there, but I am not positive that I saw Taylor there; I am positive I saw Draper there, I had conversation with him. As I went by Newman, I heard him say d - n Bridgman, d - n the high-constable, which I took no notice of at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time had there been any disturbance? - A. No, not a word said; I passed on, and examined who and what the company were till I came up to Draper; the whole of the people in the house were very quiet, and Draper and I had some quiet conversation together; he told me I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110026"/>knew his father, and many other expressions, it was quite a peaceable conversation; I told him as I was come to execute a warrant, I could not be partial at this time; I heard Newman crying aloud with bitter oaths against me by name and by office, repeatedly, very loud, and I turned round, and said, Jack, hold your tongue, or I will order you in custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Give us the expression he used? - A. Words to this effect: d - n Bridgman, bl - st Bridgman, d - n the high-constable, d - n all his bl - y traps, and several such like expressions, repeatedly, and d - n his bl - y liver was used several times indeed, that seemed to be the principal word among them; upon saying I would order him in custody, Newman rushed out of the box with great fury, as if he was going to commit some violence upon me, putting himself in a posture as if he was going to strike me, and used the same words again, d - ning and bl - sting in the same manner; he then turned round to the box where Draper was and several more of the same description, and said, you are all a set of bl - y fools to suffer yourselves to be taken; he then said, I would die first, or you ought to die first, I cannot positively say which; a confusion immediately took place; the house was upon that all up in a riot, some upon boxes, some one way, and some another; they began immediately to push about the officers, and broke away; I seized hold of Draper; his coat tore, and he got away from me at that time; he then ran up the side of a table in one of the public-house boxes; he then pulled something out of his pocket, which I have no doubt was a knife.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see it? - A. He said, I will cut your bl - y liver out, and turned it over and over again, like a confused man; another officer struck him over the arm, and whether it was from being numbed or confused I cannot say, but he seemed so confused he could not get the knife open; I never saw the knife open; he rushed out of the box at me with the knife shut, and seized my stick; I seized hold of him again, and delivered him, as I thought, into the safe custody of two officers, but I saw one of the officers knocked down; he did not fall quite down, the seat prevented his falling quite down; then Draper made his escape; I then ordered Newman into custody, and took him down to Old-street watch-house. As we went along, he still exalted his voice very high with the same sort of abuse that he abused me with before, so loud that he might be heard half way down the street; when I got to the watch-house, I had but just turned myself round, when one of the officers informed me Coltman was cut; at the same time Corneilly was brought up by two officers with his hands very bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what Corneilly said? - A. His words were just the same as the others, bl - st their bl - y liver, and repeatedly said, I wish had cut their bl - y liver out; though I have been fourteen years an officer, I hardly ever heard such horrid expressions as they used before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said by Corneilly how his hands became bloody? - A. He said some of the bl - y traps had cut him; I replied, I did not think that could be true, for I did not think one of them had a cutting instrument about them; I knew he meant by the word traps, my officers; one of them had a cutlass, but he was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Corneilly give you any other account of it? - A. Not at that time, he did afterwards; he said, he had cut it with a bit of glass; I then ordered Newman and Corneilly to be handcuffed together, one for stirring up, and the other for making a confusion; the other five were in the watch-house before the affray happened; I was not positive that Taylor was there, from my own recollection; when Taylor was apprehended, I was sent for to the Public Office, and in the back room I said, Well, Master Taylor, you know me; no, says he, Sir, I don't know who you are; I asked him where he worked; he said, he worked for a person in Castle-street; knowing that street was near my house, says I, you work for a person in Castle-street, and don't know me; he said, no, he did not; says I, don't you know the Oxford Arms, in Whitecross-street; he said, no, he did not; I said, do you mean to tell me you do not know Hopwood and Draper, (Hopwood is a person who is not taken;) he said, no, I do not; says I, do you know Sadler; yes, says he, I know

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I take it for granted, as you have described it, you saw Corneilly at the Cock and Bell, and did not see him afterwards till he was brought to the watch-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him at the Oxford Arms, or with the the persons at the Oxford Arms? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the Oxford Arms from the Cock and Bell? - A. It may be a furlong.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Newman extremely drunk? - A. I really don't think he was, for he neither staggered, nor any thing of the kind; he might be a little fresh, but he was not deranged in his walk at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known him for some years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110027"/>Q. He was part of his life a fish-monger, and part a publican? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had just before ceased to be a publican? - A. Just before the licencing day he had kept that very house.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not apprehend him to be one of the persons described in your warrant, as disorderly? - A. I should not have taken him up, but on account of his behaviour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his wife coming in at the time he and you were talking, and saying, you fool, hold your tongue; Mr. Bridgman, don't mind him, you see he is drunk? - A. There was something said, and then he said, d - n Bridgman, who cares for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his wife desire him not to speak to you in that manner? - A. I believe he knocked her down in his fury; he pushed her against the table, she did not fall.</p>
               <p>Q. He certainly had been drinking? - A. He was not stupid, he was able to walk very well.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the watch-house from the place where Coltman was hurt? - A. About fifty yards; I cannot say justly.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen Coltman, and the party that were with Coltman, from the time you had sent them with persons in custody from the Cock and Bell? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had kept the warrant yourself, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen that warrant signed yourself? - A. No, it was brought to me by one Dixon, an officer, sealed up in a blank cover, and a gentleman of my acquaintance was in the house, to whom I shewed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all see Corneilly in company with Draper or Newman that night, or with the other prisoners? - A. No, I don't remember that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Draper went in just before you? - A. He must have gone in before me, because the landlord brought him a pint of beer; it must have been just at the moment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Corneilly. Q. Did you find any knife about me? - A. No, I did not take him; he was brought to me at the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. It is a common case, I believe, when a warrant is signed by one Magistrate, to put it by in a drawer to be signed by the other? - A. That is the only warrant of the kind I have signed since I have been at the Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no sort of recollection whether Mr. Turton was present when you signed it? - A. I have no recollection whatever of any consultation on the occasion, or of the circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the persons taken up were examined at your Office? - A. Yes, they were, I took the examination myself; I don't know that the circumstance of their examination can bring to my mind any thing respecting the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the inclination of your mind that it was signed by you and Mr. Turton separately? - A. It is; the warrant is put into the drawer after being signed by one Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. And is not signed in the presence of the first Magistrate? - A. It most frequently is.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a constable of the parish of St. John's, Clerkenwell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect having been applied to by the last witness upon any occasion to assist him to execute a search-warrant? - A. Yes, on the 3d of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany him to execute it? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first go to? - A. We walked to several houses, and we went to the Cock and Bell, and afterwards to the Oxford Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Draper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the Oxford Arms? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing there? - A. Yes, I saw him draw his knife out of his waistcoat pocket; Mr. Bridgman said, he should go with him, and he said, bl - st his eyes, if he would; they had been talking some time before that; I then went to the table where he was, and immediately struck at him, and hit him over the arm; he then made a lunge at me over the table with the hand that the knife was in; I don't know that the knife was open, I don't think it was; I drew back, and received a blow from somebody on my shoulder,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110028"/>which knocked me into the box on the other side, and then they all rushed out and escaped, except Newman, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners, and tell me if you recollect having seen either of the others? - A. No, I cannot swear to Taylor; there was a man standing there with a pipe in his hand, very much like Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. You went away with Newman, and saw no more of it? - A. I went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. If you don't know whether the knife was open or not, how do you know he had a knife? - A. I saw him take a knife out of his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any confusion or noise at that time? - A. Newman was making a noise.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a constable? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany Bridgman on the 3d of November to the Cock and Bell? - A. Yes, in Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners at the Cock and Bell? - A. I did not notice any body there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Corneilly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - A. I did not see him till he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do at the Cock and Bell? - A. We took five prisoners to St. Luke's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it agreed between Bridgman and you where you should meet afterwards? - A. Yes, at the Oxford Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that said in the room? - A. Yes, Mr. Bridgman said it at the door, coming out at the door of the tap-room; we lodged the prisoners safe in the watch-house, me, Juniper, Wentworth, and another officer; we returned back down Whitecross-street, in the way to the Oxford Arms; instead of going to the Oxford Arms, we made a mistake, and went to the Three Jolly Butchers, in Whitecross-street; we found our mistake, and came out of the house again; and coming up Whitecross-street, near St. Luke's church, three men, Corneilly, Draper, and Hopwood, formed themselves in a line across the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us more particularly how they were standing? - A. Hopwood had a velveteen jacket and velveteen breeches on; he was on one side of the street, Corneilly in the middle, and Draper on the other side, with a rough light-coloured great coat on; upon our coming towards them, Corneilly swore he would have some one's bl - y life.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Corneilly had made use of that expression, had you made towards them, or used any endeavour to take them? - A. No, I did not see them till the very instant I heard him express the words; I then went towards Corneilly to seize him by the collar, but before I could lay hold of him, he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any blow while you were down? - A. Yes, several.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom? - A. I cannot say from which of them; I had one severe blow upon the hip, which I believe I received from Hopwood; the blow that knocked me down, was a very severe blow on the head; I believe it was with his fist; Draper struck me several times, I saw him strike me over Corneilly's shoulder.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Still with fists? - A. Yes, I did not see any weapon at all; when I was about half bent, I felt something prick my back; I thought it was like a pin in my linen; one of them said at that time, d - n his eyes, cut the b - r down, which I believe was Draper, but I cannot be certain, but it was one of them; Draper was upon my left hand almost the whole of the time; after that I got up, and collared Corneilly, and tore his coat; soon after that, Juniper, one of my brother-officers, came up, and knocked Corneilly down; I then found myself released, and I ran away down Banner-street; Hopwood ran down on the right hand side of Banner-street; and Draper, I believe, on the left; there was a gentleman and lady at a green-shop door; I asked them to let me come in, and sit down; I found myself very faint and sick; I went into the house, and said I was cut, and the gentleman said he would go with me to a surgeon; I put my hand to my back, and got my two fingers of my right hand into the wound, and then I found I was cut.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first find yourself cut? - A. Not till I was faint and sick, I felt myself wet in my breeches; I went over to Mr. Smith, the surgeon, the corner of Banner-street, and had my wound dressed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time of night was this? - A. Between a quarter after ten and a quarter before eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. From thence, I believe, you were sent to the hospital? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in the hospital? - A. I believe a month; I am now an out-patient.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell at all from whom you received that wound? - A. No, I cannot; but I believe it was from Draper; though, from the appearance of the wound, there must have been more than one man cut me; I have the coat here, (produces a coat and shirt.) Here is the shirt cut, and a mark with the point of a knife; just above the great gash where I received a wound in the waistcoat there is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How many cuts are there? - A. Six in the coat, two in the left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you wounded in the left arm? - A. Yes, under the left arm.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110029"/>Q. Did you see Corneilly afterwards? - A. Before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at any time, take notice whether Corneilly had cut his finger or not? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. At the time you saw Draper, Hopwood, and Corneilly, you were in the middle of the street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Corneilly was in the middle, and therefore supposing the others to be Hopwood and Draper, they were at some distance from you, one on your right hand, and the other on your left? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You first of all snatched at the person you supposed to be Corneilly? - A. Yes, after he had expressed these words, and then he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. From the moment of his knocking you down, to the end of the scuffle, you must have been in very great agitation? - A. I did not know that I was cut.</p>
               <p>Q. But from being beat? - A. I was in great agitation undoubtedly; I expected the officers to come up and assist me, which they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not an opportunity of paying much attention to their faces? - A. Draper's face I was perfectly acquainted with.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, you believed it was Hopwood that gave the wound? - A. I thought so, but I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say, you think it was Draper? - A. I say, I believe he was one.</p>
               <p>Q. Whitecross-street is not a very light street, I believe? - A. No; but the houses were not all shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that there were any shops open where you had the contest? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no warrant with you? - A. Mr. Bridgman had the warrant.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you recollect the night this search-warrant was executed, accompanying the last witness to the Jolly Butchers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were coming out, did you hear any thing said? - A. Yes, I heard a voice say, a d - d set of bl - y thieves, we will cut their bl - y livers out.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard that voice before, or since? - A. Since; I believe it to be the same voice at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose voice was it you heard at Hatton-garden? - A. I verily believe it to be Corneilly's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before that night? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard the voice, did you see any person? - A. I did not; after I heard that voice, I walked on a little further along the street, facing Banner-street; Coltman was a little distance behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came opposite Banner-street, did you then see any person? - A. I did, I saw three.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they standing, or were they walking? - A. I saw them at the end of Banner-street upon Coltman; they were all three upon him in a very active manner; they seemed to be striking him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Coltman on the ground at that time? - A. No, he was rather on the stoop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing, upon observing that? - A. I did; I knocked Corneilly down upon the spot, and as he rose, I caught him by the collar with the left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards let him go? - A. I did not; I kept him in custody till I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Corneilly's hat happen to drop off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pick it up himself? - A. He did, with my leave, and when he put his hat on, he said, now I will surrender, and go with you, you bl - y set of thieves.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time were there any other officers with you, besides Coltman? - A. There were two at a little distance off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either you or Coltman any sharp instrument with you? - A. Neither of us; I had a stick in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took Corneilly to the watch-house, did you examine his hand? - A. I did; his hand was cut just in the thick of his hand; it was quite a fresh cut, and bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were taking him to the watch-house, did you observe him make any particular motion? - A. He did, towards his breeches-pocket, but whether he dropped any thing, or not, I cannot tell; I saw nothing.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable of the parish of St. Sepulchre's: I went with Coltman to the watch-house with five persons who were taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. In coming back from the watch-house, did you see the prisoners, or any of them, and where? - A. Not coming back from the watch-house; we went into the Three Jolly Butchers, and upon coming out, I saw three men, but I cannot speak to their persons; one was a shortish man, another a middle-sized man, and the other a tall man; I saw them come from over the way, with horrid imprecations; I then saw them engaged with Coltman, they had got him down, and he was surrounded by the three men; I went up towards them, and when I got up, Juniper had knocked Corneilly down; then I found it to be Corneilly, and not before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was one of the three you first saw? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and point out which is Corneilly?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110030"/>-

               <p>Q. Did Corneilly say any thing, or do any thing, as he was going to the watch-house? - A. No, nothing particular, only when we took a prisoner, they always swore; I observed his hand cut, and I said, how was your hand cut, we have not cut it, for we have no sharp instrument with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no sharp instrument? - A. No, none of us; he said he had fell upon a glass bottle, or something of that sort.</p>

When he was brought in, I observed a very considerable cut in his back, the length from eight to ten inches, from the right shoulder slanting downwards; the breadth took place from the gaping of the wound, it might be a quarter of an inch, or more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see the things afterwards? - A. I went to all the pawnbrokers about, that I could; I happened to go to a pawnbroker's, in Turnpin-alley, Leicester-square; I saw my apron and shift upon the counter, I told the pawnbroker they were mine; the pawnbroker asked me who stole them; I told him I did not know, I was afraid my husband would lick me, and the pawnbroker gave me a description of the person; I know it was the prisoner that had been in my room.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the bill of exchange is not forthcoming? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen this bill of exchange, before you lost it? - A. I had it in the Court all day, till I went out to look for Mr. Rickerby, clerk to Cox and Greenwood; I found afterwards he was in Court; I went to get some refreshment, and I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was it? - A. I presume, it might be three o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your great coat on? - A. Yes, I had; I was sitting with two or three friends of mine over the way when I lost it; when I went home, my wife informed me that the pocket-book was left.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any enquiry made of the person that returned it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person who returned it? - A. A person that had been in the coffee-house with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to him? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it? - A. It was an Irish gentleman, a friend of mine; I thought it was a fortunate event, I thought the young man might be reclaimed.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Baron. Q. You thought it right that a forger should escape in a country like this, and set with your hands before you without making any enquiry, or doing any thing to get the bill back; you have done a great injury to public justice? - A. If I have acted wrong in consulting my own feelings, I do not regret it.</p>

On Saturday morning, about half past seven o'clock, I was going to work, and in a lane I saw a bag laying behind a little bit of a bush, about a yard from the road, with meat in it; I took it into the hay-loft, and said nothing about it; I did not go to work till Tuesday, when my master asked me how I came by the meat; I told him I found it; he said, he heard Mr. Phillips had lost some, and I had better go to him, and clear it up; I went to Mr. Phillips, and told him what part I found; he said, take it home and boil it, or do as you like with it; I told my master, and said, I did not like to eat it; he said, if you don't, give it to the dogs, and they had a great part of it, and the carter had a leg; I had about three quarters of a pound, which I was boiling when they took me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (To Brown.) Had you any part of it? - A. Yes; they gave a great part to the dogs, and I said, it was a pity it should be so wasted; I had a leg, but I first told Mr. Phillips of it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Watson. Q. What are you? - A. An apprentice to Mr. Bryant, a smith; he does the smith's work for Mess Goodwin's brewhouse: On the 5th of January the prisoner and I left Mr. Bryant's shop in Wapping, about ten minutes before four o'clock on Thursday last with some work; we went to Mr. Goodwin's brewhouse; the prisoner had a bar of iron on his shoulder, and I had a hammer in my hand; we were going to fit some work on some brass cocks at the brewhouse; when we got there, there was a screw which prevented his trying the work; he had a candle alight in his hand, and we went up some stairs, and he called me after him; I went up to the top of the stairs to a little warehouse door, and he called me again by my name; then I went inside the place, and he told me to pick up those articles that lay there, and put them in my pocket, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they articles like either of these? - A. I cannot say whether they were like these or not; as soon as I had put them in my pocket I came out, and Mr. Hodsell caught me about five or six yards from the door; the prisoner made his escape, and ran down some stairs; he ran towards the gate where the watchman was; Mr. Hodsell came down the same stairs; when he got to the yard he called out to the watchman not to let that man go out, but he was gone out; Mr. Hodsell took me to the gate; Mr. Scriven came, and ordered Mr. Hodsell to keep me there; then as I was going to the Office, going through Nightingale-lane, there was the prisoner; he had been stopped by a press-gang.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Symonds. Q. He found a screw in the way, so that he could not fit the work on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not go up stairs to get something to fit his work on with? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation passed in the room? - A. He told me to pick these things up.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body was in the room, must they not have heard this conversation? - 
               <persName id="t18040111-55-person537">A. </persName>
            He did not speak very loud to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first mention any thing about the prisoner? - A. As soon as I was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he found the things upon your person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with your master? - A. I have served four years of my time.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hodsell.) Did you hear the prisoner tell the lad to pick up the things? - A. I heard something said, but I could not tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (To Brown.) Where did you pick these things up from? - A. From the ground; there was no part in a basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any boxes? - A. The prisoner was at the boxes, and what he took was out of the boxes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you such articles as these in the storeroom? - A. Yes, there were two brass washers, and I suppose fifty of those large copper nails; there were only two brass washers of this description in the store-room, I had seen them that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe these articles to be the property of Goodwin and Company? - A. This washer I can swear to, by a small dent in the top of it, and a roughness in the inside, which we do not expect in these sort of things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Symonds. Q. When did you first observe that dent? - A. On the 24th of December; I took it into the store-room from the accompting-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. No, I did not know either of them before; Brown came up to me, and put his handkerchief into my face, and Brewster came up directly in the front of me; Brown pretended to wipe my face, because the night was wet, it rained; Brewster then snatched the watch out of my pocket, and ran away; I pursued him till the watchman caught him; one went one way, and the other the other; I cried out stop thief, all the way into Drury-lane, till the watchman stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your watch? - A. No, he was searched at the watch-house, but the watch was not found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. While the handkerchief was over your face, how did you know it was Brewster that took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110037"/>the watch, you could not see him? - A. Yes, I could.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it? - A. Moonlight.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the other man taken? - A. He followed us to the watch-house, and I knew him, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Then are you sure it was Brown? - A. I saw two men come up to me, they spoke to me about the weather.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they with you before they put the handkerchief to your face? - A. Two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing for those two minutes? - A. Sitting still.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go on, you said you were going home? - A. They came before me, and I stared and looked at them; I did not mind that they were thieves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it rain at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it could not be moon-light? - A. It was not dark.</p>
               <p>- BUCKLEY sworn. - On the night of the 26th of December, a little after twelve o'clock, I heard a hue and cry out of Parker's-lane into Drury-lane; I turned round, and saw the prisoner, Brewster, running, but not very fast, however it was fast enough to make me think it was after him the hue and cry was, and I went after him, and stopped him; the prosecutor came up directly, and told me he had robbed him of his watch; I took him to the watch-house, and he was searched, but no watch found upon him; the prisoner, Brown, followed us, as it were, to prove an alibi for the prisoner, Brewster, to clear him of the charge; but Barry made one against him, and charged him as an accomplice, and he was taken into custody also.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Barry.) What was this watch? - A. An old-fashioned silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it thrown away or dropped? - A. No, only by all accounts, Brown made away with it before he came after Brewster; they seemed so close against one another, one made off one way, and the other the other.</p>
               <p>Brewster's defence. I was going home to my sister's, and the watchman laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. I went to the watch-house to see what was the matter, and the prosecutor said I was concerned; if I had been guilty of the robbery, I should not have been so foolish as to go to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Buckley.) What sort of a night was it? - A. Rather a rainy night.</p>
               <p>Q. Parker's-lane is not much lit up with lamps? - A. Sometimes they were lit, and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see a man's face to know him? - A. I think it was; it appeared to me that the prosecutor was in liquor, and since he has been enquiring of me about it, as much as if he did not recollect.</p>

The prisoner, with the last witness, came to my Office to ask the objections I had to passing or admitting this power of attorney; I told her, I had compared the signature with the former signature of Mr. Allin, that there was a difference in the present signature and the former signature of Mr. Allin; in answer to which, she said, she expected it would be so; that Mr. Allin had been long out of the habit of writing, so much so, that her aunt signed all his drafts upon his banker; in answer to this, I said to her, perhaps your aunt has signed this for him; no, she said, I might depend upon it that Mr. Allin had signed that himself; I believe I put this question to her a second time, suspecting that her aunt might have signed it; to which she answered, I might depend upon it, it was not so; I then said, Pray, Ma'am, if I may ask you the question, what is this old gentleman going to do with this 500 l. she answered me, that he was going to make her a present of it for the great care and attention that she had many years paid him, and that her aunt was willing he should so do. I then asked her how this power came in this mutilated state; to which she answered, just as it was going to be executed, the dog had got hold of it and tore it; if that was any objection to the power she would take out a fresh one. I did not think any part of it torn to affect the validity of it; I therefore told her the Bank of England would never wish to put any constituent to any expence that might be fairly and properly avoided. To the best of my recollection, seeing the name of

            , a cheesemonger, of Greenwich, being a name I had well known and a respectable man, I asked her if she knew Mr. Verney; to which she answered, that she did; that he had been many years the cheesemonger of the family.</p>

               <p>Q. Meaning Mr. Allen's family? - A. Yes; I observed to her, that he was a considerable proprietor of stock, and if he would certify what I should write upon the back of the paper as to his personal knowledge of Mr. Allen, I then would take the matter into further consideration when she brought it back again, and from that till the present time I have not seen the power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. After that you saw nothing of the prisoner? - A. I saw her the morning after in the Rotunda, along with a man, but I had no conversation with her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that other bellman walking, or standing still? - A. I could scarcely distinguish whether he was or not, it was very foggy; I heard his bell ring, and called to him; he took my letter in one hand, and pressed it in the other, and then, apparently to me, dropped it in the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with that postman? - A. None, that I recollect, further than giving him a shilling to pay the penny.</p>

            's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the letter-carriers confined to particular districts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can they receive letters in any other districts? - A. Not in any other.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 25th and 26th, was it the duty of Holmes to have been there? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon letters being delivered to him, what was he to do? - A. To put them into the bag, of course.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got that bag here? - A. Yes. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you mean that that is the very bag the prisoner had that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Woodfall. Q. To whom is the bag afterwards delivered? - A. To a clerk at the Post-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the bag hung over the shoulder? - A. I believe it is usually carried on the arm; some carry it across the shoulder, and some on the arm.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Maxon.) Q. Is that the sort of bag that the man had, to whom you gave the letter? - A. I am quite ignorant of that, it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he hold it? - A. I think, under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. And did he hold it under his arm, when he gave you the change? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Woodfall. (To Mr. Fergusson.) Q. Is it possible to extract a letter from that bag, notwithstanding it is locked? - A. Yes, I have seen that done; they may shake out all the letters, but not any particular letter.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand it is the duty of the carrier to convey this bag to Stratford-place? - A. To the end of Bond-street, where a man is stationed with a cart to receive the bags; that is the rendezvous for all of them at that end of the town to go to Bond-street, that they may assist one another not to come so far.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you to say, the prisoner was on that beat that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him upon the beat? - A. No; it was his duty to be upon the beat that night.</p>
               <p>Q. But whether he was, or not, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. One postman will very often assist another in his duty? - A. If a man is taken ill, or has leave of absence, we have people to do that duty; it is never done without acquainting me; we have proper officers for that duty.</p>
               <p>Q. The corner of Bond-street is the end of his district? - A. No, his district is Portman-square, and he brings his letters to Bond-street, which is a general place of rendezvous.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes they do not go to the full extent of their beat? - A. No, they are saved by one another.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, supposing a man with that bag did not go to the extent of his beat, and another person taking the letters on that part of the beat that he did not go to, would have the letters? - A. He would have the whole bag; sometimes another man carries the bag, but the letters of that district are all in one bag.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at your book, and see if he was on duty that night? - A. Yes, and on the 25th; he came upon duty after his illness; he came to the office on the 25th.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon the 26th, was he there? - A. He was.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. Q. Are you a letter-carrier at the Post-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time receive that Banknote, (shewing him one), and from whom? - A. I received this note from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a regulation at the Post-office, that the Bank-notes passing through the hands of the carriers, shall have their names written upon them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that the prisoner's name upon it? - A. Yes, and I wrote my name under it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you received it from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose? - A. He said he could not make his money even for the Receiver-General's office, without change for a pound-note, and I gave him change for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not able to ascertain the actual day, I understand? - A. No; I paid it into the Receiver-General's office that same morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember sometime afterwards, an enquiry being made respecting this note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, had you any conversation with the prisoner? - A. Not till after he had been at Mr. Parkins's; he then said to me that he had taken them of Mr. Jennings, at the Three Compasses, by carrying him silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say he had taken from Jennings at the Three Compasses? - A. He said he had carried six pounds worth of small change, and had taken six one-pound notes; he said this was one of the six one-pound notes he took at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account of what he had done at the time, as to writing, or any thing of that sort? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how long before he had taken them? - A. No; he said he always signed the name of the persons he took them from, and as he took that of Mrs. Jennings, he had signed her name to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the name of Mrs. Jennings appear upon it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When this conversation took place between you and the prisoner, you don't know? - A. No; this was the day he had been to Mr. Parkins.</p>
               <p>Q. But when that was, you don't know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a letter-carrier? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an uncommon thing for you to find publicans in change, where you stop to get refreshment? - A. No, by no means.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing particular in the account the prisoner gave, that made you think that uncommon at all? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the Post-office yourself? - A. Fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your custom to put upon a note the person's name from whom you receive it? - A. I generally get the person I take it of to sign it themselves, and then I put my name upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how long the prisoner has been in the office? A. Many years, I cannot say how long; he was there before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person in the Post-office entitled to a better character than he was? - A. I never heard a better character given to any man in my life, in the office, or out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Jennings's house? - A. I have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in the habit of getting notes changed there? - A. I have, in the course of last summer, been with the prisoner to Jennings's house, when I have seen the prisoner give him some change, and he has given him ones and twos for it.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When was it - do you know? - A. On the 10th of December, I requested Folkard might be sent for into the inspector of letter-carrier's room; I sent for both, but I sent for Folkard first; I asked Holmes if he had paid that note to Folkard; he said, if I did, it has my name upon it, and when I shewed it him, he, without the least embarrassment, acknowledged the name of Holmes to be his hand-writing, and appeared perfectly unembarrassed; I asked him if he had any recollection from whom he had taken it; he begged to look at the note again, and said, yes, I have written the name of Jennings upon it, from whom I took it; he keeps the sign of the Compasses, in Portman-mews.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass? - A. He went out of the room, and I made out the usual statement for the information of Mr. Parkin, and there I left it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Then he appeared<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110045"/>not to have the least suspicion, and made no secret of any thing? - A. Perfectly unembarrassed.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't mean to say you never gave him any small notes? - A. I cannot say I never did; I don't remember the time when I did give him any; I have given him two-pound notes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the prisoner write his name upon any notes? - A. Yes, I have, upon large notes that he received from me; I have asked him whether I should write my name upon them, or he, and he said, it did not signify which, it made no difference.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time, in consequence of this letter, and Bank-notes being missed, see the prisoner, and receive any account of the transaction from him? - A. On the 12th of December, Mr. Jennings, Mrs. Maxon, Mr. Fergusson, the inspector of letter-carriers, and Mr. Coleback, came to my house; a Bank-note at that time was produced to the prisoner; he looked at it, and saw his own name upon it in his own hand-writing; he saw also upon it the name of Jennings; he said he had it either from Mr. or Mrs. Jennings; it was pointed out to him that the name upon it was Mr. and not Mrs. Jennings; upon which he said, then he must have had it from Mr. Jennings; Mrs. Maxon stated the circumstance of delivering the letter to the <rs id="t18040111-61-deflabel370" type="occupation">postman</rs>

Mr. Jennings suggested to the prisoner, that he had been ill, and probably he might not have been upon duty on that day; the prisoner said he had been ill, but did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110046"/>know whether he was then recovered, or not; I asked the inspector if there was any means of knowing whether he was upon duty, or not; he said, there was; I then sent to the Post-office to ascertain that fact. Nothing more passed at that time, the parties separated, and I believe he went to the Post-office. On the 18th, I sent to him to come again, he came, and I desired he would particularly state the circumstances respecting his having taken a note of Mr. Jennings. Upon that occasion, I took down in writing what he said, that on the morning of the day on which he received the note from Mr. Jennings, Mr. Jennings spoke to him, and said, he wanted a good deal of silver and small change against the evening, and that about half past four in the afternoon, he called upon Mr. Jennings with six pounds worth of small gold and silver; that Mr. Jennings was not at home; that he saw Mrs. Jennings, to whom he gave the six pounds in small gold and silver, and she gave him six one-pound Bank of England notes for it; he took a pen and ink, which stood upon the mantle-piece, and wrote Mrs. Jennings's name and his own under it, in her presence; he did not see where she took the notes from; this was done in the same room where he gave her the gold and silver; on Saturday he received the Bank-notes from Mrs. Jennings, and on Monday, having five pounds fourteen shillings to pay into the Receiver-General's office, he requested change of one of the letter-carriers, that he might give even money; Folkard gave him change, and he paid the other five notes into the Receiver-General's office; he does not know the number of any of the said notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long had the prisoner been in the Post-office? - A. I understand, about sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he would in a few months, or a short time, have been entitled to an annuity of fifty pounds a year for his life? - A. Of that, the inspector can inform you best.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the character he has maintained in the Post-office? - A. I understand he has maintained one of the best of characters.</p>


               <p>Q. From the 12th of December to the 18th, when he came again to you upon the second summons, he was going about his business? - A. He was suspended upon this enquiry, but he was at perfect liberty.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You don't mean to swear positively you did not give him six one-pound notes? - A. I cannot recollect it; to the best of my recollection I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. You say he did not put, at your desire, your name upon any note in your sight? - A. No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110047"/>Q. Do you know Folkard? - A. Yes, I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him come with the prisoner to your house? - A. I really cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he use your house? - A. Very seldom; I cannot say I ever noticed him coming in.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever give you change? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never give him change? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You spoke to your recollection only of three other times; you don't think he gave you change at any other time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had at any time given him six one-pound notes, is it likely you should forget it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Holmes taking a pen and ink from the mantle-piece, and writing upon the notes? - A. I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Fergusson.) Q. Can you say whether, according to the course of the Post-office, the prisoner would, in the course of a few months, have been entitled to an annuity? - A. Not a few months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. A few years; twenty years is the allotted time, if a man is not capable of doing his duty, and then by the approbation of the post-master.</p>
               <p>Q. That annuity is fifty pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I received six one-pound notes of Mrs. Jennings, and this is one of them; I signed my name upon them, and her own, in her bar, all at the same time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character, when the Jury declared they were satisfied as to character.</p>

             sworn. - The prisoner at the bar came to my house, in company with Mr. Menou, on the 27th of October last.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Menou? - A. He told me he was a gentleman in the army; I have been told he is now in Tothill-fields; the prisoner came in, and asked me if I had a chaise I could let him for a month; I told him I had one; I shewed it him, it was a two-wheeled chaise; he approved of it; he said, what will you charge me for a month? I said, four guineas; he agreed to pay it me. Now, says he, if I should buy this chaise within a month, you will not charge me for the hire of it? I told him, no; he looked about the shop, and saw another two-wheeled chaise; he asked me the price of it; I asked him sixty-five guineas; he said he thought he should purchase it of me; he told me he would send a Mr. Purvis the next day for the chaise that he had hired with a note from me; he said, Mr. Purvis was a stable-keeper, where his horses stood. Accordingly, the next day, Mr. Purvis came; I asked him for the note the prisoner was to send; he told me he had lost it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mr. Purvis now, do you know? - A. In Newgate, I believe; I was not inclinable to let him have it without a note from Sims, and he came again the next day with a note from Sims, and I sent the chaise by Purvis.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the note that Purvis brought you? (shewing him a paper) - A. Yes, it is; I let Purvis have the chaise, in consequence of Purvis's recommendation of Sims; I was to call upon Sims the next day, saying he should probably buy one chaise or the other; I went and found him at No. 40, Brompton-row, Knightsbridge, it was a very elegant house apparently; he wanted to purchase that chaise, for which I asked sixty-five guineas; I told him the very lowest was sixty guineas, ready money. Nothing more particular passed at that time; he told me he was an officer in the army, that he belonged to a German regiment that lay in Hampshire; we did not agree, and then he sent me another letter.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you find out who he was, and where your chaise was? - A. I heard that Mr. Gibbons, in Tottenham Court-road, had my chaise; it was about six weeks after he had it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to Gibbons? - A. I applied for a warrant, and found the chaise at Gibbons's on the 8th of December.</p>
               <p>- BARNETT sworn. - I am an auctioneer: I had the chaise sent to me, I think, about the beginning of December last, from the stable to my auction-room, to be sold; it was a two-wheeled chaise, with furniture; it was the same chaise that Mr. Harris afterwards saw. An advance upon it was required by a man of the name of Sowerby, but I refused it; I said I would advertise it, and put it up in the first sale I had; the prisoner came the next day, and claimed it as his property; he seemed to say he should not sell it, and wished to have it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to you about fifteen pounds? - A. He said it would not bring money enough at the approaching sale, and wanted to have it away; Sowerby said he had advanced money upon it, and claimed it as his, and Sims claimed it as his; I believe fifteen pounds was mentioned as the price of it by Sims; the chaise was sent for away while I was away, and half-a-guinea paid for the standing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The chaise<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110048"/>was brought to you by a person of the name of Sowerby, and when Sims came to you, he desired you not to sell it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever put it in any catalogue, or offer it for sale? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The half-guinea was paid for the mere standing? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a stable-keeper in Tottenham Court-road; the prisoner came to me, and told me he had a chaise, if I could find room for it to stand; that was somewhere about the 17th of November; he gave me directions where to go for it, to Mr. Barnett's, in King-street, an auctioneer, and I went to Mr. Barnett's; he was not at home, and I went the next day, and had the chaise; I paid ten shillings for the standing of it, I took it home about two days after; the prisoner asked me if I could lend him a little money upon the chaise; I lent him six pounds upon it; I took the chaise first to stand at eighteen-pence a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Sims? - A. Yes, I know him by seeing him at different places, but I cannot tell what he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he an officer in the army? - A. Not that I know of; I have known him these two years.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have seen him backwards and forwards in town? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did not Mr. Harris tell you he had sold the chaise to the prisoner for twenty-five guineas, and did you not reply to him that he had made a hard bargain with the prisoner? - A. No, I do not recollect that.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street; I apprehended the prisoner at a lock-up house in White Hart-court, at Mr. Wilson's, under the sheriff's process.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Gibbons.) Are you sure as to the time you went to Barnett's to get this chaise? - A. I think it was somewhere about the 17th of November.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Barnett says it was sent to him the beginning of December.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Barnett.) Are you accurate as to the time of the chaise being brought to your house? - A. I have a paper which Sims wrote two days after it came, and left in my accompting-house, and if that is dated, it will tell, (refers to it); it is dated the 16th; then it must have come to me about the 14th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought the chaise of him a fortnight after it was delivered to me; it is very unfortunate that I cannot get my witnesses here; he would not take my bill at a short date, but would give me credit for three weeks; after the expiration of the month, I called upon Mr. Harris, a few days before the chaise was returned, and told him I had been under the necessity of borrowing some money upon it, but he should have it again in a few days; Purvis is unfortunately a debtor on the other side of Newgate.</p>

             sworn. - I am foreman to Mr. Chattam: On the 1st of December I burnt to the amount of ten bundles of Cork; the prisoners came there after I had began burning it; after I had burned five bundles, both the prisoners were at work sweeping; the next five bundles were then burnt and swept; the two prisoners took a part of these five bundles from the burning-ground to a warehouse of Mr. Donothy's; I cannot say which of them did it, it was at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both together? - A. Yes; it was heaved out of the ground into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the workmen ever put it out of the yard to tie it up in bundles? - A. Frequently; it is sometimes bound up in the burning-ground, and it is sometimes carried out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Is Mr. Donothy's warehouse adjoining the burning-ground? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This burning-ground is common to several warehouses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known cork after it has been swept carried by mistake into wrong warehouses? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What enables you to say it was one of these two prisons? - A. Because I saw the warehouse door open, and my master's property going in; I cannot swear to either of them, but there was nobody else about there.</p>
               <p>- DONOTHY sworn. - I live at No. 30, Cow-lane, West Smithfield; my burning-ground is in Northampton-street, Clerkenwell, near the Skin-market; I know the prisoners very well; I never saw the boy many times; they never brought me any cork.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend any key to them? - A. Yes, I lent a key to Griggs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he apply to you for it? - A. No, I gave it him, and Mr. Walker called upon me the day before, and asked me to let him have a sack of shavings, and he said he would send Griggs for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110049"/>them; he did not send him, but I saw Griggs in the morning, and I told him to take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any cork in your warehouse? - A. Yes, I have cork of my own there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of Mr. Chattam's cork there? - A. No, not to my knowledge; I was not at home from nine in the morning till ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Martin.) Did you find any cork in Mr. Donothy's warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose cork was it? - A. My master's; it had not gone through my hand above an hour, it was quite warm; there was one very remarkable sheet of cork, you would not find such a one in twenty tons, that I took particular notice of; there were twenty-five sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss so many sheets? - A. Not till I saw it carried away; I examined that piece after it came out of Mr. Donothy's warehouse, and knew it again immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. (To Chattam.) Q. Did you see the cork that was produced from Mr. Donothy's premises? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it to be your cork? - A. I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it customary for cork to get by mistake out of your premises into Mr. Donothy's? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Griggs's defence. It was an uncommon dark night; I was putting baskets of dust into Mr. Donothy's warehouse, and Mr. Chattam's foreman might suppose I was taking in cork, but I was obliged to have one hand to feel my way with the dust; I never took any cork in at all, and the cork that Mr. Martin made me take away from Mr. Donothy's warehouse was Mr. Donothy's own.</p>

               <p>Eady's defence. I took in two baskets of dust belonging to my master, I took no cork in.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Griggs called three, and Eady one witness, who gave them a good character.</p>
               <p>Donothy. I went the next morning to Mr. Chattam's, and told him the cork in that warehouse was mine; I left from twelve to fourteen sheets in my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your's warm? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any mark upon your cork? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. How is your house situated with respect to the street? - A. The whole of the premises stand back from the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get out of the premises from the street? - A. The entrance is by means of a passage from Lime-street, the gates of which are shut at night; at the end of the passage part of the dwelling-house front you; the sugar-house is behind the house; it joins by means of a warehouse; the warehouse is in the middle, between the sugar-house and the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any communication internally between the one and the other? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get from the dwelling-house to the sugar-house? - A. By crossing the yard, no other way, and then into the sugar-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the entrance to the sugar-house is in the yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the sugar-house, warehouse, and dwelling-house are all surrounded by a fence are they? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way do your carts come to the sugar-house? - A. By a gateway from Lime-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the back part of the sugar-house? - A. Contiguous to a church-yard, near Fen-court; there is no entrance to the sugar-house from Lime-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was last up on the 26th of December last? - A. The gates are locked regularly at ten o'clock; I fastened the private door of the dwelling-house that night, but not the gates; I came home about twelve o'clock that night, the dwelling-house was then in a perfect state of security.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you get to the private door without going through the great gates? - A. We have besides the great gates a private door in the street, and from the private door in the street we have to pass through a passage to the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. There are two doors, the one for a cart, and the other a private door? - A. Yes; I can take upon me to say that both of them were perfectly secure at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110050"/>Mr. Knapp. Q. Is there any other passage that leads to the sugar-house? - A. There is a passage from Lime-street by Mr. Alterieth's house, but that is never used.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge whether the door of that passage was secure that night? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known the prisoner some time? - A. He was in our employ about two months previous to this affair.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he left you before this time? - A. I believe about three days; he left us on the 22d, and on the day following he applied for his wages; we paid him his wages, deducting a week, because he left us without warning, it is the rule of our house so to do; he withdrew himself, I did not discharge him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen, after you had discovered in the morning that the sugar-house was broke open, to make any observations? - A. Yes, I saw a ladder on the side next our premises, between the church-yard and our sugar-house, by which a person might easily ascend the wall, and get over into the church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You suppose that is the way the man got out? - A. Yes, we observed some foot-steps; we at first imagined the door in Fen-court had always been locked, but upon enquiry we found it had not; we then imagined he had made his entry that way.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I apprehended the prisoner on the 27th of December last; I was on the watch in Fenchurch-street, about two o'clock in the morning; the prisoner came past me facing Rood-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Lime-street? - A. Not far; I observed a bag, as I thought, across his shoulder, and I asked him what he had there; he replied, his clothes; I put my hand to them, and found it a hard substance; I said, these are not clothes, I must detain you, you must go along with me to the watch-house; upon taking him to the watch-house and searching him, I found twelve loaves of sugar wrapped up in some shirts; I found also a pair of breeches and a shirt under his waistcoat in the watch-house; he said, he had bought them; he was taken to the Compter that night; the next day I attended before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what he said there taken down by the Clerk? - A. As far as I know.</p>
               <p>Mr. HOBLER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were present when the prisoner was examined? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mason. He said the first day he bought them of a man, but he did not know who; the next day he said Mr. Gibson had stopped him of his wages, and that he went and stole them; he said, he had got them over the wall; the officer has got the things.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What are you? - A. A labourer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. No. 2, Tash-street, Gray's-Inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday evening last, tell us what you observed? - A. On Monday evening last, I was going home up Back-hill from my labour, about a quarter past six o'clock, I heard a great crash of glass windows break.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. At Mr. Page's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from his shop at that time? - A. I suppose it might be a dozen or fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see? - A. I saw the prisoner at the bar, and two or three more, run away from the window; the prisoner was eight or ten yards from the shop; he went some little way across Leather-lane, and then made a cross double towards Back-hill, where I was crossing, about the middle of the street, he called out stop thief, stop thief, running as hard as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue him? - A. He was close to where I was; he was coming right to me, and I laid fast hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him from the time of his quitting the window till you seized him? - A. No, it was not much further than from my Lord to the window that I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the crash at the window was it that you saw him leave the window? - A. Directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him to Mr. Page's shop? - A. Me, with another gentleman; he at first said, when I laid hold of him, don't stop me, I know nothing of the affair, I am a respectable tradesman in the Old Jewry; then came up another gentleman, whom I have not seen since, a Mr. Rusby, a corn-chandler, who took him into Mr. Page's shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110054"/>Q. Did you observe any thing with respect to either of his hands? - A. Both his hands were in his breeches-pocket when he came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take either of them out? - A. He seemed very much confused and frightened; he begged not to be exposed, but to be taken into a back room, that he might not be seen by so many people.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he taken into a back room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When his hands were taken out of his pockets, did you observe any thing? - A. When he was desired to pull them out, he was very loth to pull his right-hand out of his breeches-pocket; in pulling it out, it was very bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether it was cut? - A. I did not see whether it was cut then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards? - A. I cannot say exactly; it was somewhere about the finger and thumb.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the right-hand glove? - A. Yes, I asked him the reason of his hand being bloody; he said, it was owing to his putting his hand in his pocket against a piece of silver solder, which they used in their line of business; he said, he was a working jeweller; he then pulled out eighteen pence, a pen-knife, a comb, and two or three halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not pull out any solder? - A. Yes, he pulled out a piece of solder.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in his waistcoat or breeches pocket? - A. In his breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask to see his glove? - A. Out of his left-hand pocket he pulled a small neat hook, such as are used for buck-skin breeches, but it has been lost since; he took his right-hand glove out of his right-hand coat-pocket; his right-hand glove appeared very bloody; I asked him the reason of its being bloody; he said, by putting his hand in his pocket upon it, his hand being bloody; I then turned the glove inside out, and the inside was bloody as well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the glove besides? - A. No further than there was a cut in the glove corresponding with the place in his hand; two officers were sent for to take him to Hatton-garden, and I saw no more of him that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. When you came up, there was a considerable noise in the street? - A. The breaking of glass, nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not occasion a great alarm, and a cry of stop thief? - A. It created an alarm about Mr. Page's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Page's is quite the corner, is it not? - A. The corner of Eyre-street-hill and Liquorpond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner desired not to be exposed, for he was a respectable tradesman? - A. Yes; he said, pray don't stop me, I am a respectable tradesman in the Old Jewry; he said, he would give me his address; I told him I should certainly stop him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you his direction? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not since heard that he does live in the Old Jewry, and is a jeweller? - A. I have heard so from other people; in Mr. Page's shop, he said he lived four doors from the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, there was a piece of solder found in his breeches-pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it sharp? - A. Not very sharp; not sharp enough to cut any body's hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he pull his hand out himself, or did Rice Jones take it out? - A. Himself; he was very loth to pull it out.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What are you? - A. An officer belonging to Hatton-garden; I was sent for to Mr. Page's to take charge of the prisoner; I searched him, and took out of his coat-pocket a glove, (producing it;) it has been in my possession ever since; I found this piece of solder lying upon the counter.

               <p>Mr. Gurney. I am just informed, and I wish it to be understood, that the prisoner did give a true account of his residence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I live in Dove-court, in the Old Jewry; I left home between three and four o'clock in the afternoon to meet my father, who was gone to Hampstead; when I got to North End, I found he was gone; I came to town again down Gray's-Inn-lane and down Liquorpond-street; I crossed over at the end of Liquorpond-street, when I saw three fellows running away; there was a cry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110055"/>of stop thief, and that man immediately laid hold of me, and took me to Mr. Page's; it was a wet afternoon, and one of my gloves were wet; I have a habit of walking with one hand in my breeches-pocket; I put my hand into my pocket with my glove on, and my glove being wet, and the breeches having leather linings, it stuck; and, when I got my hand out, it was bleeding.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eleven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again before Barnes came? - A. Yes, he came in, and had a glass of gin, and paid me for it in halfpence; he then went away for some time, it might be a quarter of an hour; he came again, and called for a glass of gin, and gave me another half-crown, which proved to be a bad one; Barnes brought me back the other half-crown, and said that was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that the half-crown Barnes brought back to you, was the same that you received from the prisoner, and gave to Barnes? - A. I have no doubt of it, I know it by the brightness of the head; I took particular notice of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not say before that solicitor (pointing to Mr. Powell), that you took it of me? - A. No. On the 11th, he offered me two half-crowns, one I did take, and the other I should have taken, if it had not by accident fell out of my hand, and I did not like the sound of it; he said he would change it, and then he gave me a good half-crown for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the same you received from the prisoner? - A. Yes, I know it by the head upon it; I had two other half-crowns that were good ones, which I took of another man; one of them had an F upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. In how long? - A. About half an hour; I am sure he is the man; I had never seen him before; a constable was sent for, and then he made a bolt out at the back door, jumped over the wall, and got away; we went to Lambeth-street, and gave information the next morning, and he was taken at night; the property has not been found.</p>

               <p>Q. You gave information to Mrs. Francis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had no quarrel with her? - A. No; I knew her to be a bad woman, and turned her out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not leave the house, saying you were a bad woman? - A. No, I turned her out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else see the bed come in? - A. Yes, a lodger of mine, who is here.</p>

               <p>Q. Only just sensible? - A. I was not the worse for liquor; I asked the watchman to shew me where to get something to drink; I had never been at the house before; I sat down, and called for some purl and gin between the watchman and myself; I dare say there were half a dozen drank out of it.</p>

In a few minutes, I saw her return with my linen on her arm; I went into the wash-house, and missed the linen out of the clothes-basket; I followed her, and stopped her on Saffron-hill; I asked her where she was going; she said, she was going home; I told her that was not the way home; I knew her immediately, I mangle for people in the house where she lived, I had known her by sight some months; I told her they were my property, and she said she would shew me where she took them from; she came back with me. I wanted to take her into the Coach and Horses, but she refused; a person in Court then took her to the Hat and Tun, and gave her up to an officer; she said, she had fetched them from the mangle, that she had sent them in the morning by a boy, and not being done, she fetched them away.</p>

             sworn. - Q. With whom do you live? - A. With my father and mother, in Black Lion-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased was your brother, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as tell the Jury what you know relating to this melancholy affair? - A. Between ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110067"/>and eleven o'clock, my brother came to my father's house; he had been to see for his wife, who was at Mr. Smith's, the Out-riders; my mother and I were just going to bed when he came in; he said, mother, are you going to bed? I made answer, yes, Thomas, is your wife come home? he said, no, she will not be at home for half an hour; I said, will you come in, and I will sit with you? he came in, and I sat with him; we talked a considerable time, till my mother fell asleep; while my brother was sitting, I heard the watchman crying past eleven o'clock, as I thought; I told my brother, your time is expired, you had better go; he did not attend to me, but set for a considerable time; I said, you had better go, it is dangerous for your wife to come home by herself; he jumped up, and said, I will go; he bid my mother and me good night, and went out of the door, and shut it. As soon as he was gone, I jumped up, and went to the door; as soon as I got to the door, I heard a voice say, d - n you, who are you, and what are you, d - n you, I will shoot you? and whilst they were speaking, the gun went off, and I saw the flash of fire from the gun; I went from the door, and called Thomas, as loud as I could, three or four times, but nobody answered. I went into my mother, and said, I do think my brother is shot; I did not stay for an answer, but went up to my father, who was in bed, and said, do get up, for my brother is shot; he would not believe me, and then I went into a room adjoining, and awakened a young man; he would not believe me neither; I went to the window, and called Thomas, as loud as I could call. At last I said, well, if nobody will believe me, I will go myself; I ran out of the door, and when I had got half way from my father's house to my brother's, I saw my brother laying dead at the gate; I took hold of his right hand, and said, speak to me, but he could not, for he was quite dead; his head was laying towards me, as I went up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there at the time? - A. Nobody, I was by myself, I saw nobody; when I saw my brother, I don't know whether I went home directly, or not, but I run to Mrs. Wells afterwards, if I did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You saw the prisoner afterwards with Mr. Locke? - A. Yes; when I came back from Mrs. Wells, I saw Mr. Locke, Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Stowe, and Mr. Smith, with my brother; that was as I was coming back from Mr. Wells's, where I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they a lantern? - A. I don't know, I believe they had.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your brother shut the door after him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go out exactly at the same time? - A. I got up directly out of my chair, and got upon some bricks adjoining the door; I heard the words spoke.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were out of the door? - A. Yes, and when I was upon the bricks before the door.</p>
               <p>Q. The dress he had on, was a bricklayer's dress? - A. Yes, his working dress.</p>

               <p>Q. You must have heard of this ghost? - A. Yes, I heard great talk of it, that sometimes it appeared in a white sheet, and sometimes in a calf-skin dress, with horns on its head, and glass eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever occur to you to mention any thing to your brother about his dress? - A. I often spoke to my brother, and asked him, if he saw it, should he be afraid, and he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As he was dressed in white, did it happen that you cautioned him about going in that dress? - A. No, I never did, because I never had any such thought of him.</p>
               <p>Q. I only mean, as to his being in danger? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't mean to have it supposed your brother was guilty of it, but as every body was out to take the ghost, did you mention his being in white to him? - A. I did not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any conversation about it? - A. I heard that some people had seen it, but I don't know any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Smith and your brother any animosity against each other? - A. I don't know, it is impossible for me to know.</p>
               <p>- FLOWER sworn. - Q. Did you examine the body of the deceased? - A. Yes; I saw the body the day after the accident, and examined it on the 6th, by order of Mr. Hodgson; it had a gunshot wound on the left side of the lower jaw with small shot, about the size No. 4, one of which had penetrated the virtebre of the neck, and injured the spinal marrow, which has a communication to the brain; I examined the brain, but there was no injury whatever to the brain itself.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion with regard to this wound having been the cause of his death? - A. I have no doubt that it was the cause of it; it is what we call necessarily, a mortal wound.</p>
               <p>Q. What appearance was there of this having been given by a gun-shot, besides the spinal marrow being touched? - A. It had broke the jaw, and the face was black.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you know any thing of Smith before? - A. I did not; but the character I have heard of him is very good, far from being a vindictive man; on the contrary, a very mild man.</p>
               <p>- BROOKS sworn. - On Tuesday, the 3d of January, just before ten o'clock, I took the body of the deceased to the Black Lion; Mr. Stone told me, I must go along with him, and Millwood,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110068"/>the father; going up a lane, they said, we are going to take the man that shot the other; we went up to the door, and knocked; upon which, Smith looked out of the window, and came down immediately, and surrendered himself; I had him two days and nights in my custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I went out with a good intention, and when this unhappy affair took place, I did not know what I did; speaking to the deceased twice, and he not answering, I was so much agitated, I did not know what I did; I solemnly declare my innocence, and that I had no intention to take away the life of the unfortunate deceased, or any other man whatever.</p>
               <p>Evidence for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mrs. FULBROOKE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. Q. Are you related by marriage to the deceased? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard any conversation at Hammersmith about the ghost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what you heard about it, did you ever say any thing to the deceased about the dress he wore? - A. On Saturday evening, he and I were at home, for he lived with me; he said he had frightened two ladies and a gentleman who were coming along the terrace in a carriage, for that the man said, he dared to say there goes the ghost; that he said he was no more a ghost than he was, and asked him, using a bad word, did he want a punch of the head; I begged of him to change his dress; Thomas, says I, as there is a piece of work about the ghost, and your cloaths look white, pray do put on your great coat, that you may not run any danger; I don't know what answer he made; he said he wished the ghost was catched, or something of that sort.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you heard any thing of this appearance of a ghost? - A. Yes, I heard great talk of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it your misfortune to be hurt by it? - A. Yes; I was going through the church yard between eight and nine o'clock, with my jacket under my arm, and my hands in my pocket, when some person came from behind a tomb-stone, which there are four square in the yard, behind me, and caught me fast by the throat with both hands, and held me fast; my fellow-servant, who was going on before, hearing me scuffling, asked what was the matter; then, whatever it was, gave me a twist round, and I saw nothing; I gave a bit of a push out with my fist, and felt something soft, like a great coat.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called twelve witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for about three quarters of an hour, when they returned a verdict of Manslaughter. The Lord Chief Baron informed them, that according to law, he could not take that verdict, as they were not at liberty to find it; that they must either find the prisoner guilty, or not guilty, generally, there being no circumstance in the case that could reduce it to manslaughter. If they could say, upon their oaths, they did not give credit to the witnesses for the prosecution, then they might find the prisoner not guilty; if they could not say so, then they must convict him, and the prerogative of shewing mercy lay in the Crown.</p>
               <p>The Jury immediately pronounced the prisoner</p>
