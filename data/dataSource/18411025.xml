                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Street—we live at Enfield-Wash. My son was brought here, on the 17th of May, on a charge of assaulting a girl—I came to town about it several times—on the 22nd of May I was at the George public-house, Old Bailey, and was inquiring there for Mr. Phillips—I saw the defendant there—he heard me inquiring for Mr. Phillips, and asked me what I was inquiring for—I told him I had a son in trouble, and wished to know if I could see Mr. Phillips, to see him righted, to get him out as soon as I could, to get him through when the trial should come on—he told me he was clerk to Mr. Phillips, and that he would visit my son, that every thing would be right—I said I was nothing but a poor woman, and asked what he would charge me for seeing my son righted—he said Mr. Phillips could not do it under three guineas—those were the words he said to me—we were talking some time together in the room about one thing or another—I said I had not got all the money, I could give him but 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I gave him—he gave me a paper for it—I said I would be up again as soon as I could, and make the money up—here is the receipt he gave me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The Queen against Wil<lb/>liam Street. 1841. 22nd May. Received of Mrs. Street 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of this defence. <hi rend="smallCaps">W. S. HENSON</hi>."—I saw him again about the 12th of June, at the George, a few days before the Sessions—he shook hands with me as soon as he saw me, and said, "Good morning, how do you do, Mrs. Smith?"—he said, "I have seen your son, I have been and visited him"—I said, "Have you?"—he said, "Oh yes, it is all right, and Mr. Phillips is going to plead for him"—he said he should go and visit my son that day, and tell him he had seen his mother—nothing was done that day—I was obliged to wait till Friday, to send a donkey to Smithfield, to sell to get the money—I got this second paper from him—I saw him write it on the day it is dated—I paid him all the money—I cannot read very well—the next sum I paid the defendant was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was paid by instalments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did any thing else pass about your son, when you paid him the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he was quite convinced Mr. Phillips would see my son righted, and I should have my son home with me, I might depend on it—I was present when my son was tried—he had no counsel—he was tried on Sa<lb/>turday afternoon (he was brought up on the Monday morning again) I was here looking for Mr. Henson—he was not to be found—I never saw him after I paid him the last money till this morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you were in great grief and vexation that your son had nobody to defend him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I thought it very hard, after sacrificing all our things to raise the money—it has been a great expense to us—I saw a short person, (Samuel Wiggins,) on the sub<lb/>ject—I saw him first, and he told me, after the money was paid, that he was afraid Mr. Henson was not doing right by me, and I should be out of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who first sent you into the George public-house to inquire for Mr. Phillips? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were a parcel of people standing about—I was a countrywoman not acquainted with town—I wished to know where Mr. Phillips lived, and was told in Chancery-lane—I was told that at the George—it was not the landlord that I asked where Mr. Phillips lived—Mr. Wiggins told me where he lived, and we went to Chancery-lane, and he was not at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe afterwards Wiggins introduced you to Henson as the person who would do your business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not exactly—he did not say Henson was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184110250007"/>
               <p>an attorney, who could defend prisoners—Mr. Henson told me himself he was an attorney who could conduct the defence, and said he should want some money to get a copy of the depositions from Mr. Sawyer, of Enfield—he wanted the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for them—he delivered me a letter as the at<lb/>torney for the prisoner, to Mr. Sawyer, which I saw him write—I took it to Mr. Sawyer myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The remainder of the money was to prepare a brief, and deliver it to my learned friend? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he told me with his own mouth Mr. Phillips was going to plead for my son—he did get a copy of the depositions—I cannot say whether he prepared a brief—I saw a brief—before the brief was prepared, Mr. Henson read over the depositions to me at the George—he went to see my son two or three times at Newgate, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not Mr. Henson who said, when he was brought to you by Wiggins, that he was an attorney, that he would defend your son, and after<lb/>wards tell you he had given a brief to Mr. Phillips? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and that he had employed Mr. Phillips—I am sure he said he had employed Mr. Phillips, and that Mr. Phillips would certainly see my son righted—I have never been before any Magistrate about this—Mr. Henson had no opportunity of knowing what I should say to-day—my sister has seen Mr. Henson—I authorized her to say if he would return my money again, I would not proceed in it—I never said I would settle it if Mr. Henson would give me back 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—nor authorize my sister to say so—Mr. Henson told her he was going into the country for a little money, and if she would wait till he came back, he would come to Enfield to return the counsel's fee to me—he said he knew very well he had done a thing that was very wrong, and he was very sorry for it—he said so to my sister, who is here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it correct that he said he was Mr. Phillips's clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he certainly said that, I am quite sure of it—he said so the first time I saw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had anybody spoken to you about counsel on the outside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it was not Wiggins who spoke about being clerk to Mr. Phillips—Wiggins said he did not know any thing about Henson being clerk to Mr. Phillips—he did not tell me Henson was an attorney, he told me so himself, as soon as I saw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did Henson tell you he was clerk to Mr. Phillips? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Up at the George public-house, the first time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did he say he was an attorney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first time, at least he said he was clerk to Mr. Phillips—not that he was an attorney—he did not use the expression, "I am an attorney," at all—he told me he should give Mr. Phillips the money, and he would see my son righted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did he say he was an attorney? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said it the day I was at the George—he said he was clerk to Mr. Phillips—he said once at the George that he was an attorney—he said he was an attorney, and that he was clerk to Mr. C. Phillips—I am sure he used the word clerk—he did not say he should act as clerk—I should not have parted with my money, on his saying he was an attorney, without his adding that he was clerk to Mr. Phillips—it gave me great comfort his saying he was clerk to Mr. Phillips, because I thought it was quite right.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Give us his words as near as you can? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him what the expense would be, and he told me—I said I had come to see who she paid the money to, as I had been duped by a party before, and wished to see if she was paying it to any body who would defend the boy—he said if he took it by false pretences he should be taken off the rolls—he said he worked, or done business for Mr. Phillips, as well as Mr. Clarkson—he did not say in my presence that he was clerk to Mr. Phil<lb/>lips —he said the expense would be three guineas.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you look at the list? Yes—I did not see any counsel's name to it—I knew nothing about it on the first day of the Sessions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">HORRY, ESQ</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in any way retained as counsel in the case of William Street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a brief brought to me on the Friday morning before the man was tried, which was on the Saturday, the following day—there was no fee paid with the brief—I cannot recollect whether I had been spoken to before about defending the prisoner—I have a memorandum that I had the brief delivered to me on the Friday morning—I did not put my initials to the paper on the first day of the Session—I put them on the Saturday morning—I did not pro<lb/>mise the person who delivered me the brief that I would attend to the case—when the brief was delivered to me by a person who I never saw before, he said that Mr. Henson would call on me in a short time—I waited for his seeing me, and on Saturday morning, as I did not see him, I sent a mes<lb/>sage, and came down here at nine o'clock—then being particularly required to go away I put my initials to the paper in case anything should be said about the case, but between nine and ten something occurred which led me to return and strike my initials out—on previous occasions I have had briefs from Mr. Henson, and have had the fee paid afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any professional objection to your saying why you struck your initial out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will state it—between nine and ten o'clock I un<lb/>derstood that the prisoner had been brought to the bar the night before, or some time before, and had stated that Mr. Phillips was his counsel, and I said under those circumstances I could not hold a brief of a case in which another gentleman's name was mentioned, I should therefore decline hold<lb/>ing it, and I sent a message by a person to that effect—I have never seen Mr. Henson on the subject—I received an answer from him through two parties I saw in this Court—Wiggins was not one of them—I have no<lb/>thing to do with Wiggins at all—the answer I received was that Mr. Henson was very ill in bed, but would endeavour to attend—the message I sent was that I must see him, and that was the answer I received on two occasions—I received no fee—the fee marked was one guinea.</p>

On the 13th of October I was in St. Martin's-lane, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I had a purse in my right-hand coat-pocket, containing seven half-crowns, three shillings, and two sixpences—I did not feel any thing at my pocket—I knew nothing of it till the policeman drew my attention to it, I then felt, and missed my purse—I saw Holmes with Sergeant Langley, when he asked me if I had lost my purse—this was about 100 yards past Northumberland-house—Sergeant Langley had hold of Holmes by the arm—he was close to me—I saw Dooley at the station the same afternoon—this is my purse, and its contents.</p>

On the Thursday morning, 16th September, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner leading a mare—he asked if I could tell him where there was a horse-slaughterer's—I said there was none in our village, but there was one a mile and a half off at Paddington—I asked why he wished it killed—he said some one had stabbed it—I found a large wound, which I could put my hand in—it was quite fresh done, and was bleeding—I asked where it was done—he said he had turned it out on Roxley-heath common, and some one had done it in the course of the night out of spite to him—I said I did not consider the entrails were hurt, and persuaded him to take it home again—he said he had taken it to a farrier's in the neighbourhood, who had probed the wound to a great depth, twelve or fourteen inches, measuring it on his arm, that he had said the entrails were cut, and he had better dispose of it—he said he was a poor man, and could not do without a horse, he must make the best he could of it, put some more money to it, and buy another—I called Mortimer, my neighbour, across, and his opinion was the same as mine, that the entrails were not cut, and advised him to take it home—the prisoner went away towards Paddington—I afterwards saw the same pony at Guildhall.</p>

I was standing at my door in West-street, with my baby in my arms—I saw the prisoners, Sampson and Kemp, go up and Kemp take the prosecutor by the right arm—the prosecutor's friend came to his assistance from the opposite side—I saw Sampson snatch the prosecutor's watch from his right side pocket, and give it to Kemp, who then ran down Black-boy-alley—Sampson immediately followed him down the alley—I was nearly close to them—the other two ran towards Saffron-hill—there were four in number at first—the prosecutor's friend came up to him before the watch was taken, and the whole of them set on both of them—they had no power of resistance—it was a silver watch, with a yellow chain—I saw it in Kemp's hand, and Sampson's also—I think the prosecutor made a sort of trial to get the chain from him—there were four persons fell on him, but I think there were six or seven round—I knew both the prisoners perfectly well before that by sight and name—I have seen them twelve or fourteen in a gang together—Sampson went by the name of <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Taylor—I have heard them call him by that name—I have seen him for the last eighteen months, and Kemp about the same time—I knew them directly I saw them go up to the prosecutor, and thought they were going to rob him—I swear they are the men.</p>

On Sunday, the 4th of July, I was on duty at the bottom of West-street—I saw a scuffle with six or eight people—I immediately ran up and saw Kemp holding the prosecutor by the right arm—there was a cry of "Police"—I saw Taylor and Kemp run towards Black-boy-alley—there was something yellow hanging out of the hand of Taylor, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Samson, which appeared to be a watch-chain—I knew both the prisoners before—I have seen them frequently—Sampson always went by the name of Taylor before—I saw Kemp holding the pro<lb/>secutor's arm, and a scuffle, and heard a cry of "Police"—I pursued them to the end of the alley, but did not overtake them, as the prosecutor caught hold of my arm and said he was robbed, or I might have apprehended one on the spot, but that stopped me—I said, "I Know you are robbed of a watch"—I did not see Kemp again till the 17th of September, when I appre<lb/>hended him, and took him to Rosoman-street station—I applied to the prosecutor the same evening—he knew him when he saw him—I saw Samp<lb/>son about the 18th or 19th September, at Tothill-fields, by the name of Philip Sampson—I heard he was there, and went—I knew him to be the man immediately—I took the prosecutor to see him—he was shown to the prosecutor alone in the prison dress—a turnkey stood with him, but not any prisoners—he said he believed him to be the man, but should not like to swear to him in the prison dress—his dress was not altered—I had no doubt of him.</p>

Between seven and eight o'clock that night I saw the prisoner going across the market with this piece of flannel under his arm—he said he was going to take it to his master's, in Holborn—I said I should go and see where he took it to—he then threw it at me, and ran off—he was taken by the police<lb/>man—I took the flannel up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Harefield, near Uxbridge. I had thirty fowls belonging to my father, James Matthews, in a field close by our house, on the 26th of July—I saw the two prisoners hunting the fowls up and down the field—I laid down behind a hedge, and saw Bugbee take up one fowl—he threw it down, and it came back to our place—I pursued them, and Bugbee threw away a dead fowl—Day was with him—we missed seven fowls that day—I picked up the fowl he threw down—I can<lb/>not swear to the dead one—they had skinned it, and cut its head and legs off—I pursued them two miles and a half—they escaped—the fowl I sat him throw down alive was mine.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">A prisoner.</hi>) I am sixteen years old, and have been in gaol since the Magistrate committed me—I was in the service of Mr. Benjamin Robinson, in Little Britain—I was working in the farriery—I know Clark—my master had some nails for securing the shoes of horses at his farriery. On the 23rd of September I took 43lbs. weight of my master's nails to Clark—I know there was 43lbs., because I weighed them—the nails were kept in a loft at my master's—there was one sort of nails, and three sizes of the sort—I took them wrapped up in some tow, from one to two o'clock in the day—I had been to Clark once before with an old man—when I got there on the 23rd of September I saw Couch, who is a man who Clark keeps—I told him I had brought some nails—he said I was to wait till Clark came in—Clark was out—I waited an hour and a half—when he came he told Couch to go and weigh them—when Couch came back he told Clark there were 43lbs., and Mrs. Clark said I must take 4lbs. off for the wrappers—Clark gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Couch took the nails</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal clerk to Mr. Benjamin Robinson. On the 1st of September I received three bags of nails, called sixes, sevens, and eights—they weighed 5cwt. 1qr. 17lbs. —they were put in a loft over the farrier's shop—in consequence of information I examined and weighed them on the 29th of September—there were 2cwt. 2qrs. deficient, besides what we had used, which I suppose was about 1cwt.—in consequence of suspicion I questioned Barber, and he made a disclosure to me on the sub<lb/>ject of these nails—in consequence of what he said, I weighed 20lbs. of the nails, we had left, and marked about fifty of them—we gave the nails to Barber to take as he used to do—I and a policeman whom I had sent for, went in plain clothes, and followed Barber—he went to Clark's shop between three and four in the afternoon—he waited about an hour and a half—I saw Clark go in a few minutes previous to Couch coming out to weigh the nails—he took them to a chandler's shop directly opposite where we were waiting—in five or ten minutes after Couch returned to Clark's shop, Barker came out—he gave the officer 4s,—we then went into the shop—the officer pointed to the nails and said, "I have come about these nails"—Clark said to the man in the farrier's shop, "You make haste and shoe my horse"—the officer then told Clark he must go along with us—when he got outside, and saw we were determined to take him, he en<lb/>deavoured to make his escape, and said he knew nothing about the nails—on the following morning I examined the back wall at Clark's shop—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184110250047"/>
               <p>the wail was very much scratched on Clark's side—they were such scratches as would be made by a parcel of nails being got up and thrown over the wall, they appeared quite fresh, and by the side of the wall on Clark's side I found one nail, and three nails on the other side—they were the same sort as belonged to my master—since then 2cwt. all but 12lbs. of nails, have been produced by Mrs. Twigg, which are of the same descrip<lb/>tion and size as my master's—I believe them to be his property, and they and the others which have been found make up nearly the amount we lost.</p>

I think I hear it now!"—and he said, "I did not intend to kill either Mr. Burdon, or his wife; I did not intend to hurt them, or touch them at all; I intended kill my own wife, and then myself; and had not Burdon got up between me and my wife, he would not have been hurt at all; but after I stabbed my wife the first time, he got up, and the second thrust I intended for my wife took him"—I frequently cautioned him, and said, "You are not like an ignorant man, and of course know what you say I shall be obliged to repeat again"—this was about ten minutes to one o'clock, in the morning of the 26th of September.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, and live in Suffolk-lane, City. I have been acquainted with the prisoner's family about eight or nine years—in 1839, at the instance of his friends, I went down to Footscray, in Kent—I found him there—he told me he had come there to open a baker's shop—I saw the house he had taken for that purpose—it was a gentleman's cottage, with a garden in front, and a carriage-drive</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184110250058"/>
               <p>round it—he was not living at the house at that time, but at an inn in the village—the house was about three-quarters of a mile out of the village, and stood by itself—it was not a place in the least adapted for the busi<lb/>ness of a baker—I was shown the house—he was not with rue at the time I saw it—I spoke to him afterwards on the subject—I inquired of him what had been his motive in taking such a house to open a baker's shop in—his answer was, that he thought it very pretty—I afterwards walked up to the house with him, but did not go in—he admitted it was the house he had taken—I conversed and expostulated with him, for about two hours, on the folly of the proceeding—he seemed to have no know<lb/>ledge of the process of making bread, beyond the fact of its being baked in the oven, and he said he had engaged a bricklayer to build an oven in the house for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he had obtained a loan from a gentleman in the City of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was his whole money to begin with he had spent 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. already in expenses, and he proposed to bake bread, and carry it to London in a cart, for which he would hire horses from a livery-stable keeper in London—I endeavoured to show him the impossibility of carrying out such a scheme, even at the first step, on the money that should remain after he had paid for the oven, and I asked him if he had any further prospect of money—he acknowledged that he had none, save a promise from the same gentleman, that if this could be proved to be bene<lb/>ficially employed, he might then advance him as much more, and that this was to be returned in twelve or eighteen months—I can hardly remember now what he said when I remonstrated with him, but he seemed utterly insensible, and unable to apply my arguments—I asked him if he meant to get credit for flour—he said no, but he thought any one would supply him with flour who knew he was going to open a baker's shop—I asked if he had any means of getting customers, if he had any connexion—he said no, but any one would buy his bread if he drove from door to door, and said it was baked in the country—I was not able to induce him to abandon the scheme, or to make any impression—he did not appear in the least capable of comprehending my reasons—I understood from him that there was no furniture in the cottage; the only articles he had purchased were some knives and forks, and, I believe, a coal-scuttle, or something of the sort—he did not say any thing about how it was to be procured—I then left him, and came to London—he had been acquainted with me for years—I think he remained at Footscray two or three days after I left him, because I found he had written to his family, at the end of that period, from Dorking, having gone there from Footscray—I went to Dorking, and he bad gone to Hastings—I waited at Dorking till he re<lb/>turned there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he give any account of his reasons for going to Dorking and Has<lb/>tings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To see if he could find a baker's business there—I learned from him that he had made an agreement with a baker at Dorking, to take his baker's business at a certain date, and give a deposit of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was then possessed of about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I strongly endeavoured to dissuade him from going on with that scheme—I succeeded so far as this, that he agreed to return home, and to give up his schemes, but on consideration that his father would endea<lb/>vour to set him up in business in the country—I reported to his father all that passed—I afterwards saw the prisoner in town—I told him an uncondi<lb/>tional submission was requisite to be received at home again, and that his father would not consent to set him up in business—the prisoner dis<lb/>played a most violent degree of passion; his face became livid, and his</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in partnership with John Gould<lb/>smith, of Qloudesley-terrace, Islington. I know the prisoner, and have visited him professionally—I remember, among other occasions, seeing him, on the 24th of April, in consequence of what had been represented as a severe fall—I went to visit him since, but had great difficulty in seeing him—I have considered him in an unsound state of mind from the 8th of July last; indeed, from the 24th of April I did not think his mind sound—on the 24th of April he was living in William-street, Chalk-road—I found him at that time flushed; he appeared to have been drinking; we entered into conversation; he was hurried; he appeared to have a great number of projects in his mind, and told me boastfully of the money he had made and could make from his secrets—I mentioned to him that there was a Frenchman in London who said he had the power of producing a blue dye without the use of indigo—he appeared to catch at that circumstance, and in a moment he said, "Oh, I have got it, I have it; that is worth a thousand pounds to me; thank you; I will make you a handsome pre<lb/>sent"—he appeared in an excited and hurried state—I should say it was inconsistent with the liquor he had had, but arose from something more—by the request of his relatives I saw him, on the 8th of July, in the place where he resided, within a door or two of his mother's—it was a coach-house and stable, surrounded by a wall—his sister accompanied me to the place—she knocked at the door—he asked who was there—she said, "It is me Charles"—he then cautiously opened the door, and she said, "Mr. M'Crea has come to speak to you about my mother, who is very ill"—he replied, "I don't want to see him, I shan't see him," shutting the door in</p>

               <p>my face, which I prevented by putting my foot between the door and the cill—he then became very violent, took up a post or piece of timber, and said he would knock my brains out if I did not leave instantly, and I left—I had given him no reason for conducting himself in that way to me—he would not let me in—I saw his relatives afterwards, and expressed my opinion of his state of mind, and recommended that he should be put under confinement—I was prepared to certify that that was necessary—on Saturday, the 9th of this month, I saw him at the police-station, Islington-green—he was lying on the floor in a state of hysterical insensibility, and partly drunk—I could form no judgment of him then—I left, and returned in about an hour and a half—he was then sitting on a bench, and the mo<lb/>ment he recognised me he got up in a violent rage, struck at me and kicked at me—if it had not been for the police he would probably have injured me—next morning, about nine o'clock, I visited him again, accompanied by Barlow—for caution's sake, Barlow was first sent in to him—I placed my<lb/>self in a position out of sight of him, but where I could hear what passed—Barlow said that his mother and sister were greatly distressed, and had mentioned something to him about a conspiracy—he replied quickly, "They are at the bottom of it; I know all about that, but I have tricked them"—he said, as soon as he got out he would settle matters with that brother of his—I then advanced towards the door, spoke to him through the grating of the door, and asked him about the conspiracy—I said, "Your mother and sister appear greatly distressed that you should have such an idea"—he said, "I know all about it, and know what you are come for, and you may take your leave"—I then asked him what had become of the bottle of prussic acid which he had had in his pocket—he said, "What do you know about the bottle of prussic acid?"—I said, "Because you asked for it last night"—he then very cunningly said, "Oh, oh, might I not have something else in my pocket in a bottle besides prussic acid?"—he was agitated and irritable, and I took my leave—I observe a twitching and irritation about the nerves of his face now—I have not had opportunities of observing it before, I have had so few opportunities of seeing him—I have been in practice thirty years, and have had several cases of unsound mind—in my judgment he is not accountable for his acts, because he is labour<lb/>ing under a state of unsound mind.</p>

On Sunday, the 10th of October, I saw him at the police-station, Islington-green—I asked him how he was, and said I was sorry to see him there, and for the circumstance which occasioned his being there—he said he was much obliged to me—he said somebody had put a deleterious drug into his liquor the preceding evening, which so stupified him that he did not know what he was about—he said his mother and sister had sent the drug to put into his drink—I said his mother and sister were in a state of great distress about him—he said that was all stuff and non<lb/>sense, they were the cause of his being put there—I said, "I am sure that is not so; I do not see how it is possible"—he said, "They are"—I said, "They are in great distress about you, and they have told me you have an idea that a conspiracy is formed against you"—he said, "Yes, and they are at the bottom of it"—I said I felt certain they could not be at the bot<lb/>tom of it, on account of their having expressed so much sorrow at what had taken place, and the grief they appeared to be in—he said, "Pshaw, they are not in grief about me, they are at the bottom of it"—I said, "If any body formed a conspiracy against you, they would have had the op<lb/>portunity of carrying it into effect long since"—he said, "I have been too deep for them"—a policeman came in, and I was obliged to leave—the same morning Mr. M'Crea went to see him, and the moment he saw him he said, "I say, that is Mr. M'Crea, I don't wish to have any thing to say to you; I know what you are come about"—Mr. M'Crea observed, that he came there as a friend, and wished to talk with him for his good, and told him it was a serious matter his having fired a pistol—he said, "Me fired a pistol! I have fired no pistol"—Mr. M'Crea asked what he had done with the bottle of prussic acid he had in his pocket—he said, "What is that to you?"—I should most certainly think him of unsound mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Read, who is occasionally the master of a vessel—he is not so at present. On the 18th of August last year, my husband was at sea—I had known the prisoner before that, by his calling to see Mary Ann Barton, a young person who lodged with me—on the evening of the 18th of August, I was standing at my door—my daughter and Ann Dye, my niece, were with we—the prisoner came up and asked for Mary Ann Barton, and asked where she was living—I told him in Sydney-street—he then wished to come in and have some wine to drink—I consented, as he was not a stranger, and we went into the kitchen—a bottle of port wine was sent for—the prisoner gave Ann Dye the money, and she went for it—I think he gave her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not observe whether he took it out of a purse—we drank that bottle, and the prisoner proposed having a second—he gave some money for a second, and Ann Dye went for it—he took that money from his pocket—I did not see his purse at that time—after she was gone for the wine, the prisoner sat at the opposite table and was looking at his purse, counting his money over—he had a purse, and I saw some money in it, but I do not know what amount—it appeared to be sovereigns—I thought he looked very serious,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184110250066"/>
               <p>and asked what was the matter—he said he had missed half-a-sovereign—he put the money in his purse again, and said he knew where he had been previous to coming to my place, that it was a very short distance, and he would go and ascertain whether he had given it for a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he said he had called for a glass of half-and-half, that he did not approve of it, and had 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin-and-water—he then left the house—he came back in about ten minutes or rather better—Ann Dye came back about the same time—I was still in the kitchen with my daughter and Ann Dye—the second bottle of wine was not touched at all—the prisoner said he should like to have a pint of half-and-half and a smoke of a pipe—Ann Dye fetched it, and we all sat down—I got up to snuff the candle, and he pulled me on his knee—I got off immediately, and took my seat again—he afterwards put his hand on Ann Dye's bosom, and she boxed his ears—my daughter was in the room the whole of the time—the prisoner said he thought he should stop and lodge there that night—I said I had no convenience for any thing of the sort—he then attempted to go—he got off his seat and missed his purse directly, and said he had lost his purse in the house—I was quite surprised to think he should accuse us of such a thing—he said he had lost it in my house, and he insisted on knowing the particulars—he immediately went up into the street, called in two policemen, said he had lost his money in my premises, and gave us in charge—he said he had lost his purse at the time he pulled me on his knee—I refused to go to the station, and one of the policemen behaved very ill indeed to me, and wanted to take me without a bonnet or shawl—the prisoner did not say any thing about what I bad better do, or about letting me go, nor about giving him back his money—he said we should go to the station—he would insist on saying the money was lost in the house, and the house was searched at the very instant—he did not say any thing about how I might turn the policemen out—very few words passed at the time—the policeman searched him, to see whether he had got a purse, and did not find it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have a house in the parish of Stepney. On the 27th of September I went to bed about half-past eleven, or a quarter to twelve o'clock—I was the last person up—I saw part of the house fastened, and the servant fastened the other part—he is not here—I saw the man fasten the parlour window-shutters and the street door—I went out through the back-door about eleven o'clock, but I did not see it fastened afterwards—I do not of my own knowledge know it was fastened, but the entrance was effected through the parlour window—I came down stairs about six o'clock in the morning—I found both the parlour and kitchen in confusion, every thing was turned out of the drawers—I saw the glass of the parlour-window had been cut near the fastening, the fastening undone, and the window-sash pulled down—the fastening of the shutter had not been touched at all—the shutters do not go far enough up to the top, and they had got over the top—the shutter was still fastened when I found it—it had not the appearance of having been removed at all—lucifer-matches were strewed about the whole of the room—a cupboard had been broken open, and I missed the property stated—I did not hear the least noise in the night—the shutters reach to within one pane, or rather more, of the top— there was plenty of room for the body of a man between the shutter and the ceiling—the window was fastened when I went to bed—there are two</p>

About half-past nine o'clock, on the morning of the 29th of September, I saw the prisoner walking behind the prosecutor—he lifted up the tail of his coat, and took the handkerchief out—I cried "Stop thief," and followed him—he turned up Little Queen-street, and there I lost sight of him—he was taken by the policeman.</p>

I was sent for, and went into the loft—the prisoner was lying there, with the shoes on his feet, and the handkerchief on his head—I conveyed him to the station—in going along, Allen asked him what he had done with the shirt—he said lie never had a shirt—Allen said he had better tell—he then said he sold it for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went and got it—the stable had been broken through some boards—he had broken the lock on the corn-bins, and got these things out.</p>

On Wednesday, the 13th of October, between four and five o'clock, a boy came to my house to change a sovereign—he bought some biscuits—I gave him eighteen shillings and two fourpenny-pieces—I do not know who he was.</p>

About five o'clock in the evening of the 13th of October, the prisoner came down stairs and went down the area into the front kitchen, towards the cellar—I afterwards searched the cellar, and found this pocket-book containing the articles in question—six of us went down to search—I found it about half-past two o'clock.</p>

I have done nothing, I am innocent"—they got up against a water-spout by a gate belonging to an undertaker—the man caught hold of the water-spout—the policeman snatched him away, and he fell to the ground—the policeman lifted him up from the ground with his left hand—his staff was in his right—the man said, "Don't ill-use me, if I am to go to the station, I will be quiet"—as soon as he said that, I saw a man snatch the staff out of Carroll's hand, and strike him with it over the left eye—he fell to the ground directly, and the man ran away—I did not perceive that he had the staff with him when he ran away—when the man struck the policeman, the prisoner was about six or eight yards from the spot, in custody of other policemen, and continued there—Carroll fell as soon as he was struck with the staff—I helped to lift him up, and he was put into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he was insensible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bridger, a miller, and live at Stanley-bridge, Fulham, in the parish of Fulham. On Tuesday night, the 26th of October, I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock—I fastened the house up myself—I had been to bed about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, when I heard a noise at the front door—I got out of bed, looked out of window, and stood at the window nearly a minute, when I saw two men come out of my door—one was the prisoner—I cannot say who the other man was—Weller had something under his arm, but whether</p>

               <p>it was any thing more than his umbrella, or not, I cannot say—I knew Weller before—it was moonlight, and there was a gas-light in front of the house—I did not observe whether the other man had any thing—they went across the road where the gas-light was, in the direction for the Bull-alley, which is a little distance from my house—I then left my window and ran down stairs as fast as I possibly could—when I came to my door they were returning from the Bull-alley, and they came straight into my house, and called for a pint of beer—I had then missed all the things stated, off the horse, by the tap-room fire—I had been washing, and hung them up after I had fastened my house up—I drew them a pint of beer, and they had twopenny worth of bread and cheese—I afterwards brought them another pint of beer, in the meanwhile my husband was searching for a policeman, and the things—a policeman came, and we then gave them into custody—my things were brought to me a little before eight next morning—the house had been entered by the front door, which fastens with a spring-lock—with a hard force the spring would fly open.</p>

The prisoner was my errand-boy between five and six weeks—I dismissed him on the 27th of September, and three or four days after I missed a silver lancet-case and razor from my surgery, and two days after I missed three seals from my wife's writing desk in the parlour—I next saw the prisoner on the 11th of October, and gave him in charge for throw<lb/>ing a handful of mud in at my door—his father and mother came, and I accused him of stealing the razor—his mother persuaded him to tell the truth whether he had taken it or not, and said it would be better for him to tell.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 19th of October I was in my carriage in Sloane-street, about two o'clock in the afternoon—one of my horses became restive, and threw himself down—I descended, with a view of assisting my servants and the by-standers in extricating the horse—when we had done that, a person asked if I had been robbed—I searched, and found my purse had been extracted from my coat-pocket—it contained the money stated—I saw it in the hand of a person immediately after the robbery—this now produced is it.</p>

On Satur<lb/>day morning, the 28th of August, I received information of an offence about to be committed—in consequence of which I went to Mr. Drake's house in Camden-villas, about eight o'clock on Sunday night the 29th of August—I took three policemen there, left them in the house, and placed them in different parts—on the Sunday evening at a quarter past seven, I saw the prisoner in company with one Jones, within about 300 yards of Mr. Drake's house, and near to the Robin Hood beer-shop, there was the prisoner, Jones and Cole, all three together—at five minutes after nine I saw Jones and Johnson leave the same beer-shop together, they appeared to go towards Mr. Drake's house, but I lost them, as I wanted to avoid their seeing me—about half-past nine I went into Mr. Drake's house, and found the prisoner and Jones both in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a soap-manufacturer in High-street, Wap<lb/>ping, my premises are by the river-side, close to where the Tunnel will open, at the bottom of Old Gravel-lane; the back of the premises is bounded by Brewhouse-lane—Brosnan has been in my employ about two years, and was employed in the fancy soap-manufactory, which was then at the back of the premises adjoining Brewhouse-lane—there is another soap-maker's at the top of Old Gravel-lane, and a small manufactory about the centre of Old Gravel-lane, but not very near my premises. On the 23rd of September, the witness Austin called at my counting-house, and gave me some information—I directed him to go and look among my men—he came back and gave me some further information—in consequence of what he told me, I called Brosnan before me, not in Austin's presence—my son, who was in the counting-house, first said to him, "You have robbed us"—he replied, "You cannot prove that"—I immediately said, "That is no answer, you have robbed me"—he turned exceedingly pale and became much agitated—he caught hold of the bars in the counting-house before the desk, and after a little while he said, "It is too true;" or I have robbed you"—I cannot exactly say which of the two sentences he uttered, but either one or the other he certainly said—I asked him to what extent—he said, "Not to much"—I said, was it to the extent of 5cwt.?—he said, it might be—I said, perhaps it was half a ton, for I began to be a little alarmed—he said, yes, it might be half a ton—I then said to him, "Now, it will be better for you to tell the whole"—I afterwards desired him to go to his work, and sent for an officer—he was taken into custody about ten minutes afterwards—after being in custody about a fortnight he was discharged—he never had any authority to sell any soap—from the extent of my stock a considerable quantity might easily be taken away without its being missed.</p>

I have done it, and he has returned the money to me—I remember a man called <hi rend="italic">Patty</hi> being there—he is an Irish-man—Patrick, I believe, is his right name—he goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Patty</hi>—he has been there a good many times—on one occasion when <hi rend="italic">Patty</hi> was there, Mason said to his wife, "Move the soap into the kitchen, and don't let <hi rend="italic">Patty</hi> know we get any from Wapping"—I remember the day on which Mason was apprehended—I watched his house for some time after that, and I law the prisoner Brosnan leave the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, Tower-street, Vauxhall. In De<lb/>cember last I was in Mason's service—he first employed me to go with him to fetch some soap—we went to Wapping, to the back entrance of Mr. Charles's premises—when I went with him he left me, and I did not see where he went for the soap—I do not know that he went to Mr. Charles's then, but I know he did go there, because I have gone by myself at other times with a note which he has given me to receive soap—when he gave me a note I went to Mr. Charles's back premises, and knocked—Brosnan opened the door, I delivered the note to him, and he took my basket and filled it—I received 56lbs. of soap each time I went, sometimes more, and sometimes less—before that I had gone with Mason on various occasions—he has gone away, and when he came back he bad a basket full of soap, sometimes 1/2 cwt., and sometimes 3/4—I delivered the soap which Brosnan gave me to Mason—the 18th of January was the last time I went with a note—I cannot say how many times I had brought soap before that, but I had brought it away for about five weeks by myself—I do not know whe<lb/>ther the soap I brought on the 18th was marked or not—some of the soap was—I have heard Mason say it was Mr. Charles's mark, and it was to be cleaned—I cannot read myself, or else I could have made it out—it has been cleaned before I delivered it to the shops—by cleaning, I suppose he meant the mark was to be cleaned off—I delivered the soap to him, and went home, and next day, perhaps, I went to deliver it to the shop-keep<lb/>ers for him—Mason did not keep any shop at that time—I have not said any thing to Brosnan when I have gone for the soap—he has delivered the soap to me, and I have delivered to him the money—sometimes half-a-sovereign, and sometimes a sovereign—I cannot say what particular money I delivered on the 18th—sometimes they settled between them—I do not know when—I have been to Mason's house sometimes on Sunday but was not in the habit of doing so—I have never seen Brosnan there at all.</p>

               <p>—he was about seventy-two or seventy-three years old—about three weeks before the Coroner's Inquest I attended him for ill health—that ill<lb/>ness, I should say, had nothing to do with his death. On Saturday morn<lb/>ing, the 18th of September, between five and six o'clock, I was called to see him, by Conner, the policeman—I went to his house and saw him—he was dead, but not cold—I thought he had been dead about two or three hours—I made an external examination of him then, and found a cut on the right eye, with ecchymosis, which is coagulated blood, and an abrasion on the right temple, with contusion, and a bruise on the left eye, a slight cut on the lower jaw, just below the eye, and he was bleeding slightly from the mouth—that blood came from the head—some internal injury in the head produced it—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination with Mr. Atkins—I found extravasated blood between the membranes of the brain, and coagulated blood at the base of the brain, the middle hemisphere of the brain highly inflamed, and a quantity of bloody serum in the left lateral verticle of the brain—those symptoms were quite sufficient to account for death—there was blood on the pillow—these symptoms were produced by some external injuries—I should say a blow or fall, or blows and falls, would account for it—if blows were inflicted a few days before, there would have been the same appearances—he was in bed lying on his left side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Thursday, about half-past two o'clock, I received information of the copper having been stolen—from that information, and from my own suspicions, I came to town, and in the Borough I overtook the prisoner Towers' carriers-cart—it was standing still when I first saw it, and a young man named Cole was in it—in about a quarter of an hour Towers came to the cart, got into it, and drove over London-bridge—he stopped at a public-house, and got down, but took nothing out—he then got up again, and drove direct to White-street, Cutler-street, Hounds-ditch, to a marine store-shop—he got down from the cart there, and went in—he returned in four or five minutes, and said something which I did not hear to Cole, who was in the cart, upon which Cole handed him a hamper, which Towers took on his shoulder, and carried into the marine store-shop—I directly went into the shop, and found Towers in the act of taking the copper out of a sack out of the hamper, and the marine store-dealer was preparing the scales to weigh it—I said, "This is what I was look<lb/>ing after"—I stopped it, and took Towers in custody to Bishopsgate-street station—he there said he had bought the copper of two boys, named Barnes and Cole, for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took him to Greenwich station, and when the Inspector was booking the charge there, he said he had had the copper of the two boys, Barnes and Cole, and he had given them 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account, and he was to give them half what the copper fetched, after he had taken it to London and sold it—my brother constable apprehended Barnes, and on the following morning as I was taking him from Lee to Greenwich, he asked if Cole was come home with the cart—I said, "I don't know, why?"—he said, "I shall tell the truth about it"—I said, "Mind, whatever you may say to me will appear, and be said again in a court of justice"—he said, "I don't care, I shall tell the truth"—he said that Towers had sent for him to his father's, saying he wanted to speak to him, and when he went, he asked him to assist in lifting a heavy tub, and afterwards asked him to go and get Mr. Williams' copper, as he was going to town, and he wanted a little money, and that Towers gave him some warm beer—he afterwards said he went into the place, got the copper, put it into a sack, and carried it into Towers' stable, where it was packed in a hamper, and taken off to London—he said that another party, named Cole, was with him; that Towers asked him and Cole to go.</p>

Between nine and ten o'clock at night, on the 28th of September, I was on duty in New King-street, Deptford—a little girl came out of the King's Arms public-house, saying she had been robbed of a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Sergeant Lovell was with me at the time—the prisoner came out of the public-house, and said, "It is no such thing, she gave it us"—" No," said the girl, "it is the only 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I had; he took it out of my pocket"—I said to the prisoner, "It would be more to your advantage to spend your own money"—" You be d—d," says he, "you are as bad as the others"—Lovell went and spoke to the landlord, and he then spoke to the prisoner—I then went on my beat—about twelve I saw the prisoner again at the end of Dock-street—he appeared to know what he was doing—I passed by him—he said, "You b—y b—r, you wanted to take me into custody for a robbery"—I said, "Go to your home, I do not wish to have any thing to say or do to you"—he doubled his fist in my face, and struck at me—I threw his blow off, and he seized me by the—with his right hand—he hurt me at the time, but in the struggle I got his gripe away, and got him down—he gained his hold again, and said, "You b—y b—r, I will <hi rend="italic">do for you"</hi>—he hurt me, and I could hardly speak—Taylor, a parish constable, came up, and assisted me in getting off him—he and I took the prisoner towards the station—on our way we met Pritchard, and Pritchard and I took him to the station—on the way he said, "Only for this constable having hold of me, you b—y rascal, I would rip your b—y guts open, or do you bodily injury; I don't care a d—n for you; Dr. Drury will stand my friend; or, if he don't, Mr. O'Connell will"—I had known the prisoner before—he had been about eighteen months from Ireland, the last time—I felt pain all that night, and the night following, from the gripe the prisoner gave me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George John Lloyd, of Thorn-cottage, East Brixton. The prisoner was in our service eighteen months, as cook, and left on the 18th of July—Mr. Elphick is our butcher—we generally paid him every week—the bills were generally brought to me first, and I employed the prisoner to pay them—I furnished her with the money weekly—these six bills now produced are Mr. Elphick's bills—they run from February 17th to March 27th—they were sent to me regu<lb/>larly, but being small amounts, they were allowed to run, and on the 1st of April I gave her the amount, not separately, but altogether, with the six bills—they were afterwards returned to me, purporting to be receipted by Jane Elphick.</p>

                  </hi>, junior. I was living with my mother, Catherine Stokes, at the time in question, at No. 11, Great Bolton-street, Kenning<lb/>ton-common, in the parish of Lambeth, I think—she has only part of the house—a person up stairs, named Cane, has the other part—the house is divided—Mr. Farmer is the landlord—he does not live in the house. On Saturday, the 16th of October, I left home, with my mother, at half-past six o'clock in the evening, leaving my brother Christopher in the house—we returned at eight, and found the door open—I got a light, and found my brother's drawers unlocked and empty—there had been five shirts, four pairs of trowsers, and three waistcoats in it, also a frock-coat—several things were taken out of my mother's drawers—three dresses and two cloaks—the cloak and gown now produced are part of my mother's pro<lb/>perty—my brother had gone out after us.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 24th of October, about ten minutes before seven o'clock, I was watching in Tho<lb/>mas-street, and saw a person, not in custody, walking to and fro near the prosecutrix's house, in East Thomas-street—I watched him for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, at which time he was joined by the prisoner John stone—they conversed together for a few seconds, and in about ten minutes the prisoner Castles came out of No. 31 or 32 (I will not swear which, the doors are so close together), and joined them—they separated after conversing a few seconds—Castles wenton the left-hand side of the street, and Johnstone and the one not in custody on the right-hand side, walking opposite one another—I followed them to the top of Thomas-street, and at the Obelisk by London Bridge I saw Castles had something very heavy in his pockets—I saw a constable near the bridge—I then collared Castles—I told him I wanted him, and made a motion to the constable, who came towards me—the other two ran away over the bridge towards the City—they were pur<lb/>sued, and Johnstone was brought back—the other was lost altogether—I took them into a tobacconist's shop, searched Castles, and found in his coat and trowsers pocket and hat all the articles now produced—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I also found these skeleton keys, and part of a box of lucifers on him—I lost sight of Johnstone, but recognised him when he was brought back, and am sure be is the man—I knew him before the occurrence—I was about fifteen yards from him when I first saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Blackfriars-road. The prisoner was in my service. On the 30th of September I was out on bu<lb/>siness, and when I came home I thought the prisoner walked about as if he had a pair of new boots on, but I did not like to speak to him, as he had not been in the house above twenty-two hours—my lad then told me something, and I told the prisoner that my lad thought he had a pair of our boots on—he said, yes, be had, and he meant to keep them, and he had told <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> of it—I said, "What do you mean by that, why did you not tell me of it?"—I told him to sit down and pull them off—he pulled off one, I saw my mark on it, and sent for a policeman—he then began to shuffle about, and pulled a pair of shoes out of his pocket—he pulled another pair out of his pocket, and put them behind him.</p>

I was steward of the <hi rend="italic">Dido,</hi> which was at sea in Janu<lb/>ary last, lying in Benin-roads, about fifteen miles from land, on the west coast of Africa—Philip Carpenter was the master—the prisoner was chief mate—Edward Hills was second mate—on the 12th of January Mr. Carpen<lb/>ter went up the Benin river, leaving the prisoner in command of the ship— Hills was also left—in the evening the prisoner and Hills were both very much in liquor, and were quarrelling in the cabin—they appeared to be reconciled, and very good friends before they went to bed—on the morning of the 13th I was in the cabin, making the breakfast—the prisoner, Mr. Morgans, the surgeon, and Hills, the second-mate, were there—Hills came down after all the others—as he was coming down, the prisoner asked if I had called him—I said, "Yes"—he said, "What is keeping the d—d old fool from his breakfast?"—Hills was coming down the ladder at the time, and heard it—he came down the ladder into the cabin—the prisoner said, "Here comes that d—d old fool to his breakfast"—Hills repeated the words to himself, "Here comes that d—d old fool"—they had some words between them, which I did not pay much attention to, but after awhile I heard the prisoner say Hills kept private societies forward among the men—Hills stood up, shook his hand across the table at him, and said, "By G—d, Mr. Tatham, if you were on deck you would not tell me so," put<lb/>ting his fist near him—it did not go within eighteen inches of his face,</p>
