The notes were in a small box inside the large box - they were all bank notes, except two 1 l. notes. There were six half-crowns tied up in the corner of a handkerchief. In the course of the next morning, in consequence of an alarm, I went and found my trunk in the passage, broken open, and all these things gone, except two 1 l. notes - the wearing apparel was left.

            . I was in the Army, and am now a prisoner, on suspicion of being a deserter. On the 30th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was confined in the guard-house, at Hounslow, the prisoners, M'Court and Rhodes, came into the black-hole where I was, they were on duty, and did not know I was there - there was no light there. I heard M'Court say to Rhodes, that he took the box out of the room - he did not say whose box, or what room; he said he took 48 l. out of the box, and he was afraid if there were any more in the mess they would be found out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he said any thing before that - A. Not that I heard. He said he took the money, and told Rhodes to meet him at the Travellers' Friend, and then they would divide. After that he was going out, I rose up, they heard me - M'Court came, and said,</p>
               <p>"Who is that?" I said it was me. He said he supposed I heard what had passed between him and Rhodes, and I should not want for any thing while I was there. I then went into the guard-room. Next day I went out with the sergeant, and mentioned this to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long were you in the black-hole - A. Forty days. I was never in confinement before. The guard is informed if there are any prisoners, but they did not know that I was in the black-hole, as I sometimes slept in the guard-room, which is separate; you go out of doors into a passage to go to the guard-room. The prisoners were on guard, but not on sentry - they were relieved next day; I told what I heard the next time they came on guard, which, I believe, was next day. I told them I had not heard what had passed, as I was afraid they would ill-use me. He said he would knock me on the head if told what I had heard. I told the sergeant when he came.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You generally sleep in the guard-room - A. Yes; if they had been in the guard-room, and had seen I was not there, they would have known I was in the black-hole, but not otherwise.</p>

            . I am sergeant major of the regiment. Mrs. Endfield reported the robbery to me - their room is in the barracks. On that night the prisoners' duty was to be in the barracks. I searched the whole regiment - nothing was discovered. The prisoner, M'Court, belonged to Enfield's troop. Anderson had been in the black-hole about thirty-two days - he reported to me what had passed.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that - A. I cannot speak to the day, it was some few days after the robbery. In consequence of his information on the morning of the 5th of May, I was ordered to take Rhodes into custody, and found two 5 l. and two 1 l. bank notes in his pocket, concealed in an old glove. He pulled it out, I asked him what it was? he said it was nothing. I seized his hand, and found the money in the glove, which I gave to Glanville. On the same morning I searched M'Court, and found a 1 l. bank note, and two half-crowns concealed in the turn-up leather of his dress cap. Next morning I went to him, when he was in custody, and told him if he would confess this, it would be the means of saving his life. He told me there was some property in Captain

            . I am a watchman. On the 17th of April, I saw the prisoner coming up Duck-lane with two bundles - another man was with him. I put my hand on the bundle, and asked the prisoner what he had got there? he looked me in the face, and both ran off different ways; I sprung my rattle, and two watchmen came to my assistance; the prisoner ran into Duck-yard, and got off. I had seen him two or three times, but never had a view of his features before. I saw him again three weeks after - he was then dressed differently. I am sure he is the same man. I described him to Gilmore.</p>

            . I live in Short's-gardens, Drury-lane. I lodge with the prisoner, and sleep in the room with him and his wife. On the 16th of April, about half-past nine o'clock at night, he came home to supper, and did not go out till about six o'clock the next morning. I was awake before five o'clock - I am certain of it.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 14th of May, Claxton informed me of the robbery, and said he had lost his trunk - the prisoner's husband kept the house. She denied all knowledge of it; she said he had taken his chest and trunk away in a coach. I was sent for to the house again soon after, and the trunk was produced on the table - Claxton had a plane in his hand and a bunch of keys; he unlocked the trunk and missed the 10 l. note; I took the prisoner into another room, and told her that I must search her very particularly. She then took a 10 l. note from her pocket, and said it was a 1 l. note which she had found in the room the night before; it was No. 4953, dated April 22, 1819.</p>

             re-examined. I had taken my chest away in the morning, but left my trunk behind. Before I fetched Haines, I asked her for my trunk - she said I had taken it away; after Haines left, she herself produced the trunk to me; I had left a plane in it, which I found in a woman's hand in the house. The prisoner had a bunch of keys in her hand; I took them from her, and found that one of them opened my trunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I had been drinking a little, but was not intoxicated - I did not open my trunk.</p>

            . I live at Barnstead, in Surry. On Saturday, the 1st of May, about half-past<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181905260006"/>two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in town with my sister, and went to Mr. Garton's shop in Cheapside; he deals in cotton. I paid a 5 l. note there, and received four 1 l. notes and some silver in change. I put the notes into my pocket-book, with two 10 l. notes, which I had brought from home - they were marked on the back with the word</p>

               <p>"Bank," and my own name. Soon after we left Garton's, we crossed over on the Bow-church side, and were going towards Bread-street - I held my pocket-book in my hand. Very soon after we passed Bow church, some person caught at my pocket-book - I held it fast; they did not succeed for sometime. I held it fast for a small space of time; it was then taken from me by pulling and twisting it from me - I was nearly turned round before I let it go. I made all the resistance I could, and held it with both hands - it was taken forcibly from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner - A. Yes; the instant he took it from me, I saw him, and followed him with my eye. I saw him take the pocket-book out of my hand - he ran towards Bow church, then crossed, and dodged between the coaches. I pointed him out to a gentleman who passed me, and he followed him. I saw my pocket-book and notes again at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He struggled with you to get it - A. Yes; I saw the prisoner the moment he got it. He is the person who took it - I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

               <p>"Stop thief! the fellow has taken the lady's pocketbook from her!" I observed the gentleman look across the way towards the coaches, by which I supposed the prisoner had run through the coaches. I ran across the road, and saw the prisoner making towards Lawrence-lane. I overtook him in Lawrence-lane, and said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you are the person who has taken the pocket-book from the lady." He said he would strike me if I came near him. Two or three young men came up at the time. I ran to the Castle, public-house, expecting to find an officer, but did not. I ran back, and found the young men still following him. I came up - he threatened to strike me again, and said he would fight me; I did not choose to fight. I followed him to the corner of Aldermanbury, and there collared him. He struck me in the face - the others assisted in securing him, and we delivered him to Nickson at St. Lawrence bench. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am servant to Messrs. Todd and Co., who are haberdashers, and live in Fore-street. I know Hurst - I believe he is a weaver in Spitalfields. On the 27th of April I bought a piece of blue and a piece of white satin of him. I gave him 3 s. a yard for the blue, and 3 s. 3 d. for the other; they came to 22 l. together.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that an under price - A. It is a fair trader's price - I buy them for that every day. After I had bought them, on seeing the marks, I knew them to be Mr. Wilson's, and informed him of it - I told him who I bought them of. I have known Hurst some years.</p>

            . On the 28th of April I went to Messrs. Todds', and saw the two pieces of satin, which are mine. I find by my books that they were never sold. The prisoner was in the habit of coming to our house during the whole of April, to collect cotton to dye, for Mr. Summers. The satins cost me 31 l. - I should not sell them for that. My brother Stephen is my partner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. They might have been sold, and not entered - A. It is possible. This book is a copy from the waste-book.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the blue piece worth a yard - A. I should not sell it under 5 s., and the white at 5 s. 6 d. There would be a discount of 10 or 12 1/2 per cent. taken from that, which would make the blue 4 s. 6 d. and the white 4 s. 11 d.</p>

I told him to leave it, as I was going into the City next day, and would take it with me. On the 27th he brought me a piece of white satin, and that afternoon I sold them both to Crow for 22 l. Inquiry was afterwards made about them, and I immediately said the prisoner brought them to me. I went with Armstrong and pointed him out. He said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been a ribbon-weaver - A. Thirty-four years. Crow fixed the price of the satin. The prisoner told me not to take less than 3 s.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was coming out of the garden, and heard the dog making a noise - I then heard the privy door shut; the prisoner jumped out of the prosecutor's window, I caught hold of him, and asked what business he had there? he said he had been looking for work, and that his mate was in the privy. He broke from me; they followed him, calling Stop thief! I lost sight of him, as he ran through a hedge. I met a woman, she pointed him out - we ran up a lane, came up, and surrounded him; I am certain he is the man. The house had not been left open - he had climbed up a pear-tree which grows round the house, to get in at the window.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor brought the prisoner to the office - I found him sitting on a seat in the office; there were two or three small pieces of paper under his feet, the prosecutor picked them up. I found some other pieces in the lining of his waistcoat. On putting them all together, I found they made the duplicate of a shirt pledged that day at Turner's. He denied all knowledge of the pieces being in the lining of his waistcoat.</p>

On the 12th of May, between six and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came into the shop together, and asked to look at some gown prints; I was serving a customer, and told them to wait - I afterwards showed them some prints, and they fixed upon one. Ford looked confused, which made me suspect them. They asked me to take 18 d. off the print. I went round the counter, and told Ford to move from the counter, which she did. Walters stumbled against my foot, and a piece of linen fell from under her petticoats; she was then about half a yard from the counter. I am certain it fell from her person; she had a shawl on; she said she was never caught in the act before. I gave them in charge. The gown they chose would come to 7 s. 4 d.</p>

            . I am the father of the last witness. On Saturday morning, the 1st of May, I heard a rumbling in the parlour, got up, came down, and found the prisoner standing with the parlour-door in his hand. I knew him before, and asked him how he came there? he said he came there to sleep. The window was wide open, and the desk a little up. I found the paper of halfpence in his pocket, which I had seen in the desk the night before. He tried to escape, but I held him. I never gave him leave to sleep there. I saw him the night before near my premises.</p>

About the end of March last I sold the prisoner a pair of breeches for 5 s.; he said if I would meet him at night he would give me the money. I saw him a few evenings after - he said he had not got the money, but he had got the duplicate of a pair of sheets, which I should have for 3 s., and he would give me the other 2 s. as soon as he could. I did not give him a positive answer, but he left the ticket with me till he could pay me; he said they were his, and that they were a very nice pair. I gave the ticket to Davis; this is it - (looking at it.)</p>

On the 3d of May, about one o'clock in the day, the prisoner came into my shop, I went down to the bakehouse with him to look for half a crown, which he said he had dropped - we could not find it. In looking for it he put the candle out, I went up to get another light, leaving him in the bakehouse - my watch hung there then; before I returned with the light he came up stairs, saying he had not found it, but if I found it I could give it to him. I went down stairs, missed my watch, and ran up directly - he had then got out of the shop, and was running away, I pursued, calling Stop thief! a man attempted to stop him, he pushed by him, but was secured without my losing sight of him. I am certain he is the man. He was brought back, and the officer searched him in the back room. We found the watch on a sack of raspins close to where he stood.</p>

            . I am constable of Bishopsgate Ward. On Thursday, the 20th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I received information of the two prisoners coming out of a linen-draper's shop. Blakeley was seen by a woman to put something under her apron after she came out. They turned down Catherine-wheel-alley, leading to Petticoat-lane. I immediately went after them, and overtook them in conversation together. Blakeley had a basket before her, and was lifting something up underneath it. I asked her what she had got under her apron? she said she had nothing. I put my hand to her apron, and found the print under it. Brown walked a little forward - I called to a young man who was there to bring her back, which he did. I never lost sight of her, and am sure she is the woman who was with Blakeley. I searched her, and found a piece of cotton on her, which she had bought at the prosecutor's shop. I took her back to Mr. Nott's shop, and asked him if he had lost anything? he said, No, not that he knew of. I produced the piece of cotton to him, with the mark and ticket on it - he claimed it directly, and said he had not sold it. I also produced the piece which I found upon Brown - he said he had sold it to her.</p>

            . I live with my father, who is a wine and spirit broker, and lives in Great Tower-street; the prisoner was his errand-boy. One morning when I came to town, he took the two bill-cases in question, out of a drawer, and said,</p>
               <p>"See Thomas, what I found yesterday on St. Dunstan's-hill as I was going home." I asked him if he had shown them to his father, and what they contained? he said,</p>
               <p>"I have not, nor have I opened them, for I was so agitated when I found them that I knew not what to do; they are too large to go in my pocket, and I did not like to carry them home in my hand, so I returned to the counting-house, and put them in this drawer." I said he should have spoken to his father about them; and have them advertised, and said he had better speak to him as soon as possible, for if they were found upon him he might be hung; he said he knew that, and he should have spoken to him, but he had not seen him, and he was thinking of speaking to my father when he came in, which I desired him to do, and said if he liked I would mention it myself; he said I might, but afterwards that he had better state the facts himself - I told him to do as he pleased. He then opened the cases, and showed me the contents, which were a bill for 496 l. 18 s. 11 d., a 1 l. bank note, some silver and copper, some coffee warrants, and memorandums; he tied the cases up, and replaced them in the drawer. My father came in shortly after but did not stop long. When he was gone I asked him why he had not spoken to him? he said he saw no occasion for troubling my father, and had rather speak to his father, which he intended to do as soon as he got home, and he would go with him directly to the newspaper office, and have them advertised without any further delay. Next day he said they were advertised. I looked into the Times, and said it was not there; he said he knew it was not there, but it was in the the Morning Advertiser, or Chronicle, I do not remember which. I said I wondered his father had not advertised it in some other papers, as it was so large an amount. He said his father looked upon that paper as being generally perused throughout the City, and thought it sufficient; he said,</p>
               <p>"To-morrow I will tell you the result." On the morrow he informed me that he and his father had been to Messrs. Palmer and King, and restored them the cases. I asked him if they gave him any thing? he said,</p>
               <p>"No, my father would not allow me to accept any recompence, saying it was my duty to restore the property," and said there was property in the cases to the amount of 300 l. or 400 l. in bank notes, and that the gentleman suspected that the person or persons who robbed them had taken the notes out, overlooked this 1 l. note, and thrown the cases away, that some person might find them, and thence bear a suspicion of knowing something of the other property; and said</p>
               <p>"the gentlemen were fully satisfied with respect to my knowing nothing of it, were extremely obliged to my father for his trouble, and would willingly have given me some recompence, if he would have allowed him to accept it. My father has desired me to mention this circumstance to no person, for as the other property is not yet recovered, people may conjecture, by my finding the cases, that I know something of it, but as I told it to you in the first instance, and promised to tell you the result, so I have, but I earnestly entreat you not to mention it to your father or anybody, for you see how the case stands. My father does not wish it to get wind for it is a very unpleasant affair, and might bring suspicion on my family."</p>
               <p>Q. You do not remember the day this took place - A. No. My father had been robbed, and I was looking in the cupboard to see if I could discover any thing, when I found these two bill-cases - this was on the 3d of May, which was a long time after this conversation took place - it might be three weeks or more after. I immediately spoke to my father on the subject, and he went to the prosecutors'.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 10th of May, about twelve o'clock at night, I was awoke by some dirt falling down the chimney of my bed-room; I heard a noise in the yard, and got up; as I was lifting up the window I saw some lead thrown down. I called Williams and sent him and the watchman to the back of the premises, where the lead was thrown from. I went into my house, dressed myself, and saw the prisoner cross the roof of four houses; I secured him under a stack of chimnies; we took him back through my own house - he was very resolute, and threatened to throw us off the roof. When more assistance came, we took him down, and gave him in charge. I found 164 lbs. of lead thrown down at the back of the premises - it had been cut off the roof of an unfinished house, which belonged to

            , at a public-house kept by Mrs. Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of any suggestion, go to France to discover the prisoner - A. Yes; I sat off on Thursday, the 12th of November, accompanied by a friend and an officer. We went by Dover to Calais, in consequence of what we learnt; from thence we proceeded through Holland, and discovered the prisoner at Braak, in Germany, under the surveillance of - , at the hotel; I saw Mr. Macnamara there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner did any thing pass - A. On his seeing me he exclaimed</p>
               <p>"Oh God! Oh God!" in great agony, and put his hand to his face. I remained in the room; he threw himself on the floor, embraced my legs, and implored mercy. I then left the room without making any reply.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the child - A. I did, at the house of Mr. Macnamara, the Consul; it was the male child I had lost - (looks at the letter). I have seen the prisoner write, and believe it to be his hand-writing - (looks at a passport, signed S. Reynolds) - it does not appear like his usual writing, but I believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have known the prisoner many years - A. I have known him six years. Since I have been married, I believe I have seen him about three times. He is my wife's first-cousin.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you permitted to have possession of the child immediately on discovering it - A. I was not; I was told it was necessary I should identify the prisoner as the person who was named in the warrant, and I went to see him for that purpose, and that only.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not learnt, before you went to the prisoner, that it was necessary there should be some proof of your being the father of the child - A. It was intimated.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not for the purpose of getting that admitted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181905260015"/>that you went to the prisoner - A. It was not, on my oath. I think the child was kept from me six days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not restored to you at last by the prisoner's means - A. I am not aware that it was. It was determined that I should see the child without speaking to it, in the presence of the Government officers, the Consul, and others, and the child was to recognize me. This ceremony was gone through; the child was not then immediately restored to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not by the prisoner's means you got possession of the child much earlier than you should otherwise - A. I am not aware of it. He confessed it was mine without hesitation; I did not apply to him to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him that if he rendered you the assistance which the forms of that country required, you would render him every assistance you could here - A. On my oath I did not. I found the child none the worse in health for his journey; his clothes were rather coarse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time you lost it until it was restored to you - A. A little more than a fortnight. Holebrook was between sixteen and seventeen years old; she had lived a little more than two years with us.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you any doubt of the child being yours - A. No. The child came into the room, looked at two or three persons, and then at me; he gave a sort of hysteric laugh, and cried,</p>
               <p>"Oh, papa! Oh, papa! my dear papa!" He recognized his mother and the whole of the family when he came home.</p>

               <p>Q. On Sunday, the 8th of November, were you out with the children - A. Yes, and saw the prisoner in Canonbury-lane. He accompanied me to Smithfield, as far as the hospital; we arrived there about three o'clock. He said he was going to his brother's, to see if his brother's luggage was ready to take to Birmingham, as he and his brother were going there in a post-chaise - I had the children with me. He returned in about an hour, and said a coach was ready, by which I must go to Birmingham, and he would meet me there that night. He said he had taken a place for me in the name of Jackson, and gave me 2 l. I went to take the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he accompany you any part of the way - A. I left him opposite the Saracen's Head, Snow-hill, with the two children. I had the key of my master's house with me; I told him to take the key and children home, he said he would.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed before you asked him to take them home? had you expressed a wish to go with them yourself - A. Yes, and he said he would take them home himself.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you arrive at Birmingham - A. On the Monday afternoon, at five o'clock; I did not find the prisoner there - I did not see him again until he was in custody at Bow-street. I returned to town on the Wednesday, about three o'clock, and told Mr. Oldershaw what had passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He left you at the Hospital-gate with the children - A. Yes, and returned and helped me to the Saracen's Head.</p>
               <p>(The letter referred to was then put in and read, as follows:)</p>
               <p>"MUCH INJURED SIR, - I scarcely know in what words to address you, and I tremble lest the moment you discover the hand-writing of one who has so injured you, you in your indignation should tear it to pieces. My own griefs it would ill become me to speak of to you, for they are caused by the wrong I have done you; but I intreat you to consider my poor mother - you know she is an affectionate one, and that I am bringing her with sorrow to her grave. There is also a wife and a beloved infant, for whose well-being I am necessary. Let these considerations operate upon you, for in punishing my crime you must infallibly bring misery on them. Through your mercy I might yet become a creditable member of society; for while I write this I call God to witness, that through the remainder of my life I will act in an upright way, and will, by my unceasing industry, (through your mercy) support myself and family, and be a comfort to my now wretched mother in her old age. O Sir, do not deprive me of the happiness I may yet give and receive. Most sincerely do I (or may I never hereafter be forgiven my sins) repent of my cruel conduct. I blush for myself, and only dare hope to obtain forgiveness from your being a parent and a son, and having the feelings of those ties. That you may prosper in life is not more ardently wished by any than by</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury - Permit me to solicit you attention to an unfortunate young man, who wishes to state, as briefly as possible, the peculiar circumstances of his case. The course pursued by my prosecutor and his friends, who through the medium of the press, have branded me with the most gross and dishonourable epithets, renders it necessary for me most respectfully to intreat that you, gentlemen of the Jury, will take heed lest, unconsciously, you give a verdict under the influence of a mind tinctured with prejudice.</p>
               <p>I have, as it were, been hunted down and stigmatized as the worst of human beings - described as a wretch devoid of feeling - one whom every parent ought to detest. Were I that infamous person, I should at this painful moment shrink from your sight, but, with the indulgence of the Court, I shall relate facts which, I trust, will induce you to cast back upon my accuser part of the odium he has industriously endeavoured to bring upon me - facts which, I feel convinced, will place the crime with which I stand charged in a different point of view.</p>
               <p>You have heard the evidence in support of the offence imputed to me, but you are strangers to the injustice and oppression under which I have suffered. Let me intreat you, my Lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, to listen to a persecuted, much-wronged individual, and decide with that mercy and liberality which so eminently characterizes a British Court of Justice. I am the grandson of Mr.

            , late of the Inner Temple. In the course of his extensive and respectable practice he realized a considerable fortune. He possessed several estates real and personal, independent of money in the funds, to the amount of several thousand pounds. The principal freehold estate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181905260016"/>(of the estimated value of 20,000 l.) situate in and including the manor of Wesmeon, in the county of Southampton, was given, under my grandfather's will, to trustees in trust for my father (the only son and heir of his body). He amply provided for his other children out of the remaining estate and funded property. At his decease, my father entered into possession of the estate bequeathed to him, and continued in the enjoyment of it up to the time of his death, which happened at an early period. He left a widow, a daughter, and myself - from that time I date all my miseries. Mr.

            , the singer, had married my aunt, the sister of my father, who was executrix under my grandfather's will, and trustee of the estate bequeathed to my father, who at the time of the testator's decease was under age; upon her death, Mr. Dignum, as her legal representative, acted as sole trustee. My father, several years previous to his decease, was of an imbecile mind and dcoiliated constitution; he made a will in 1805, giving the whole of his property to his wife, his daughter, and myself, naming his wife executrix, and two respectable gentlemen his executors.</p>

               <p>This distribution of property not meeting the views of Mr. Dignum, he, in 1809, in concert with Mr.

            , of Hare-court, Temple, a man known to my grandfather by being often at his table. Taking advantage of my father's mental weakness, they got him to sign, at Agar's chambers, a paper, previously prepared by Mr. Agar, which gave all his real estate equally between my sister, himself, and Agar's illegitimate child. His personal estate was given to a prostitute, who had been Dignum's servant, and then cohabited with my father. They named her executrix and themselves executors, leaving his wife now unprovided for. This scandalous will answered a double purpose - in the first place, it was calculated to increase my difficulties in recovering my birthright, the seizure of which was then in contemplation, as my father's decease was an event supposed to be not very far distant - Secondly, in case I ultimately succeeded in obtaining my birthright, it might afford a comfortable provision for Agar's illegitimate offspring. My father died, surrounded by his wife and children, under the impression that he had provided for his family by the will made in 1805, the only one known by them to be in existence, he himself (such was his mental incapacity!) having no trace in his mind of the will (if it deserves the name) made in 1809.</p>




               <p>Judge of our astonishment and indignation when this villainous document was produced and read to us at Agar's chambers - Dignum acted alone as executor. After paying the tribute of crocodile tears to the memory of his departed brother, and vowing that he would be the friend of the widow and children, his first act was to lay claim to and take possession of the family estate; he then put up to sale all the personal property left by my father, including every article of furniture, which having accomplished, the widow and children were turned out of doors, to do the best they could for themselves.</p>
               <p>The property included the residue of a lease of some houses in Grafton-court, the deeds thereof being in Dignum's possession, which, on being put up for sale, found no bidders, it being stated that the securities were lost; Dignum, the executor, became the purchaser at one-fourth of the value. Whenever I endeavoured to remonstrate with him on the injustice and cruelty of depriving me of my birthright, he stopped me by tauntingly asking me why I did not take legal steps for the recovery of it? well knowing, in addition to my being under age, and without a guardian, that I had not the means of purchasing the necessaries of life, much less to defray the expences of law proceedings. He knew he ought to have given me possession as heir at law; independent of which, it was his legal as well as moral duty, as trustee, to institute a suit in a Court of Equity, if he doubted my right to the property. After a lapse of about five years, I applied to a solicitor, who, at first, warmly advocated my cause; but, after a meeting held at the chambers of my prosecutor's legal adviser, he became the solicitor of my prosecutor, who, about this time (he being in humble circumstances) married Dignum's daughter. Five years had then elapsed since my father's death, during which, my poor aged mother and myself underwent all the miseries attendant on the lowest state of poverty. Dignum, taking advantage of my distressed condition, proposed to me, that if I would give a release to my claim on the estate, he would use his interest to procure me a situation in the East India House, or some office under Government - I indignantly rejected the proposal. Sunk in poverty, and despairing of the restitution of my right, I had no resource but to propose to these oppressors to receive a small compensation for my claim. The business was negociated by my prosecutor on behalf of himself, Dignum, and a Miss Faruell, who also claimed an interest in the property. Every circumstance that appeared calculated to bring me into an acceptance of their own terms, was eagerly laid hold of by my prosecutor. My father's will of 1809, my poverty, and consequent incapacity of prosecuting vigorously with legal proceedings, were coutrasted with their ability to protract the suit for a number of years, which Mr. Horsley assured me it was their determination to do if we could not come to terms. Thus situated, I was reduced to the deplorable necessity of disposing of my title to an estate, for a sum not amounting to one-half the proceeds thereof received by my oppressors since my father's death.</p>
               <p>Under all these afflictions, they would yet have enjoyed peaceable possession of the property, had not their subsequent injustice have worked me almost to a state of frenzy. Miss Farnell, the young lady before alluded to, was left an infant orphan under my father's roof. I looked forward to her giving a proof of her gratitude to her benefactor in the person of his widow or children, particularly as she was unmarried, and had no near relatives. - she was at this time in the last stage of a fatal disorder. On the day of the compromise, she told my sister she was very unhappy, she had not a friend in the world, and had ever lamented losing the protection of her uncle Rennett - no one had ever treated her with kindness but him. Mrs. Horsley used her very ill, and she wished to alter the distribution of her property, but had no power to follow her own inclination. The following day she signed a will, leaving her property (except some gift to charity) to Dignum, Horsley, my prosecutor, and the illegitimate son of

            . She died a few days after signing the will. Dignum, the executor appointed thereto, sent a letter to my sister, stating that she was remembered by the testatrix, who had left her twelve yards of black ribbon - the rest of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181905260017"/>the family, he said, were not named. The whole of this property, amounting to several thousand pounds, was derived from my grandfather.</p>
               <p>Can it be credited that this young lady (laying under the greatest obligations to my father, and which she always readily admitted, and after what had passed between her and my sister the day previous to her signing this will), would, if left to the exercise of a free will, have so disposed of her property. Could she, then on the brink of eternity, be capable of acting such a cruel, ungrateful and deceptive part? most assuredly not. It is too revolting to common sense to suppose it.</p>
               <p>This last act of avaricious villainy inflamed me to an excess I cannot describe, and finally urged me to commit the offence which has brought me into my present unhappy situation.</p>

               <p>My Lord, and gentlemen of the Jury - here I entreat you to feel for my wrongs; repeated injuries too often goad and drive men to the commission of crime - such has been the case with me. I am sensible of having done wrong. Reflection, which brings conviction to the mind, has shewn me my error; but I hope and trust, when the provocation is considered with the act, you will say the offence is deprived of that false glare and enormity the prosecutor and his friends have given it.</p>
               <p>This case differs from all others that have hitherto occupied the attention of a British Court of Criminal Justice. A series of private injuries have given birth to a public crime. Not possessing sufficient command to submit to the wrongs inflicted by my prosecutor and his friends, I have committed an act which gives my prosecutor an opportunity he will not let slip, of completing the ruin he has so successfully began, unless shielded by the mercy of those whom I now have the honour of addressing.</p>
               <p>The parental care and kindness that the child which accompanied me experienced, proves that I am not that abandoned hard-hearted wretch which the prosecutor has described me. By voluntarily acknowledging him to be the father of the child, I enabled him to obtain immediate possession of him, and return to England, which he could not otherwise have done. I made every reparation in my power, and received in return his promise (in writing) of mercy.</p>
               <p>I thought my prosecutor sincere in his profession of mercy. At Bow-street he pretended that he gave the promise under the idea that my offence was punishable with death. Can such ignorance of the punishment of my offence be credited, in one whom it so essentially concerned? is it not more reasonable to infer that he subsequently regretted giving the promise, and wished to avoid it? His endeavour to explain it away, however, destroys the effect intended, for it proves that he did not give it as a promise of mercy; and his repenting of it does not make it less a promise. I have only to add, that I have suffered six months confinement, five of which I have been in a foreign country, and that a beloved infant has perished in a prison, where its mother was taken on suspicion of being an accomplice.</p>
               <p>Relying on your candour, I throw myself upon your most humane consideration.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Prossor, in Swallow-street. I went to school with Knight about seven years ago. On the 25th of April, about twenty minutes after ten o'clock at night, I saw him and Kent together, with two others, standing at Mr. Burt's gateway, in Swallow-street, some distance from Hanover-street - they were with Walker and Bowman - Walker sat down on the stones, and the four wanted to lift him up, and said they would fetch him a coach for a pint of beer. Walker and Bowman walked away together - both appeared to have been drinking, but they were able to walk. Soon after this I was going into my master's house, they passed me, one of them said they had hit him a crack of the eye. I ran away. I saw three of them running. Knight spoke to me that evening in the public-house.</p>

            , who lives in Goswell-street - I live at Edmonton for the benefit of my health, and keep a jeweller's shop there, on my husband's account - I serve in the shop by myself. On Saturday, the 3d of April, the prisoner came in with a girl about fourteen years of age - they asked to see some rings, marked 4 s. 6 d.; I showed her a tray with five in it. She chose one, and asked to see more. I showed her another tray with sixteen rings in it. She turned round to the girl and said,</p>
               <p>"Have you got the pound note?" The girl said,</p>
               <p>"No, the young woman has got it outside - they both went out; the prisoner said she would be in again in a few minutes. I counted the rings, and missed one, went out, and saw the two and another female with them - the stranger left them, and went up a lane; they had been about two minutes together, and could have passed any thing from one to the other. I went to them, and said I had lost a ring; the prisoner said she had not got it; they offered to go to be searched. I said,</p>
               <p>"That is of no use, you have delivered it to the other woman." They insisted on going back. The girl began to strip; I said it is no of use, and threatened to send for a constable; the prisoner fell on her knees and begged for mercy - she said she had two babes at home, and if I would go with her she would pay me for the ring, rather than have a piece of work - she said it was about a quarter of an hour's walk. I set out with them, and went about four miles, to this side of Kingsland turnpike - A dray was coming along. The drayman said,</p>
               <p>"Are you going to town?" the prisoner said Yes, jumped upon the dray, whispered to the man, and he rode off with her - the girl ran away. I got on a coach that was passing, and overtook them; she got off the dray and ran away; I followed, and overtook her; she said she would pay for it, and took me to a house where she endeavoured to borrow the money; the woman said she had got none. She went out of another door of the house, and went away. I saw her again about six weeks after, and am sure she is the woman. I have never got the ring.</p>

I saw three women standing, and asked them if they had seen her? the lady came, and I returned with her; I was frightened, and said I would pay for it. I was afraid to tell her that I lived in town, thinking she would put me in prison. I know nothing of the ring.</p>

He said he found it in the bag, on board the ship Fortitude, No. 2. I went to the warehouse, No. 2, but could find no sugar of that quality. I went to No. 11, and found several casks of sugar, which corresponded with it. The cask was marked I B No. 20.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About a quarter past two o'clock I was going my rounds, and saw the prisoner with two others by Hood's shop. When I came close I saw them lifting a window-board up at the next house. I secured the prisoner - the others got away. He said he knew his sentence, and they could only give him six months. I took him to the watch-house, returned to the shop, and found the door broken open.</p>

On the 30th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, a woman was passing my shop-door, and told me something was taken out of my shop-window. I went in pursuit with my two sons, turned towards Aldersgate-street, ran back again, and heard my son say,</p>

               <p>DR. RODERICK M'LEOD. On Wednesday evening, the 5th of May, I was walking from Bow, to my own house at Westminster - I got to Aldgate church about eleven o'clock, and was walking slowly along. A young man, whom I believe to be the prisoner, came right up against me at the <placeName id="t18190526-59-crimeloc318">corner of Mitre-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18190526-59-crimeloc318" type="placeName" value="corner of Mitre-street"/>

                        targets="t18190526-59-off314 t18190526-59-crimeloc318"/>; it was a very clear moonlight night; I looked in his face to judge whether he really meant to do me any violence, and the innocent appearance he put on prevented my suspecting any harm of him. He made so many apologies for stopping me in my way, that it put me off my guard entirely; I said there was no occasion for any apology; I endeavoured to make way for him, and to pass him. In making that effort to pass him, I felt a violent snatch, and thought my watch, seals and chain and all were gone. I immediately called out Stop thief! and pursued the man. When I got a little way I came in front of the watch-house; the constable of the night met me, and asked me to step in until the watchman and beadle, who were in pursuit of the man, came back. I went in, and in a few minutes one of the watchmen brought a young man in whom he had caught; I told him that was not the man who stopped me, and therefore I could not give him in charge. In a few minutes after, Fawcett, the beadle, came in with a hat in his hand, and said the man had got away but he had knocked off his hat; I left my address at the watch-house and proceeded home. On Wednesday, the 14th of May, I was requested to appear before the Lord Mayor,; when the prisoner was produced the features of his countenance made such an impression on me from what I have stated, that I said I felt no hesitation in saying I believed him to be the man who stopped me. From the observation that I made at the time, he is the man, I have not the most distant doubt of it. I have neither recovered the seals or chain; the chain broke off at the ring, and the watch was left.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so light on the 5th of May, as to enable you to know his person again on the 11th - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. All this was done at one snatch - A. I felt nothing until it was snatched - there was no struggle or resistance on my part - it was about eleven o'clock, it might be a few minutes after, but I cannot tell. I have no doubt in my own mind of the prisoner's being the man, but I am not infallible - he kept saying,</p>
               <p>"Sir, I am very sorry I stopped you." I saw him all that time. There was another man there, who asked me if I had lost any thing?</p>

            . I am beadle of St. James, Dukes-place. Just after eleven o'clock - it was gone eleven, I was in the watch-house, and heard the cry of Stop thief; I immediately went out - there were several men running about and the watchmen. One man had slipped through the dark court into Duke's-place; when I got there he was about a hundred yards before me; I pursued him from there, to the end of Winfield-street, Petticoat-lane; I there made a blow at him, intending to knock him down, I was not quite near enough to him, but knocked his hat off, and then lost him. On Tuesday following, the 11th, I saw the prisoner and took him - I suspect him very much to be the man I had pursued.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take him - A. I did not see him till the Monday after, and then he gave me the slip; I saw him again on Tuesday, and took him - I did not know him before, except by seeing him about the street. I took him believing him to be the same man, and informed the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was it - A. It had just gone eleven o'clock; he was just before me - I did not see his full face. I saw him on the 10th, at the Roebuck, public-house, Duke's-place, about half-past seven o'clock at night - Winfield-street is a good way from there; he just came in and went out again - I am confident he saw me; I said nothing to him. Next night, about seven o'clock, I saw him there again - another man was taken on the night of the robbery but not by me. I knew the prisoner before by sight.</p>

He sleeps in the front room, and we supped in the front room. Mr. Shannon went away about eleven o'clock;

I returned home about six o'clock in the evening; my pocket-book, with above 80 l. in it, was in the pocket of my pantaloons. I had received this money at Coutts's, the bankers. The prisoner assisted me off with my pantaloons. Immediately after they were off, I told him to hand them to me, for I had left my pocket-book in them. He immediately replied,</p>
               <p>"There is no pocket-book here, Sir." I said,</p>
               <p>"I told you to hand me my pantaloons, I did not desire you to search for the pocket-book." He gave them to me, and I missed it. Next morning I had the notes stopped at the Bank; I afterwards saw a 5 l. note there with the prisoner's name on it - I think it was his writing. I afterwards got an officer, who searched, and found my pocket-book, with 65 l. in it, wrapped up in a parcel, in a small closet where the prisoner kept his clothes. The prisoner said it was not my pocket-book, for he had found it in the area - I said that was impossible, for he knew it was mine, as he had been in the habit of seeing it two or three times every day.</p>

On Thursday, the 22d of April, about ten minutes before nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop, bought two ounces of tea and a pound of moist sugar, and paid me a 1 l. bank note. I asked him his name? he said Mr. Hewett - I asked him where? he said No. 2, Phipps-court, Tottenham-court-road, and that he was a painter and glazier. I had not sufficient change in the till, and took the note into the parlour to my master, leaving him in the shop. I returned with my master, who gave him the rest of the change, which was 18 s. 3 d. in all, out of the cash-box. I wrote the name and address on the note - (looks at one) - this it; it has that name and address on it, and my initials - he went away. My master was not satisfied with the note; I pulled off my apron, and went after him, crossed the way, and lost him immediately - he had not been out of the shop above a minute and a half. I went and inquired for Phipps-court, but could find no such place. I returned and told my master, shut up shop, and went out again towards Oxford-street. As I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181905260023"/>was crossing in Oxford-street, I saw a man put his hand to his mouth, and call out</p>
               <p>"Oh!" then crossed over to the prisoner at the corner of Charles-street and Oxford-street - they joined company together; I followed them, and between Chapel-street and Wardour-street I saw the other man give something to the prisoner; they went on as far as a cheesemonger's shop in Oxford-street; the prisoner went into the shop, I passed them; he came out in half a minute - the other man was on the opposite side; they joined company again at the corner of Wardour-street, and went down there. I inquired for a watchman. I saw them looking into another shop, they went on farther. At last I saw a watchman at the corner of Little Pulteney-street, I then laid hold of the prisoner, the other man ran off. The prisoner was taken to St. James's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say anything - A. He said he was not the man. As we were going to the watch-house I said,</p>
               <p>"Ought you not to be ashamed of yourself for seeing me in the shop, and passing to me such a note?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Why did you not take the right man?"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Did he not say</p>
               <p>"I am not the right man - A. No; he said,</p>
               <p>"Why not take the right man?" No person was in the shop when he came in. I had had very few customers that evening. I am sure he is the man. I took him about forty minutes after he left the shop. I did not find the change, nor the tea and sugar on him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you ever the least doubt of his being the man - A. Never, I suspected him when he was in the shop, as he held his head down under his hat while we were looking at the note, which made me take particular notice of him.</p>

On the 27th of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, my daughter knocked at my door, and said there were thieves in the house. I went down, found the kitchen window down, two drawers open, and the articles stated in the indictment gone; they were all safe the night before. In about half an hour I found the prisoner concealed in the privy in the yard, which is walled round six feet high. She must have got over the wall. All the property was found on the floor of the privy - she said she put them there. My lodgers have a key, and let themselves in after I go to bed.</p>

I returned in about five minutes, and saw the prisoner, Porter, come out of the yard before my door, Price stood at the gate - something passed from one to the other. I went into my house, missed my watch off the shelf, ran into the alley, found Porter coming out of the next house, and charged him with taking my watch, he denied it. I found Price at the bottom of the stairs in that house. I am sure they are the same boys.

As she was dressing herself again she went close against the wall, I pulled her into the middle of the room, when a 2 l. and three 1 l. bank notes, with 19 s. 6 d. in silver, in a purse, fell from her. I picked it up, and gave it to the officer. The bundle was given to Snowsell.</p>

I heard an alarm, came home directly, and found the prisoner in custody - she had a bundle containing my clothes. I found the door locked, but the padlock was forced off; keys were found on her which fitted my door. I sent for an officer. I saw the keys tried with the lock, and they opened it. I went to my chest, and missed a 2 l., three 1 l. bank notes, and 19 s. 6 d. in silver. I had put no mark on them.</p>

            . I live in Stanmore Marsh, my husband is a labourer. On Sunday, the 21st of March, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw three men take the gelding off the marsh - the prisoners are two of them; I have not the least doubt of it - they were all on foot. One caught it by the head, the other walked round and examined it, and the third sat down. They led it off the green into the road by its head, then let go its head, struck it with a stick, and drove it up a lane which leads to Kingsbury and other places - they were five minutes in my sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoners were strangers - A. Yes. I saw them a fortnight after at Union Hall, among other people, and have not the least doubt of them. They were not pointed out to me.</p>

            . I am a broom-dealer, and live in the Borough-road. On the 28th of March the prisoner, Shearing, came to me, and asked me if I wanted to buy a horse, and requested me to go to the Obelisk livery-stables to look at it - he said it belonged to Green, who was with him. I knew Shearing before, and asked him if he knew Green? he said Yes; that he knew the man well - that his father and him kept an errand-cart, and he used to turn it out into the field, but now he was obliged to sell it, as he had quarrelled with his father - Green did not hear that. I went to the stable; Shearing showed me the horse, and asked 6 l. for it - I gave them 4 l.; I laid the money down, Green was there, and took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Green treat the horse as if it was his - A. He took the money for it, and gave Shearing a 1 l. note to pay the hostler the expences. I gave Shearing a shilling for his trouble. In about two hours I heard something, and gave information. Christmas saw the horse, and claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Green did not hear the conversation about the money - A. No. I cannot swear which took the money up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who gave the 1 l. note to the other to pay the expences - A. Green gave Shearing one of the notes I put down. I think the expences were 10 s. - I believe the charge is 2 s. a night; it had nothing but hay.</p>
               <p>SHEARING'S Defence. I was at a public-house at Stanmore, walking about, and never saw the horse until I came to town.</p>
               <p>GREEN'S Defence. I was on the dunghill on the common for an hour and a half. I came to town, and met Shearing and another man, who asked me to go and sell the horse for them - I went to the witness Stiles.</p>

The prisoners lived near me - they knew the ass was mine; Merriman has often seen me at work with it.</p>
               <p>JAMES WHITE. I live in Kent-street, Borough, my father is a horse-boiler. On Thursday evening, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoners brought the ass to my father, and asked him to buy it. Jones spoke - he asked 1 l. for it; my father offered him 14 s. They went away, returned in about three minutes, and both said they must have 16 s., and that he should have it; they took the money, and both said they would bring one or two more on Friday - they said they lived in Fox-buildings, Kent-street. I afterwards found it was false.</p>
               <p>MERRIMAN'S Defence. A man on Westminster-bridge gave me 2 s. to sell it.</p>

On the 14th of May I apprehended the prisoner in Cockspur-street, and told her I supposed she was aware what I took her for; she said she supposed it was for robbing the gentleman. I asked her what she had done with the watch? she said she had sold it for 15 s. to two young men, who stood by as she came out of the house where she had robbed the prosecutor.</p>

We could not agree about the price that was to be allowed for them - he spoke to me in French, a lady interpreted between us. He appeared not to understand, and intimated that he would bring a friend who understood English; he then left the shop. Next day I saw him before the Alderman at Guildhall. About a week after he had been apprehended my two seals were produced at one of his examinations. I am certain they are part of the stock I had when he came into my shop; I showed them to him.

On the 16th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop - I was engaged with a gentleman; Mrs. Kipling and her brother were behind the counter - the prisoner spoke in French, I understood him. He asked to look at some black silk handkerchiefs; I directed him to go to Mrs. Kipling, but told him in French that we kept no black handkerchiefs, but had plenty of coloured; he went to Mrs. Kipling, and she showed him several coloured ones. After pulling them about for sometime, he objected to the colour, and said he wanted some with more blue in them; my customer left, and I then bent all my attention to him. He offered 12 s. for two, which we refused - at last we agreed for 12 s. 6 d.; he pulled out a double Napoleon, I think, and wrote on a piece of paper that it was worth from 35 s. to 38 s. - I thought it was worth 33 s. 3 d. Mrs. Kipling's brother went to the jeweller's, and brought word that it was worth 34 s. - I said we could not take his money. He desired they might be put by, and he would bring a person in the evening or next day, who understood English; he left the shop, and in about five or ten minutes we missed three silk handkerchiefs - no other customer had come in in the mean time - he never called again. I saw him the following week at Guildhall, and the handkerchiefs were produced; I had the other four in my possession, and they corresponded exactly - the piece contained seven.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was not a very common pattern - I have no private mark on them.</p>

He pulled the handkerchiefs about a good deal, and said he wanted a particular colour; my man showed him a variety, and told him they were 6 s. each. He pulled out an India handkerchief, and put it on the counter; I heard the conversation - it was in French. He offered a foreign silver coin, but I refused to take it without knowing the value, and told my man to go and inquire at a silversmith's; he said in broken English,</p>
               <p>"No, me will go and fetch proper coin." He left his own handkerchief on the counter, returned in about three minutes, and asked for it; I gave it him. My young man asked him if he would take the handkerchiefs. He said,</p>
               <p>"How much?" he told him again 6 s. He said he would only give 5 s., and ran out of the shop in a great hurry. The next week Brand produced my two handkerchiefs to me, which were on the counter when he was there - they are worth 4 s. each.</p>

On Saturday, the 17th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, and pointed to some silk handkerchiefs which laid in the window. He made signs, and touched a coloured handkerchief which he had on his neck. I supposed he wanted something of that pattern - nobody but myself was in the shop. I took a parcel out of the drawer, laid it on the counter, and showed him several different patterns; one handkerchief in particular I remember opening, thinking it might strike his attention - he fixed upon two others; he asked the price in French, I told him 15 s. the two - he held up his hand, and said sancho, by which I understood he meant 5 s. I shook my head, meaning I would not sell them for that. He took a purse from his pocket, and produced gold and silver foreign pieces - he produced a double Napoleon, put it in my hand, and made signs for a pen and ink to let me know the value. I gave him a pencil - he wrote down 35 s. as the value. He offered me 11 s. for them, I refused to take it; he bought nothing, and left the shop. He put his hat on one part of the counter and his handkerchief on another, about half a yard off; he took up his handkerchief, shook it, and then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shake his hat - A. No. I threw the handkerchiefs promiscuously into the drawer. About half an hour after, a neighbour came in to make inquiry; I went immediately to Guildhall, and saw two handkerchiefs which belonged to me; I am certain one of them was on the counter when he was there, I particularly showed it to him; and the other was in the shop the evening before when I shut up. My young man came into the shop while he was writing the value of the Napoleon, and staid till he left. They are worth 13 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you go to Guildhall the same day - A. Yes, about twelve o'clock the same morning. I knew him immediately. I did not suspect him.</p>

               <p>THOMAS M'GUIER. On the 27th of April, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner in Coleman-street with these pots under his coat; I followed him to London-wall - a boy about twelve years of age was with him. I then went up, and asked the prisoner what he had got under his coat? he answered, Nothing. I took the pots from under his coat; he then said a man gave them to him in Lombard-street to get stretched - they did not want stretching. I took him to the Compter.</p>

On the 27th of April, in the evening, he asked for the key of the beer-cellar to draw some beer - my sister told him to take it; he also took the key of the spirit-cellar. He was gone longer than he ought, and I called him up - he made no answer; he came up soon after with his candle out. I asked him why he put it out? he said it fell out - he smelt very strong of liquor and went out with his beer. We found a two gallon cask nearly full of gin on the stairs, and the key of the spirit-cellar in the door which was open. He had spilt a quantity of gin about in filling the small cask out of the large one.</p>

               <p>Q. When he returned from serving the beer, what did he do - A. He went down, brought the small cask up, and took it out the back way as fast as he could; my sister followed him, and I went out the front way to meet him - it was dark; somebody was there ready to receive it, but I could not see who it was. He then ran into the stable, and shut the door in my sister's face.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 22d of May, about five o'clock in the morning, I was going home, and saw the prisoner and two others coming down the road; I stopped till they came opposite to me. The middle man then threw some lead down and ran away - the prisoner was the first man, and had the greatest part of the lead in a bag; he threw it down and ran. I pursued him and a man stopped him. He threw himself down; I collared him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was he introduced to you - A. I first met him in the public street, where I was waiting for a female friend - it rained, and he held an umbrella over me. I would not allow him to see me home, but he would not leave me till I promised to meet him. I promised, in order to get rid of him, but did not meet him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was your next interview - A. By chance, in the street - he spoke to me. Our courtship continued about six months. I made no inquiry about him. He obtained no money from me, he only took my watch when he left; I have since got it back from the pawnbroker's. He wanted me to mortgage a house which will come to me at my mother's death.</p>

He then took his neck handkerchief off, filled that full, padded it out like a stiffener, and tied it round his neck, and then went up to the shop - I followed, got between him and the door, and ordered him into the parlour, instead of which he ran down into the cellar. I followed - he was then taking the tobacco out of his hat. He gave me a violent shove, and threw it out of his hat, and a parcel out of his breeches. He then ran up stairs - my wife endeavoured to stop him; he gave her a shove - I followed and seized him, he made a great resistance. I gave him in charge; he wished me to forgive him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Saffron-hill. About two o'clock in the morning of the 3d of May I met the prisoner coming up Red Lion-court with the lead; I went up to him, and he threw it down. I sprang my rattle, but he got away - I knew him before, and am sure he is the boy. On the Sunday following I saw him; he ran off, but I secured him in a cellar in Field-lane.</p>

I never applied to the Insolvent Debtors' Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if an order was procured by him for your discharge in that Court, it was without your authority - A. Yes. The 14th of May he brought me a paper, and said it was my discharge - he told me to give it to a messenger to take to Mr. Shannon's office for a scrutatus, and to bring the paper and scrutatus back. I told him I could not get a messenger; he found Bannister on the Middlesex side, and sent him into the conversation-room to me, and desired me to go up, and deliver the paper to him, which I did. He waited for Bannister's return, said he thought he had been a long time, and went away. I delivered the paper to Bannister between one and two o'clock, he returned about seven.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. A. What did you employ the prisoner for - A. To supersede one action, and to compromise the other. He called again the next day.</p>

I went to the Secondaries Office, in Coleman-street, about five o'clock, and gave the papers to Mr. Hudson; they told me to call again at seven, which I did, and was told to call again at eleven o'clock next morning, which I did and was detained.

            . I am agent to the prosecutors'; the two bales of goods in question were delivered at the wharf, and put into the warehouse on the Paddington wharf, with other goods - it was locked. There are three doors, which are fastened inside, and locked. On the 20th, as we were going to put them in the boat, we missed them; I immediately gave information of it all over the neighbourhood, and handbills were printed. The prisoner lived opposite our wharf. On the 26th, about six o'clock in the evening, I went to his house with Woodbury, he met us on the wharf, and seemed very white and confused. Woodbury asked him how many carts he had in the yard? - he keeps the wharf - he said he had one cart. Woodbury asked him if he had heard of the robbery? he said,</p>
               <p>"No, what robbery?" Woodbury said,</p>
               <p>"have you not heard of the robbery over at Stubbs and Worster's, about some pieces of nankeens and things, that have been stolen." He seemed very much agitated, and said he had found some pieces in the dunghill. We asked him where they were? he said in his house. He consented to our going into his house. We began to search, he pointed to a box full of pieces of nankeen and pillow fustians, and said</p>
               <p>"There is what I found." There were two boards laid by the side of the box, which would make a cover to it - it would then be a complete package; a saw also laid with the boards, as if it was ready to be packed up. The officer asked to search the stable? he said he had not got the key. The officer said he would break it open. He then said he thought he could find a key that would open it. I then perceived a piece of pillow fustian lying in the bed. I said</p>
               <p>"what is that? there is another piece there." He</p>
               <p>"yes, there is a piece there." Woodbury said if that is the case I must search the house, and immediately went to the bed, turned the clothes down, and found another piece of fustian in the bed. We found nine of the wrappers. He said he found them on Sunday morning, and had told nobody of it. It was very wet on Saturday night and Sunday morning, the goods appeared a little dusty, but nothing like dung or wet in the least. The box did not belong to us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. They were soiled - A. Yes, they would get that by moving about. He said there was a little dung scattered over them - there was a dunghill on the wharf. We found nothing in the stable. I had seen the goods in our warehouse. Either me or my nephew received them.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I went to the prisoner's house with the last witness. On Monday the 26th of April, about six o'clock in the evening,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181905260037"/>and saw him coming out of the door; I asked him how many carts he had in his yard - he said one. I asked him where it stood - he appeared confused, and pointed to a place where it did not stand. He knew I was an officer. I asked him if he had heard any thing of the robbery which had been committed on the opposite side of the water? he said,</p>
               <p>"No, what robbery?" I said,</p>

               <p>"Not heard of the robbery at Worster and Stubbs's, opposite you?" He said No, again. I said, if you know nothing of the robbery, do you know any thing of nankeens and corderoys? he said Yes, he had got some of them. I said then shew me where they are. He took me into his house, and pointed to a box in the middle of the room. I asked him if that was what he found? he said Yes. I said</p>

               <p>"is this all you found, you did not find them in this box, for they were lost in wrappers." He said he found them in the box. I asked where, he said in the yard, in the dunghill, on the Sunday morning. I asked if he had got the key of the stable - he said No. In going out Holt saw a piece of fustian under the bed. I asked the prisoner why he did not tell me he had got it there, and if he found that in the dunghill - he said Yes. I turned down the bed clothes, and found another piece in the bed - he never told me it was there. He said he found that in the dunghill also, and that he found them all in the box. The box was quite full without these two pieces - it would not hold them. I asked him who he had told that he found the property, and if he had told the carter or clerk of the wharf? he said No, he had told nobody. Bills had been posted about, and I had given them about the neighbourhood. The outside of the box was quite dry. There were two pieces of wood laid by it, which appeared just sawed - they quite fitted the box - there was sawdust about. Next evening I went and found several picklock keys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He said he had told nobody whatever, that he had found them.</p>
               <p>Q. Since the prisoner's confinement has there not been more goods found in the neighbourhood - A. Yes.</p>

I was throwing the night soil up in the yard, stuck my fork against the box, and pulled it out; I went to the Horse and Sack, mentioned it, and inquired if they knew who had lost any thing? they said No. I heard nothing more until the witnesses came; I showed it to them, and said there were more pieces in the bed.</p>

            . I am clerk and foreman to Mr. Dove; I confirm his statement respecting the wharf. I saw the prisoner find the keys in the night soil.</p>

               <p>Q. On your solemn oath did you see him find the keys - A. I did, on my solemn oath. I borrowed one of them about five months ago to pick a lock of my own drawers - they were fastened together when he found them, I believe. He shovelled them out of the night soil.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the robbery - A. About two years ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Where do you live - A. At No. 9, Lisson-green, North. I have been there nineteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. You had heard of the robbery - A. No, I had not. I came from dinner, turned into the public-house, saw the bill up, and went to the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not know of the robbery before Monday - A. On my oath I did not - positively I did not know of it till the the middle of the day on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear positively that you never heard or knew of the robbery till the middle of the day that the prisoner was apprehended - A. I did not, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. On the oath you have taken have you never said to any body, that you gave the prisoner information of the robbery being committed on the wharf, before he was apprehended - A. Never in my life. I never told him so.</p>
               <p>Q. You never told anybody that you said so to him - A. Never in my life, for I never knew of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at Holt, and say on your oath, did you not tell him that you informed the prisoner that a robbery had been committed before he was taken - A. No, I did not on my oath, for I did not know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Woodbury - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Woodbury, the officer, that you informed the prisoner before he was taken into custody that the robbery had been committed - A. On my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen these goods before the prisoner was taken into custody - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. And two years ago I am to understand that you saw the prisoner shovel the picklock keys out of the night soil - A. I think it was as long as that - they are steel, and will not canker in the soil so soon as iron.</p>

I charged him with it; he denied it, and at that instant Thompson came up and said,</p>
               <p>"This is him - I saw him do it." I sent for a constable, who found a knife and some wire on him. I lost three odd pistols out of the window.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. John's. On the 17th of May, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I was in company with the landlord of a public-house, talking at the door, the prisoner, Miller, passed us with a bag at his back - I followed and asked him what he had got in the bag? he replied it was his own property. I said,</p>
               <p>"It is lead, where did you get it from?" he made no answer. I collared him; he dropped the bag on my toes, and got away for about five minutes, I then secured him, took him into the public-house, and asked him how he came by it? he said a man gave him 1 s. to carry it to Dartmouth-street. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have taken it from Mr. Hodges's house, for I saw it put on this very day." I left him in charge, went to Mr. Hodges's house, and found the lead gone. I had seen the two prisoners together between six and seven o'clock that night. A man was with Miller when I stopped him.</p>

On the 25th of May, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, at Mr. Walker's, who keeps a hair-dresser's shop - the prisoner, Osborne. came in, and said she had known me for three years past; I said she knew nothing of me. She began crying, and I gave her a shilling to go and fetch something to drink. She began making a disturbance, and in order to keep peace in the house, I took her to a public-house close by, and called for a shillingsworth of gin and water; I changed a 1 l. note to pay for it. She then prevailed on me to go to a house kept by the prisoner, Furze - I paid 1 s. for a room. In about half an hour Furze came up stairs, knocked at the door, burst it open, and sat down in the room. Osborne thrust her hand into my breeches-pocket, took out five 1 l. notes, and gave them to Furze. Two other women came into the room directly. I went to Lambeth-street, and fetched an officer; we found the house empty. Next morning I found the prisoners in custody. I have never found the notes. I am certain they are the women.</p>

In about a minute I went out, and saw the prisoner about two doors off, concealing a pair of shoes under his apron. I collared him, and the other two ran away.</p>

He came again on the 10th, and had other things, which came altogether to 12 l. 1 s. 8 d. He told me to come on Thursday morning, the 14th of May, at ten o'clock, and he would pay me. I went, and he was out. I was told to call again at three, which I did; I called again at nine o'clock; and saw him. He said,</p>
               <p>"I cannot settle your bill, unless you change me a 30 l. note," I said I could; he then said he could not settle with me until the next morning at ten o'clock. I went again - he put me off till three, I then saw him in his back parlour - he asked me if I had got change for the 30 l. note? I said Yes. He told me to write the receipt. He took out his pocket-book, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have not got my 30 l. note here, I must go up stairs for it." I had put two 5 l. and eight 1 l.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181905260040"/>notes on his table with the receipt. He took them up, and went up stairs with them. At the same time his shoemaker, who was there, left the room - I remained alone. Instead of returning into the parlour to me, he ran straight out of the house. I followed, and saw him run out of the side-door of the Crown and Sceptre, public-house - I stopped him, and asked him for his 30 l. or my 18 l. He said,</p>
               <p>"My good fellow, you shall have your 30 l. note in fifteen minutes, if you will go with me to the King of Prussia, public-house." I went and waited about twenty minutes; he sent for somebody, the person returned, and said he was not at home - I waited there an hour. I had occasion to leave the place for about a minute; on my return I found he was gone. I ran to his house and several other places, and in about half an hour I found him in the garden of the King of Prussia; I asked him for my 18 l. - he said,</p>
               <p>"My good fellow, you are frightened at your own shadow! it is of no use for you to have your 18 l., you will have the whole presently." He had a bill for 29 l. in his hand, and said if he were to give me this bill he should be under an arrest. He put it on the table, I said,</p>
               <p>"That is of no use to me." I returned with him to the Crown and Sceptre. I saw a friend, and beckoned him over. I got an officer, and gave him in charge. He was searched at Worship-street, after a great resistance - my notes and receipt were found on him, but no 30 l. note.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you agreed to take any thing in exchange for the 18 l. but the 30 l. note - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he not give you the bill - A. No. I had no idea of discounting the bill for him. I did not take it up. I neither drank nor sat down with him.</p>

I produced my staff - he asked for my warrant. I said I had none. He threatened me, and pushed me out of the house. I went for assistance - he came into the public-house, and I took him into custody, and took him to the office; he resisted very much, and said, as there was no magistrate on the bench he would not be searched, and what he had about him was his own. I at last searched him, with assistance, and found a pocket-book, with twenty-eight duplicates, a bill of exchange for 29 l. 14 s., and Bryant's receipt for 12 l., in it.</p>

On the 27th of April, as he was leaving the yard to go to dinner, I observed something suspicious in his apron; I stopped him, and took a bolt from his pocket. I took him to Mr. Curling, who made him unload. He produced from his person about 12 lbs. of copper bolts and nails and mixed metals, I asked him what could induce him to do it? he said he wanted to obtain money to purchase a jacket. He had 24 s. a week.</p>

            . I was constable of the night at Mile End. About four o'clock in the morning of the 25th of May the prisoner passed the watch-house with these things. I asked him where he got them from? he said a gentleman gave them to him to carry - I believe he was intoxicated. He said he was going to Bow - he turned the wrong way. I secured him, and he threw them down.</p>

            , widow; the prisoner was in our employ. On the 13th of May, we lost some metal, and set my brother to watch. In consequence of what he told me, about seven o'clock in the evening, as the prisoner was leaving work, I desired him to give me what metal he had about him; he said he had none. I searched him and found one piece weighing about 2 lbs. I gave him in charge, went to his house, and found about 30 lbs. of mixed metal, which is mine.</p>

            . I am a dealer in harness, and live in Crawford-street. On the 13th of May I was informed a man had some harness to sell, and went to the prisoner at the Castle, public-house, in Chapel-street, and told him that I had been informed that he had got some bridles and saddles to sell; he said,</p>
               <p>"I have; I don't think they are altogether right - they are crossed," which I understood to mean stolen; he said he had let a man have 1 l. on them - I said I would buy them. He took me to a cottage in Bell-street, near the Edgware-road - the saddle laid on the floor. He went towards the window, lifted up a board in the floor, and pulled out two new rugs, two bridles and a martingale; he put the rugs back again and put the board over. I said they were not good enough for me, and if he had any better another time I would buy them. We came away and left the things there without replacing them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who let you into the cottage - A. He let himself in with a key, and locked the door again when he went away. We parted, and I gave information to Shackle; on the Sunday morning I went with him and the constable. I left them in the street, went to the cottage, and asked for Shippen; they said he was in bed, but they would call him. The prisoner looked out of the window, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will be down directly." I said I had a customer for the things - he said he had not got them, but they were at a house just by in a bag - we went to a house a few yards off, and he brought the bag out. We went to the Castle, public-house, and sat down in the harbour; he was in the act of pulling them out, when Wales came in and asked him whose property it was? he said it was his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. A man named Hazlewood sent you to the prisoner - A. Yes. The board was sawed out of the floor. The place was not like a scuttle.</p>

             I am an officer. I went in search of the prisoner with Spendlove; he fetched him out and took him to the Castle, public-house. I followed them, and asked the prisoner what he had got there? he said they were that man's, pointing to Spendlove - Spendlove said he was about buying them of the prisoner. The prisoner then said they were his, and he had let a man have 1 l. on them, and he had not seen him since. The bag contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

On the 25th of May the prisoner came to my house, and asked for some clothes for Mr. Jacobs; my sister called me down - I told him to send Mr. Jacobs himself for them. About three-quarters of an hour after he was gone I received information, and then missed the table-spoon off the beaufet. I went to a coffee-shop in Church-street with an officer, took him into custody, and asked him for the spoon; he said he gave it to Jacobs - he then pulled it out of his breeches-pocket.</p>
