About eight o'clock last Saturday morning, the 15th of June, I went with Hodges up Green Dragon-yard—I saw the prisoner coming out of the factory—Hodges went up to him and said something, I do not know what—the prisoner was about return<lb/>ing—he had one foot in the doorway—I said I wished him to come to the station-house—he did not resist in the least, but walked there—I said I must search him—he directly undid his trousers, and took this lead from them.</p>

               <p>Hill, London. The prisoner was in my employ for some time—I let his have money when he wanted it—he had a commission, and I made it up to 1002. a year—if his commission exceeded that he had it—it might have produced him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; but if it did not produce him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I made it up to that—he travelled for me in this country and abroad—he ought not to have travelled for other houses—I had forbidden him to receive money for me for the last eighteen months—Mr. May is a customer of mine—on the 18th of March the prisoner told me he wanted a piece of black satin for Mr. May—I had not such an article—I got it for the purpose of the order—I gave it to him, to take it to Mr. May, to tell it to him—from half-past ten to eleven o'clock in the morning—no price was named—he knew it cost me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard, and he was to get as much more as he could—Mr. May always paid cash on delivery to the person who carried the article—it was not the prisoner's duty to receive the money for this piece—he had received money on former occasions from Mr. May for goods—he was aware of May's practice, but I told him not to receive the money—he said, "I shall be over as soon as I can, and state at what pride I sold it"—he returned between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I was not in the counting-house when he returned—I saw him about five o'clock—he laid Mr. May had agreed upon 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I said, "That it less than you expected"—he said, "But I shall see him again to night, and get 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more, and let you know to-morrow, that you can make out the invoice" that was all that passed—he did not return—I did not see him till, I think, about the 7th or 8th of May, when he called at my counting-house for a letter, and was taken—before that I met one of his acquaintance in the street, in quite a different part of the town, and I communicated to that party that there was a letter for the prisoner—I gave him no reason to believe that this had been discovered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Green's-place, Bethnal-green. On the 16th of April I went to the Rose public-house, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, in company with the prisoner's father—the prisoner came into the room—I offered his father a drink of beer out of my pot—his father did not give him any, and they began to quarrel—the prisoner sat down right opposite me—he began abusing his father for not asking him to drink, and his father threatened to <hi rend="italic">whop</hi> him for it—the prisoner then rose off his seat, and threatened to cut his father's throat—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself for using such language to his father—I got up, and shoved him down on the form—he then began abusing me, and I said I would give him a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi>—he called me all manner of names, and I threatened to <hi rend="italic">whop</hi> him for it—he said if I came near him he would stick a knife into me—he had a knife on the table, which he had been eating his victuals with, but he had done eating his victuals, and it laid on the table—I got up off my seat, and was in the act of pulling off my coat, when he reached across the table, and struck me in the breast with the knife—it went into my breast—I hit him two or three times after that, not knowing I was stabbed till I felt the blood running down my side—I had not struck him before this, nor aimed any blow at him—when I found I was stabbed, I said to hit father,</p>

               <p>"Look here, Mr. Russell, your son has cut me with a knife"—I went out at the door, and the father followed me—there were two policemen against the door—his father spoke to them, and gave him in charge—I went over to the doctor.</p>

On Saturday night, the 8th of June, my husband and I went to bed after one o'clock—we fastened up the house as usual—a square of glass was out of the back kitchen window, and a square of tin was put in with tacks and putty—that was safe when I went to bed—I put five brass candlesticks in the window when I went to bed—there were four upright ones, one pair was a match, one stood high, which had been mended—the foot had been broken off, and it was white with metal where it had been soldered—one was a chamber candlestick, and another was smaller than the rest—it was an upright one—the shutter was not shut, as it shuts with hinges—I was going to shut it, but found the candlesticks behind it, which prevented my doing so—I got up next morning, between seven and eight o'clock, and found the kitchen curtain down, which had been up the night before, the square of tin out, and the candlesticks gone</p>

               <p>—I have never seen them since—I gave information of the robbery that morning to Murray—the chamber candlestick had a hook, but no extin<lb/>guisher, and a piece of soap was taken—the prisoners lodged in a little cottage, about 100 yards from us.</p>

H. R." and four German silver tea-spoons—the back-door was unfastened, top and bottom, but shut to—it was fastened the night before—that must have been opened from the inside—the wash-house window had the bottom sash up at the top—I missed from the back parlour cupboard a pair of silver sugar-tongs, marked "T.H.R." and two German silver salt-spoons—a pair of steps which were kept in the yard were removed from their place, and put under the window to enable a person to get in at the window, and there was dirt under the win<lb/>dows and on the window ledge—I found things moved from one place to another, besides what was gone—I had awoke in the course of the night, and saw the reflection of a light shine on the dresser—I was frightened, and covered my head over—I afterwards saw the light through the key<lb/>hole—I listened, but heard no noise, and went to sleep again, thinking I might fancy something.</p>

               <p>colour, and a pair of silver sugar-tongs—the prisoner went out, leaving the articles on the table—he said he thought the spoons were German silver—there were two white silk handkerchiefs, one figured all over, and the other plain with a figured border, and scented with musk very strong—Mary Ann Douglas asked him, when he came in, where he had been—he said, "To the doctor's shop at Cambridge-heath"—she asked How he got in—he said he got in at the back window, and stepped over a man-servant in bed, and he was going back again for three coats he had left in the back garden—he went out about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after—he was gone about half or three-quarters of an hour; and when he came back, he said he could not go because there were brick-layers at work—he went out about six o'clock, and took the things with him in a box—he returned home between seven and eight o'clock—when he came in the morning he gave the girl Douglas 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and in the afternoon he gave me a sovereign to fetch a pot of beer, and I brought him the change back—I saw a pair of pincers in the house—the prisoner put them in the fire, made them red-hot, put them on the hearth till they were cool, then with a rasp broke them—this is part of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know this iron chisel—I have seen it before in the prisoners's house—I was there from the 17th till the 20th, at my sister's house—I saw it there on the 17th and 18th, but not afterwards—I did not have any share in the property, or assist in disposing of it—I was taken into custody by the police, and told what I knew about it—I and Douglas had a quarrel six weeks ago last Sunday—I was taken into custody a week after that—the quarrel had nothing to do with my giving this statement.</p>

The prisoner attended on my wife in her illness—in May I had the misfortune to lose my wife—the prisoner rented a room in my house—she quitted about a week before this happened—I missed an umbrella on Sunday before the 10th of June—the prisoner denied all knowledge of it—I saw the coverlid and other things on her bed at the milk shop where she lived—I cannot say if the umbrella was safe on the 16th of May—we had it on the day of the funeral.</p>

On the 29th of May, between twelve and one o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the office of the Van Diemen's Land Company to pay some calls on some shares—I saw the prisoner there, and told him I believed there was a call on some shares, that I had lost the letter announcing such call, and I would be obliged to</p>

JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was the first day on which he spoke to you about hiring the horse and chaise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say what day—it was between the 28th of March and the 13th of April—that was the first time of my knowing him—I saw him frequently at my place after that—he gave me his card on the 13th of April, when he hired the horse—I had not asked him for it before, nor had he told me what he was, or where he lived—he closed with me on the 18th—he had been five or six days in treaty—I delivered him the horse and chaise on the 13th—he took it away that day, and brought it back at night; he used it once or twice between that and the 17th, and he brought it back each night—</p>

               <p>he took it away altogether on the 17th—he was to pay roe for the hire at the end of the month—I let it him for twenty-eight days certain from the 13th of April.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not let it to him for three months? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, certainly not for three months certain—I gave him a ticket for eighty-four days, which is customary in our business—if he had paid me for twenty-eight days, and I was satisfied with him, he would have gone on regularly—we pay no duty to the Stamp-office for twenty-eight days, and that was the reason I let it for that time—eighty-four days was stated on the ticket, but he was not bound to keep it that time—I saw the prisoner on the 3rd of May, in Mark-lane, and spoke to him about only sending me a quarter of a ton of coals, and next day he sent me four more tons—my object was to set that off against the hire of the horse and chaise—he did not tell me, when he gave me his card, that he was in the habit of having his corn ground at that mill, nothing of the kind—I met him on the 21st of May, in Mark-lane, close to my place of business—I asked him to walk with me before the Lord Mayor, and said I should give him into custody if he did not go—he wanted to get away, but a friend went with me to prevent him—I had so policeman—he was remanded, to give him an opportunity of returning the property, to which I consented, but he did not, and was committed—the officer has the horse and chaise.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, in Blackfriars-road. On the 18th of April the prisoner called at my office there, with a person named Solomons, and applied to me for a loan of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and offered to lodge this horse and chaise, which he drove up in, as security—our negotiation was taken down in writing—this is it—he signed it—the horse and chaise were delivered to me—I gave him 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day, and he gave me this pro<lb/>missory note for £23—the horse and chaise were taken from me on the 27th, I think—I sold the horse to Mr. Seal, a coal-merchant, in Black-friars-road, for sixteen guineas, on the morning of the day on which Mr. Whityear and the prosecutor applied to me, three or four days after the note became due—I believe it was on the 24th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you sell it after you received notice from Mr. Biggs that it was his property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—I had not received any notice at the time I sold it—I sold it to Seal about ten o'clock in the morning—I had partly sold it to him the day before—he had offered me the money for it, but I expected the prisoner to call for it, and put it off as long as I could—I used the horse and chaise while it was in my pos<lb/>session—I went all over London with it, and passed the prosecutor's yard several times—I have had many transactions with Mr. Seal before—he is a sheriff's officer, and holds a farm in Surrey—I sell for the sheriff of Surrey—I consider sixteen guineas as much as the horse was worth—Seal paid me for the horse, I think on the same morning as I sold it, in my own counting-house—my foreman, Graves, was present—I gave him a receipt for it—the horse was standing in my own stable—it had been occasionally at a livery stable opposite—Seal has a small stable at the back of his own house—he sent for the horse on Friday, the 24th, I believe—it only came back to my stable to be given up to the authorities—at the time the pri<lb/>soner applied to me he said he was only in want of a temporary loan, and he should in all probability redeem it in two or three days.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Pier Steam-mill at Deptford. The prisoner has no residence at that mill—I live at No. 18, Union-street—I never authorised him to give my address as his—I advertised for grinding, and the prisoner answered my advertisement—I stated in my advertise<lb/>ment that any one who wished to grind at my mill could reside at my house, if they wished, as I wanted to let part of it—the prisoner never came with corn to grind—he said he expected to send some down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the morning of the 25th of May I was on duty in Wentworth-street, which leads to Petticoat-lane, and saw Clark and Williams walking together down Wentworth-street, in the direction of Petticoat-lane—Williams had the property now produced, tied up in two handkerchiefs—I turned up a court—they looked after me, then walked very fast, and kept looking back—I followed them, and at the corner of Petticoat-lane I laid hold of Williams, and asked what she was carrying—she made no answer—I laid my hand on her right arm, and felt something hard—I said, "What is that?"—she said, "I don't know"—I said, "Whose is it?"—she said, "That young man's," pointing to Clark, who was within bearing—I took the parcel, and brought Clark back to Williams, and asked him what the bundle was—he said he did not know—I asked How he came by it—he said he picked it up in Whitechapel—I requested him to go to the station-house, and Williams walked by the side of us to the station-house—I saw him speak to Harris at the station-house—the two bundles contained the plate produced—in going to the station-house they said they picked it up in Ben Jonson's-fields, which are at Stepney—this was at five o'clock in the morning—Clark gave his address, No. 6, Ernest-street, Regent's-park.</p>

I went to Gulston-street, Petticoat-lane, on the morning of the 26th of May, in plain clothes—I saw Smith, Liddiard, and a girl named Gilbert pass by roe, and as they passed I heard Liddiard say, "Hush, hold your tongue"—I followed them, and they separated—Liddiard went on first—I went up to Smith and Gilbert, and asked them where they had been—Smith said he had been to a public-house with the female prisoner to have a pint of porter—I asked if they knew each other before—they said they did not—Trew then appre<lb/>hended Liddiard—all three were taken to the station-house, and there Liddiard said he lived in Pheasant-court, Gray's Inn-lane—I found that to</p>

                  </hi>. I am eighteen years old—I was taken up for this robbery on the morning of the 25th of May, and have come from prison—when I was taken up I lived in No. 1, Pheasant-court, Gray's Inn-lane, in the back-parlour—I could see Mr. Reeve's back premises from that house—I knew Clark, Smith, and Liddiard before—they all three lived up in the top garret, and Williams lived with me—the night before I was taken up, when I left home, about ten o'clock, I saw the three male pri<lb/>soners in our room, sitting down—I returned home about two o'clock—I had been walking the street all that time—when I came home I found them all in my room, playing at cards, and Williams was playing with them—shortly after Clark got up, and said he was going out, but where I did not know then—they all three went out together, and returned in about a minute, and said there was a policeman—Clark asked Williams for a piece of candle, and the young girl who lived with Williams, and who she called her sister, said to Williams, "They are gone over to Mr. Reeve's back premises"—they had gone out with the candle then—I noticed that Liddiard had a lucifer in his hand before they went out—I did not see where he got it from—Williams gave him the candle—it was not lighted then—I went out again—I was not out a minute—I came back, and sat at my door—I afterwards went to Hoi born-hill, and came back again with the girl who lived with Williams—her name is Sarah—when I came back I saw Smith standing, looking at the other two prisoners, who were over the wall leading to Mr. Reeve's back premises—Williams was not there then—I next saw Liddiard coming over the wall, with a bundle of things, which he handed to Smith in the yard—at that time Williams was in bed—she slipped on her petticoats, and came into the passage just as they were getting over the wall—I am quite sure I saw Liddiard, Smith, and Clark there—Clark and Liddiard were over the wall, and Smith and Williams were in the court—when they came over the wall, Liddiard said to Smith, "I have done it"—Smith came into the room with a bundle of things, and went up to his own room with them—we all went up into his room to<lb/>gether, and he opened the bundle on the bed—there were several watches, a lot of silver spoons and gold rings, and gold pins and things—the rings were all on cards—they were taken off the cards, and the cards torn up and burnt with the candle, and put on the side of the fire-place—Smith said he had better take the cards off the rings and burn them, or he should get found out with them—the things were then all tied up in two hand<lb/>kerchiefs</p>

I have taken so many at different times, you shall answer for all"—I gave them into custody, and gave the officer the half-crown—I was walking from the sitting-room to the bar that evening, I put my foot on something—it was a small bag with a half-crown in it, of the same date as the one I had taken—I gave that to the same officer—it was inside the bar, as if it had been thrown over the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Edward Sherman, he is master of the Bull-and-Mouth, Regent-circus. On the 29th of May the prisoner came to the booking-office—he presented this order, and asked for a basket, addressed to Mr. Blandford, of Dover-street, Piccadilly—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Bull-and-Mouth coach-office, Regent-circus,—Please to send by the bearer a basket, that came by the Devonport and Exeter coach, this day, for J. Blandford, 20, Piccadilly—<hi rend="smallCaps">J. SMITH</hi>. 29th June."—I did not notice the date, but I took the order, and gave it to Mr. Sanders—there was a hamper on a box in the office, directed to Mr. Blandford, which had come by the Devonport and Exeter coach that morning—it was pointed out by a porter in the office—the prisoner took it, put it on his shoulder, and walked out of the office with it—two days afterwards I was in Oxford-street, in a cart, and saw the prisoner—I drew up immediately, and laid hold of him—the parcel was directed to No. 30, Dover-street, Piccadilly—Mr. Blandford is a surgeon, I believe—he always used to send for his parcels, and there was no complaint of their not being delivered—he never sent orders before, but this being a fresh person, we thought that was the reason—we knew the person who came before—we did not know How the name of Smith came on this order—we thought it was some assistant or something.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you searched very accurately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the prosecutor was sitting on the stairs—any body going down must have passed him—there was no woman in the room when I went up.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)

On the 1st of June I was working at the Assembly-room, Kentish-town—I went into the kitchen there about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and the prisoner was there taking a pint of porter—he asked me to take a sup, which I did—I called for a pint myself, and when it was brought I asked him to take a sup of mine, which he did—I have not been drinking now—I am very nervous, and have had a fall since the rob<lb/>bery, which hurt me very much, but I am not at all intoxicated—I took out my purse to pay for my porter and his too—I had 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—the prisoner saw I had money—he said he was going to his barracks, and we walked from the assembly-room house together—we then went to the Nag's Head, and had two pints of porter, which I paid for—we then came on to Kentish-town-bridge together, and when we got there the prisoner pinched hold of my throat with one hand, and put the other into my pocket, and took out all my money but a halfpenny—he ran away immediately, and was not taken till the 4th—I went to Portman barracks then, and saw him in the guard-room with four or five more—I went straight up to him, and said he was the man.</p>

On the 1st of June I went to the cellars under Charlotte-street Chapel—I placed myself in one of the vaults—it is divided into six departments—I was in the middle one—I heard a rumbling noise in the adjoining vault at the end, and soon after I saw the prisoner Doherty with a lighted candle in his hand—he examined the place, and immediately after went to a bar<lb/>rel with this measure in his hand—I saw him take out a spile from the barrel, and fill the measure with the beer in that barrel—he then conveyed it to a hole in the wall where he got in at—I did not see him get in, but he could get in no other way—he gave the beer to Morse and another—he returned three several times more to the same barrel, filled the mea<lb/>sure each time, and took it to the bole in the wall—on the fifth time, while he was in the act of knocking the spile in he moved his position, and saw me advancing, he fell down, and the light went out—I fell on the</p>

               <p>top of him—I saw decidedly that the other person was Morse—I after that went to King's yard, and took Morse—I went into the stable, and found this funnel with the froth of malt liquor on it, and close by it I found this bung, and the cuttings of another bung—when I took Doherty I took this measure of beer from him—I put it into this jar now pro<lb/>duced—the hole in the wall is 16 inches by 10—I could not get through it—there were three bars built in the wall, which had been sawn asunder top and bottom, and put in their places with a quantity of hop matting to support them—I found them so when I went at 4 o'clock in morning—both the prisoners are servants to Mr. King.</p>

I have not any dress"—I then asked where Sullivan was—she said she had gone round the corner—I took Smith with me to Sullivan, and told her I wanted her respecting a dress we had lost—I brought them both back to the shop, and asked Smith about the dress—she said she had not got it—Mrs. Norbury said, "I saw her drop this dress," pointing to this one, which is the one I had seen under Smith's cloak—I then spoke to Sullivan, and she said Smith had been drinking just before she entered the shop with a young man, and she begged Mr. Norbury to let Smith go—a policeman was sent for—Mr. Norbury said he did not suspect Sullivan but Smith, and the po<lb/>liceman took Smith—but previous to that they had changed their bonnets in the shop—Sullivan went with us to the station-house, and when we got nearly there Smith said, "Sullivan has got a dress also, and if I go she shall go"—I then mentioned it to the policeman, and when we got in the policeman searched Sullivan, and found this cloth dress, which is the one I saw Smith take off the counter—Sullivan said she had bought it at our shop, and had given 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, and brought it with her that Smith might have one like it—but when she was in the shop Sullivan had not shewn any dress at all—Mr. Norbury said he should like to have the premises searched at No. 2, George-street, Lisson-grove—this dress was found there in the back room first floor, and this shawl was in the front room, and in a work box on the table I found four or five duplicates—I can state that these were our goods, and had not been sold.</p>

I was sent for and took Smith in charge for stealing this dress—the prisoners then exchanged bonnets—we came out, and in going along, Smith said Sullivan was as bad as she was—I said, "Do you live together?"—she said, "Yes," that Sullivan took her to the shop, and Sullivan had taken a dress—I then found this other dress on Sullivan—I went to the lodging which Sullivan gave me the direction to—the landlady took me up stairs, and there I found this shawl and this other dress, and four duplicates of three dresses, some shawls, and half-a-dozen white handkerchiefs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Richard Swan, a pawnbroker, in Seymour-place. On the 6th of June, between five and six o'clock, I received information, and went up Wellington-street, to Grove-street—I saw Haley and Beeson running together—I came up to them, and Haley said, "There he goes"—I then saw Downes running with some trowsers—he was stopped by a policeman, and then he dropped these trowsers, which are my master's—here are five pairs—they were just outside the door, tied to a chair.</p>

               <p>was some paving going on—nothing had been said to him about the stones in my presence—I then saw the prisoner Lee, he was about fifteen yards from the stones—I went up, and asked him who owned those stones just shot from that cart—he said he did, they were his—I then gave him into custody—I went with Lee, and another officer went with Valentine—I asked Lee whether he was not in the dock at Stratford, on Friday night (the night before)—he said he did not know where it was—he at first said the stones were his, and then he said he knew nothing about them—before he left the place he pointed to the stones, and said to the man, "Go on with your work with these stones."</p>

I am a clothes salesman, and live in Monmouth-street I had three tame fowls on the 31st of May, which I saw safe in my back kitchen, about eleven o'clock at night—I missed them at half-past five o'clock next morning, and found them at a bird shop, kept by Carr, in the next street, in a cupboard at the top of the house, between two rooms—I have had them twelve months, and know them to be mine—I do not know the prisoner—he is a stranger to me—the back kitchen was left open that night—the back of Carr's premises is about five houses off mine.</p>

Between five and six o'clock in the morning, I was coming down St. An<lb/>drew-street, and heard a noise in the passage of No. 29—I looked into the passage and saw the prisoner—I had seen him about before—he had three fowls in his hand by the legs—they were alive, and one was hallooing—I waited at the door till he came down, and asked what he was doing—he said they had got away from him, and he went over the wall after them—he spoke of them as his own fowls—he asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. till he sold them—I would not—I saw the fowls afterwards at the office, and they appeared to be the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pensioner of the Bombay Artillery. I came home in the <hi rend="italic">Lady Feversham</hi>—I landed at Blackwall on the 11th of June, about seven o'clock in the morning, with a person of the name of Henry—I had a box with me containing the articles stated and the money—when I came on shore I went into the Kings Arms public-house—I saw some comrades, and told them I wanted to get the boxes out of the boat—I went out, and saw the prisoner—I told him to come and assist me with the boxes out of the boat—he went with me to the boat—we took the boxes out, and brought them up to the public-house, and laid them in front of the bar—I asked him to show me a place to get shaved, and he went with me to a barber's—after I was shaved we came back to the same public-house, and found the things where they were left—I and my comrades brought the boxes out, and laid them on a cart—we took them out again, and laid them on the pathway, and I went in to settle—the pri<lb/>soner was standing convenient to the pathway, close to where we laid down the boxes—I told him I wanted to go to Leadenhall-street, as be<lb/>ing the most convenient to the India House—I returned to the public-house to settle with the landlady, and when I came out the prisoner was gone and my property—I expected to find him there—I have never seen my property since, nor did I see the prisoner till he was at Lambeth-street police-office—he was then quite in a different dress—I am certain he it the person—I went with him to the shop, and walked with him.</p>

I met the prisoner and Fowns together about twelve o'clock on the night of the 6th of June, and went to a house near Petticoat-lane with them—I went up stairs with Fowns and left Tucker below—after Fowns had gone away the prisoner came up stairs and pretended to make the bed—I asked for Fowns—she said she would come directly, but she did not—I took my coat off in Tucker's presence, put it on a chair, and went-down to look for Fowns, who I told her had got my ring—there was a pocket-book, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, an invoice, a pencil case, and a purse con<lb/>taining silver in my coat pocket—I went up stairs again, put my coat on, and came down—I then felt in my pocket, and missed my pocket-book—I told the prisoner I had lost my pocket-book, and said I would give her half a crown to go up stairs with me—she did so, and she said there was no pocket-book there—I took a light, and looked myself, but could find no<lb/>thing—she crossed over the way, and no doubt put it away somewhere there—I have never found it since, nor the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—I did not stay up stairs with the prisoner two minutes—I told the policeman of it when I came down.</p>

                  </hi>. I command the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi> Dublin steamer. I sailed in her from Falmouth on Friday, the 22nd of March, about eight o'clock in the morning—I received two boxes from Mr. Jordan, which I put in the money room under the cabin floor—I locked the room, and put the key in a blanket under the head of my bed—we arrived at the Irongate-wharf in London about a quarter to four o'clock on Sunday the 24th of March, and commenced unloading next morning about six or seven o'clock—I sent word to the wharf that when the man came for the box I should want him at ten o'clock—I put the two boxes in the office on the wharf—Mr. Bristow and Mr. Felton were present at the time—I put them in the office about ten o'clock on Monday morning—they took charge of them—I afterwards went to the office in John-street, Crutched-friars—I got there about half-past ten o'clock—I saw the prisoner Lewin Caspar there—I told him I had delivered the money or the boxes, and that I was going to the Custom-house to report the ship—he said he would go down and attend to it himself—among the papers in the ship's-box was this bill of lading (<hi rend="italic">marked "No,</hi> 1")—I signed two, and one was put into the box—I believe this to be it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am of the Jewish persuasion. Before this matter hap<lb/>pened I lived in New-street, Mile End-road, and was a watchmaker—I was in the employment of Mr. Hyams, and have been so ten years last November—I have been acquainted with the prisoner Ellis Caspar about sixteen years—I was once his foreman for about twelve months—I remained with him as his foreman till I was about to be married—my acquaintance with him has continued down to this transaction—he was present at my marriage—I con<lb/>tinued to see him occasionally from that time to this—I have known the younger Caspar the same time—a certain interval elapsed when I did not see him—he came to learn my business of me immediately after I left his father's employment—he came for a very short time, not more than a month or two—I sometimes saw him in his father's shop as I passed—it may be three or four years ago that the interval was when I did not see Lewin Caspar—I have been in the habit of seeing him for the last twelve or eighteen months—I knew he was in the employ of the Irish Steam Packet Company—Ellis Caspar lives in Finsbury-pavement, and Lewin lives with him—I called there to see them about last October, at Ellis Caspar's invitation, and accompanied him to the synagogue—while we were at the synagogue Lewin Caspar came in—we all three left the syna<lb/>gogue together—Ellis Caspar said he wanted to see me—I said I would call at the earliest opportunity—I saw Ellis Caspar on the following Sun<lb/>day at my house—I did not expect him there—I had not called on him be<lb/>fore, as I had said I would—he then said he wanted me to do him a favour which he did not explain then—he wished me to meet him in the afternoon in St. Martin's-le-Grand, at Williams's coffee-house—he told me we should meet another person, who would explain the business to me—I went there according to his wish—Ellis Caspar came there to me, and I went with him to the Old Bailey—he did not tell me for what purpose—we called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in the Old Bailey, both got into it, and were driven to Charing-cross—he told me we were going there to meet a person—we went into a coffee-house at Charing-cross—Lewin Caspar came there—he said nothing there—there were some strangers in the room—he said he would walk out, and go over the way, and we all went into the Park—by that time it was quite dark—when we got into the Park, Ellis Caspar told Lewin to tell me what he wanted of me, as he had told me nothing hitherto—Lewin said, "I have not yet told him neither"—upon that Lewin Caspar said a good deal, he said "The business you are wanted for, is to bring a letter that my father will give you, to my office in John-street, Crutched-friars, and I will give you a box, which you will take to my father, and I will meet you at some future time, and make you a hand<lb/>some recompence," or something of that sort—I asked him what the box was to contain—he told me he did not know; it was a matter of no con<lb/>sequence to me what it contained—he said a ticket-porter might do it, only he did not want his father to be seen in it, as the business was secret—I was to have the letter next morning, at a coffee-house in the street which faces the Monument—I was to meet his father there—I went to that coffee-house next morning, about ten o'clock—Ellis Caspar met me there—he</p>

               <p>said he had not seen Lewin yet—he went away, and returned in about a quarter of an hour, with Lewin Caspar—Ellis Caspar had a letter or paper in his hand—I did not look at it so as to know its contents—Lewin Caspar said the ship which was to have brought in the box had not yet arrived, and he told me I had better call in the afternoon, as it was hourly expected—we then separated—I went back in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Ellis Caspar desired me to go in a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> which he paid for, and I went home—I did not receive any thing from either of them at that time—I did the following day—I met them both again the same afternoon, at the same place—I met Ellis Cat par first, and he fetched Lewin—Lewin then told me the ship had arrived, but there had been an accident; two of their ships had run foul of each other, and there had been a great deal of damage done—he told me the ship had arrived, but the boxes were at the bottom of the vessel, and he could not get at them, and I was to come next morning to the same place—I went next morning, and saw Ellis Caspar there, as before—he fetched Lewin—Lewin told me the box was too heavy to take away, and he desired his father to give me half-a-sovereign, which he did—that was for the time I had lost in attending to them—Lewin asked me, if he should want me at any time, where he was to direct—(Ellis was present at the time)—I told him I was always at my employ—he knew where my employer lived—Lewin said he did not wish it should be known by my employer that a correspondence was carried on between us, and he should direct over to my house, by the Twopenny post, and would not sign his own name—after that I met Ellis Caspar in Finsbury-square, and Lewin came to us—I saw them several times before this transaction occurred—I cannot exactly say How often, but it was several times—that was always in consequence of receiving notes—the meeting in Finsbury-square was not at Ellis Caspar's house, it was in the street—the other meetings were frequently at the Exchange coffee-house, and different places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During these meetings, did either of them give you information about this transaction you were to be engaged in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—on one occa<lb/>sion Lewin asked what sort of a hand I wrote—Ellis Caspar was not pre<lb/>sent then—it was on one occasion, when I met him, about three months at least before this transaction—it was before Christmas—I wrote my name and address on a piece of paper—he said that would do, and he proposed for me to write for him two letters—he said he would give me the forms, and I should copy the forms, and he would also give me another letter, that I was to imitate the hand-writing of as near as I could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was that other letter about, that he gave you, the handwrit<lb/>ing of which you were to imitate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a letter about a turtle that was to have been sent by a gentleman at the Bank of England—this is the letter-(<hi rend="italic">looking at one marked No.</hi> 6)—I subsequently received two forms which I was to copy—I copied them, and returned them to Lewin Caspar, with the copies—the first I wrote were rejected in consequence of the spaces being too narrow, not left wide enough, and the ink was too pale—there were spaces to be left—I wrote two others—(<hi rend="italic">looking at Not.</hi> 3 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 4)—these are both my hand-writing—there were spaces left, which are now filled up—(<hi rend="italic">the witness here marked those parts which were left blank when he wrote it</hi>)—the address was on No. 3—I have marked on them what was blank when I wrote it—this letter (No. 4) was addressed to Lewm Caspar when I gave it to him—I delivered both the letters to Lewin Caspar myself at the same time—I addressed one to him by his desire-one was not enclosed in</p>

Hartley's, John-street—a young lad came to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> door—Ellis Caspar had desired me to ask for Mr. Hartley, which I did—something passed between me and the lad, and he went in and sent out Lewin Caspar—I gave him the letter, and he went into the office with it—he came out again to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with another letter, as well as the one I had given him—he compared the two, and said there was some mistake, I must go into the office and he would correct it—I went into the office into the back-room, the inner-room through the front warehouse—there was nobody in the inner office but Lewin Caspar and myself—we passed through the outer office, and I saw some clerks there—when we got into the inner room he corrected the mis<lb/>take—I did not notice what the correction was—he then wrote an order at the foot of the letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Mr. Bristow, please to deliver the above, Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You went there on purpose to tell Mr. Robinson, and now do not recollect whether you told him or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I sent the statement to Mr. Robinson in writing—it was very little conversation I had with him about it—I went there to tell him—my object was to be more particular, be<lb/>cause I had written the whole account of the transaction to be sent to Mr. Robinson, which was taken to him—there was some negotiation going on at that time, and so I wrote this out—it was taken there by Davis and Mrs. Abrahams together—I recollect perfectly that it was said in Robinson's presence what became of the boxes—it was mentioned that Davis had destroyed the boxes, but about Mrs. Levy was not mentioned in Robin<lb/>son's presence—it was mentioned about destroying the boxes, I recollect that perfectly, by Davis.</p>

               <p>but Lazarus was my wife's maiden name, and he was her father—I never heard that he travelled any great distance—he has been dead some years—I never heard that he went to Botany-bay—I do not doubt that such a thing might be the case—I never knew it—I hardly know How Davis gets his living—I do not know How many houses he keeps—he has more than I am aware of—the house I was hid in I think was a house of ill fame—that was not the first house I went to, but the first house was one of the same kind I believe—I knew that house before—it was not at my own suggestion I went there—it was Ellis Caspar's suggestion—he gave me the paper, and desired me to go—Davis kept that house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to tell me just now that you did not know How he got his living? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he had various ways of getting his living—I believe a portion of his living was got by keeping brothels—I have not the least doubt in the world of it—I do not know How many he keeps—I knew he kept those I went to, at the time I went there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But it required a note from Mr. Caspar to induce you to go to your own father-in-law's brothels, do you mean to say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I mean to say I never went there once in three years before—Mr. Caspar desired me to go there to conceal myself, and gave me a note—I kept that note, and handed it over to the officer—I quitted one and went to the other, be<lb/>cause he told me I should not be so safe there, as I should be in the other—one house is in Coventry-court, and the other in Oxendon-street—they are very near each other—I do not know that Davis had any other houses but those two—I have been told he had one more—I do not deny it being so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By the bye, when did you see Ikey Solomons last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that I ever saw him in my life to my know<lb/>ledge—I have heard of the man—I should not know him if I were to see him—I do not know that I have ever spoken to him—to my know<lb/>ledge I never did—if I did it is not to my knowledge now, nor ever was—I never did know him to my knowledge—I have no recollection of the man—he never came to me to employ me in my business as a watch<lb/>maker—I did not deface any marks on watches for him, that I swear—I did not expect there was any guilt in this business till my last interview with Caspar—I do not know where I lived at the time Ikey Solomons fled—I do not know what time it was exactly—I remember hearing some<lb/>thing of the circumstance—it did not make the least impression on me—my house was never searched on any occasion—it was never searched for Ikey Solomons, nor was any house belonging to me searched for him—nor any house where I lived—I lived in a place called Bevis-marks, at No. 18, I think, but it is so many years ago—it is twelve years ago—my house there was not searched for Ikey Solomons—that I swear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your house searched for any thing which Ikey Solomons was suspected of having stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It never was searched—I remember now the circumstance well, if you will give me leave to explain it—there was a person called at my house, when I lived there—I do not know that he was an officer—there were two gentlemen together—they said they had got information I had some stolen property about the house—I took them into my work-shop, and the side room—they looked about, but saw no<lb/>thing there, and one gentleman said to the other, "I am perfectly satisfied we have got wrong information"—I do not know that they were officers—I believe one was an officer—I should suppose so—my house was not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170165"/>
               <p>searched, they merely went into the shop—they did not tell me it was for property I key Solomons was suspected of having stolen—they never men<lb/>tioned the name—I did not ask them what property they wanted—they merely looked over the shop-board—in fact they did not want to tee so much as I showed them—they merely came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just before they came in did you hand any property out of any of the windows? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I answer that without hesitation or doubt, because I can recollect—I swear it most distinctly—Mrs. Levy did not live in my house at that time, nor did Mrs. Lewell—Mrs. Almazedo did—I believe she is alive—she was a lady, with two daughters and a son—she was a very respectable lady—I do not know that she is dead, but she was an old lady then—there was no other place but my shop searched—I did not ask them many questions, because they said at once they were satisfied it was wrong information they had received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you of the Hebrew persuasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have said I was not—I told Mr. Fishwick so, of whom I had the. lodging—it was not true—it is a tenet of our religion to abstain from certain articles of food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In order to convince Mr. Fishwick that that falsehood was truth, did you eat any of those articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I ate at their table—I dare say I ate pork, but I do not know—I ate every thing that was set before me—I do not know exactly what dishes were served up—I said I was no Jew, and ate any thing at their table—he did not ask me if I liked any dish or not—at the first interview I had, he asked me about the diet—he thought I was a Jew by coining with Mrs. Abrahams—I did not eat bacon or pork that I know of—I should consider it sinful to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you can say whether or not you committed a sin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had no other means of getting provision—I did not eat it that I recollect—I might—I did eat forbidden meat—various meats I had while I was there—every thing that came in my way I ate, whether it was a hind or fore quarter—it made no difference to me while I was there—the bind quarter is forbidden in our religion, but it made do difference to me then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, Mr. Moss, you have sworn that until a certain time, which you mentioned, you did not suspect there was any guilt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—I had suspicions when I was asked to imitate another man's hand-writing—that was a long time before I became alarmed—but my suspicions were lulled by Lewin Caspar assuring me that his friend was a banker, and there was not the least fear that harm could come of it—it never struck me it might be to commit a forgery on the Bank—he told me his friend was to sign the letter himself—it was not his hand-writing I imitated—it was his clerk's. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why imitate another man's writing, you having suspicion it was not right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will tell you—I will explain to you again, if you please, How it was I was induced to do so—at the time I mentioned my suspicions Lewin Caspar then showed me a letter which he had received from the same person addressed to him, where a consignment was made to him for 90, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that lulled my suspicions to suppose he was going to commit a forgery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you, at the dictation of any one, to imitate another person's handwriting in letters with blanks—can you give any honest reason for doing so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I cannot—I knew it was wrong, the whole business—I knew it was wrong at the time—he told me he did not wish to be seen at my house—I never suspected to what extent it was wrong—I know it was wrong to some extent—I never knew a robbery was contemplated.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you give any honest reason for your writing a hand like a banker's clerk at the dictation of a third person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can give no honest reason for committing a forgery—it is a forgery I am convinced—I knew it was imitating, but I did not know the intention—I did not think it was an honest intention—I inquired what the intention was, and he said it was to deceive the London clerks only—I should have thought that no harm, if a robbery was not intended—he gave me to understand it was to oblige his friend and not himself—I did it freely—I did not think it fair and honest—I thought a forgery was to be committed—I did it to oblige Caspar's friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you have stolen this gold dust if you thought it was wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not have stolen it under the idea that I was doing right—I did not know I was stealing it at the time I took it—I fetched it away to oblige Caspar—I did not know what it was—if I had thought Caspar was employing me to steal it I certainly should not have done it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why commit a forgery knowing you were committing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know at that time what use was to be made of the letters—I knew it was wrong—I did not conceive it to be a forgery, in consequence of my not having made use of any names—I knew I was imitating a handwriting, but I put no signature to the letter—I said just now that it was a forgery, but I was told that it was only to deceive the London clerks—I knew I was imitating.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know it was a forgery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I did know it was a for<lb/>gery—I have made up my mind to that—I knew a forgery was a criminal thing—I was induced to do it by Mr. Caspar—I would not steal at the suggestion of Mr. Caspar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then why forge at his suggestion?<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot give any honest reason for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Give us a dishonest one—come, out with it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, my dishonest one was to oblige Mr. Caspar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not think something was to be got by it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He promised to pay me for it, most distinctly he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then to oblige your friend Mr. Caspar you committed a forgery, be having promised to pay you for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did it for money—I never said that my only object in doing it was to oblige Mr. Caspar—I did not mean to. convey to the Jury that my only object was to oblige Caspar—I got nothing for the forgery—the forgery evidently did succeed, but I got no money—I am not at all pleased with Mr. Caspar—there was not any stipulated sum which I was to have for the forgery—I was to depend on Lewin Caspar for the reward—I had not the curiosity to ask what the for<lb/>gery was about—I was astonished afterwards to find I had been guilty of stealing—I was surprised to find the consequences, as Lewin told me there was no consequences attached to me at all—I had no intention to rob any<lb/>body—the letters I wrote did not contain any thing—they were only half sense—I thought there was secrecy in it, but I did not know there was crime—there was no sum mentioned for my imitating the hand-writing—I did not ask if I was to be paid—I was told I was to be paid—it was after I was told so that I committed the forgery—it may have been a month after—it was Lewin Caspar asked what kind of hand I wrote—he might have seen me write, as I was with his father twelve months and better—I was not writing daily in the shop—I sometimes wrote before both father and son.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170167"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And yet Lewin asked you what kind of hand you wrote? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did—I do not know that I ever wrote in any books of theirs at all—I wrote on paper—I never wrote in any of Caspar's books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray, Mr. Moss, How many accounts of this transaction did you give to the prosecutor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know exactly—I gave more than one—they were not all alike—it was with a view to my being admitted as Queen's evidence that I sent in the statement—when I first saw the prosecutor I told them that the statement I was then giving was a true one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the oath you have taken was not that just as false as your telling Fishwick you were not a Jew? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, decidedly, I gave that statement intending to deceive them—I was induced to do it—my object was at the instigation of Davis and Mrs. Abrahams to screen them as well as myself—I thought the most of myself—I gave in another statement after that—I do not know How many statements I gave—there were several sent up—I only gave two statements—the one given with my own hand was true, and one I told Mr. De Mole was not true—the first statement I gave in was false—I gave Mr. De Mole another false statement—both those state<lb/>ments were false—Mr. De Mole is one of the solicitors for the prosecution—I gave him that false statement to blind him, not to baffle the prosecutor, but to screen these parties and myself—I certainly should not have done it if I had not been implicated myself—I should have had no necessity for it—I sent in the written statement first, and then Mr. De Mole saw me, and I gave him a second statement, which was as false as the first—it was all at the instigation of Mrs. Abrahams and Davis, most decidedly—they per<lb/>suaded me to save them and myself—I only gave one more statement—the third was the truth—all of it was truth—I believe every word was the troth—there was not a syllable intentionally, to deceive any body—it was all true—I should suppose nobody could be deceived—that third statement was given in to save myself only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What! your old affection for Davis and Mrs. Abrahams fled? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had no affection at all—I thought they were my friends, but found they had deceived me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, did you not most solemnly assert to Mr. De Mole that the se<lb/>cond statement which you gave him was true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did—I believe the verbal statement I gave Mr. De Mole corresponded with my written statement, and that I assured them it was truth—the first statement was contradicted by the second—they were both false—if I said the second statement corresponded with the first it was a mistake—I sent in the first statement as the truth—if I said the second statement which I made to Mr. De Mole corresponded with the first, it was a mistake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the second statement contradicted the first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The second was false, and the first was false, yet at he time of giving each you assured the prosecutor both were true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have given a third statement to-day—that differs from the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you give us the same assurance now that this is true as you gave the prosecutor about the other two? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because when the first were to be carried into effect I refused to swear to them—I refused to swear to the verbal statements which I made to Mr. De Mole—I thought I had done wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear you only made three statements? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170168"/>
               <p>several statements, and sent them to Mr. De Mole, from the prison—the first statement was sent to Mr. Robinson—I sent one to Mr. Robinson—I was dictated How to word it—Davis dictated it to me—I sent that to Mr. Robinson as the truth—I did not give a second statement in writing—I do not recollect it—I wrote a great many papers—the second statement I wrote I have no recollection of but that I gave it Mr. Buckland, my attor<lb/>ney—I have no recollection of sending another statement not through Mr. Buckland—I will not swear I did not send a third false statement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not when you were afraid Mrs. Abrahams would turn evi<lb/>dence that you made the statement you have now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was not afraid at all—I never heard that she intended to turn evidence—the true statement I made was sent from the prison—I sent that in more than a month before the final commitment—I was at all the examinations—Mrs. Abrahams was examined at one of them—I think it was after her exami<lb/>nation that I sent in the true statement, but I had mentioned the circum<lb/>stance to the gentlemen for the prosecutor in the officer's parlour before Mrs. Abrahams was heard—it was after that that I sent in the written statement—that was done for the sole purpose of saving myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, on your oath, do you care who is convicted, provided you are saved yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is not my object—I have acted under the ad<lb/>vice of my solicitor, who has told me to tell all the truth and let every one take care of themselves—I was one of those who was to take care of myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not you afraid that Mrs. Abrahams was going to take care of herself when you saw her sworn at the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing of that—I did not see her sworn that I recollect—when she was at the bar as a prisoner I never heard her sworn to my knowledge—I will not say whether she was sworn or not—I remember her being examined as a wit<lb/>ness in the police office—I will not swear she was not sworn in my pre<lb/>sence—I was not charged at that time—Mrs. Abrahams and I were not sworn on the same book at the same time—I was not sworn till the last examination—I do not remember Mrs. Abrahams being sworn—it was be<lb/>fore she was examined that my solicitor told me every one was to take care of themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, be good enough to tell us what guarantee we have that you are telling the truth now more than the prosecutor and Mr. De Mole had as to your. other statements? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The only guarantee I believe is I am borne out by other circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you do not consider yourself worthy of credit unless your evi<lb/>dence is borne out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Under these circumstances I do not think I am to be believed without it—I think my being a forger is against me—every thing tends to cast suspicion upon me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not leave that box having a very bad opinion of yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have a worse opinion of myself than you may imagine.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What aged man are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 42—I was brought up in St. George's-fields, and apprenticed in Sun-street—I then went to live at Birmingham—I was there about six months, and then came back and worked for Mr. Caspar—I have mostly lived in London—I have been married fifteen years—I was married in the Jewish form—the Jew's Passover corresponds with the Christian's Easter—I am not aware that Jews are much in the habit of visiting each other at Passover times—they eat the passover cake.</p>

               <p>commit forgery, and assist in robbery?<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was conducting business for Mr. Joshua Hyams—I had a salary—I got into debt two quarters' rent, and some other little matters—I keep no shop—I was acquainted with the Caspars before—it was considerably before Christmas that Lewin wanted me to do this—he made a thousand excuses about the forged papers—I had not the least suspicion in the world—I wrote two letters, which were rejected, and then wrote two others, with the paper and ink he supplied me with—the two first were torn to pieces—I had a brass plate on my door, with "Moss, watchmaker," on it—it was Monday night that I burnt the boxes—I sat up all night doing that—in the interval I took off the plate, before it was quite day-light, I recollect that—Mrs. Abrahams came to me at Davis's house on Easter Monday night—I only know of Davis keeping these two houses—he was indicted for one, but I believe he does not keep that house now—I am sure I do not know what other trade be follows—I dare say he may deal in gold and silver—I believe him to be a very bad character—I do not know where he is now—I have not heard from him since he has been away—the last I heard of him was at the police-office, at the first examination or two I think he was there—he was there after I had told the truth, in the Magistrate's parlour—I corrected my statement in the parlour, in the presence of the gentlemen—I saw Davis after I made my full statement in the Justice's parlour—he went to the prison with me in the coach the same evening—he ran away afterwards—it was on Easter Tuesday night that Mrs. Abrahams and Davis met me in Lincoln's Inn-fields—I went to Brentford, to get out of the way, while they procured me a lodging—Davis did not go there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why, you say you did not know you had done any robbery; what harm had you done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was convinced of it then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were doubtful before whether going to another man's house, and taking away valuable property, was a robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know but what Lewin had authority to do it—it was Lewin's own order—it was Ellis who told me I had been watched and must be careful—he told me so the same night—I had all the property then unbroken in my possession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did not you then, when the property was all untouched, and you were implicated as a thief, tell the prosecutors there was their property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I was afraid I had gone too far—I knew I had written the letters—I was afraid to do it—it occurred to me afterwards, since that—it did not occur to me at the time—I was under the influence of fear—I heard about the parting with the gold on coming to Lincoln's Inn-fields—my desire in giving the two false accounts was to spare Mrs. Abrahams and Davis, and to screen myself, of course—my wife and sister were not concerned—they were in prison—I thought of saving them most decidedly—I believe you told the Magistrate that I could not be a witness till they were liberated—I have only known Solomon since this transaction—I never knew him in my life before—I put the name of Dean to the letter, as I thought it was the name I was desired to write—I have heard since that Solomon's foreman is named Dean—I never heard it before he was examined—there was a negociation going on by Mrs. Abrahams and Davis before I ever saw Mr. Robinson—the purport of the negociation was not for Mrs. Abrahams to tell what she knew, and bring herself out of all danger—I went with them twice to Robinson's—I do not know the day of the month—it may have been the 11th of April—I afterwards had an interview with Mr. De Mole,</p>

               <p>Mr. Hartley, and some other gentleman, I believe, was there—I made a statement there—I had made the statement to Mr. Robinson before that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you, and Mrs. Abrahams, and Davis, went to Robinson's house, did not Mrs. Abrahams say, "I have at last got Moss to come for<lb/>ward to you, he will satisfy you with documents who the receiver is?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think she did—I do not know the exact words I made use of—I did not bring the "IOU" with me—Robinson had it before I came—I do not remember saying, "Mrs. Abrahams has brought me to you, I hope I can rely on you as well as her"—I cannot swear I did not say so—I might have said, "Here are the notes, and an 'I O U', given to me by Solo<lb/>mon, who bought the gold of me;" but I did not bring the "I O U" with me—I could not have mentioned the "I O U," because I had not got it—Mr. Robinson had it in his pocket-book—I never saw it before I saw it at Mr. Robinson's house—I cannot say who brought it to Robin<lb/>son's—he had it when I came into the room—I never had it in my pos<lb/>session—I did not say, "Here are the notes and the 'I O U'"—I gave him the notes—I dare say I said I had received them of Solomon, to whom I had sold the gold dust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you at the same time say, "I hope you will get me made a witness for the Crown?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect ever saying those words—I came there with an understanding that he was to get me a witness for the Crown—I may have said I expected to be made so—I do not recollect the precise words—perhaps I did say so—I cannot say whether I did or not—he had been previously apprised of my intentions—he did not dismiss me, saying I was not to be believed at all—he never said any such thing—he never said, "I don't believe a word you say, you have told me so many lies"—I suppose he had not found me out then—Mr. Robinson was not with me when I saw Mr. De Mole—he came with me in the coach, and Davis and Mrs. Abrahams—Roe, the officer, was waiting there, and Mr. Hartley was there—Robinson and Davis came in a coach from Peckham—I believe an appointment was made the night previous for Mr. De Mole to see Mrs. Abrahams at the London Coffee-house, and take down what she had to say, but I was not present—I never saw Mr.—till I saw him at the police-office—since the last commitment I have had conti<lb/>nual communication with him.</p>

On the 25th of March, I remember seeing John Vince with the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi> papers' box in the warehouse—I saw Lewin Caspar come in between seven and eight o'clock that morning—his usual time of coming was nine o'clock—after the ship's box had been left in the warehouse, Lewin Caspar came in a second time—he opened the box and took the papers out—I received the General Post letters from the postman that morning, and gave them to Wm. Blundell—about ten o'clock that morning, Lewin Caspar told me to go down to the wharf and tell Mr. Bristow not to let the <hi rend="italic">money</hi> go until he (Lewin Caspar) came to the wharf—I delivered that message to Felton, the clerk, as Mr. Bristow was not in the way, and returned to Lewin Caspar at the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your return did you see Lewin Caspar in company with any body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The second time I returned I did—I saw him in his own office</p>

               <p>with the witness Moss—I saw them go out—Lewin Caspar only went as far as the warehouse door with him—he went with him from his own office to the warehouse door, and he opened the door for him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been a messen<lb/>ger in the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been in the employ close upon seven years—I have known Lewin Caspar there about a year and a half—he was very attentive to business as far as I observed—he came between seven and eight o'clock that morning—I am sure it was before eight o'clock, but he went out prior to receiving the ship's box—I will say he came at a quarter or twenty minutes before eight o'clock—nine o'clock was his usual time, sometimes he used to come rather before nine o'clock, and sometimes after nine—I have not often known him come as early as eight o'clock, with the exception of mornings that a vessel was to sail at six or seven o'clock—he has not been there as early as six or seven o'clock, but I have heard him say he slept on board a vessel all night—it was very seldom vessels did sail so early—I have known him be at the office when vessels sailed so early, but to go away again—I have been there as early as six or seven o'clock on those mornings—I have not seen him there so early—when a vessel did sail so early, he has slept on board all night—I have seen him at the office as early as six or seven o'clock in the morning—I have not seen him there as early as seven or eight o'clock when no vessel was to sail—he has said be slept on board occasionally—I cannot tell whether he did or not—he did not usually do so when vessels were to be unloaded—I am not aware that it was part of his duty to superintend the delivery of cargoes—I have never seen him attending the delivery of a cargo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not seen him there as early as seven or eight o'clock when vessels were not expected to sail? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might be there as early, I can<lb/>not say—I have not the least doubt I have seen him there at eight o'clock—not frequently—he might be there as often as twice or thrice at that hour—I mean only two or three times in the year and a half—I should be very sorry to swear I had not seen him there ten times—he might or might not—on the 25th of March Mr. Hartley was not in town—the whole management and superintendence of the business fell on Lewin Caspar during his absence—he was the confidential clerk or manager—he was the only man the business rested on—there was a second clerk—every body else there was under him—the business of the office generally commenced at nine o'clock—it opened between six and seven o'clock—I was one of the first there—I remember that it was the 25th of March that he was there. between seven and eight o'clock, because it was the day the robbery was committed—I should say he always showed the greatest anxiety to do what was proper in the business—I have brought him his breakfast to the office several times on mornings that he has been on board ships—I cannot re<lb/>member that I have done so on other mornings—I will swear I cannot re<lb/>member doing so except on those mornings I have named—I will swear I have not—I have done so when a vessel was sailing—those were the morn<lb/>ings to the best of my recollection—I will not say I never did on other oc<lb/>casions—I have brought him his breakfast time after time, and especially on those mornings when a vessel was to sail early, but I am not aware; of any other time—I will not swear I have not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever give a description of the person you now say was Moss, who was in Lewin Caspar's company <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of—the statement I gave at the office was, that he wore large whiskers,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170173"/>
               <p>I mean coming down with a peak to the chin—at the tithe he was in the office with Lewin Caspar he had whiskers—now he has none—they were large whiskers, very bushy at the side, such as you do not often see—I men<lb/>tioned about it at the office, not at any other place that I am aware of—I did not give any description of him till I was at the office—there was a great stir in our office when the robbery was discovered—I gave no de<lb/>scription of the man till I went to Lambeth-street—I went there by my<lb/>self—I was summoned to go by Roe or Lea—I might have had some con<lb/>versation with Roe or Lea before I went there—if I had, I cannot recollect what it was—I do not recollect having any conversation with them, but I Will not swear any thing about it—I am not aware that I gave a descrip<lb/>tion of the man to Roe or Lea—I will not swear I did not—I might or might not—I cannot recollect that I did, either to Roe or Lea, or any one, till went to the office to state it there, until my statement was taken down by Mr. De Mole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the man you saw at the office with Lewin Caspar a fair or a dark man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should call him a dark man—to the best' of my opinion he was dark—I will not sweat he was hot a fair man—I will swear nothing at all about it—he Had what I call sandy whiskers, they were rather red—he was a light made man, not very than, nor yet stout—I should have taken him to be between thirty and forty years of age, to the best of my opinion—I never gave Mr. Bristow a description of the man, that I am aware of, but I will swear nothing at all about it—I did not to my know<lb/>ledge—Mr. Bristow did not ask me any questions about it that I am aware of—I did not tell Mr. Bristow that the man I saw in the office with Casper was about sixty years of age—I will swear that I never said any thing to Mr. Bristow about the age of the man, to my knowledge—I remember asking Lewin Caspar, in Mr. Bristow's presence, to give me something to drink his health—that was on Good Friday, when I pasted some bills, by order of the prisoner, one in front of the office—that was the Friday after the robbery—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I did not, on that occasion, give a de<lb/>scription of the man to Mr. Bristow—I said nothing about the age of the man at that time—I did not say that the bills contained a false description of the man that I am aware of—I did not say that I am aware of—I will swear nothing at all about it—but I am not aware of saying any such thing to Lewin Caspar, or Mr. Bristow—the bills were about the robbery, giving a description of the man, and all the rest of it—I know a clerk named Allen—he was in the office six or seven months—he left about a fornight or three weeks after after the robbery—I do not know that it was Within a week of it—I know nothing further than he has eloped—he was not dis<lb/>missed—he left of his own accord—he gave no notice that I am aware of—I do not know whether he gave notice—he left the situation suddenly—he lived at the corner of Burr-street, East Smithfield, just before he left—that is nearly opposite where the packets come do—I do not recol<lb/>lect How long he lived there—I heard him say he had moved from the Commercial-road—I did not know where Moss lived at the time of the robbery—Allen did not live near the London hospital, to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Messrs. Hartley's office. On the 25th of March I was in the counting-house when the General-post letters were delivered—Lewin Caspar was there also—it was about half-past nine o'clock—I took the letters from Mitchell's hands, to whom the postman delivered them—it is my practice to enter them in a book which I have here—I did not take any account of them before I gave them to Lewin Caspar—he took them from me—there is an entry made by me that morn<lb/>ing of the letters that came—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>) "1 Falmouth, 2 Plymouth, 4 Dublin"—they came to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Lewin Caspar took the letters from me, and returned them to me afterwards—some of them he opened—when he returned them to me there were two Falmouth letters—1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is the postage of a Falmouth letter—it was the custom of the General-postman to put the amount of all the letters on one of them, and he had done so that morning—I ascertained the amount myself—the amount, when I put it down, did not agree with the postman's—I put down the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from one Falmouth letter, two Plymouth, and four Dublin, but there were two Fal<lb/>mouth letters, after taking them from Lewin Caspar—I at first ascertained there was but one, and put it down so—after Caspar returned them to me, I found two, and altered the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the entry of the postman on the letter was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we settled with the General Postman once a week—when I paid him that week I only paid him for one Fal<lb/>mouth letter—after that the letters were taken into the office—Lewin Caspar took them in—about eleven o'clock that morning I was called out to see a person who came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—(<hi rend="italic">the witness Moss was here called in</hi>)—that is the person—he asked for some one in the office—I went out to him, and he asked me if Mr. Hartley was in town—I told him he was not, but that Mr. Hartley's agent would see him—I went in and called Lewin Caspar—he went out to the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and they both returned into the office together—they remained there a very few minutes, and came out together—they were in the back office—before they came out, Lewin Caspar came into the room where I was, and asked me if there were two boxes of gold dust, marked "BC 18—19" consigned to the Brazilian Com<lb/>pany—I told him the manifest had gone to the wharf, but I would refer to the book—I did so, found the entry, and told him—when they left the office Lewin Caspar opened the door, and let Moss out—he went away, and Lewin Caspar returned into the office—Moss was not present when Lewin Caspar asked me about the gold dust.</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant to the Brazilian Company. I came to the office on Monday morning the 25th of March, at the usual time, about ten o'clock—I know Messrs. Came, merchants, of Falmouth—I have not got by me any advices I received from them previous to that day—no boxes of gold dust, marked "B C 18 and 19," arrived on the 25th of March—we expected them—Mr. March, the secretary, arrived at the office about a quarter before eleven o'clock, and in consequence of some conver<lb/>sation between myself and Mr. March, I sent George Carthew to the Dub<lb/>lin Steam-packet office to inquire if two boxes of gold, marked "B C 18 and 19," had arrived by the Dublin steam-boat—I remember Lewin Cas<lb/>par coming to the bullion-office, at the Bank—I was there—I went to as<lb/>certain if the boxes had been delivered at the Bank—I asked Lewin Cas<lb/>par what had become of our two boxes of gold dust, marked B C 18 and 19"—he said, "They have been delivered to your house"—I said, "How is that, when they are consigned to the Bank of England by the bill of lading?"—he replied that they had received a letter that morning from Messrs Carne's, of Falmouth, saying, that in consequence of an error in the manifest, they were not to be delivered at the Bank of England, but to the agent of the Brazilian Mining Company in London—I asked him if he knew the name of that agent—he said he did not remember—I asked him if the name was March—he said, "That, I think, is the name"—I afterwards went to the office, in Crutched-friars, and saw Lewin Caspar there—(before that I had been to our office, and ascertained that the boxes had not arrived)—I said, "These boxes have not been de<lb/>livered at our house, what has become of them?"—he said, "If you will walk into the office I will show you what has been done with them"—I went in, and he produced two letters purporting to be from Messrs. Came—these are them (Nos. 3 and 4)—No. 4 had the address torn off, and the other was addressed to Mr. Hartley—I called his attention to the one with the ad<lb/>dress torn off, and said, "What has become of the back of this letter?"—he hesitated some little time, and then replied, "I don't know whether it was torn off when I got the letter, or whether it has been torn off since"—he did not say who it had been addressed to in any part of the conversation, that I recollect—he called my attention to the signatures of the letters, and asked me if I did not think they were the signatures of Messrs. Came—I said they appeared somewhat similar, and asked him if he knew the handwriting in the body of the letter as coming from Messrs. Came—he said he did perfectly well, having seen it several times—he did not tell me whose writing it was—I said I had never seen it myself—I then looked at the letters more minutely, but made no observation to him about them particularly—I called his attention to the handwriting of the body of both letters, and his observation I understood to apply to both—he gave me</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Brazilian Mining Company—Mr. George Haythorn is one of the proprietors of that company—there are a great many proprietors. On the 20th of March I received advices from Messrs. Came, of Falmouth, of the arrival of two boxes of gold dust, marked "B C 18 and 19"—the letter of advice does not mention the "B C "but the numbers—they were to come by the <hi rend="italic">Sea Gull</hi>—a subse<lb/>quent, advice mentioned the letters "B C" as well as the numbers—it would be known among the shipping people in London that very morning, the 20th of March, that the <hi rend="italic">Sea Gull</hi> had arrived—on the 25th I received further advices from Messrs. Carne, informing me of the transmission of the boxes of gold dust by the <hi rend="italic">City of Limerick</hi>—I never authorised Moss, or any body else, to go to the Dublin Steam Wharf, and make use of my name, to receive them—I did not see this letter (No. 4) before the boxes were gone—the signature to this letter bears a similarity to Mr. Carne's—the hand<lb/>writing of the body does not appear to me to be the same, and it strikes me as a very informal, unmercantile sort of letter, which it is very unlikely any merchant should sign—there is nothing else which strikes me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at No.</hi> 3)—I do not think the whole of this is one hand<lb/>writing, and it is a letter very unlikely to be signed by Messrs. Carne—my name is wrongly spelt, which Messrs. Carne are perfectly acquainted with, as they are con<lb/>stantly in the habit of writing to me, and it designates me as the agent to the Brazilian Mining Company, which is not correct—my name is not correctly spelt in No. 4—my correct designation is Secretary to the Com<lb/>pany.</p>

               <p>"London, 23rd March, 1839.—Messrs. W. and E. C. Carne.—Dear Sirs, A most diabolical robbery has been committed here through the means of forging your signatures to two letters; on the other side I send a copy of them, and I beg that you will use your utmost exertion towards disco<lb/>vering the perpetrator. The impression is that it must have been done by persons who have had access to your office, or knew of all the particulars as early as yourselves. The letters were posted at Falmouth, 23rd, and arrived with this morning's manifest. Shortly after a gentleman called requesting the delivery of two boxes, marked B C 18 and 19; he showed me a letter, purported to be Mr. Marsh, or from him. I had not the slight<lb/>est suspicion, and referred him to the wharf, writing an order for their de<lb/>livery. Unfortunately they were handed to him, and it only remains to use every exertion to obtain a clue. Let me beg and entreat of you to show your usual zeal in this matter. Believe me, dear sirs, I am almost heart-broken. Yours, very truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">L. CASPAR."</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When had you first any communication about Solomon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first communication we had about Solomon was from Messrs. Bult—it was some time at the latter end of April or the beginning of May, I am not sure which—it was before he was examined as a witness—I remember his being examined at the police-office—he was first sum<lb/>moned to the police-office to give an account of the property he had sold to Messrs. Bult—he was examined as a witness and sworn—that was very early in April, I do not remember the day—I believe it was on the 6th, it was on a Saturday I know—I think Solomon's house was searched about a fortnight or three weeks after the examination—it was not searched more than once to my knowledge—I was not there when it was searched at any time—Solomon went about his business after he was first examined—he was taken up, I should say, nearly three weeks after—it was after that that the first negotiation took place about his being admitted as a witness—I never spoke to Solomon in my life—I never spoke to my attorney about his being admitted as a witness—I was not aware that any proposition was made by Solomon—I was not aware that any offer was made of his being made Queen's evidence—I only knew it about three weeks or a month ago, I think about a month ago—I knew it before he was examined the second time as a witness—a few days before—now I recollect it was at the commencement of May, the first three or four, or five or six days of May—I learnt it from Lea the officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it then agreed on with your consent that he should be admitted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave no consent about it, I left the matter to the discretion of the magistrates—I gave no assent or dissent about it—I left it to the magis<lb/>trates and my legal advisers—I heard that he was to deliver up a large portion of the property which he had got possession of—I mean the five bare of gold which he had—they were worth about 2400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., we understood at the time it was near 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe his house had been searched before that by the officers—I do not know that it was arranged that it should be found in any given part of the house, nothing of the kind was said to me—I know nothing at all about it—I did not even know in what part of London it was to be delivered up, nor any thing about it—at the time Lea communicated to me about Solomon being admitted as Queen's evidence, he did not say any thing about his house being searched again—I am sure of that—I do not recollect it—Solomon was taken into custody some time in April, he was examined as a witness the second time—I do not recollect that he was sworn more than once—he was examined more than once or twice—he was first summoned and sworn when the first conversa<lb/>tion took place about Messrs. Bult—he was afterwards in custody and examined as a prisoner, and afterwards he was examined as a witness—to the best of my recollection, that was at the latter end of May, but I am not certain about dates—it was some time after the conversation between myself and Lea—I do not recollect that any one was present when Lea mentioned it to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERGEANT BOMPAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was it Lea mentioned this to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really cannot charge my memory with it, we have been so much together</p>

               <p>from the time of the robbery, that I really do not know where it was—it might probably be at my own office in John-street, or it might be at Mr. De Mole's—it made no impression upon my mind—I expected to get the money which Solomon proposed to give up—I do not recollect where it was Lea told me—I never saw Mr. Abrahams, Solomon's attor<lb/>ney, except at the police-office—I never spoke to him on the subject—my attorney communicated with him—that was after my conversation with Lea—we had several conversations about the gold being given up—not about Solomon's evidence—I authorised Mr. De Mole to communicate with Solomon's solicitor—I did not authorise him to make the best terms he could with Solomon—I authorised him to make no terms whatever—I authorised him to hear what Mr. Abrahams had to say, but to make Do stipulation whatever about any portion of the property—I did not know of the officers going to search a second time—I have not got the gold dust into my possession yet, nor has my attorney—the officer got possession of it about the first week in May—Lea brought it to the police office—that was not almost immediately after the conversation with Lea—there was considerable time before the property was given up—it was the first week in May I saw it at the police-office for the first time—J did not at all personally interfere, I left it to my professional adviser to do what he thought best—I was under their advice.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the course of all these transactions, did you see any thing of Alice Abrahams, the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw her once, for a short time, at the New Inn opposite, the day Moss surrendered himself—I saw her several times afterwards at the police-office—I saw her once or twice at my attorney's office—that was before the surrender of Moss—I never heard her give any information—I do not know what she was there about—she came with Robinson and Moss—she was not examined by Mr. De Mole, Mr. Humphreys, or any one else to my knowledge—she made no communication then, to my knowledge—I knew she had brought Moss to the New Inn—Moss never was at Mr. De Mole's office, it was at the New Inn that she was in company with him—Moss, Robinson, Mrs. Abrahams, Mr. De Mole, myself, and the two officers were there—that was about the middle of April—nothing was then said about the share Solomon had in this transaction—yes, there was, I beg pardon, when Moss gave his statement he stated that the property was sold to Mr. Solomon—Alice Abrahams was not present then—she was up<lb/>stairs—Moss then communicated about the property being sold to Solomon, and the whole transaction of his having taken it away from the wharf, and the whole circumstances connected with the robbery—at that time Solomon was not in custody—he was taken very soon after—Solomon was a con<lb/>siderable time in custody before any proposition came from him to turn Queen's evidence—I do not know How long—I forget dates very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray have you indicted Mr. Moss for this felony—have you not been before the Grand Jury on a second bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not been before the Grand Jury at all—I do not know that I have preferred an indictment against Moss—I did not know there were two indictments—Mrs. Abra<lb/>hams was at liberty when we were at the New Inn, and Moss also—he surrendered himself that day at the New Inn—what then passed implicated Solomon very strongly in the transaction—it was from information which we got from Mrs. Abrahams that we took up Solomon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe Moss made several statements? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did, affecting in each to tell the truth—upon the faith</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170189"/>
               <p>of those statements we were about to make him a witness for the Crown—it was considered then, that having made different statements, he could not be fully depended on—the principal part of the statement he made to us at the New Inn was false.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That was when Mrs. Abrahams was there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not proposed on the part of Mr. Solomons's solicitor, or himself, that he should refund such of the property as he had in his possession, and be admitted for the Crown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—this was stated openly and publicly before the Magistrate in the police-office, and his consent requested before it was done—the two Magistrates, on the re<lb/>presentation of the counsel for the prosecution, gave their full consent to it—at that time Moss was a prisoner, and had not been examined as a wit<lb/>ness—it was stated to the Magistrate that the best test that Mr. Solomon was about to tell the truth, was his delivering up the property, so that they could depend upon what he said—it was also stated by the counsel for the prosecution that it was utterly impossible they could make out any case without making some of the prisoners witnesses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And was it not under a full conviction on all your parts that Moss was not to be depended on, having given such contradictory statements, that Solomon was admitted as a witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but nothing whatever was done until every thing had been stated to the Magistrates, and their consent asked and given, in the presence of the prisoners—the value of the property given up by Solomon is about 2400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am quite satisfied we could not have gone to trial on the evidence of Moss, unless we had strong corroborative testimony—I think it ought to be strong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has Lewin Caspar been a clerk in your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only became connected with the establishment in October, 1837—I found him. in the office then—very large quantities of money have passed through his hands in the course of business, frequently from 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month,—I had the highest opinion of his honesty till this transaction—large quan<lb/>tities of property, as well as money, have passed through his hands, bullion and specie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have not been able to find Allen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have not—I have not been on the look-out for him, nor directed any search for him—I have had no occasion to do so—I do not think it worth while—he absconded without giving me any notice, five or six weeks after the robbery—this transaction had been put in the train of legal investigation long before he absconded—Solomon had been taken up about three weeks before, to the best of my recollection—Allen absconded about a month before Solomon was first summoned to give an account of the property—it was, of course, talked of in the office that Solomon was taken up—on one occasion Lewin, Caspar had specie to the amount of from 130, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 150, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his care—that was on the 15th of December last—it was a consignment from Fal<lb/>mouth—I was in London then, and he went with it to the Bank—Allen was our collecting clerk—he had access to the different offices—we trusted him, or we should not have kept him—I was apprised of this robbery on the 27th, while in Dublin—I came to town on Thursday, and Lewin Caspar was taken up on the following Tuesday—I have no doubt it was publicly talked of in the office before I came, as information was given the very day it happened—I found Lewin Caspar in his situation when I returned from Dublin, and he remained there till he was taken—he went to his own home</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170190"/>
               <p>as usual—he was allowed to spend the Sunday as he liked—he could have gone off if he pleased—Good Friday also intervened—he had that day himself also—he might have absconded if he liked.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether you found Lewin Caspar at his post when you returned from Dublin—did he ever, before or after inquiries had commenced on this subject, suggest or hint to you that there was a person in the world of the name of Moss? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—the same course was pur<lb/>sued with respect to Moss becoming a witness as was pursued with regard to Solomon—it was the proposition of his attorney, adopted by the prose<lb/>cution, and acquiesced in by the Magistrates—it was at the latter end of the examination of one day that Mrs. Abrahams was examined—she was ex<lb/>amined from about ten to fifteen minutes, to the best of my recollectioin and she was then handed over to the care of the officer, upon her begging she might not be put into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the letter-carriers of the General Post Office. Mr. Hartley's office in John-street is in my district—I have my book in which I keep an account of the letters delivered to all those persons who have an account with me—Messrs. Hartley had an account with me—I used to be paid every Saturday—(<hi rend="italic">turning to his book</hi>)—the amount of Messrs. Hartley's postage for the week in which the 25th of March was included, was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the amount on the 25th of March was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. only—only one unpaid letter came by the General Post from Falmouth to Messrs. Hartley, that day—I do not take an account of paid letters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inland messengers of the General Post Office in London—all unpaid letters have a circular stamp placed on them, which is kept at the Post Office—the whole of the bags are di<lb/>vided into eight divisions, called tables, and each division is stamped by a particular letter—there are four stamps for each division—I have them here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the London post-mark, with which this letter (No. 3) ap<lb/>pears to be stamped? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is not the London post-mark—it is a for<lb/>gery—the post-mark to this letter (No. 2) is genuine—this letter (No. 3) could not have come through the General Post Office—the post-mark to this letter (No. 4) is also a forgery—that did not come through the Post Office.</p>

On the 25th of March, he lived at No. 12, New-street, which is by the side of the London Hospital—Mr. Moss generally went out to work of a morning in a kind of long rough working dress—he used to go out between eight and nine o'clock, or about nine o'clock—on the morning of the 25th of March he went out about half-past eight o'clock—he had not his working dress on then, but a better suit of clothes—he returned between one and two o'clock—he usually gave a double knock, but when he returned this day, only one knock came to the door—my mistress opened the door.</p>

I have known Alice Abrahams many years—she came to my house last Easter Wednesday, in the forenoon, and wished to know whether I could make it convenient for a person to come and lodge with me, whether I could accommodate them with a bed and lodging—she did not say who it was—she asked me if I could accommodate a person there, a particular friend of hers—I said, "Is it a male or female?"—she said, "It is a male"—I asked her if every thing was honourable—she said I might depend on it, that it was—I told her if my wife was as agreeable as I was I had no objection—I had no lodger at the time—I asked if it was any person I knew, knowing all her family so many years—she said, "No, it is not"—she said his circumstances were rather embarrassed, and he wished to be there two or three days, until his creditors could meet, and compromise the business—my wife was at that time attending a lady in the village in her accouchement—I told her she might see my wife, it was on her road home, and I would take her down there, and she might speak to her—I went with her to my wife, but what passed between them I do not know—it was at the lady's door—I was not exactly near enough to hear, but my wife came over and said, if the person could make it convenient with me till she returned home, she had no objection—Mrs. Abrahams said, "None of my family know it, and I don't wish them to know it"—she went away, and returned again the same evening, in company with two gentlemen—one was Mr. Moss, and the other a gentleman—I do not know his name—(<hi rend="italic">Moss produced</hi>)—that was one of the persons—he was left behind, and slept at my house that night—Mrs. Abrahams and the</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Lambeth-street office. On the 25th of March the prisoner, Lewin Caspar, came to me at that office, at near three o'clock, to inform me of a robbery which had taken place at Messrs. Hart<lb/>ley's—he showed me these two letters (<hi rend="italic">Nos.</hi> 3 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 4)and described to me the way in which the robbery had been effected—by desire of Mr. Hard<lb/>wick I went with him to the Dublin steam-wharf—he staid with me there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170202"/>
               <p>a short time—he then said he thought he could be of no more assistance to me—I then went with him to the office in John-street—he there pro<lb/>duced four or five letters out of a drawer, and asked me my opinion of the writing—he had them in his hand—he said, "Do you not think the writing is very much like these?"—I said, "No, certainly not"—he then asked me what I thought of the signature of Messrs. Carne, and on compar<lb/>ing it with the other letters, I said they appeared very much alike, certainly—he said it was principally on the faith of that signature that he had given the order to the person who brought the letter in the morning—I asked him the description of the person—he said he was about sixty yean of age he thought, and a little taller than himself, dressed in black, and grey hair and whiskers—he said it was a person that came from Mr. March, but whether it was Mr. March or not he did not know—nothing more passed at that time—I went away shortly after—about eight o'clock that night I was at the Swan with Two Necks, making inquiries about this matter, and the two Caspars came there together in a coach—the mail leaves the Swan with Two Necks a few minutes before eight o'clock, I believe—it was gone when they arrived—I spoke to them, and told them they might perhaps overtake it at the railroad station, and I went with them in a coach, but we arrived too late—that was with a view to Lewin Caspar's going down to Falmouth about this business—he stated to me himself, in his father's presence, that he meant to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to Falmouth to look after it—I think his father was not to have gone with him—his father went all the way to the railroad station—we returned in the same coach when we found we were too late—as we returned the elder Caspar left the coach, to the best of my belief and recollection somewhere about Charging-cross—I cannot say exactly, for I did not notice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it said for what purpose he should leave the coach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Young Caspar said some bills were to be printed on the following morning about this matter, offering a reward of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said Mr. Allen and Mr. De Mole were to have them printed—I said I should like to see Mr. De Mole and Mr. Allen before they were printed, and upon that Lewin Caspar told his father to go to Mr. De Mole about it—it was for that reason he left the coach—Lewin Caspar only went with me to the steam-wharf that day to take inquiries—in the evening he went with me to St. Paul's coffee-house, to inquire if any person had come by the Falmouth mail—I had been there before in the early part of the day—we went to see if a person had come, answering the description Lewin Caspar gave of the man, sixty years of age, with grey hair and whiskers—we heard of a person who appeared to answer the description—Lewin Caspar said he thought the description given by the proprietor of the coffee-house, resembled the person very much—he described the person as having grey hair, and about the height and age—there were one or two waiters, and the landlord—three persons had arrived that morning from Falmouth, and this descrip<lb/>tion was given of one of them—Lewin Caspar said it appeared to corre<lb/>spond—he said nothing to me about that house at that time; but a day or two after he said he thought I could not do better than stick to the per<lb/>sons at that coffee-house—I saw him on two or three occasions after, and he asked How I was getting on—three or four days after, I succeeded in tracing the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> to New-street, and was led to a house in which the wit<lb/>ness Moss was stated to have resided—I think it was No. 1—it was the first house on the left side—I have never been there with Moss—I saw</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Blundell give you any description of the man who took away the boxes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best my recollection he could give very little description of him—I believe he did give some description—I remember he could speak very slightly of him, in fact I asked every one of the clerks—as for as my recollection serves me, Blundell gave a very slight description of the man, but he did give a description that he was dark, tall, and so on—I had seven or eight descriptions from different clerks there—some described him as one sort of man, and some as another sort—I had seven or eight differ<lb/>ent descriptions of him from persons, the greater part of whom were con<lb/>nected with Mr. Hartley's wharf and office—I think Blundell said he thought the man had grey whiskers, but he would not speak distinctly on it—I particularly asked him that—he certainly said he thought the man had grey whiskers—he did not give me that description of the man before Lewin Caspar gave me any description at all—that I swear positively—Lewin Caspar had mentioned about the grey whiskers to roe before I saw Blundell at the office—Blundell's description corresponded with Lewin Caspar's as to the whiskers, but not as to the person—Blundell did not describe the man's age at all—I did not ask him—I do not recollect that any thing passed between us respecting the man's age—I do not recol<lb/>lect what he said about the man's age at all—I will not swear he did not describe him as about sixty years of age—I spoke to half a dozen clerks about it, and I cannot recollect—I spoke very little to Blundell about it at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother as goldsmiths and dealers in bullion, in Cheapside.

Robarts, on account of two bars of gold, which we had bought of him on the 2nd of April—we had bought the gold of Solomon, but his eldest son Selim brought it to us, as he had been in the habit of doing—the weight was 408oz. gross—we have a correspondent named Emerique, of Paris—in purchasing bul<lb/>lion the object of the party is to turn it into money directly—we seldom keep it above a few hours if we can dispose of it—it depends on the state of foreign exchange—we shipped these bars of gold to Emerique, of Paris, I think on the 5th of April—I had in the meantime made a com<lb/>munication to Mr. De Mole, in consequence of what. I had heard of the loss of the gold-dust—I made the communication the same day I received the gold, before I sent it away—when gold is once melted, if it is amalga<lb/>mated with copper or any thing, it will entirely alter the colour, which would prevent it being identified—the alloy will alter the colour—the colour depends on what it is alloyed with—I have two assay papers—(<hi rend="italic">marked</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 13)—they came from Mr. Johnson, the assayer, in the ordinary course of business—it is the custom to take a little piece off to assay gold—I did not pay the balance for the gold on the same day the 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was paid—we had an order not to pay the balance—Edward Clark, our clerk, had paid some money to Solomon on the 2nd of April on account, but not in my presence—there were two payments made on the 2nd of April to Solomon—I do not exactly know whether it was on the 2nd without my books, which my clerk can produce to-morrow—the payments were all made by my clerk—he can prove these things to-morrow—he is not here—this is the cheque for 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">marked No.</hi> 11.)</p>

               <p>stolen plate—I was told then that I ought to have been in the dock, but allow me to explain: a regular dealer I had known for years by the name of Lau<lb/>rence, well known in the trade, came to my shop one morning, and produced some plate—he asked me for that plate 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. peroz.—I offered him for that plate 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—he would not take it, and was going with it to the next neighbour of mine, Mr. Warner, a silversmith in the Strand—I sent for him back again, and offered him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—he would not take that—there being some articles among them which I wanted, (I should not have given that price at any other time, but there being two Or three articles I wanted) I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce for it—some few days after, to the best of my recollection, my young man came home and said he had seen a bill at Messrs. Bult's with a description of this plate, saying it was stolen by a town-traveller of Mr. Lias; that it had been absconded with by a town-traveller of Mr. Lias, the same plate that I had purchased—he discovered that it had been stolen—we sent immediately to Mr. Lau<lb/>rence to give him information of it—he, in his turn, went to Mr. Lias, and gave the information himself who he had bought it of, and sold it to me—we gave the information from our house to Mr. Laurence, and he went and told Mr. Lias—we had no business to inform Mr. Lias—we told the man we bought it of—I gave evidence in the other Court when the case was tried there—I was told by the Judge that I ought to have been placed in the dock, and tried—he told me I was a lucky man not to be placed in the dock—that was in answer to a question I asked—I asked who the plate was to be given to, to the best of my recollection—I did not ask if I was to have it, to the best of my recollection—be did not say I was lucky in not being tried for receiving stolen goods—he said, "You are a lucky man not to be placed in the dock;" but I beg to tell you I was then going to give the explanation to the Judge of our having given information in the first instance of it; and he said, "There is no im<lb/>putation on you, Mr. Solomon"—it was Mr. Sergeant Arabin, I think, tried the case—I do not know that I was complimented by the Counsel—the case was tried at night, and, in the confusion, asking about the plate, that observation did pass in the Court, and it was the general impression in the Court that the Judge mistook me for Mr. Laurence—it was night before the case was finished—I do not mean to swear it was night—I know there were lamps alight—since then Mr. Laurence has paid me back at the rate of 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce, in bills at two, six, and nine months, which bills I have sent, with some others, to Ransom's, the bankers—he gave me the bills with the rate of five per cent, interest.</p>

               <p>brought it me I was very much alarmed—I found I had got into it, and I suspected this was the gold that was lost—the gold I heard of that was stolen—the gold dust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And then you desired her to bring you some more? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She went away to bring more—I did not desire her to bring more—it was when I saw the 110 ounces that I was alarmed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you thought it was the gold dust that was stolen, and after that paid her the money, and agreed that she should bring more? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said she would bring more—she swore an Hebrew oath, that she would never divulge it—I did not swear too—she did not take an oath from me that I would not divulge it—I had no idea of taking an oath to her—we did not take each other by the hand—she seized my hand—she swore, I did not—it was after that, all the rest of the gold came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you then any doubt whatever that you were buying the gold that was stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suspected it was the gold—I suspected it was that gold—I believed it was that gold—I went on receiving it—she brought me the rest—I did not become quiet and easy about it—unfortunately I have not been out of a state of agitation since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you say you were in for it, why did not you give her back the gold before you paid her, if you believed it was stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I had done so—I was unfortunately in it, and felt unhappy all the time—the had previously sworn to me in a very pitiful manner that she would new divulge that I had melted it for her—I do not generally keep a furnace alight in my back-room—I do not recollect whether I lit it on purpose for her—the furnace was burning, and I put the crucible on—the fire was already burning—I paid her 330<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first—I paid her the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the course of the afternoon—I cannot tell exactly the time—I did not pay attention to the time—to the best of my recollection it must have been between three and four o'clock—it was about that time to the best of my belief—I gave her the 330<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the morning—it must have been before twelve o'clock to the best of my belief—I should say it would take about half-an-hour to turn the gold into a bar in my furnace—I had not received all the gold from Mrs. Abrahams before I paid her the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was after I had received the third lot that I paid her, to the best of my recollection—the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not paid on the second occasion, it was after the third melting—I melted two or three times after that—I do not know whether my son Isaac was there all day—he was not in the back shop—he attends to the front-shop—he was not in the back-shop that day to my recollection—I do not recollect, upon my honour—I do not mean to say he did not see what was going on—I do not recollect his coming into the back-shop at the time—I do not remember his coming into the back-shop at all—I will not swear he was not there, but I do not remember his coming in there at all—my son Selim was certainly not there, for he attends to the shop in Coventry-street—he was not in the Strand at all on Easter Tuesday to my know<lb/>ledge, to the best of my recollection he was not—I do not mean to swear it, I say to the best of my recollection—I saw my son Isaac up in the drawing-room that day, when he brought me the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the banker's—to the best of my belief he was present when the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—yes, he was—I recollect it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of course he knew what it was paid for, and all about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I do not know, I am sure—nothing took place in his presence about it—he only told me he had been to the Bank of England and got the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note</p>

               <p>and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note changed, which he had received from Williams, Deacon, and Co.—he told me that in the presence of Mrs. Abrahams—I did not direct him to get the notes changed when he received them—he got them changed at the Bank of England himself—he thought perhaps it might be more convenient to me—he had no other reason for going—if he had thought I was doing wrong, perhaps he would have brought all sovereigns—I told him to go to Cock and Johnson's and get the money, but did not tell him what for or for whom, to my recollection—I did not to my recollection tell him what for—I swear to my recollection I did not—I merely told him to go and get me this money—that is all I remember—I do remember telling him that, but not for whom—to the best of my recollection he was in the front shop at the time I told him to go to Cock and Johnson's with the bar—to the best of my recollection I went into the front shop and gave him the bar to take—I cannot state it in any other way—I gave it to him in the front shop to the best of my belief—I am almost certain I did—I did to the best of my recollection or belief, I can say no 'more—I will swear to nothing but what I am positive downright to—to the best of my firm belief he was in the front-shop when I gave it to him—I cannot give any other answer—there was nobody present that I recollect when I gave it to him—I do not remember seeing any one present—I was so agitated in the busi<lb/>ness that I did not notice whether any body was present or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As I understand you, you did not at all suspect, till you saw the 110oz. but that it was perfectly right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did previously suspect it, before she came I suspected it was all wrong, that there was something wrong about it, when Moses said, "Remember, you do not know me and I do not know you"—I do not remember saying that I did not suspect any thing till I saw the 1100oz. instead of 30oz.—I felt alarmed at its being that, it might have been a further confirmation in my mind, but I had a previous suspicion of it—I suspected that it was the gold that was lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not ascribe your suspicion to its being 110 <hi rend="italic">oz.</hi> instead of 30? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, very likely I did; but I previously-suspected it—I sus<lb/>pected before she brought the gold that it was the gold that was stolen—I suspected it—I can say no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you believe before Mrs. Abrahams brought it, that she was going to bring the gold that was stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suspected it was—I cannot answer in any other way—I suspected it was the gold lost—I was in great alarm when it came—I was alarmed before she came at all—I did not give it a thought before she came the first time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why, you say you suspected it before she came at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I suspected it, but I was under no alarm, because I had done nothing yet—I felt no alarm as I had had nothing to do with it—she went into the back shop with me when she came, pulled out the gold, and we melted it there at once—there was no one in the back shop with me at first—my servant, Dean, came in at the latter end of the melting of it—I melted it myself the first time or two—I put it into the crucible with my own hands—to the best of my recollection, Dean came in at the latter end of the melting—I have no doubt at all of his being there at the time I was melting the first parcel of gold—it was at the latter end of the first parcel, to the best of my belief—he assisted me in melting the first 110oz.—it was at the latter end of the melting, because I had sent him previously into the City—he was there when the 110 oz. were being melted—to the best of my recollection, he came at in the latter end, just as I had nearly finished—I</p>

               <p>had sent him to Cock and Johnson's, and Messrs.

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SERGEANT BOMPAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you put the rest into the crucible, or did he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did it together—my son Isaac was attending in the front shop—I do not know whether he was there all the time or not—all the gold was melted in Mrs. Abrahams's presence—each melting took from half to three quarters of an hour—about half an hour to the best of my recollection—as soon as it was melted she went away to fetch some more at each time—the last parcel was brought, I think, between five and six o'clock, to the best of my recollection, but I did not notice the time—the time it was finished, was between five and six o'clock, the time she went away last—it was early in the afternoon that I sent Isaac out—I do not remember sending any body else out that afternoon—I have no recollection of it—I do not know whether I did or not—it was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon that I paid the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and after the third melting—there were two or three meltings afterwards—Mrs. Abrahams came next morning (Wednesday)—I think it must have been between twelve and one o'clock—I cannot say exactly the time, because I did not pay attention to it, but it was between twelve and one o'clock, or about one o'clock—the bars which I sent to Messrs. Bult were melted on the Wednesday morning—I am certain of that—it was not on the Tuesday—I mean the re-melting—Mrs. Abrahams saw the original melting, but this was the re-melting—the gold was all re-melted on the Wednesday morning, except the bar sent to Cock and Johnson's, and a bar of 70 oz. melted on Tuesday—I sent two bars to Messrs. Bult, which I melted on the Wednesday morning—that is what I put some copper into—that was all I put in, to the best of my recollection—the copper I put in myself and my servant Dean—I was afterwards summoned and went before the Magis<lb/>trate.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had the gold in your house at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave it to my servant Dean to take care of—I gave it him the morning after we melted it, when I received the message from Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he trusted in respect of your property generally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is my son—he did all things I wished him to do—Dean only had the care of this property—before that I locked it in my iron chest myself—I kept my papers and deeds and coin in that iron chest—I put bowls of coin there of a night—there was no other melted gold there, to the best of my recollection—I am a general dealer in gold and silver, a bullion dealer generally—my son Selim had nothing to do with the shop in the Strand at that time—I sent for him on the Wednesday morning—he had</p>

               <p>very little indeed to do with that shop—he might come over occasionally, but very little indeed—he had the entire management of the shop in Coventry-street—my daughter had nothing at all to do with the business—she never interfered in it at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let us understand you rightly, you had two shops at the time of the transaction, one in the Strand and one in Coventry-street—the shop in the Strand is where the fire is ready, and the crucibles prepared? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Where the gold was melted—it is the place of business—the crucible was ready, unfortunately, at that moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was merely accidental that the crucible was ready, it was never so before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never, to my knowledge—I have been twenty-five years in business—Moses came to me in the morning, and said he had gold dust to sell—I said I would not receive more than thirty ounces—I had not dealt with Moses before for gold—I had dealt with him for spirits—I did not ask where he got the gold—I got 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce for the gold—that is standard—it contained silver and sulphur at first—I cannot tell what I got for it, because it was mixed with other gold—the gold contains silver and sulphur.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not the gold dust coming from the Brazils in the highest state of perfection? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not in the highest perfection, it requires a process to make it pure—I do not know whether it is in the purest state when it comes from abroad—it comes in different prices—it varies in price, and cannot be quite pure—alloy is used to it afterwards to make it workable—I had beard there was gold dust lost before Moses came to me—I heard that it had been stolen—I asked no questions of Moses—I was astonished when Mrs. Abrahams came with the 110 ounces instead of thirty, and I was sorry I had got into it—I had melted it and weighed it before J discovered there was 110 ounces—I could tell, without melting it, that there was more than thirty, ounces, because I made the observation that she had brought more than her father intended—I did not say, "Take it away," nor did I say, "Come again with as much as you please."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray did either of your sons see any thing of the transaction of that day, when Mrs. Abrahams was there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My son Isaac saw her come in, to the best of my recollection, in the morning, the first time she came with the gold—he did not go with her into the back shop, he remained in the front shop—I do not recollect whether any body else was in the front shop—when Mr. Moses came in I was attending to two or three persons—I do not know who they were—in a public shop I cannot tell people—none of them are here—I received the summons to attend before the Ma<lb/>gistrate on the Friday night, three days after I bought the gold—I at<lb/>tended, and was examined—what I then swore was false—I was not thinking at the time, and did it to screen myself—I knew it was wrong—I signed my name to it—I did not consider it willful and corrupt perjury—I did not swear to injure any body, but to screen myself—I was not think<lb/>ing at the moment—I am very sorry for it—I feel great remorse and sorrow for it—I am satisfied I swore wrong, but I did not think it was wilful corrupt perjury at the time—I regret it very much—my conscience has told me I ought to regret it—I saw Mrs. Abrahams at the office, while I was at the bar in custody—I am sure I do not know How far I was from her when she was being examined—I should think I was as far as I am from the foreman of the Jury now—but I cannot remember such trifling things—I was as far from her as I am now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath was she not interrogated by the Magistrate in a clear</p>

               <p>voice, and did not she give her evidence in a clear tone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not pay attention to it, I was too agitated—the magistrate did not ask me if I had any questions to put to her to my recollection—I was attended by counsel, and I left it to my counsel—Mr. Plum tree attended as my attor<lb/>ney in the first instance, and Mr. Abrahams next—that was when Mrs. Abrahams was examined, but I do not know what passed—I have been detained in custody ever since till now—I have never been out—neither of my sons or Dean have been to see me while I have been in custody—I did not know where they were—I did not know whether they were in England—I have no reason to believe or suppose that they went out of the way and went abroad—I did not write to them and desire them to come back and be witnesses with me at the police-office—I left it in the hands of my soli<lb/>citor—I believe Dean is still living in the service of my family, carrying on my business in Coventry-street—I have not taken any other house to carry on business in—they have, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who are they? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know I am sure—I do not know where the house is—I do not know whether it is in Hanway-yard—I have heard that some one has taken a house for them—I do not recollect the person's name—he does not act for me—I have been in prison ever since, and have had no communication—I do not know who has taken the house or where it is—I have been in prison, and have not troubled my head about it—I do not know that it was my brother-in-law, Mr. Rees, that took it—I have every reason to believe it is not, or I should have heard it—I do not know who is the owner of the house in Hanway-yard—it is not my brother-in-law—he has no houses there—he did live in Hanway-yard before I went to prison—he lived there in a house of his own—my wife and family have not taken his house—they have taken a house there, but not his house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray How long was it after Alice Abrahams was examined that the remorse struck you, and your conscience began to work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Directly after I had bought the first gold—I would have made reparation and told the truth if I could have got out of it then—I did not like to expose myself that I was in it—it was about a week or ten days after Mrs. Abrahams was examined that I made the disclosure—it might have been a fortnight—my conscience had begun to work before that—I only sent one statement—I was examined privately before the Magistrate once, and then. Mr. Hardwick told me I must consider that statement was a vo<lb/>luntary statement, and that was the way I gave it—it was drawn up in writing by my solicitor, and my signature was attached to it—it was the substance of the truth that I was to swear to—I swore to it afterwards be<lb/>fore the grand jury, not before the Magistrate—I do not remember swearing to it before the Magistrate—I gave it in—they considered it a voluntary statement—I did not swear to that statement before the Magistrate—I was examined by the Magistrate after I gave that statement in—I was ex<lb/>amined afterwards on oath before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that statement of yours put in and sworn to, or did you swear to some other matter which was taken down by the clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was sworn to what I am stating now—I swore to all the questions the counsel put to me, and that was the truth—my solicitor wrote down the statement as I stated it to him—he drew it up from my dictation—he wrote it down, and at the same time told me not to add a word more or less, and to tell nothing but the truth and the whole truth—I cannot say whether that same paper was read before the Magistrate, or whether he copied</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170221"/>
               <p>it before he gave it to the Magistrate, but I know it was read before the Magistrate, and brought to me to sign—I believe a gentleman now on the bench, Mr. Hardwick, and Mr. Clarkson were present in the private room when I made this statement—I do not recollect seeing Lee and Roe there—Mrs. Abrahams was not there—I should think it was nearly a fortnight after that before I was examined as a witness—my sons had been exam<lb/>ined before that, and my servant Dean—I remember him being examined—he is in my service now—he attends at the shop in Coventry-street—he has been a great many years in my service—he is a confidential servant—I left him in care of my whole house—I do not know whether he went out of the way when I was in trouble—I was in prison from the 16th of April, and cannot tell you of any thing that took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, upon the subject of this private examina<lb/>tion, was the clerk to the Magistrate present who read over the paper which you had signed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was purely a voluntary statement made by me to my attorney to be forwarded to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Magistrate give you any caution, or make any observation to you on the subject of your statement before it was read? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my recollection he said it might be used against me, or it might be destroyed—he said if the statement proved untrue I should be put in the bar, and it would be used against me—at that time no promise was made me that I should be a witness—I did not know I was to be received and examined for the Crown till long after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Henry Solomons. My father had a shop in the Strand, and another shop at No. 9, Coventry-street—I assisted him in the business at the shop in the Strand—I was at that shop on Easter Tuesday last—the prisoners, Mrs. Abrahams and Mr. Moses came there—Moses came first—I was in the front shop next the street when he came—my father was there—Moses spoke to him—he merely said he wished to speak to him, and they went to the passage, and went up stairs—they re<lb/>mained up stairs about ten minutes—Moses then left—about three-quarters of an hour after he was gone Mrs. Abrahams came—she went into the back shop—my father was there with her—there are furnaces in the back shop—I do not know whether there was any fire in them at that time, I believe there was—I did not remain at home all the time Mrs. Abrahams was there—my father directed me to go out—in consequence of directions from him I went to Ransom's, his banker—I returned and told ray father what had happened there—I went out again, and took a cheque for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me, drawn by my father on Ransom's—I took the change I got for it to my father—I know Woolf, a tailor in Regent-street—in consequence of my father's directions I went to Woolf, and received a cheque of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him on Ransom's—I had also received three£5 notes and five sovereigns from Woolf—I went to Ransom's with the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque of Woolf's, and received the amount of it—I do not remember what I received from Ransom's in payment of that cheque—I delivered it to my father in the same state I received it—I took a bar of gold to Cock and Johnson's the same day, and they gave me a cheque for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Williams and Labouchere's bank on account of that bar—I presented it for payment, and received a£300 note and a£100 note—this is the£300 note I received (<hi rend="italic">looking at the one marked No.</hi> 15)—I took it to the Bank of England and got for it twenty £10 notes, and twenty£5 notes—I changed the£100 note for a hundred sovereigns—I carried them back to ray father—I found Mrs. Abrahams</p>

               <p>there when I returned—she was in the drawing-room with my father—I gave the notes and sovereigns to my father—I told him I had received them from the Bank of England, that I had got a cheque from Cock and Johnson's on Labouchere's, and the£300 note and£100 note that I got there I had changed at the Bank of England—I remember the day my father was summoned to attend as a witness at Lambeth-street—I had before that taken some French bank notes to Messrs. Bult, and had received some money for them—I do not know the exact amount—it was about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should think—I gave that to John Dean—the French bank notes belonged to the shop in Coventry-street—on the evening that my father received the summons I saw the prisoner Moses at his house in Vinegar-yard—I went there by my father's direction—I said to Moses that I wished to speak to him—he said, "What do you want?"—I said I wished to speak privately to him, and I walked up stairs with him—there was nobody in the room besides ourselves—I showed him the summons, and asked him for the bank notes which he had—I believe he had read the summons when I put that question to him—I said if he would let my father have the bank notes he should have sovereigns as soon as possible—he said, "Don't make yourself a child"—he promised me that he would not part with the bank notes, and I then came away—I was aware of the contents of the summons when I went there—when I showed him the paper I said, "I hope the bank notes are perfectly safe, and if you will let me have them back you shall have sovereigns for them"—I said my father had received a summons, and that he had to appear at Lambeth-street.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You heard a good deal of this affair while concealed in the Hay-market, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear any thing—I only saw Mr. Abrahams one evening—we had money with us to live there—it was my brother's money, not my father's—I never wrote to my father or communi<lb/>cated with him in any way while I was in the Haymarket—my sister was in the Strand at that time.</p>

In£5 notes—I gave Moses sovereigns in return—after I got these notes I went again to Moses' house—he was not at home—I saw Alice Abrahams—I asked her whether I could see her father, she said he was out—we then got into conversation respecting the Caspars, and in the course of conversation I asked her whether the I O U was safe—she said yes it was, she had given it to her sister in a piece of paper, with some other notes, sealed up—I then asked her whether she was sure she was not watched, when she brought the gold dust to our house—she said, "No, I am sure I was not, and I will tell you the reason for why; I have an old sweetheart of the name of Jessop; I asked him to lend me a cupboard, to put some things in, which I intended to send to my sister in the country; and it was there that I put the gold dust," and that she brought it to our house from there—during our conversation the name of Davis was mentioned—she mentioned his name—she said she was in the house when the officers were there to search it, when some jokes passed with them, and she gave them a glass of rum—on Monday, the 15th of April, I re<lb/>ceived a message from John Dean, my father's servant—in consequence of the message I received from him, I went, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, to <hi rend="italic">Money</hi> Moses' house—I found Mrs. Abrahams there, standing before the bar down stairs—she took me up stairs into a room, and told me she must have those bars back—I said, "No, you can't"—she then said that if she had them back she thought she could settle it with the prosecutors—I then asked her whether her father would give up</p>

ADOLPHOS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now when you went to this house in Vinegar-yard, you found Mr. Moses and his daughter, Mrs. Abrahams, there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know whether she was there—I do not recollect having seen her there—she was alone at the house when I had this conversation with her—I did not know her at all before this—she entered into this conversation with me of her own accord, and told me all I have stated—we got into conversation, and that was How it occurred—this was long before I went as a witness to Lambeth-street—I have no recol<lb/>lection when I was first examined at Lambeth-street—I was only ex<lb/>amined there once, and my deposition was taken before the Magistrate in a private room—I was examined publicly and privately—I was not examined publicly twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who examined you privately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went into a private room, and my deposition was read over to me, I suppose by the clerk—there were some gentlemen there—I do not know who they were—I suppose they were the Magistrates—I saw them afterwards sitting as Magistrates—that was the way in which I was examined—a written paper was pro<lb/>duced and read over to me as my statement, and I signed it—I did not swear to it there, it was taken into the office afterwards, and I swore to it there on the same day—I do not know whether it was drawn up by Mr. Abrahams—Mr. Abrahams took my statement as to facts, and that was the statement that was read to me—I signed it at the private ex<lb/>amination, not before—I am sure, to the best of my recollection, that I was not examined a second time at the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, in the first statement you made in the private room, in<lb/>clude every thing you have said to-day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I have no recollection of the date on which I was examined—I have now a recol<lb/>lection that I was examined a second time publicly, respecting my having gone to <hi rend="italic">Money</hi> Moses's on the Monday evening—I had not said any thing about that at the private examination—I had mentioned about my going to his house before, but not about my going on Monday evening the last time—I did not mention before my second examination about Mrs. Abrahams saying she must have the bars, and nothing but the bars—that had taken place before I was examined at all—it was while I was in the Strand, before I had absconded—I did not say any thing about baring seen Mrs. Abrahams on Monday evening, before my second examination—I do not think my second examination was so long as twelve or thirteen days after the first—I do not remember How long it was—it was not the next day—I do not know whether it was within a week—I have no re<lb/>collection at all—whether one or two Sabbaths passed in the mean time I do not know—I might have seen Mr. Abrahams two or three times in the mean time—I did not see him every day—I was not doing any thing while living in the Haymarket—I lived there about three weeks—I took money of my own there with me—I am in my father's employment—my brother and Dean had money likewise—I had to pay various expenses—I never inquired what they had—I paid my share—I have no recollection that I paid all—it was all paid—I did not pay it—it was sent to the parties—I do not know who paid it—I did not pay any—I did not pay my share—I</p>

               <p>do not know whether Mr. Abrahams the attorney paid it—he came to us while we were there—I do not know that he read over our depositions to us—the first time he came he took our statements—he gave us copies of our statements afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever write to your father, or see him in the whole of this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wrote to him once—I do not recollect the time—it was before he was examined—it was before my statement was taken, or any thing occurred—I do not know whether my brother, or Dean, wrote to him—I never went to see him, or wrote to him by Mr. Abrahams, nor did any of us to my knowledge—I am now living in Coventry-street with my brother—I believe my brother, John Dean, and Mr. Abrahams, were pre<lb/>sent when my statement was taken—whether he examined me for the purpose of getting my father admitted as a witness I do not know—he told me he had hopes of my father being admitted as a witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, before you went into the Magistrate's pri<lb/>vate room, had you stated to your attorney, or your father's attorney, all that you knew? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All except my going to Moses the last day, on Mon<lb/>day evening, when Mrs. Abrahams spoke to me about the bars—he took down from my mouth what I had to say—he told me to state all that I knew, for he had hopes that my father would be admitted as a witness, if all he had told was fully corroborated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At that time, had you seen or heard the statement that your father had either made or was to make? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I never had any commu<lb/>nication directly or indirectly with my father on the subject—I detailed to Mr. Abrahams all the facts and circumstances that I then recollected—I did not at that time recollect the fact of my going on the last Monday to Moses's house—Mr. Abrahams read over the statement to me which he had taken down, before he took it away—when I went before the Magi<lb/>strate I was not accompanied by my attorney—Mr. Abrahams was in the Magistrate's room with me—I am not sure that I saw him hand my state<lb/>ment to the Magistrate—I suppose it was the clerk read the statement to me—when I was examined publicly in the office it was by questions put to me by you—my examination was taken down by the clerk at the desk—after I had finished my examination, it was read over to me by the clerk, and I signed it.</p>

                  </hi>. Easter Tuesday last I was in the service of Henry Solo<lb/>mons, of the Strand. I remember going on that day for ray master to Messrs. Cock and Johnson's—I returned about one o'clock, as nearly as I can recollect—when I returned, my master was in the workshop—the prisoner Mrs. Abrahams was with him—there were two furnaces alight, and a crucible in each—I saw Mrs. Abrahams give him some lumps of gold—he put them into a crucible—when it was melted, Mrs. Abrahams went out into the front shop—I did not observe any thing done between her and my master in the front shop, if any thing was done—I do not know How long she staid in the front shop before she left—she came back in about half or three-quarters of an hour, and brought more gold, which was melted in the same way as the other—Mrs. Abrahams was present in the workshop at the time of its being melted—after it was melted she went into the front shop, and went away again—she came, in the course of that day, four or</p>

               <p>five times, I am not certain—after the larger pieces were melted, she produced some smaller ones from a bag or pocket which she had fast<lb/>ened round her waist—she said that was for herself—I melted that—after it was melted I gave it to her, and she took it into the front shop—my mas<lb/>ter was there with her—she gave me half-a-sovereign—after she was gone we remelted some of the gold with about seventy ounces of silver that night, and made it into a bar—it was put into an iron chest—previous to this, one bar had been melted, alloyed with some silver-gilt lace—I think I should know the bar into which the seventy ounces of silver was put, if I was to see it—(<hi rend="italic">one produced</hi>)—yes, this is the bar, but it has been marked and cut since I gave it to Mr. Lea—before this bar was melted with the seventy ounces of silver it weighed about 270 ounces—the bar which was remelted with the silver-gilt lace was sent to Messrs. Cock and Johnson by my master's directions—Isaac Solomon took it—next morning, Wednesday, we melted six more bars—I mean Mr. Solomon and myself—some large pieces of Russian copper coin were put into them, which would alter the colour of the gold—Selim Solomon was afterwards sent with two of them to Bult's, in Cheapside—the other four were put into an iron chest, the same as the bar of silver was put into—that would make live bars—in consequence of something which passed between me and my roaster, I took charge of that gold—it was taken from the iron chest, and I put it into a chest belonging to myself—I placed the chest in the top room of the house, and left it there—I went away about a week or ten days af<lb/>ter—when I went away, as far as I know, I left it in that place—I re<lb/>member, after the two bars were sent to Cock and Johnson, Mr. Clark came to my master—he is a clerk to Messrs. Bult—on the Friday following Mr. Solomon sent me to Cock and Johnson's with a message—I delivered the message, and received an answer—I went to Messrs. Bult two days after the bar was sent there, if I recollect right; no, I believe it was on the next day, Thursday, I was sent there with a message by my master.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, upon that day did you see Mrs. Abrahams? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a mistake in the depositions, and I wish to have it corrected—I will tell you what I said before the Magistrate—that upon the day on which Selim went to Messrs. Bult, upon his return I saw Mrs. Abrahams in the shop—when I was summoned before the Magistrate, the deposition was read over to me—I mentioned to Mr. Gunter that it was not when I returned from Messrs. Bult's, but when Selim returned from Bult's, that I saw Mrs. Abrahams—Selim is the person who took the two bars—that was the occasion on which I saw her—it was in my master's shop on Easter Wed<lb/>nesday—she asked for Mr. Solomon—I told her she would find him up stairs—she went up—I remember the Saturday on which my master went to the police office—a summons had been left for him on that Saturday—I received a £100 note from Selim Solomon on that Saturday—I received no directions what to do with it, only to get it changed—when he gave it to me he told me what to do with it—in consequence of those directions I went to Messrs. Ransom's to get sovereigns for it—I sent it by George Wood, one of my master's servants—Wood brought me back one hundred sovereigns for it—I put them into a bag, and gave them to Selim Solo<lb/>mon with another 100 the same evening—in the course of the next week I changed several other notes for gold by Mr. Solomon's direction—I know the person of the prisoner Moses—I saw him at my master's shop on</p>

               <p>Easter Tuesday—it was in the forenoon, about 11 o'clock—that was before I went to Cock and Johnson's—I was in the workshop when I saw him—on Sunday, the 14th of April, I saw Mrs. Abrahams in master's shop in the Strand between 11 and 12 o'clock at night—she asked to see Mr. Solomon—I told her that he and all the family were gone to bed, but if she wished to see him particularly I would call him up—she said, "No"—I asked her if any thing was the matter—she said, "No"—she then told me to tell young So<lb/>lomon to be at her house between seven and eight o'clock next morning—I delivered that message accordingly to Selim Solomon—I saw him go out next morning (Monday) between seven and eight o'clock—I know these two assay papers—(<hi rend="italic">Nos.</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 13 <hi rend="italic">produced by Mr. Bult</hi>)—the top writing on them is mine—the other is Mr. Johnson's, of Maiden-lane, the assayer—he is a different person to Messrs. Cock and Johnson—(<hi rend="italic">read,</hi> "H.S., No. 2, 2nd April, 1839, double gold assay"—that is my writing as far as that—this "W 4 1 5/8" means "worse 4 carats 15/8"—that is Mr. Johnson's writing—that means less standard, or worse than standard 4 carats 1 gr. 5/8—this "No. 1 H.S., 3rd April, 1839, double gold," on the other assay paper is my writing—the "W 4 2-1/8" means worse 4 ounces 2 grains, and 1/8—they have each Mr. Johnson's signature to them—On Monday, the 8th of April, I remember obtaining some sovereigns from Messrs. Bult's—there were from one hundred to one hundred and twenty, as near as I can recol<lb/>lect—I got some from Messrs. Ransom's on the same day—I do not recol<lb/>lect getting any more at any other place that day—during that week I got some from the shop in Coventry-street—I do not recollect How much gold I got from Ransom's—I got it from various cheques—I do not recollect what I got from Coventry-street—it was by Mr. Solomon's directions that I got this gold—I changed notes with the trades people in that week—with three or four people—I remember taking a £100 note to Ransom's during the week beginning Monday, the 8th—I took one there to get change, and one to pay in to Mr. Solcmon's account—one was changed for notes and sovereigns.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not know whether you are able to speak positively to the bars or not, but are these other four bars such as you took from your roaster's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I will not undertake to swear to them, as they have been out of my possession—they varied in size as these do, but I made no mark on them—I believe them to be the same.</p>

Bult's, and Cock and Johnson's—I do not know to what amount we sent them—it was not 8 or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I should think about half that.</p>

               <p>Certainly—the business we do with Bult's is notes and coin and a few bars—it was quite an extraordinary thing to send two or three bars to this extent at one time to Bult's—when I returned from Messrs. Bult's, on 2nd of April, Mrs. Abrahams was in the workshop—Mr. Solomon put the gold in in my presence—not in both the crucibles, only in one—I saw that it was gold dust—I had heard of the loss—I did not suspect what it was at first—I did not suspect till after it was all brought, when I saw the quantity—I did not know what weight there was—I could see it was large bars—I could tell there was more than thirty ounces when I saw it con<lb/>tinually coming—when I saw there was such a quantity I suspected it was the gold that was lost, when I saw it come so many times and there was such a large bulk—I had no suspicion when I saw Mrs. Abrahams with the one hundred and ten ounces—I thought it was the ordinary course of bu<lb/>siness—I had never seen Mrs. Abrahams before—I staid in the workshop all the day from time to time when she came—I saw her come from time to time—I went out of the workshop after it was all done—it might be about six or half-past six o'clock—Mr. Solomon was with me all the after<lb/>noon—he was in and out of the workshop all the afternoon—he was not in the workshop all the afternoon—I do not recollect seeing Isaac in the work<lb/>shop—I saw him in the front shop—he generally attended in the front shop, but he went into the city, and Mr. Solomon was obliged to attend when he was in the city.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How often was Mr. Solomon in the workshop with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every time Mrs. Abrahams came Mr. Solomon came into the work<lb/>shop and put the gold into the crucible—he did not always do that—he did that afternoon—I never melted any thing of the kind before—I never melted gold dust—I never melt any thing but for respectable dealers whom I know—when I saw Moses in the shop, he was standing with his back against the wainscot, looking across the counter—I was at the furnace at the time—there was a crucible in the fire, but I was not looking in the furnace—I was looking towards the door—it was my business to attend to the furnace at that time—I had seen him once before—he was not known to Mr. Solomon—he came there with a bottle of spirits once—Mr. Solomon did not deal with him that I know of—I do not think I saw him in the shop more than half a minute or a minute at the outside—I do not mean when he came with the spirits, but when he came on the Tuesday—there were two doors between me and where he was standing—there is a door to the workshop, and between the workshop and passage there is a little parlour—there is a door to that pars lour—there were three doors between us, but neither of them were shut—there were two doors, and one besides—if I had told you there was only one and there were two, I should have said false—I did not remember at the moment—we leave all the doors open—that was the usual course, except when the chimneys smoked, and then we closed them—I should think it is nearly 90 feet from the further end of the workshop to the door in the Strand—you can see the door in the Strand from the furnace—I swear that—a person in the Strand could not see what was going on at the furnace, for the furnace is not so high as we are, but they could see the furnace alight—the shop-door leading from the street is generally kept shut—the back parlour is not used for any thing particular—any lumber is put in it—there is a counter there, on which we brush clothes or so sometimes—I never knew Mr. Solomon take a person in there for private conversation—I do not recollect that there is any fire in the workshop, except the furnaces</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170236"/>
               <p>—there is no place for a fire in the workshop, except the furnaces—the chim<lb/>neys smoke when we are burning sweep—I should think the parlour is about fifteen feet wide, but I never measured it and cannot say—I should not think the passage is quite so wide as the parlour—I do not know whether the shop is about nineteen feet wide—I cannot say whether it is wider than the parlour—it might be a foot or so longer—the shop I should say is a little longer than the parlour—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the plan</hi>)—this is not correct—the furnace ought to be on this side—the furnace is opposite the door—when you enter the room the furnace is right before you—it is at the furthest end of the workshop opposite the door—there are four furnaces—they are against the wall at the end—they are built against the wall on the left hand—they join the wall on the left hand—they are not straight against the wall—they do touch the wall in one way—the side of them are against the wall, but the back is against the wall in front of you—they do not touch the wall on the right hand—there is no furnace near the door on the left hand—the furnaces come out about two or three feet from the wall—when you first enter the shop, there is a door between the shop and passage, then another door to the parlour, and then another door into the work<lb/>shop—I dare say the whole of the premises, from the street door to the end of the furnaces, is between eighty and ninety feet—I was in the workshop when I saw Moses—it was my business to attend to the crucibles, but I was not looking at them at the time—if I had been attending to them, my back would have been to the front shop—I think there were some other people in the front shop at the time, but I did not see any one distinctly—I could not see all over the shop—had Mr. Moses stood against the counter, I could not have seen him, but he stood against the wall and looked over the counter—I believe there was somebody else in the shop, but I would not undertake to swear it—I cannot swear I did see any body distinctly—I cannot say positively that I saw any body else—I do not recollect seeing any body there—I cannot swear there was any body there—I have no recollection of seeing any body else there besides Mr. Moses—I have no recollection whether I saw any one else there or not.</p>

Mr. Clarkson examined me at the police-office—I am not certain that he was in the private room—I am not aware that any copies were made of my statement—how many Mr. Abrahams may have made I do not know—when I came before the Magistrate in the public room, I was asked questions about this transaction—they were to exactly the same matters as I had stated in the private room, and which were con<lb/>tained in that paper—it had been read over in the private room.</p>

               <p>I do not know what shop it is to be—it is not open yet—there is no conve<lb/>nience for a furnace—the lumps of gold were found in a box of mine—I had not looked into the box from the time I put them there till I went to the box with Lea and Mr. Abrahams—I put them there the day they were re-melted—that was on the 3rd of April, when they were re-melted and alloyed—I never put any valuable property in that loft before myself, nor ever knew of any being put there—Roe came to search the house when Mr. Solomon was taken into custody—that was about a week or ten days afterwards—I knew what he came to search for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you, being an honest young man and a Christian not to conduct them up stairs, and say, "Here is what you are searching for?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I did not think proper—I certainly do not think it would have been honest to do so—it was given into my custody, and I did not think I had a right to give it to the officers—I saw the gold dust come to the house, and I had suspicions—I saw it melted and alloyed so as to disguise it—I then took it away, and concealed it in a box in the loft—there were stairs leading to that loft—I saw the officers come to search for that gold, but told them nothing about it—afterwards, when I was requested, I told Lea where it was, and conducted him to it—I gave it up at Mr. Solomon's re<lb/>quest—Roe was not there at that time—the box was precisely in the same situation as where I had left it—the door of the loft was not locked or se<lb/>cured in anyway.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you searched the books in the Accountant General's Office, in which these notes would be entered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw the file of notes, and there I saw the notes filed which had been received by me on the 14th of May, and this one was amongst them—I searched the file on the day the person called, about a week after the 14th of May, and upon that search I found this note amongst the seventeen notes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you never put the tick on any but Robarts's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I had the west-end walk, and received a number of notes from Coutts's, perhaps I should put the tick on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any tick in this book on Robarts's notes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, there is no tick here—here is a tick on Dorien's notes on the 15th—this tick runs through the book to other bankers who pay a large amount—here is no tick to Robarts' on the 14th of May—that must have been an error of mine—business perhaps was heavy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you searched the file, can you tell How many £5 notes were on it, might there have been twenty or one hundred notes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh. yes, more than that—they run in rotation, according to the ledger.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any thing in the method by which they are filed, which would enable you to go to the file and put your hand on the notes taken on a particular day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not me, sir—the accountant shows it—it is his property—he keeps the file—there is no division of days on the file.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were told the note was stopped about a week afterwards, and you went to the file and found that note with several others, did you find seventeen notes marked in the way this is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and this was one of them.</p>

I have been so about seventeen years—the examina<lb/>tion of the prisoners and the witnesses in this case, was conducted before me—I am the committing Magistrate—I remember some papers being pre<lb/>sented to me, which I took into my private room—I had had no communi<lb/>cation with the parties to whom the statement alluded before they were put into my hands—they were put in publicly in the office in the presence of the counsel and attorney—I took these statements into my private room at the request of the counsel, which was made publicly—it was publicly stated to be for the purpose of enabling me to ascertain whether, in my discretion, I should receive the testimony of Solomon as a witness for the Crown—the prisoners were present, and the counsels and attorneys on all sides, and the office full of people—I desired the clerk to accompany me to the pri<lb/>vate room—the attorney of Solomon was present in my private room—the statements were in the hands of the clerk, and I believe were read by the clerk in the presence of the young Solomon and Solomon's attorney—each of the persons who had made statements were brought into the room to me by themselves, and each of the statements were read to me without the interference of any body—the statements were read to each separately, and the others were not in the room at the time—after that had been done, and I had come to my conclusion as to the course to be taken, the persons left the private room, and were taken into the office, and there a <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi> examination by counsel took place publicly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that these papers were delivered to you publicly in the public office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know whether any of the prisoners or their counsel or solicitors had the means of ascertaining one word of their contents—all that passed was, the coun<lb/>sel requested the Magistrates would take certain papers into their hands and retire into their room, and there read them—none of the counsel of any of the prisoners had any means of knowing one syllable that they contained—the counsel and attorneys for the prosecution retired with me—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170255"/>
               <p>the counsel and solicitors for the prisoners were not allowed to be there—Mr. Abrahams, the attorney for Mr. Solomon, was allowed to be in the room—I cannot say How many persona came into the room to make statements—there was Solomon and I think two of his sons—I do not recollect whether there was any more—I do not recollect whether Mr. Dean was one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were these statements signed by the parties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—after they had been read over to them, and every question strictly forbidden, and they had been distinctly told that the Magistrates would only receive it as voluntary confession, which might be used against them—when the papers were read by the clerk to us, the persons making the statements were asked, if such statements were true—the papers were each signed by the parties making the statements—I cannot say into whose hands they im<lb/>mediately passed, but I suppose into the hands of the counsel, as notes to examine the witnesses afterwards in open court—I received the papers from the hands of the counsel for the prosecution, before I went into the room, and returned them to their hands—this private examination might have lasted an hour and a half—I believe the counsel and attorneys for the prosecution had private audiences with me several times, not every morn<lb/>ing—we were asked for a private audience and gave it, and should have given you the same if you had asked—Alice Abrahams was examined be<lb/>fore me before this—I cannot say if she was examined on her oath, but she was examined and made a statement as a witness—I have never been desi<lb/>rous of any testimony, but when I found there was evidence to implicate her—there was none excepting her own statement—the prisoners were to be kept separate in Cold Bath Fields—there were various directions from time to time—myself and my brother Magistrate were there when these statements were read over—I am not sure whether Lea or Roe Were there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you there when Lewin Caspar came to give information of this robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think it was about twelve o'clock in the day—Lea, the officer, came and asked me whether I Would give a gentleman in waiting a private audience—I found that person to be Lewin Caspar—when I saw him at the bar, I recognized him to be the person I had seen in the private room—he said he had been to the Mansion-house, and they had referred him to our office, for the purpose of detecting the thieves—in consequence of his application, I directed the officers to give the necessary assistance—in the interview young Caspar appeared agitated, and expressed great anxiety about the matter, and he put some papers into my hand, stating on these he had given an order for the delivery of some chests of gold dust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have told us some orders were given that the prisoners should be kept separate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I believe they were kept separate, so that they should have no communication with each other, ex<lb/>cept when they came to the office—I should not have read these papers in my private room, if I had not thought it detrimental to justice to read them publicly.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170256"/>
               <p>found there—I will not positively swear that there were no boxes there, but to the best of my recollection there was none—there was a good deal of lumber there—I did not pull it about, but I looked, and did not find any thing there that I was looking for—the room was small—it was per<lb/>fectly light.</p>

I observed the prisoner there for about a quarter of an hour, and watched him—he went behind a gentleman, lifted the tail of his coat, and took this handkerchief from it—I immediately went to the gentleman, and asked if he had lost his handkerchief—he felt, and said he had—I said, "This boy has got it; come with me, and I will take it from him"—the prisoner crept under a show—I fetched him out, took the handkerchief from him, and the gentleman claimed it—he would not come to the station-house, as he said the had so much trouble in a case before—I do not know his name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the 22nd company of the Royal Marines. On the 6th of June last year, I went to Eltham to see my father and mother—I came, in my way home, down Wellhall-lane, about twenty minutes or half-past ten o'clock—I was alone—I met Evans, a postman, as soon as I got outside my father's house, but met nobody else till I got into the lane—I met there two soldiers—the prisoner is one—I do not know who the other was—they had round red jackets on, black trowsers, and side belts, which is the regimental dress—I pointed out to the constable the place where I met them in the lane—they were coming from Woolwich towards Eltham—I was going towards Woolwich—I said, "Holloa Perceval, where are you going this time of night?"—he said, "I am going to Footscray, will you come?"—I said, "I have no pass for Footscray, I am going to barracks," and I wished him good night—the other man said nothing—I have known Perceval three or four months—he is not in the same company as me, but in the same barracks, and I have mounted guard with him.</p>

               <p>which we call Oxford grey cloth, almost as dark as black, and a round scarlet jacket, and with that jacket they would have a dark blue forage cap—they would be compelled to leave the barracks in that dress—they could not go out of the gate without it—a man may put on his full dress coat and cap, but cannot alter his trowsers—if he has on the fatigue jacket he must have on the forage cap—Norton has been between eighteen months or two years I believe in the regiment—he is in the same company now—his being out of England was in the performance of his duty—he went out in the <hi rend="italic">Hastings</hi>—he left England the latter end of September.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I knew the deceased—he was Sergeant-major of the second battalion—he was not under me—on Sunday morning, the 26th May, about half-past ten o'clock, I got up from my breakfast table in my own room on the ground-floor, and looked out of window—I saw the Sergeant-major moving along towards the private parade, where his guard was falling-in—I saw the prisoner with his musket to his shoulder levelled towards the deceased—he was about twenty-five yards from me at the time, and about eight or nine yards from the Sergeant-major—before I could think, I heard the explosion of the musket which was pointed at the Sergeant-major, and I saw the Sergeant-major fall fiat on his face on the ground—his back was towards the prisoner and likewise towards me—when I saw him fall, I had not the least doubt in the world be was a dead man—the prisoner stood still and seemed to poise his musket, to hold it to his shoulder to see if he had perpetrated the act—I rushed from my room and cried out, "Seize that man," and before I got up to him he was secured by two non-commissioned officers—be was standing between Sergeants Poison and Patton when I got up—the moment I arrived I put my hand on his arm and said, "What could induce you to commit such an act?"—he said, "I have meant it some time, or I have thought of it some time"—I cannot be certain which—one or the other I am perfectly sure of—I have been in Court while Patton was examined—the account he has given of the manner in which the ball cartridges are given out for convict service, and the duty of returning them, is perfectly correct—when a man mounts duty during divine service, it is not his duty to have his musket charged at all—he should have nothing in it—there is a difference between ball cartridges and blank car<lb/>tridges—ball cartridges are made up in whitey-brown paper, and blank car<lb/>tridges in blue paper—it was not his duty to have any cartridge in his musket, but ten in his pouch, made up in packets of five—there is never any convict guard on Sunday—the prisoner never was on convict guard—he was once, as I have heard, warned for it, but was never on it—Her Ma<lb/>jesty's birth-day was celebrated on the 23rd of May—the men fired the usual <hi rend="italic">fen-de-joie</hi> on that occasion, which is three rounds of blank cartridges—they are delivered out for that express purpose—no more and no less than three to each individual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you examine the body of the unhappy man who fell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As soon as I left the prisoner I went towards the deceased, and made way for him to be carried into one of the barrack-rooms—he was laid on his back, and was stone dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The ten cartridges you speak of are ball cartridges? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—according to the regulations every man carries ten rounds in his pouch at all times—that is all they are to carry except when they go out to <hi rend="italic">feu-de-joie</hi>—they are left at home in case of accident—the ten are for them if called suddenly on any duty—I do not know myself when the prisoner had his ten served out to him—they are put back into his pouch, I know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am orderly to the second detachment of the Royal Artillery. It was my duty to call the men who were to mount guard on the 26th—the prisoner was the first man for guard, and I called him first—he did not come when he was called—I called his name twice—I saw him the next instant—I saw the deceased there—I did not see him do any</p>

               <p>thing—I saw the prisoner present his piece and fire—the Sergeant-major was walking when he fired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the prisoner been at all corrected by the deceased shortly before this day for any improper conduct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was found fault with for being dirty on parade on the 23rd of May, the Queen's birth-day, by the Sergeant-major, and the Adjutant ordered him to have an extra parade as a punish<lb/>ment—it was my duty to see that he had an extra parade, and I told him to attend parade, but he did not come—it was my duty to report his absence to Sergeant-major Shepherd—I did so—the Sergeant-major told me to parade him again, and let him know How he turned out on parade the fol<lb/>lowing morning—some Sergeant-majors confine a man for absence, but I was to try him again—I warned him of a second parade, but he did not come to that—I should have to report that to the Sergeant-major at the parade time the following morning, which was Sunday the 26th—I had not done it—I was just about to do it as the Sergeant-major was walking towards me, when this unfortunate affair occurred—the Sergeant-major was coming towards me at the time he was shot—the prisoner would have an opportunity of seeing that—he had been found fault with several times for slovenliness in dress—I never counted his ball cartridges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The Sergeant-major did not confine him then when he did not appear on extra parade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, be was a very kind man to the men—the prisoner was first for guard on this morning—I did not find him in company with the Sergeant-major, as if wanting to talk together—I called his name twice, and the men told me he was talking to the Ser<lb/>geant—I did not turn round and see him with the Sergeant-major as if wishing to talk together—I saw the Sergeant-major coming away from towards him, but I did not see they had be*n talking together—I did not see them together—I think I said I did before the Coroner, but I corrected that evidence—I was under a mistake then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Recollect now, do you think they seemed as if they wished to talk together, or at least that he wished to talk to the Sergeant-major? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the Sergeant-major appeared coming from towards him, but I heard something—I was too far off—I had not reported his having missed the second parade then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On Saturday the 8th of June, I was called in to attend Ann Dunn, about two o'clock in the afternoon, she complained of a pain in her head—I did not examine her head at that time—I found her tongue was foul, and the state of the bowels confined—I sent her some medicine, and at one o'clock on Sunday morning I was sent for again—I found her in a state of insensibi<lb/>lity, and I applied leeches to the temple—I saw her again about ten o'clock in the morning—she still remained insensible—she died on Thurs<lb/>day, the 13th of June—she was insensible till the Wednesday afternoon—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170283"/>
               <p>she was only sensible at intervals that afternoon, when she was roused—after death I examined the body—on the back of the head there were marks of violence—there was a bruise on the whole of the back of the bead, the back of the ears, and the ears them selves—I removed the integu<lb/>ments, and found the covering of the skull exhibited the same dark ap<lb/>pearances, and there was a partial extravasation of blood—I removed the skull, and there was extravasation of blood at the base of the brain—that was the cause of death—I examined the rest of the body, and there was nothing else to account for death—I judge death arose from the bruise at the back of the head—it was a recent wound—on the Sunday I cut her hair off, and found the head tumified, which proved it was recent—I should judge a blow must have been given within about forty-eight hours of the Sunday morning—I mean the blow which caused death—the effusion of blood on the base of the brain would be caused by such a bruise.</p>

About ten minutes before twelve o'clock I was called—I saw the prosecutrix outside her door, lying on her back, bleeding profusely from the throat—I inquired who did it—the prisoner came running down stairs, and said "I did it, and meant to do it, and to do for myself afterwards"—I took him to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of Anthony Gorman. I know the prisoner Lawrence by sight—I went and cautioned her three or four days to buy nothing of my boy—and the last time I went her husband told me he would not—I went to the prisoner, because she so often bought of boys—I thought my boy had got into bad company, and I told her not to buy of him—I did not take my son with me, but she knew him well—she used to take him in, and give him some meat, and he used to go in and out there—I have cautioned her not to buy of my son, when he was there himself.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you presented this statement to him did he say, "Why, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., you might as well make me your apprentice again, you know I was never absent except I was ill?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could not say so rightfully and with justice, because he was absent a great many days—I will not swear that he did not say so—I showed this paper to his father—I did not refuse to pay his wages on the first Saturday night, on account of this being due to me—I paid him at once—I did not bring the statement forward on the second Saturday night—I never pressed the "thing—there was one paper presented to him, and one to his father, I believe—I have his indentures now; but I told his father he should have them at any time—I did cer<lb/>tainly refuse to deliver up the indentures on the day the prisoner first demanded them, when his time was out—they expired about the 6th of May, and he continued to work till about the 22nd—I know Thomas Skipper, but am not acquainted with him—he is no relation or connexion of mine—he may be a distant relation—I believe I saw his wife yesterday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you employ Skipper to go to the prisoner's premises before you obtained a search warrant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He pointed out the premises to Sadler, a nephew of mine, before I got the warrant—he is not here—I do not know that Skipper has absconded from a charge of felony—I cannot say when I saw Skipper last.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, have you not yourself sold the prisoner tools? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I never took any money for tools from him in my life—I never sold him any tools—I never sold him a lot of tools for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the presence of a man of the name of Speechly—I never sold any to any person living—it was perhaps a month before the prisoner was taken that I saw Skipper—I never took particular notice.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not on Skipper, your nephew, and Clark's information that you took the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My nephew pointed out the place—I took the prisoner from finding the tools—I got the warrant, as I had strong reason to believe he had been robbing me a long time—I discovered the place through my nephew, who is not here to-day, he is very particularly en<lb/>gaged putting up a steam-engine—Skipper did not come to my house to my knowledge after he had been to the prisoner's—I did not see him to my knowledge—I went out—I cannot say whether I saw Skipper or not—I did not employ him to go there—I did not know of his going before he went—I must know it certainly before we got to the place—I was informed he could point out to me where he thought there was something going on wrong—my nephew told me that—I did not send Skipper to the place—I did not go with him—he said he had been employed there by the prisoner—I never saw Skipper there—he told me he knew where the place was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear he did not tell you he had been there and seen some tools? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear it—I said to the prisoner, "George, you know we have for a long time been robbed of a great many tools"—he said, "I know you have, master"—I said, "If you have no objection we will walk to your premises"—he said he had no objection, and we went part of the way—Clark and my foreman were in company—the prisoner said, "I will go with nobody but you"—he walked with me to Union-hall, that was after I got the warrant.</p>

               <p>—we walked together till we came to the office—I said to him, "Wait here"—Clark and Sadler saw that he did wait there—I fetched the officer out and the warrant—he waited, but I suspect the others would not have let him run away—I told them (but not in his hearing) not to let him go—I did not wish to hurt his feelings—I did not wish to lose him, nor did I wish to lose my tools, but I have lost some scores of pounds' worth—when the officer came, the prisoner took us to the place where the tools were—I do not know what has become of Skipper—I know nothing about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it not occur to you that your distant relation might have put some of these tools there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not ask him—I have no reason to know whether he did or not—the prisoner's workshop is not above half a mile from my place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was the last application on your part, when you told the prisoner you thought him bound to make good the time he had lost during his apprenticeship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say whether it was just before he was out of his time, or after—the account is 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was about the 22nd, I think—that was the day I got the warrant—I do not think that I ever heard of any tools of mine supposed to be on the prisoner's premises till about the 22nd—it was the same day—I do not remember that I had heard it before—Clark did not give me any information—the prisoner said it was a hard thing for him to work to make that up, and I said it was a hard thing for me to lose it—I said to his father, "I shall give him up his indentures"—I left it to himself—I gave him a chance of working it out if he chose—he did not choose—I never demanded the money of the father—I had the account made out to show his father the time he had lost, and to see whether it was not right that he should make me some remuneration for it—I thought it good to let him know, and his father also, the time he had lost in my service, not taking into account any holidays or illness, but just working time—Clark made out this account—I certainly knew the prisoner had been absent when he first demanded his indentures—I have been losing tools for three years, but till the 22nd of May, I never took any steps to see whether he had them—I had very great reason to suspect him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you took any step against the prisoner till you were foiled in this application? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not prove it before—he had been suspected a long time—it was about the 22nd of May that I was told I should find tools at his lodging—I did not set up any claim against him till he had asked for his indentures.</p>
