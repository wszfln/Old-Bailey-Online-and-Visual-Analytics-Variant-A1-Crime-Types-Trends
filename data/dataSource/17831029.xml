               <p>On Thursday the 24th of July last, I had been to do the business of the county at the Sessions, at the County Hall at Clerkenwell-green; I am <rs id="t17831029-1-viclabel4" type="occupation">in the commission of the peace for this county</rs>

He answered pretty quick, give me your money, or I will blow your brains out; he took my purse with five guineas in gold in it, the purse was green and red silk; he then said give me your watch; the prisoner at the bar came up on the other side of my chariot, and he spoke rather sharper, give me your watch, he said, and be quick; the prisoner was one of the two men that came up, he was on the right side of my chariot close to my chariot; on the broadside of the glass, he had no disguise at all on his face, neither of the men had any disguise, I had the opportunity of looking at him and his horse, it seemed to me to be a dark bay or chesnut, and I believe it was cropt, I could not tell whether it was a horse or a mare; he took my watch, it was silver gilt, and the seals to it were gold, a gilt metal chain, a key and a hook to hang it to the head of the bed; when they had robbed me and took my watch in that manner, they turned round to go back again towards London; as he came I looked out of my chariot, and I called out to the best of my knowledge, and he said, you, Sir, he spoke in a feigned voice, what do you want; I said if you will leave my watch, where I can come at it in London, I will pay you for it, or give you something for it, or to that effect; he said I will advertise it in the Chronicle.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say that yourself? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that is the man? - I am certain sure the prisoner at the bar is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the watch advertised? - Yes, it was advertised by Sir Sampson Wright, the prisoner was not taken on my account, he was taken on another account, my watch was never found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What time was this? - Eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was it not a dark evening? - No, quite light, the sun shone.</p>
               <p>Was not you considerably intimidated? - To be sure I was.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner before? - If I did it is more then I can say.</p>
               <p>Because your recollection of him seems to be pretty strong? - I think he gave me a good deal of reason to remember him.</p>
               <p>But you was exceedingly frightened? - If I had I could not have asked him for my watch, I was more frightened afterwards.</p>
               <p>You never saw him before did you? - I will not take upon myself to say any thing to that.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>I lived with Mr. Fellows, I was the coachman, I drove him the day he was robbed; as we were coming up Chevy Chace Hill, towards Uxbridge, we met two men, one on the right-hand and one on the left, I did not take any notice of them, I thought they were young gentlemen that went to Uxbridge market, the young man on the left-hand turned back and stopped my master, there were two turned back, but I saw only one; I saw the face of the other that was convicted last sessions, I did not see the face of this prisoner at all, nor of his horse; I cannot say what man it was that did come back, for he desired me to look forwards or he would blow my brains out; it was the man that came forwards that demanded my master's watch, and that bade me look forward.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the other man say any thing? - No, I saw nothing done, I only looked forwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You know nothing of the prisoners then only that your master was robbed? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my Council.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I beg leave to call a man that can prove him on the spot.</p>

               <p>I live at Hillingdon, within a mile of Uxbridge, I took in the horses; there were three men, but I cannot say I could swear to either of them; they came in at the Red Lyon, where I was hostler.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take notice of the man? - Yes, one was shortish one, and two came first and the one came at last; he who came at last went the first away, the other staid about five minutes after; they came towards London, it was about seven o'clock, and they went towards London.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What time was you robbed? - It was rather turned of eight, it struck eight when I was at the Old Hatch: there is one matter that I have omitted, that is the colour apparently of his coat, it appeared to me to be blue.</p>
               <p>Court to Allen. What time was it when they went away? - About seven.</p>
               <p>And they went towards London? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing of their clothes or faces, or any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>What clothes had they on? - One was in dark brown, or something of that sort to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of the colour of their horses? - I cannot swear to the horses again.</p>
               <p>Can you with certainty say what horses either of them rode? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I beg leave to speak, he knows more, he knows the colour of them all three.</p>
               <p>Court. But he does not say so.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. But he is wrong.</p>
               <p>Court to Allen. You are not to take notice of any thing that is suggested to you unless it puts you in mind of speaking the truth, do you recollect the colour of any them, you told me not just this minute? - I would not say a wrong thing if I knew it.</p>
               <p>Court. I would not have you upon any consideration, then do you or do you not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290005"/> recollect the colour of their horses? - I think one was a chesnut mare.</p>
               <p>Recollect? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not know the person who rode it? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>You cannot tell who rode the chesnut mare any more than any of the other horses? - No.</p>

               <p>I live at the Red Lyon at Hillingdon, I know nothing any farther, than the same evening that Justice Fellows was robbed, three young men with the appearance of gentlemen came to my house, and asked me if they could have any tea, I said, yes, they asked me if they could put up their horses, I told them yes; at the back door I met a short man, he asked for a spare room, says he, can I have tea, says I, do you belong to the two gentlemen that came in just now, he said no; I shewed him into a parlour and when they went in to tea, they asked me if a gentleman was not come in, I said, yes, they desired me to go to him, and to give their compliments, and ask him, if he would drink tea with them, he said, no, he chose to drink tea by himself; they behaved like gentlemen, and went away about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you recollect whether the prisoner is one of these men? - No, Sir, I really do not, I cannot swear to the gentleman, I took no particular notice of him.</p>

               <p>I only know that my master was stopped the very same night that Mr. Fellows was, between Southam and the turnpike, near eight o'clock as near as I can guess, or it might be between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Court. Southam is about nine miles from London? - About nine miles and a half, we were robbed near the ten mile stone about forty or fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Court. How many were there that robbed your master? - Two.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of them? - I cannot say I did, I only just saw the glimpse of one of their faces, the man that came up to me on my left-hand was dressed in blue.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of his horse? - I cannot say I did in particular.</p>
               <p>Which way did they go? - Towards London.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any witnesses, Sir? - Whilst I was in custody my Lord, I had several respectable gentlemen offered to come to my character, but having notice too late last night, I could not send to them; my Lord, by perusing the sessions on the trial of a young fellow, that has been already convicted for this same robbery, you will find Mr. Fellows has greatly contradicted himself.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. In what particulars do you say that Mr. Fellows contradicted himself, or swore inconsistently? - I have perused the sessions paper my Lord, and there he swore that the then prisoner at the bar, whose name is

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. There was another man convicted last sessions who was on the left hand of you, and he says that you swore when that man was convicted, that your notice and attention was particularly fixed on that man, and that you could say nothing to the other man, whom you now say is the prisoner, and should not know him again? - No, I did not say I should not know him again; my attention was fixed on Sharman at first, but my attention was fixed on that man the prisoner, when he said give your watch to me.</p>

             being inconsistent with what he has said now; I have read the sessions paper, and though the Prisoner says that the Prosecutor swore that he could not speak to the man that came up on the right hand side and should not know him (which he now says is the Prisoner) yet you have heard the sessions paper read, which does not agree with the Prisoner's account, and Mr. Fellows has been asked, and he says positively he did not say that he could not swear to that man, but that his attention was then particularly fixed on the man that came up first to him; but, says he, when the other man came to take my watch from me, I attended to him; and he does most positively swear now his situation was such, that he can as positively swear to that man as the other; another thing is every material, you see the prosecutor was not called upon then to swear particularly to the other man, he had not seen the other man at that time, he was not taken: therefore it is almost improbable to think that the Court would be asking him as to the other man, nor does it appear that Mr. Fellows has sworn at all inconsistently; that he was robbed, seems to be exceedingly plain, you have heard his evidence, he seems to speak very correctly, though at the same time very positively; and he swears positively to the person of the prisoner; you observe he was robbed between the eight and nine mile stone, taking it from London, he was going to Uxbridge, and he tells you the men met him and they passed him: then you have in confirmation of that the evidence of two people, that three men, though not ascertained, were at Hillington, at seven o'clock, the hostler does not confirm any description of the men or the horses, nor does the woman, but she says two of them came in together, one did not come in then, but they all went out together; as to this third man there is no traces whatever, nor is it material, he was not concerned in the robbery, but it confirms that there were two men, one speaks to a blue coat; the coachman swears his master Mr. Baine was robbed, and the time of the robbery, and the circumstances of the robbery are for you to weigh; he swears however, his master was robbed about forty or fifty yards from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290007"/> ten mile stone from London, that as nigh as he could guess to the time, it was between eight and nine; Mr. Fellows swore they methim, and passed him, and then turned back again, now that there was a robbery committed by two men, corresponds within a few minutes, or within a quarter of an hour to the time that Mr. Fellows was robbed; these are the circumstances for your consideration, Mr. Fellows swore positively to the men: he has had every caution given, and he himself is a magistrate; you are therefore to weigh his testimony from his positive oath, and from these circumstances that confirm it of two men being there at, the time; sorry I am to make the observation that there is not a creature to shew where this prisoner was at the time; I wish I could make any observation in his favor, but the circumstances that are against him are equally my duty to observe to you; you are to say upon your consciences, whether you think him guilty or not, and if you think him so, you will say so, if not you will acquit him.</p>

               <p>What money had you? - I know I had thirteen guineas in a canvas bag with a parting in it, I had the silver in one side and the thirteen guineas in the other; I cannot be positive to the quantity of silver.</p>
               <p>Was this your own money? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How many were there of your party? - Only one, but he was more in liquor than me, and was taken away to bed.</p>
               <p>Do you know this prisoner? - Yes, he is a neighbour of mine.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he was there or not? - No, I never saw the man all the day.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find your purse or your money? - No neither, I was offered seven guineas of the money by Perry, who said he came from the prisoner, and asked me to make it up.</p>

               <p>Was you in this house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time of the day did you come in? - About a quarter after four o'clock, I stopped I believe till six o'clock or after, I went in to have a pint of beer to nourish myself, and in the mean time who should come in but the prisoner, and he would insist on sitting down by the prosecutor who was in the house; when I first came in he was in company with Mr. Perry.</p>
               <p>Was he sober or in liquor when you first came in? - He was between both.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his falling asleep? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did he lay? - He lay with his head on the table sleeping by himself, the prisoner came in and placed himself on the other side of the box opposite to him, and he sat there about the space of a minute, he moved and sat by the prosecutor and began to handle him with his right hand on his left side, and I saw the prisoner put his right hand into the prosecutor's left hand breeches pocket, he drew his hand back and put it behind him under his coat, and drank his beer and walked out of the house immediately.</p>
               <p>Did the man awake before you went out? - Yes, and I saw him searched.</p>
               <p>How came he to be searched? - Mrs. Medley insisted on his being searched before he went out of the house, as I told her of the man having robbed him; he had nothing but a few bad halfpence.</p>
               <p>What did he complain of having lost? - The same as he does now, thirteen guineas and some silver.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Prosecutor. Was not you intoxicated when you came in? - Not so much.</p>
               <p>No, not quite so much: did the last witness at any time give you a reason for not detecting the party he afterwards chose to say had robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did not you immediately pursue him? - I did, I went to three different constables.</p>
               <p>What reason did the last witness give you for not detaining him? - The reason he gave is, he is very guilty of drawing a knife, and they were afraid of that.</p>
               <p>There has been a great deal of misunderstanding between you and the prisoner? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Did you never make use of words to this import, that you would do for him? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Brassnell. Had the prisoner and you any quarrel at any time? - No, never.</p>
               <p>How many people were there in the room? - I suppose there were ten or eleven.</p>
               <p>But you did not think proper to stop him? - I was rather dubious, I immediately acquainted all the remainder in the room of it, and nobody stopped him.</p>
               <p>Did not you say at any time, that if he did it, it was out of fun? - Yes I did think so.</p>
               <p>Jury to Brassnell. When you saw the prisoner with his hand in the man's pocket, did he take out canvas or money? - I saw his hand full.</p>
               <p>What was it full of, canvas or money? - I cannot say, it made no noise.</p>

               <p>Was that such a distance as this man might have gone to his house, and told her of his situation in that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. This prisoner in your hearing endeavoured to wake the prosecutor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290015"/> did not he? - I saw him pulling him about, I supposed he was waking him.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the house-keeper examined him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not see this house-keeper as you call her take any thing from that person? - No, Sir, she did not.</p>
               <p>How many people had you in your house? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was not the purse down on the ground any part of the time? - When he sat down to go to sleep, he sat down in the box, and he slipped down, and I thought he lay in a very uneasy position, and I desired two or three that are here, to go and pick him up, and they did not chuse it, because he had some money about him, and nobody went night him but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. You said that nobody went near him? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you in a situation to be able to see that? - Yes, Sir, suppose this was the bar, and the bench where you sit the box, all on a line strait.</p>
               <p>Then you can speak with confidence that nobody went near him till the prisoner? - Yes, and after the prisoner went out, nobody went near him till the woman came in.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner come into the house at the time that you called to the company to help the man up? - No, this was before.</p>
               <p>Was the box searched? - Yes, very carefully, he could not have dropped his money there, he never turned with his face downwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have witnesses here that were in the tap room at the same time.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. What are you? - I keep carts and horses.</p>

               <p>Had you a fight of them before they got up? - Yes, I saw them upon the man, they appeared to be searching his clothes what I could see of them, I overtook them both; when they found I came up so fast they both turned round and stood, one with a cutlass, and the other with a stick which I thought was a cutlass at first, to make a defence against me; indeed it was a wonder they had not chopped me; then I run back and I came and picked the man up.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you find the man? - With both his hands tied together all over blood almost.</p>
               <p>You untied him then? - I took him home to my master's and we untied him and washed him, and took him to the infirmary.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing of the apprehending the prisoner afterwards? - Yes, my Lord, I took him the next morning within ten yards of the place, he came back to see whether there was any money lost, the next morning I went out early with my barrow into the fields, and when I came into the field this prisoner was coming down to the place where the prosecutor's hat laid all night, and I took hold of him, I had seen the hat before the prisoner came, the prisoner was alone when I saw him come up to the hat, I took him before he came to the hat, and he told me after I took him, that he came to see whether there was any money lost, this was while we were taking him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>What did he say to the charge? - He said at first he was innocent of it, and he afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290018"/> confessed and told us where to find the other man, as well as he could.</p>
               <p>Was any body with you when you took him at first? - No, I took him to my master, he confessed to my master he was concerned in the robbery, and told me he was coming to see if there was any money lost, the other man could not be found though he gave us directions after him.</p>
               <p>Did he say who the other man was? - Yes, he said that he had been with him, he said he had not been in company with him above three or four hours before the action was done, but he knew nothing of him before.</p>
               <p>What directions did he give you to find him? - He gave us directions to the Bladebone near Mile-end turnpike, and there we were to ask the servant maid that lived there whether she had seen any thing of such a man.</p>
               <p>Did he name the man? - No, he said he could not name the man, my master and I went there, but we could get no intelligence of the man, otherwise than they had been there the day before, these two men had left this man at another house, while they were there together two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was the other man in company with this man before that afternoon? - Not that I know off, this man and I came into London of a Thursday morning, and he pretended to be my friend, then we went to the White Swan, and he borrowed a guinea of me to get change to get some meat for breakfast, I was not mighty willing to let him have it, and he went away about nine, and did not return till three or four, and he brought this man with him; the prisoner told me the other man was bred and born in the same place with him, and that they were all the same as brothers.</p>
               <p>When did you first see this man the prisoner, and where? - On Tuesday night at the Coach and Horses on this side Ilford, he joined company with me there, and came to town with me.</p>
               <p>Was the other man there at all? - No, I never saw the other till I came into London</p>
               <p>Then you did not see the other man till the Thursday afternoon? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Strong. Did you find any of the things in the possession of the prisoner? - We put him into my master's stable, we did not think to search his pockets before we put him into the stable; when we took him out again, we found the handkerchief and the pair of stockings, I was not present when my master found them, he is here.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner confessed to your master that he was concerned in the robbery, was there any promise made him? - I was not there, he told me he came to look if there was any money.</p>

               <p>What did the prisoner say for himself? - We secured him in the stable, I asked him how he came to be such a cruel man to behave in such a manner to a man that he had been acquainted with; he first of all denied it, and said he knew nothing of the matter; I told him he was a very remarkable man, that no person could mistake him, I said if you tell me the truth we will beg for you, and recommend you to mercy as far as we can; but if you mean to deceive us, it will be worse for you; I found these things hid in the stable, I supposed he might be shifting something out of his pockets, he went back and made me no answer either way; we delivered him to the watch-house, and I set a man to clean the stable, I had looked but could find. nothing; and while I stood by the man, he put his hand on the rack, and among some straw that was on the rack there, he pulled out these stockings and this handkerchief; these are the things that were found there, I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>

            , you have been convicted by the verdict of a very merciful Jury upon the clearest and most satisfactory evidence, of a crime so attrocious as to demand the most severe and immediate interposition of Justice; our sovereign has publickly declared his determination to afford no mercy to those wretches, whose wickedness leads them to add the crimes of cruelty and violence to that of robbery; and to endanger the lives as well as the properties of his unoffending subjects; every body must applaud the wisdom and humanity of that determination, and I find it peculiarly my duty in the situation in which I am placed, to lend every assistance in my power towards effectuating his Majesty's intentions. The case that has been proved against you appears to be attended with every aggravation; you were not only a partaker in the cruelty and violence that was used by your companion on this occasion, in treating this unfortunate man in a manner that indangered his life, and was likely to bring you to this bar for murder: but by your extreme treachery you seduced this unfortunate man under the expectation of receiving kindness at your hands, into a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290020"/> situation which gave you an opportunity of perpetrating this shocking cruelty which is a farther aggravation of your crime. There is therefore no circumstance of favour to be found in your case, and for the protection of the innocent and for an example to others, it is necessary you should be brought to speedy and exemplary justice; your case comes so full within his Majesty's declaration, that I shall think it necessary to make a report to his Majesty on Monday, or so soon after as he shall receive the same, and you must therefore prepare for a speedy execution, as soon as his Majesty's pleasure is known; at present it is my duty to pronounce upon you the dreadful sentence of the law, which is, that you be carried from hence to the place from whence you came and from thence to the place of execution, there to be <rs id="t17831029-4-punish27" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>This is laid in the first charge of the indictment to be the property of the consignees, and in the second charge to be the property of persons unknown, that was because as this ship was a prize to his Majesty's ships which I have named; it was impossible to state in the indictment the name of every commander and every mariner who had a right to some of the property. Gentlemen, this is one of those instances which we too often have of the property of poor sailors being plundered when they come into this country, by which means they are deprived of part of their prize money. The vessel in question was taken and condemned in the West-Indies, at Barbadoes: In the voyage to England no less a quantity than thirty thousand weight of coffee has been taken out of this vessel, that is known by the invoice and by the King's bill, comparing one with the other there is upwards of thirty thousand weight deficient in the cargo. Gentlemen, these depredations are so often committed, and committed with impunity, that they are now grown to an alarming height; it is an offence that requires examination, and if it is brought home to the prisoners at the bar, it is an offence which ought to be most severely and exemplarily punished.</p>
               <p>The facts to bring this charge home to the prisoners are these; the vessel sailed into England under the care of the Prize-master Mr. Warren, he was the commander of the ship and had the care of the goods; Hodge was the Mate, Harris was the excise officer put on board by government, and Hudson and Waterman employed by these very people in bringing the goods on shore; and when I describe the characters of the three first, the Master, Mate, and Excise Officer, it makes one shudder to think that men intrusted with the property of hundreds, should forfeit the confidence reposed in them. The owners, the consignees in London, when the ship came, thought it right and proper to employ a man of known honesty and integrity to watch over the persons in that ship, upon which a man of the name of Jeffreys was employed by the agents here, and put into the ship by way of spy and guard of the property, to see that no soul transaction was carried on; and it turned out that that caution was necessary, that it was right and proper, for by the event it seems that if he had not been on board, much larger depredations would have taken place, it might and would have been larger if it had not been detected: On Saturday the 6th of September last, as this man of the name of Jeffreys was walking the quarter deck, he observed the Captain and the Mate in close conference in the cabbin, at last

             the commander, knowing very well the situation of Jeffreys, came up to him and said, Jeffreys, I want to ask a favour of you: what is that? why, says he, as commanders we are intitled to some sweepings, you will have no objection to my going down to the hold to take those sweepings, we have had a great deal of trouble in working the ship: Jeffreys said, I can have no objection to any prequisite; the name conveys an idea of very little value; and they went down, but instead of taking sweepings they were employed in taking and cutting the bags of coffee, and they took out of eight new bags six pounds of each; these were taken out of the bags in the vessel and put into new bags which they had for the purpose, the persons who went down were the Commander, Mate, and Excise-officer; Jeffreys was alarmed at this, and convinced at the time and at the moment that this could not be sweepings, but was afraid at that instant to examine, because he was single in the ship, and here were three men who were actually committing this theft; this was in the dead of night, and all the terrors which night carried with it certainly invaded the poor man's mind at that instant. Hudson had brought to the vessel one or two boats, into which this coffee was put from the ship and was carried to shore, what became of it afterwards we cannot tell. On the next day Jeffreys went on shore but Mr. Scott was not at home; on Monday he applied to see the Clerk of the Brokers, he was not at home; he left word that he wished to see them on very material and particular business, and desired that they would come on board the vessel for he had something very particular to tell them; upon which they went on board, and he then discovered to them the whole of the transaction, he then opened that scene of wickedness that these men had been guilty of, in going to the hold, taking out the coffee, and sending it on shore: Jeffreys being then brought on shore for the purpose of bringing these men to Justice, one

             immediately supplied the place of Jeffreys, and when he came on board there was jealousy and suspicion; for people who commit bad deeds are always suspicious, and there was a consultation between themselves, Harris said, we must take care to be all in one story; this was a sufficient clue to Beyer to know that that story meant something more than he was then well acquainted with. Gentlemen, these are the facts which will be produced to you in evidence: It will be in proof to you that this vessel has been robbed to a large amount; it will be in proof to you, that a man of trust, a man of character, who was put on board that ship to protect that property, has withstood temptation, and has done justice to his employers; on his evidence you will hear that the property was sent on board by these men; what defence they can suggest I cannot tell: I hope and wish they had a good one, I wish that every man who has a good cause may make it appear; but if they are guilty it is as soul and as bad a case as can come before a Court of Judicature; if on the other hand it is not made out fully, you will be happy in an opportunity of clearing them; but it is our duty and the duty of the consignees to bring a question of this magnitude before you, for we are bound to protect the property of these seamen who are fighting and risking their lives for our defence. Gentlemen, I leave the case in your hands, if the facts appear as I am instructed, and the prisoners are proved to be guilty, you will say so by your verdict, and if they are not, I am sure your humanity will acquit them.</p>

               <p>Court. If it appears that the witness has an interest in the conviction of the prisoners, that will render him incompetent as I conceive in all cases, but his interest in the property will not affect his testimony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I declare I do not make this objection from any consciousness of the badness of my case, for I am as confident of success in this trial, and of the innocence of the men, as I ever was of any cause in my life.</p>

            ; the vessel laid in September off Stone-stairs, between that and Ratcliffe-cross.</p>
               <p>When did you arrive in the river? - The latter end of August.</p>
               <p>What was she loaden with? - Coffee, cocoa, and cotton, and some kind of wood.</p>
               <p>What quantity from the invoice was there of coffee? - (Looks at the Invoice.) 399931 pound Dutch weight?</p>
               <p>What was in the English weight? - (Looking at the Invoice.)</p>
               <p>"439924 English."</p>
               <p>N. B. These are Dutch weights, and they are ten per cent heavier than the English.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I should think it would be necessary in a criminal case, where Mr. Silvester has opened such a business as he has; to establish the fact clearly by occular proof, had of the cargo as it was on board; it does not appear that the coffee, as it is said to be loaded by the invoice, was, or was not loaded before the ship set sail in the West Indies, or whether part of it was lost; your Lordship knows if an action is brought upon a policy of insurance, they never attempt to account for the loss by the invoice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It can be proved no other way but by the invoice; if any is lost that the Captain can prove by people on board the vessel; it is prima facie evidence of the quantity on board.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The invoice only proves this, that such a quantity was put on board.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It is the best and the only evidence you can have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, Mr. Silvester wants to put it upon the defendants to supply the prosecutor with proof, because there has, says he, been a particular quantity according to the appearance of this invoice, it shall be incumbent upon the defendents to prove that that cargo is not so great; why that is the very point upon which your Lordship will determine this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Runnington another of Prisoners Council. I believe about two years ago an objection<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290025"/> of the same kind was taken, where Mr. Silvester would not support it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. A man does not come with the invoice bill himself?</p>
               <p>Court. No, but the Captain and the officers of the ship are capable of proving it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. There would be a failure of justice if it is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Scott. What is the nature of the invoice that you produce? - It is an invoice I conceive taken from the paper from the bills of lading then found on board.</p>
               <p>Court. It is clearly not evidence, had the ship been loaded under the direction of the Captain, the Captain being the prisoner, I should have been of opinion that as against him the invoice would be evidence, because he is the only person who would controul the invoice, who had the power of inspecting into the cargo; therefore, as against him, I should have thought it would have been good evidence; but the paper Mr. Scott produces is the Dutch invoice of the loading in Holland; therefore, it is no evidence whatever, that this cargo was on board the ship when this man was put on board her as Prize-master: for it was subject to all the consumption of the Dutch crew, therefore the Prize-master is not to be charged as answerable for the invoice in Holland, to which he was not privy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Then there never can be any evidence of the cargo of a Dutch or any other foreign ship?</p>
               <p>Court. Yes there may, because an account may be taken at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. I am clearly of opinion it is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Scott. Then we must not say to what amount? - I cannot say, the goods are not yet delivered.</p>
               <p>Did you employ any person to superintend it? - On that ship beginning to unload, I desired the broker to send a person on board to take an account of the cargo and watch it, he sent

               <p>Court to Mr. Fielding. Do you conceive then that a felony cannot be committed on the property of aliens or even of an enemy? But however, I think the Count laying it, the property of persons unknown, covers that sufficiently.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Mr. Scott. You desired the brokers to send a trusty person on board? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who is that? - Hes name is Jeffreys, he was to watch the cargo and take an account of it as it went into the lighter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. FIELDING.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott, I am sorry to mention that there have been disagreements between you and Mr. Warren, but the fact is so that there have? - We did disagree, we differed in sentiment in point of settling his accounts, but no other.</p>
               <p>You know the officers that appointed Mr. Warren to this charge? - I knew some of them, Captain

               <p>How came it that you should think of the broker's interference, by way of sending a man on board this ship? - It is a custom.</p>
               <p>Therefore you trusted to the broker's knowledge of sending a proper person? - I did.</p>
               <p>You knew the man so sent? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you know the man? - No, I did not even know his name, till my clerk informed me that the person had sent to inform him.</p>
               <p>That is not evidence, did not you think it worth your while to ask the broker this man's name, that he had appointed to this species of trust? - No, I did not.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290026"/>Did you never hear complaints of this very man who has made the information against these four people at the bar? - I heard some.</p>

               <p>Did you never hear he was one of the most drunken fellows that ever was put into the employ? - I heard when I was on board, Mr. Warren and the others say that he was the most drunken fellow.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that before Jefferys had charged them? - I think it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Then you must necessarily suppose there was no great good will; but you never was lucky enough to hear that this man was the very thief that had stolen bags of coffee? - They said he was a drunken fellow, I paid no attention to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Speak of the fact. - I do not recollect that they charged him with theft, but with drunkenness they did, they charged him before the Justice.</p>
               <p>You told me before you knew nothing of him? - I had an opinion of the man, by the people that sent him.</p>
               <p>Did not it ever come to your knowledge that this man, this Jefferys, put false marks on the bags? - I cannot charge my memory with that circumstance.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear that if he had not taken coffee, he had taken sweepings? - I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Willey make complaints to you of this man? - He might, I cannot charge my memory, when I went on board he laid complaint against a waterman that I had sent on board.</p>
               <p>Did not the complaint go the length of charging him with being drunk, and making the marks? - I do not recollect any think about the marks, the man complained very heavily of them, I never took him away.</p>
               <p>Was not he turned on shore? - I do not know, I believe he was, he went on board again.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear it was for making false marks on the bags? - I do not recollect any thing about the false marks.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Did these men ever charge Jefferys with stealing the coffee, till they themselves were accused? - I do not recollect they did till they came before the Justice, then I believe Mr. Warren repeated it several times, that they had prevented him from taking handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Court. What they said before the Justice is no evidence against him, though it would be against them, that is the case with every confession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Then there was no complaints of that nature that made you doubt or enquire into the conduct of Jefferys? - None at all, I looked upon their complaints to arise from a little pique between me and Mr. Warren about his accompts.</p>

               <p>Who did you send? - I sent this Jeffreys, knowing him well to be as worthy respectable character as any I know, and knowing him to be a proper person to take care of the cargo, I have known him five or six and twenty years, in fact he is a distant relation of mine, a man to be trusted in every respect whatever.</p>
               <p>Did he apply to you again, and give you any information about this?</p>

               <p>What happened on the 6th of September? - On the 6th of September the lighter lay alongside the ship, I was on watch the fore part of the night till twelve, and between ten and eleven in the evening Mr. Harris, the Excise officer who had been on shore came on board, he came first before, and just asked me how I did, and then he went into the cabbin, and he walked round the cabbin; there stood a glass of liquor, and he drank and said, he would go on shore again, and lay on shore, and he went, and in about a quarter of an hour afterwards Mr. Warren and he came on board again, Mr. Warren had been on shore before; they went down to the cabbin, and staid there some time; Mr.

             I believe was in the cabbin before, Mr. Hodge is the Mate.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure Hodge was with them? - Yes, after they had been in some time, they sent for me into the cabbin, and Mr. Warren said to me, I have a favor to ask of you; says he, give me leave to go down into the hold to take a bag or two of sweepings, loose coffee that lay about the ship, which I gave consent for him to do, they went down into the hold.</p>
               <p>Court. Who went down? - Mr. Warren, Mr. Hodge, and Mr. Harris, I went along with them.</p>
               <p>Any body else? - I cannot recollect any body else; when they got into the hold, instead of taking the loose coffee, they began to cut the whole bags of coffee, and shake them into new bags; they shook the value of half a hundred weight or upwards into each bag, to the number of eighteen bags; then they sent them on board the boats that lay alongside, to carry them away; Hudson was the waterman who took them away; they went towards London Bridge, and where they went I do not know.</p>
               <p>Where were the other Excise officers? - They were asleep between decks; the other two Excise officers, and one of the Custom-house officers, heard a noise, and they got up, but it was all over then; this was on Saturday night, I came on shore the Sabbath day for a clean shirt, and I enquired for Mr. Ashton, or Mr. Cotton, and they were both in the country, I came on shore on the Monday night, and they were not at home; I then left word for them to send somebody to assist me, for there were underhand doings going forward; I had not been on board long before Mr. Harris and Hudson came to me, and asked me if they might go down again; Mr. Warren was then ill in bed, they blamed me a good deal, and said I was a simpleton, because I would not let them; they said I might as well put two or three guineas in my pocket as not, I told them if they would give me ten or twenty guineas they should not; then on Tuesday morning I wrote a letter to Mr. Ashton, to insist on somebody coming down to assist me, or else I would not stay any longer; on Wednesday Mr. Ashton and Mr. Scott's Clerk, came down, and I told them; they ordered me to come on shore that night, and to meet them, and I told them the whole story, the same as I do now, and Mr. Scott's Clerk took it down, and he wrote to Mr. Scott thereon.</p>
               <p>Who was put in your place? - One Bear I went on board again on Thursday morning, then on Thursday afternoon Mr. Scott sent his Clerk down with this Bear, and I came away I never was on board the ship afterwards.</p>

               <p>That night you was drunk? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Warren and you disagreed? - No.</p>
               <p>Now Jeffreys how many bags of coffee or handkerchiefs of coffee, have you carried out of the ship? - None.</p>

               <p>Did they give you any particular directions as to calling them up, or alarming them if any thing happened? - No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Warren and his companions sent for you and asked a favour of you? ha! - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you went with them? - Yes, I granted it, and went down with them.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday you was up in a room with Mr. Scott? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did it fall to your lot to examine the men, or look over them when they were at work in the hold? - I took account of the bags as they were taken out of the hold to put over into the lighter.</p>
               <p>Then you saw the men that were employed at work on the Saturday in the hold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did they leave the work? - About six.</p>

               <p>On Monday morning I take it for granted they went to work again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The same men that had finished the business<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290029"/> in the hold on Saturday night, renewed their employ on the Monday morning in the hold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then they must have known the condition of the hold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to these men about the business? - No, not at all.</p>

               <p>Do you remember Pearce coming on board that ship that night? - I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Had not you particular instructions from one of the men if any thing happened to call him out of his hammock? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>What became of you after the Thursday? - I was at home and we went before the Justice and took out a warrant against these Gentlemen, on Friday they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Then this business had slept from the Saturday night, all Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and on the Thursday you told this story, and they were taken up on Friday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What has become of you since that time? - I have been down in the country in Northamptonshire.</p>
               <p>What has supported you in the country? - Hard labour, I am a poor labourer.</p>
               <p>Have you had no other support while you was in the country? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>What do you call hard labour? - Going to plough.</p>
               <p>That has been your employ? - Yes, and sowing.</p>
               <p>How long ago is it since Mr. Scott sent for you up to town? - I came up last Thursday was se'nnight by Mr. Scott's desire by a letter from him.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Scott give you no money to go into the country? - No.</p>
               <p>Not a halfpenny? - No, I had no more than my wages.</p>
               <p>Were there any complaints made of you during this fortnight by any of the officers that were known to any of the men? - I do not know that there was.</p>
               <p>Recollect, because there are many sailors here? - There never was any thing mentioned to me, I never quarrelled with any of them, nor they with me.</p>
               <p>You were the man that went into the cabbin with Mr. Warren, and he asked a favour of you in this manner that you have mentioned? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Runnington. Have you been accustomed to be put on board vessels of this sort? - No, I never was on board one before: Yes, I was sent on board the America by Captain Wallis.</p>
               <p>Was not you turned away from that American prize? - No other way than this, I staid while Mr. Wallis wrote an answer and sent back, I suppose I was not there half an hour: He ordered me a little grog.</p>
               <p>That was the first vessel and this was the second: Who had the keys of the hold? - Mr. Warren, when he was on board, had them in his care.</p>
               <p>What was the name of the Custom-house Officer? - I cannot recollect his name.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the name of Mr. Pearce? - Yes, that was his name.</p>
               <p>Was that the Custom-house Officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he the gentleman to whom you communicated this intelligence on the Saturday night; I told him the whole transaction.</p>
               <p>What is the name of the other Excise Officer? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Did not Hudson immediately surrender himself? - I was not there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290030"/>When you was before the magistrate did not you give an information of this sort, that all the while you was upon the deck; that you was not in the hold of the ship but upon the deck of the ship? - I was in the hold.</p>
               <p>Did not you there swear that you was upon the deck and not in the hold? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Are the informations returned? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. In what situation was Hudson? He came as the waterman to take the coffee away, and was employed by the others.</p>
               <p>That night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he in the cabbin with the other three? - I cannot say he was.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. Have you any other evidence than Jeffreys to charge Hudson? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Then surely there is not the smallest pretence to charge him, a waterman employed by the commanding officer; how is he to know? If it is desired by the prisoner's council I shall take the verdict of the Jury upon Hudson now.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury,</p>
               <p>There are four prisoners you see indicted in this case, the Prize Master, the Mate of the ship, the Excise Officer, and Hudson, who it now appears in the evidence, was in no capacity or trust whatsoever on board the ship, had no knowledge of what passed, and was only a waterman employed that evening to bring some boats to carry away the coffee that was brought to him by the others: The Waterman being thus employed by the persons who had the apparent and rightful authority on board the ship and the direction of her cargo; it was impossible that he should know whether they were doing a justisiable or unjustifiable act, unless Jeffreys had objected before Hudson, therefore, without anticipating at all your consideration of the other prisoners, the council for the prisoner Hudson now desire your verdict.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, we do not press it.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. They do not it seems now press your verdict, till the whole comes under your consideration.</p>

               <p>You was put on board this ship I understand, on the Thursday that Jeffreys went away? - Yes, on the 11th.</p>
               <p>Did any thing particular pass? - Nothing passed only I went with Mr. Scott's clerk with a letter, and delivered that letter to Mr. Warren; Mr. Warren read that letter, and told this man that was here that he was to go on shore; I took the pen out of this man's hand, and took an account of what went out of the ship, I staid and delivered the ship; Mr. Harris told me he was glad the fellow was gone, for he had detected him of robbing the ship of coffee several times, likewise he said to Mr. Warren, you know it, and we must all be in one story.</p>
               <p>Court. How did you understand that? - I took it as meaning only to make a regular complaint of Jefferys.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Warren. Do you wish Sir, to say any thing yourself? - My Lord I leave it to the council.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodge and Harris. We leave it to our council.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I beg to observe that Jefferys stands in the situation of an accomplice, and there is no other evidence to corroborate his testimony; the felony itself, if committed, depends upon his evidence; the whole charge stands on his single evidence, no goods are found, nor is there a single tittle of evidence in corroboration of what the accomplice has so deposed; I take the liberty of saying in confidence that there is not.</p>
               <p>Court. You beg the question, that this man stands as an accomplice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, if a felony has been at all committed, as he has related it, he makes himself an accomplice by being present, going there, aiding and abetting, consenting to it.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you make him aiding and abetting?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290031"/>Mr. Fielding. My Lord he was there, and he states that a favour was asked of him, as if his assent was a necessary ingredient before they could get to the hold.</p>
               <p>Court. If they had asked him to go with them to steal the coffee out of the bags, and he had so gone down, I should have been of opinion with you, but if they asked him to go down for a different purpose, for a matter of favour at least, if not of perquisite and right, to go down to take the sweepings; and as he says, that they then immediately proceeded to do quite a different thing, and to commit a felony in his presence, he being a single man, and not daring to call on the officers, that does by no means make him an accomplice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. He says they asked him the favor to go down to take some sweepings.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not fix him with a felonious intention, it is certainly too much to charge a man who is present at a felony, and does not instantly oppose it, it is too much to make him an accomplice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Your Lordship sees he was by all the time, further than that, he does not attempt to prevent them, nor to dissuade them from it.</p>
               <p>Court. Take the distinction with you, I agree, that a man who is present and permits a felony, is not an innocent man, but I do not know that he is an accomplice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. He does not even dissuade them, he attends the boats, and observes them put it into the boat.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Fielding, as you have not an opportunity, by the rules of the Court of making a defence for your clients, you have taken a very ingenious method of letting the Jury know your objections, but I am of opinion, that his conduct does not make him an accomplice, but that his is evidence to go to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. All the observations I have now made, either in your Lordship's hearing, or the Jury's, have been drawn from me merely by the evidence that the man gave himself.</p>
               <p>Court. As I have given my opinion that he does not appear in the light of an accomplice, and that there is evidence to be left to the Jury of this being the property of Scott and Co. or of persons unknown; any thing that you now say will be addressed to the Jury indeed, therefore I must stop you; and I am also of opinion, that although the Captain of a ship has a qualified property in the cargo of the ship, yet he certainly has no right to carry it away by night, that is certainly a felonious taking: A man may feloniously take away his own property in the night, his property being mixed with others, if he takes it away with a felonious purpose; if in a warehouse in the city where goods are kept, one of the partners was to come in the night, and take away part of these goods, it would be burglary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, that is a trespass committed upon the possession of another; but I beg my Lord, again to declare that I have not taken a single objection owing to my consciousness of any weakness of this cause.</p>
               <p>Court. I think the objection a very fair and proper one, and by no means frivolous, though my opinion is against it.</p>

               <p>Did you give him any directions? - I told him to call either of us up when he was tired of walking, either in one hour or two hours, whenever he thought proper to call, if he was sleepy or heavy or any thing to call another man up; there was a lighter laid alongside partly loaded with coffee, that we had been discharging that day, and I told him if any thing happened to call us.</p>
               <p>Did he call you up? - No, I got up about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you see him when you came upon deck? - He was upon deck.</p>

               <p>You may know something of the behaviour of Jeffreys for that week or fortnight that he was on board till the 6th of September? - He always behaved very well, he was always very quiet.</p>
               <p>You did not know of Willey's objection? - No, I never heard of it.</p>
               <p>Court. What are the names of the other officers on board? - The Custom-house Officer's name was Canham.</p>

               <p>I was on board this prize on the 6th of September, I came from Barbadoes in her, I was at work in the hold till six o'clock in the evening, the hatches were then shut up, and the keys given to Mr. Warren, on the Monday morning I perceived no difference at all in the state of the coffee, as I could find.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive any good bags cut open? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of a ship was she? - We had two pumps almost always going, we pumped out a great deal of the coffee.</p>
               <p>Do you know Jeffreys? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you first hear that tale of the coffee? - Never till Mr. Warren was taken up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290034"/>How many days after? - Six or seven days.</p>
               <p>How many days was Jeffreys there after the sixth? - I do not know exactly the day that he went from the ship, I saw him there one day or two.</p>
               <p>What sort of a Captain did you fail under? - A very good one, as good a gentleman as ever I wish to cross salt water with.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council to Gardner. What sort of a Captain had you? - A very good man as ever I knew.</p>
               <p>Was he a good sailor? - Was he! aye; he is a sailor, or else I do not know how the ship would have been brought home, I believe the Dutch would have taken her, we had eleven of them to take care of.</p>
               <p>If he had not been a good sailor, Mr. Scott would never have had any of the coffee, I believe? - No, that he would not, we pumped all day and night too; I wish Mr. Scott had the trouble I had.</p>

               <p>Council for Prosecution. On the Monday morning you did not examine particularly? - As we left the work on Saturday night, so we found it on Monday morning, no alteration at all that I saw.</p>

               <p>I belong the Custom House, I know Harris extremely well, I have known him twenty years, he was with me on the 6th day of September last, and slept at my house that night.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you remember the day? - On the Friday he wrote to me that he was at Clerkenwell Bridewell, he often sleeps at my house, and has no other habitation.</p>
               <p>Court. How came he in Clerkenwell Bridewell? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury: This is a case which has taken up a great deal of time, and deserves great deal of your attention, for it is a charge against four men of exceeding good character, and some of them in respectable situations, and if the charge be true the crime is of a very aggravated nature, and public justice is greatly concerned in the punishment of offences of this fort, when clearly and satisfactorily proved: on the other hand if the charge is not a true one, it is a wicked and malicious prosecution and you will not grudge the time (though at this late hour) that may be necessarily taken up in investigating this business, or in my summing up the whole of the evidence to you with such observations as may occur to me there on. [ Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence on both sides and then added] I will just observe with respect to Jeffreys, that he does not stand in the light of an accomplice, if he did, the objection taken by Mr. Fielding would have been a good one; there being no other evidence against the prisoners: but the utmost that Jeffreys can be charged with, for his conduct from his own story, (if true) is that of culpable timidity, or easiness, in consenting to go down to the hold for a purpose, not a very proper one, at that time of night, though not a felonious one; and the credit of Jeffreys (if his own story be true) is undoubtedly affected by his conduct on that occasion: This prosecution rests on the single testimony of Jeffreys, who has positively sworn to a felony being committed by three of these prisoners: to be sure it is very unlikely that 3 men should chuse to commit a felony for an hour and an half, in the presence of a man that was set to watch over them, and this man not immediately interfering or alarming the Custom House Officers that were then on board: another circumstance is, he says they cut the bags, now you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290036"/> have heard what has been sworn as to the state of the bags you will weigh the whole case; it is peculiarly your province so to do: and if you are convinced in your consciences that a robbery was committed, and the evidence of Jeffreys is true, then you will find three of the prisoners guilty, (for there is no evidence of any kind against Hudson,) if you are of a contrary opinion or have any doubt upon the matter, in that case you will acquit them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Can the witness say I took the candles away at all, or ever saw them at first or last? - I cannot be positive that it was the prisoner took the basket out, as his back was towards me, but it was the colour of his coat, I am sure he was the man that had them on his shoulder.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was very much in liquor at the time I had this plate to clean, and I put these spoons and these buckles in my pocket, I came up with the other things, and put them out of my hand, I took up the shoes to carry them into another room, and a friend came by and called me out, I went to a publick house, and then I went to another, and spent all my money, I was very much in liquor, and when the reckoning came to be paid, I had no money, I asked him if he had any, he said, no, I told him I had a pair of my master's buckles in my pocket, and he bid me go and pawn them, and I went and pawned them, I intended to have brought them again; my friends do not know that my trial came on to day.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is very true that he was very much in liquor before, he might have taken two hundred pounds worth of plate, I had no suspicion of his taking any thing of this sort; as to his story of his bringing them back again, it may be true.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you think from his behaviour that he did not mean to steal them? - I do my Lord, he was very drunk, I do not think he was sensible.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Would you be kind enough to take him into your service again, if he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a very proper question, he seems to be very sensible of having done wrong, it may save the young man from destruction.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I should not wish to take him again as he has done this.</p>
               <p>Court. But if you think he did not mean to steal them, and it was a mere act of drunkenness; it is a bad mind which constitutes the offence; and as you have behaved on this prosecution with the utmost lenity in the world, much to your honor, for the hands may be guilty, though the heart may be free, and have gone so far with respect to saving the bad from a punishment which you think he does not deserve, you would act mighty well to try to save him for the future; if you can employ him or recommend him to employment, do think of it Mr. Wilder on the recommendation of the Jury and myself.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I will try him for a week or two, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a thing you will reflect on with pleasure.</p>

               <p>Who was in the room when you missed your money? - Not a soul.</p>
               <p>What did you do when you missed the money? - I was taken so ill I kept my bed four days.</p>
               <p>Who did you first tell? - I told my husband when he came home at night.</p>

               <p>What time did you dine? - I had a little bit of dinner before this happened.</p>
               <p>Was not it natural for you when you missed your money, to run out of the room and call the little girl? - I was so frightened I made no enquiry.</p>
               <p>Did you sit on the same chair till your husband came home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did not you even get up to look if the money had dropped? - I looked all over the room.</p>
               <p>Then you did not sit still you know. - My sister saw me have the money, I cannot account for my telling nobody, I was taken very ill.</p>
               <p>Then it was natural to call to your sister for assistance: upon your oath, was not the reason that you did not speak to your sister before your husband came home that you had a suspicion of the girl? - I could not speak.</p>
               <p>If you were able to walk you were able to speak. - I could not walk.</p>
               <p>Why you have said already you looked all about the room? - I looked where I sat.</p>
               <p>What time did your husband come home in the evening? - I cannot tell, it was about duskish.</p>

               <p>Court. When your husband came home you told him what had happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him the same story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he do? - This was night, and the next day was Sunday, and my brother and sister went out of town on Sunday and took the little girl with them.</p>
               <p>Has the bank note ever been found? - No.</p>
               <p>How long did your brother and sister stay out of town? - Pretty near a week or four days.</p>
               <p>How soon was the prisoner taken up? - She was taken up upon suspicion.</p>
               <p>When? - I do not recollect, my sister will tell you, she was taken up when my sister came back.</p>
               <p>Why not before your sister came back, why did not your husband take her up? - Because my sister knew of the money.</p>
               <p>Why did not your husband take her up? - Because my husband was out when I lost it.</p>
               <p>Then your sister was so material a person that you waited for her coming back from the country, and yet you never told your sister about the loss at the first? - I did not, I could not speak to her I was struck so.</p>
               <p>Why could not your husband and you act without your sister? - Because my sister knew about it.</p>
               <p>Did not your husband know as much as she? - He knew I had the money.</p>
               <p>Why did you wait for your sister's coming home to know about it? - Because she knew I had the money.</p>
               <p>And so did your husband; upon your oath was not the reason both of your not speaking to your sister that day, and of your waiting till they came back for a week, because you suspected the girl? - No.</p>
               <p>Then can you give me any reason why you waited for your sister coming back? - I cannot.</p>

               <p>Did not you tell her then? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you give any reason for that? - I cannot upon my honour, I was so very ill.</p>
               <p>Then though you lost this money at one o'clock on Saurday, and your sister's girl<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290045"/> had been twice in the room while you had it in your lap, you never told your sister of the loss till she came out of the country? - No.</p>

               <p>How came you to ask her what she had drank? - I did not ask her any questions about it, she told me of the loss of the money.</p>
               <p>What connection had her drinking with the loss of the money? - She said a glass of brandy was the only thing she had drank, because she was telling me that she had lost so much money, as she had taken out her money to give to the little girl to go for a quartern of shrub, to treat this washerwoman.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you what money she had lost? - She told me, she had lost fourteen guineas and a ten pound bank note, which I knew she had.</p>
               <p>What did you do upon that? - Nothing, because my brother and sister were gone into the country.</p>
               <p>Why they were not gone before you came home? - No, my brother was with me.</p>
               <p>Did not you enquire of your sister's girl? - Yes.</p>

               <p>That was that afternoon when you came home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had your wife told your brother and sister about it before you came home? - My brother was out with me.</p>
               <p>Had she told your sister before you came home? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was there no suspicion entertained of the little girl at that time? - Not the least in the world, the little girl went out of the room before the prisoner went out of the room, as my wife told me.</p>
               <p>Did you go immediately after this woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Why not? - Because we had no suspicion of the woman.</p>
               <p>What, when nobody else was in the room? - We could not think it was the woman, we could not say any thing that it was that woman.</p>

               <p>You knew as much about it then as you do now? - No, because before they had</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290046"/>not a sixpenny-piece to help themselves, and the week after we lost it, her husband bought him a new watch, and new clothes.</p>
               <p>Then you did not suspect this woman till after the things were bought? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner's husband? - He is no trade, he was a gentleman's servant on board a ship, he rented a little shop, and set up a penny-barber, and he bought a new watch, and clothes, shoes and buckles, and gowns for her, and every thing of that.</p>
               <p>Did you make any enquiries at the places where these things were bought whether she had changed any bank notes or not? - No, where he bought the watch the man said he pulled out a handfull of guineas.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you had her taken up? - As near as I can guess about five days, when my sister came home she was the person that found out every thing, or else we had no suspicion of this woman.</p>

               <p>Jury. Who brought your wife the glass of brandy that she said she drank? - I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>That is as she told you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did she say she had been? - She had been to a tallow-chandler's in some court near Temple-bar, and she said, she had sent a porter four times, and paid him sixpence a time, but he had never been near the place.</p>

               <p>You chose to take her word? - I did.</p>

               <p>Did you know what money she had? - I know that was the money she had when I went out.</p>
               <p>Exactly that money? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>She had more than that? - She had about ten pounds more, that remained when she went out on Monday to buy her some things.</p>
               <p>Is not she a good deal given to drinking? Not that ever I saw, she loves a glass or so.</p>
               <p>So you were satisfied with the story that she told you, of the four days that she was out, sending to you four times without making any enquiry? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You asked her no questions? - No.</p>
               <p>How happened that? - We were persuaded to say nothing about it, till we could do something in it, on the Sunday I was obliged to go out of town, and they let it alone till I returned.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it proper to ask her some questions that evening? - No, my Lord, because they desired I would say nothing about it till my return.</p>
               <p>Did you suspect this woman at that time? - Yes, because there was nobody else in the place.</p>
               <p>Did you talk with your sister and your brother about your suspicions of that woman that evening. - On the Saturday morning my sister's son, who had been at sea asked her for seven guineas, she gave it to him, and she told her money in my presence, and I saw her put it in her pocket again before I went up stairs, the son was gone then for hours.</p>
               <p>How came she to have the money out for hours after he was gone? - She took it out to send for some shrub, I was present when she took out her money to see whether it was all right, she was telling her money when I went into the room about ten minutes before the prisoner came into the room.</p>
               <p>How much had she got then? - Fourteen guineas and some silver, and a bank note which was wrapped up in a paper.</p>

               <p>You are sure of that? - That was all I saw, whether she had any more any where else, I know nothing at all about that, she told me, she was going to pay some money away.</p>
               <p>Did you see it told? - I saw her tell fourteen guineas, and some silver, and a bank note.</p>
               <p>Was there any more? - She did not pull any more out of her pocket before my face.</p>
               <p>After you came home what was done with this woman? - We sent for her and asked her to return the money and we would not hurt her, she said, the watch her husband took out of pawn, at the pawnbroker's in Bell Court, she said, she had a new gown that she changed with her sister, which her sister denied, she denied ever seeing the money; then we had a warrant of Justice Blackborough, and she was in prison six days, and he acquitted her, then there was an indictment for some trifling things of mine, I missed them the next morning.</p>

               <p>Court. Was you by when he was taken up? - No, Sir, I was in hold, and I sent for him to know how he came by that money and clothes.</p>
               <p>Did you hear, or did the officers tell you what he said? - No, Sir, I heard him confess after we were all taken up together, he said, he took the things out his own self, and no person was with him, but a man that he hired and paid porterage to; it was one Mr. Hopkins that asked him, and one Mr. Bishop was there, who lives at St. Catherine's.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290049"/>And you was then under a charge of this very fact yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you heard him confess? - Yes.</p>

               <p>But you must say one way or the other? - I heard Mr. Hopkins say, if he would tell where the things were, and that he could get his property again, he should not be hurt.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I cannot take what he said after that promise; who was there besides? - Nobody else, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Who was Mr. Hopkins? - He keeps a public house at Bristol.</p>
               <p>How came he there? - He is the father-in-law of the lady that was robbed.</p>
               <p>When did you see the things there last? - I had been very lame and my child very ill, and I had not been there for three weeks or a month; and I sent another person in my stead that saw the goods.</p>
               <p>Who went in consequence of this confession to see for the goods? - Mr. Hopkins went himself, but who went with him I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will acquaint your Lordship with the truth of what she lays against me; the 22d of August, I came to her house to lodge, and having lodged there some time, I went up with her son one morning, sitting at breakfast, she asked me to go up and bring down a pot of white paint or yellow paint, accordingly to oblige her, being my landlady, I did; and she gave me the key to go up; and some time after that, I was up at my mother-in-law's at breakfast, and she was with me, I was then in a little trouble, and says she, I have have had the selling of part of these goods myself, for Captain Smith brought a woman in the house, and she has robbed Mrs. Smith of part of her clothes, and I am to dispose of them, and some time after this, says she, as you have sold your property, and are acquainted with gentlemen, you may as well sell part of this gentleman's goods; so I took out the goods by her desire, and I sold several things, but not so many as are laid to my charge, I sold them at different times; and I hired a man, for I am a cripple, to go in open day-light, if I had known they were stolen goods I should not have gone in open day-light: I sold them to a gentleman who has known me many years.</p>
               <p>Court. So that all that was done, was by her desire?</p>

Says he, Mrs. Smith will not come here any more, she has taken a house at Shadwell, and she is brought to bed of a boy; I said, are you going to take the things on board of ship, and my husband said, he believed the prisoner was a Jew, and I said, I believe he is a Jew altogether, for he has a Jew's heart, upon which the prisoner left the things and walked off: there was a handsome table wrapped up in a carpet: There was another woman that looked after the house whilst

               <p>I am coachman to Mr. Heaton, he was in his phaeton and I with him, we were coming from Moor-park on the 21st of August last, and we stopped at the Duke of Chandois's Arms, at Edgware, and my master asked for a man and horse with arms to guide his phaeton to town, but they said they had none at home, it was then turned of eight, and the prisoner then came by on a grey horse, went slowly through the town, and looked very hard at the chaise, with that I said to my master, Sir, there is a gentleman going to town on horseback, and very likely he will accompany you; we overtook him in the town going for London, and I says good night to you; he walked and trotted; I always ride in the phaeton with my master.</p>
               <p>How was the night? - There was daylight enough, I said good night to you; with that he turned his head aside; I then went on, and there is a bridge turning out of the town near to the turnpike, and the prisoner came up then close to the phaeton and looked at us, he rode between the turnpike and the phaeton, I thought the fore wheel of the phaeton must have taken hold of his horse, he got a little before us then, and he slackened his pace, and we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290052"/> came up to him; I still looked at him very hard, then we got a little ahead again with the phaeton, he did not stop, but rather slackened his pace, with that we got ahead of him about an hundred yards, and my master turned his head round, and saw him come up very smart towards the phaeton again, I turned round after my master mentioned it, and saw him close on the phaeton, and my master said directly, depend upon it that is a highwayman, I said I could not think it, but that he was a Londoner out, holiday making, I did not know but he might have been a clerk or something of that kind; he came up close to the phaeton, and I turned round, and I said directly to him, says I, what are you, are you afraid to come up? with that he slackened his pace again, and staid behind: We pushed on, and twice afterwards he came up in the same manner; I looked very hard at him every time, it was quite light. The fifth attack was the general attack; he then came up with a little bit of black something, it was not crape, but it appeared to me as if he had cut the inside of his hat to bring over his eyes, I then looked back and saw him, he was about two hundred yards behind, I could see him very plain waving his pistol, and hallooing out stop, stop, stop, very loud; he came up to my side, which was the off side, and presented his pistol, and said stop, (I had said to my master before he came up, whatever you have give it him for fear of an accident) I said my friend take your pistol away, and you shall have what we have got; my master gave him his watch, he did not demand it, but he gave it him; he put it in his pocket and said then your money, with that my master gave him his purse with eight guineas and an half, and about twelve shillings in silver; we baited at Rickmansworth, and my master had ten guineas in his pocket when he came out in the morning: After the prisoner had robbed my master, he says to me, Sir, your money, I said I am but a servant, what I have got is but very trifling, he said necessity obliged him, and he waved his pistol, I begged he would take it away, I then stood up in the phaeton to put my hand in my breeches pocket to give him what I had, being quite intimidated with the pistol, I gave him about six or seven shillings in silver, and half a guinea; after that I said, still looking at him, as the little thing he had over his face came only to his lip, and I said, Sir, you gentlemen of the road have a bye-word, whatever it is I will be obliged to you to give us the watch-word, he made no reply, but clapped spurs to his horse and and rode off; we turned off to Edgware, and lay there that night, we were about a mile from Edgware at this time, the next morning coming to town, we gave information before Sir Sampson Wright, some time after Sharman was apprehended, and Sir Sampson sent down to us, I went to see if he was the man, but he was quite different from the man that robbed me, and I told Sir Sampson he was not the man; some time afterwards Sir Sampson sent again, and the prisoner was brought up, and the instant I saw him I knew him to be the person; whilst Sir Sampson was examining him, he wished some bitter wishes that he never knew the Edgware road, nor the way to it; he was further examined when the turnpike-man was present.</p>
               <p>Court. You are very sure this is the man? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Pray Mr. Coachman are you sure as to the hour of the night? - Within five minutes under or over.</p>
               <p>What kind of pace might you be coming home? - I suppose about six or seven miles an hour.</p>
               <p>Was there any particular inducement that led you to take more notice of this man than any other common traveller on the road? - By my master's saying he was a highway-man.</p>
               <p>Your master never made that observation till you came through the turnpike? - He did not.</p>
               <p>When you spoke to him, I think you say he made no answer but turned his head? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290053"/>Then you could not see his face at that time? - If you will take it the plain way, Sir, I will tell you.</p>
               <p>There was no particular inducement that led you to take notice of this man's person till that time? - You are going behind the story, Sir, I saw him again.</p>
               <p>You have given us an account of his overtaking you, and your overtaking him four times, as it happens very frequently to passengers on the road, you went one pace and he another, and so you alternately overtook each other? - We only overtook him at the turnpike.</p>
               <p>But you had no inducement to observe him before your master said he was a highwayman? - Only the oddness of his not returning the compliment when I wished him a good night, but he never was out of my view till the last attempt.</p>
               <p>Did you take as much notice of his horse as of him? - Equally the same.</p>
               <p>When this man was examined, was he put into a group of figures, or was he put to you singly to look at? - No, there were two of them.</p>
               <p>You did not swear to him positively then? - There was some lenity in me.</p>
               <p>Did not you take some minutes before you swore to him, and desire to call in the turnpike-man? - He wished such bitter wishes, that I desired to have my testimony established by the turnpike-man.</p>
               <p>What horse was he upon? - A grey horse.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I am a turnpike-man, I was on the 21st of August at Edgware-bar, in the evening about a quarter after nine, I recollect the prisoner coming through on a grey horse, he was dressed in dark grey, with his hat flapped round, I went out to him and asked him if he had paid the toll, and he mentioned the letter, and by his turning his head round I had a full view of him; I did not hear of any robbery that night.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure by that transient view you had, the prisoner was the man? - Yes, it seemed to be a square hat, and the flap hung down; the next day the prosecutor and the man came up and asked me if I was in employ the overnight, if I recollected such a man, and what he was dressed in, I said in such coloured clothes as I have now, and the gentleman made reply, that is the man that robbed me of my watch and money.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the person? - To the best of my recollection, by the light of the lamp, that is the man, he was dressed in dark grey such as I have on now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What time was it you came on duty that night? - At seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>What might the time of night have been when this grey horse came through that you are speaking of? - Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>It was quite dark then? - There was the lamp on the post.</p>
               <p>That is on the other side? - No.</p>
               <p>How many horses had gone through before? - I had not opened the gate.</p>
               <p>Should you know the horse again? - I cannot say I should, one grey horse may be like another, I have no doubt no further than that I am sure so far to the best of my recollection; the next morning I described the marks of the man and the clothes that he wore.</p>
               <p>There was no inducement that led you to look at the man when he came through the gate? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>The man's hat was flapped? - Yes, the broad part of his hat, being a cocked hat, hung over his shoulders.</p>
               <p>And what sight you had was from the reflection of this lamp? - Yes, the lamp stands over the Horse-gate, I have seen the man in company with two or three others several times on that road, I did not think he was a rogue.</p>
               <p>Court to Flinn. What colour was his coat? - A grey coat.</p>

               <p>On the 26th of September, about nine at night, the master of the Bull and Gate Holborn, came down to the office, and said there was a man in his house that had lived with him as a waiter, and he had heard that he had carried pistols in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290054"/> pocket, and he believed him to be a highwayman; I went up with him, and at the gate, there was a hackney coachman who enquired after the prisoner, if he was gone, as he had waited so long, I asked him where he brought him from, he said from Tower-stairs, and that he brought one man and a woman with him, and that the man who got out of the coach said to the prisoner, go to Prosser's at the New-inn, Tottenham-court-road, and discharge the horses: then I went into the room to him and searched him, I found nothing upon him but a guinea and a half, no pistols nor nothing about him; I secured him that night at the round-house, I went that night to Prosser's, and brought the ostler down, who said he had had horses there on Tuesday and Wednesday, he and another man, and that other man's name was Frasier, and we went out and took Frasier up from his direction, I brought the prisoner to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the turnpike-man one question; when you was at Bow-street office did not you say that I had a round hat, such as I have in my hand? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you deny it? - I said it was a flapped hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing further.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Flinn. Did you never trace the grey horse up to Mr. Prosser's? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Morant. Prosser's were both brown horses that they had, it was not at that time.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any witnesses? - None.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, Mr. Heaton does not appear here himself, therefore it depends entirely upon the evidence given by his coachman, who swears in the very circumstantial manner you have heard, and who had repeated opportunities of seeing the person.</p>

               <p>Was it a light night? - So light I could have read in the street; I knew the prisoner by his coat, and his figure, and his face.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about him now? - As much as I believe any thing in the world, I believe him to be the man; I saw him the same morning at ten o'clock in Bow-street, in custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you immediately discover him to be the man? - When I came in the room I saw my watch laying on the table, I was surprized it was there so soon, and immediately after the man was brought in; as much as I believe any thing, I believe him to be the man.</p>

               <p>Was you sober? - Yes, it was very light, and there was a lamp in the alley just by; the prisoner and two more were together, he took my watch out of my pocket, and knocked me down, and run off, he took my watch before he gave me the blow, my companion was close by me, nothing was done to him, I called to him, and said, Scott, I am robbed of my watch, that is the man; Scott ran after him, and I saw no more of the prisoner or of Scott, till I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290057"/> him in the watch-house at Ratcliffe Highway, about three quarters of an hour after; then I saw the prisoner, the man that pursued him, and the man that stopped him;</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What is he? - I cannot say, I have heard he belonged to a press-gang then.</p>
               <p>Do you belong to any ship? - Yes, my Lord, I have been waiting for a ship this two months, I should have been aboard of her but for this, she is an Indiaman at Blackwall, I never found my watch again,</p>
               <p>It was pretty late, where had you been? - Up in Holborn at the Tweed-side House, I was there before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>So you had been there from eight till near twelve? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Drinking? - Yes, drinking with company.</p>
               <p>I suppose by that time you must have been a little in liquor? - I was quite sober, quite sensible.</p>
               <p>Where had you been before you got to the Tweed-side House? - I walked up from Wapping to see an acquaintance there.</p>
               <p>Had you been drinking that afternoon? - Nothing but porter.</p>
               <p>How many pots to your own share? - I do not suppose I drank above one pot or three pints at farthest to my own share.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect having your watch in your pocket any part of that evening? - Yes, I had it in my pocket coming down Nightingale-lane, I took my watch out there and put it again into my pocket, which is not far from the place I am speaking of.</p>
               <p>Did you stop in Nightingale-lane? - No, I never went into any house till I was robbed, nor met with any woman, nor spoke to any woman.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am about twenty-one years of age, a sea-faring man, the prosecutor and me were in one ship thirty-four months together, I went to the Tweed-side House and we staid till between eleven and twelve, and we walked arm in arm all the way to Plow Ally, it is a very narrow pass into the Alley, I parted from his arm, and I saw the prisoner knock him down; I was not two yards from him, the prisoner let off through Hermitage-street, I followed him, and called stop thief! I never lost light of him, it was as clear as day; I passed through a lane and chaced him, and he passed all the watchmen, and never a watchman offered to move, and this gentleman, Mr. Sellers, he was coming by, and Mr. Sellers chaced him, and he ran right a head, and tacked to the larboard, and he took down Burr-street and was taken: he was searched, Mr. Sellers stroked him down.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure this is the man that you saw knock the prosecutor down? - I am quite sure.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Returning from a club, of which I am a member, in Cloth Fair, between twelve and one o'clock, I came through a passage called Dark Entry, and soon after there was a hue and cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner before any person, there was no soul by him, he was running, he came up part of Nightingale-lane, then he came down on the same side of the way, I was upon, on the right-hand side, it was just at the corner of Nightingale-lane, Burr-street comes into Nightingale-lane, just by the corner he crossed the end of it, it is a wide open street, seeing a man run and a cry of stop thief, I immediately went after him; I presently came near to him, and then he cried stop thief, I laid hold of him, he said, I am not the man, I cry stop thief; I held him by his blue great coat; he did not immediately stop when I first took him, I cried out watch, and the watch and Mr. Scott were coming up to my assistance; I then asked them what they charged him with, they said, he had knocked a person down and robbed him of his watch, I took him to the watch-house, there was no constable there, but I demanded one to be sent for, and a sort of search was made, but the prisoner might have had several watches about him, they did not offer to strip him; the prosecutor came into the watch-house some little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290058"/> time after, and as soon as he saw the prisoner, he declared he was the man that knocked him down and robbed him, in company with two more.</p>
               <p>What condition did the prosecutor appear to be in? - He appeared to be very sensible, so as to give a reasonable answer, he had been drinking, but you could not call him a drunken man.</p>
               <p>What condition was Scott in? - As sober as he is now.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had a little tea on board an Indiaman, and coming up towards Execution Dock, two or three met me, and tried to take it away; I got a boat and rowed over, and got the tea safe, and coming up Nightingale-lane, I heard the cry of stop thief, and I cried stop thief, and this gentleman laid hold of me by the coat, I asked him what he wanted with me, I told him, I would stop; Scott came up, and said, I was the person that knocked a man down and took his watch away: says he, to me, you know you belonged to a press-gang, and says he, you know how I served your officers, and how you served me when you took me; says I, why blame me for it now; they sent for the officer of the night, and this gentleman came up to the watch-house, he said, he did not know me at that time, afterwards he said, he could not be sure, and he told the officer of the night he might let me go if he would: the officer of the night is here, and the watchmen had enough to do, gentlemen, to hinder Mr. Scott from killing me in coming up Nightingale-lane.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MOSES sworn.</p>
               <p>Our officer was dead, so I was called, at one o'clock, the prosecutor made a complaint against the prisoner at the bar, for robbing him of a watch; I searched his pocket, and all round his thigh and found nothing but a knife; they were all three together, they had words and wanted to fight, and I would not let them.</p>
               <p>Court. About what? - The prisoner said, he did not rob him, and the prosecutor said, he knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing else that they quarrelled about? - Nothing particular, the prosecutor said there, that he was half and half, he was not very sober, he said, at much as to say I might let him go, says he, if you cannot find the watch you may let him go; says I, you gave charge once, I will not let him go; if the Justice will forgive him tomorrow morning, it is well and good; I will not forgive him.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing said about pressing? - Yes, Scott says, he knows nothing about him, he never was pressed by him, nor any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>But did Scott, or did this prosecutor charge him with having ill used them when he belonged to a press-gang? - No, that word was not mentioned.</p>
               <p>Sellers. This gentleman swears positively, that the prosecutor was going to fight with the prisoner; it is false, they never offered to fight; Scott and him would have fought; Mr. Moses wanted to be admitted as an evidence in this affair, and wanted his name put on the back of the indictment, and I said, you know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character, and said, he had more at Wapping, but could not send for them soon enough.</p>

               <p>Does that door lead only into your house or into White's? - There is a street-door, this is my room door that was broke open, the street-door was on the latch, I returned between six and seven, I borrowed a candle from below, and went immediately up to my room, and I put the key in the door to try to unlock it, I found the key did not turn, and I went down stairs, and as I was going down stairs, the prisoner at the bar opened the door and looked over me, and he struck at the candle which I had in my hand, I ran down stairs, perceiving that there were more than one man in the room, and called murder and fire, the prisoner ran after me and knocked me down with his double fist on the crown of my head, and stepped over me, I am very positive to the prisoner, because I had the candle, I got up and was in the street very near as soon as him, and called stop thief, by which means this man was taken, another man came down and called stop thief, and he escaped, I did not find my leg hurt then.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner taken? - No, they brought him back, and asked me if I knew him, I said that was the man that opened the door and looked at me, he was taken in Sydney's alley, about two of three hundred yards off, the prisoner was taken before Justice Welch and committed, I went up stairs immediately, and found the room in the greatest confusion, the bed curtains torn down and laid on the floor, all my dirty linen was in a foul clothes basket in the closet, and they were removed from that place.</p>
               <p>Was the trunk removed from the place where it was left? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where were the tea-spoons? - The teaspoons were on a tea-board in the closet, they had reached out the tea-board and taken the spoons, and knocked down the china, and broke it, the teaspoons were taken from the room and when the prisoner was brought back, they were conveyed on the table, one bundle of the things they dropped in the passage, they were all in the house when I went away, every thing in its place, and they were all removed out of the place, if I had brought them all I must have had a cart, they had cut a bit of wood out of each drawer to try to open it.</p>

               <p>Could you distinguish people's faces? - I will not be sure, I heard stop thief cried, being on the same side of the way as the robbery was committed, I turned back, I saw the prisoner between where I was and the house that was robbed, which was about four doors, I did not see him come out of the house, but within four doors of the house, he was running, he passed me, and I hearing stop thief cried the second time, made after him, knowing him to be the man, because there was nobody else between the house and me, and stop thief was cried from that house, I pursued him, he turned round into Cranbourn-alley, he was not out of my sight till he fell down.</p>

               <p>Did you see him fall down? - I cannot swear that I saw him fall, but in the fall I lost him, which was just at the turning, the mob was to thick that I could not come to take him, I came up to him directly as he got up.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not lose sight of him, long enough for any other person to have come in his place? - No.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - I am positive of that.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again when you saw him get up? - I know him to be the man that I pursued.</p>
               <p>Is that the man? - That is the man, I took him by the arm, I did not loose him till I gave him into the hands of the man that belonged to the house, Mr. White.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough when he came by for you to distinguish the face? - Yes, as he came past the publick house door I saw him by the lamp, and the light of the place.</p>
               <p>Then it was not light enough for you to distinguish without the help of the lamp? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a child's shoemaker, I had six pair of children's shoes bespoke at Cranbourn-alley, I had carried them home and got the money, I was going to the leather cutter's in Cranbourn-alley to buy some leather, there was a great noise and cry of stop thief, and a man laid hold of me, I strove to keep him off, he said I was a thief, I know no more of it than the child unborn, I never was at the house.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Is this the account he gave before the Justice? - No, my Lord, not a word of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Bayley. You have heard what he says now, was it what he said before the Justice? - No, it was not.</p>

               <p>Were there any particular marks about her? - Yes, she had a cut in her off ear, and a crack in her off foot on the inside, I found her again at Warwick, I have her now.</p>

               <p>I live in Warwick, I keep a publick house and am a farmer; on the 4th of October, the prisoner at the bar came to my house and called the hostler to take his horse, he came into the house and had a mug of ale, he drank it, and went up into the town, in about half an hour he returned, he called twice to the hostler, and ordered the mare out, and called for a feed of corn, he said, says he, landlord, I have a useful little mare here, but she will not draw, he asked me if I had ever a one that I could change with him that would draw, I told him I had; I keep several hacks; and there was one that stood in the stable that I chopped with him for the mare; he shifted the saddle and said, will you go and have a shilling's-worth of ale, we went and had some ale, having seen the mare, and finding her better than my horse, I suspected him, I said, I do not think you came honestly by this mare.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the mare better than your horse? - Yes, therefore I was surprized that he should make such a swap as that; he said, it was his father's mare, I said, I am afraid you have stolen this mare; a gentleman farmer came into my house, this gentleman examined him where he came from, he said, from Bucks, he asked him if he knew one Dumper, he said he did, he said, he is a sad fellow; I did not like my customer; he got up pretending to make water, and ran away, says I, go after him, he was gone a long way towards Coventry, I went after him, he got over the grounds that I could not follow him, I rode after him about a mile and half, and I took him, I asked him what he ran away for, says he, do not hurt me, I am guilty; I took him before the Mayor of the town, and he was committed, I asked him going to prison where he got the mare, he said, two of his friends had taken her and brought her to him; I asked him whose mare she was, he said, it was Mr. Hoblar's mare; the Mayor of the Town said, he would write to Sir Sampson Wright, and get to the bottom of it; I said to him, you must be a very great villain, supposing this mare had been found upon me, and I never saw you in my life before, I delivered the mare on Tuesday evening by the orders of Sir Sampson Wright, to young Mr. Hoblar.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hoblar. You received the mare from this witness? - I did, I delivered it to my father.</p>
               <p>And that was your father's mare? - It was.</p>
               <p>When did you last see the mare before you missed her? - I rode her on the Thursday, and had her on Thursday at two o'clock, and missed her on Friday the 3d of October.</p>

               <p>When I was first apprehended the Mayor of the Town said, if I had any companions that helped me to the mare, if I would confess of them and let them be apprehended,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290064"/> he would admit me as an evidence.</p>

               <p>On the 13th of October, I had a search warrant to search Shipley's house for some horse cloths, and I found one, and next to the sacking of the bed, between that and the bed I found a sheep skin, it was up stairs, there was only one room on the floor.</p>
               <p>Who lives in the house besides Shipley? - He has a wife but she was in London, I know it to be his house, the door was upon the latch.</p>
               <p>(The Sheep skin produced.)</p>
               <p>I found in the same room at the feet of the bed, a leg and loin of mutton, I put it within the skin and took it to the house where Shipley was then, I took him to the Justice, and the Justice sent me to see if I could find any more mutton, I went into the next house thinking it was the same, and there I found a shoulder of mutton with part of the breast; that was in one Easterlough's house, then Mr. Church suspected Templar, and he had a search warrant for his house; and in the back place next to the common, I found a leg, shoulder, and loin, and part of a loin was boiling in the pot; I found the wind-pipe of a sheep over the oven, and I found the head over the ashes of an oven partly burnt.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know it was the wind-pipe of sheep? - The butcher says so, it was partly burnt to pieces, and the suet of one loin in a flour bag, this was at Templar's.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any reason to know whether that mutton belonged to Mr. Church's sheep more than any other man's sheep? - Only by the butcher.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to the Rotation Office, Whitechapel: On the 3d of October, a woman said, a boy had been robbed by two men, by somebody, she said, I knew: I went to where he lodged, but he absconded ten or eleven days. On the 15th coming down the road, I met Sharpling the prisoner and two others, I took him and the others ran away; I brought the prisoner to the watch-house, the boy was sent for, and he picked the prisoner out: The master had been on the morning of the robbery and described the prisoner, I cannot be certain whether he said a brown, or a blue, great coat, and striped trowsers, he had the same things on when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was the prisoner? - In the cage, when the boy came he was ordered out amongst a number of people, and the boy picked him out, he was asked if he knew any one there, and said, the prisoner was the man, and he knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I was put to the bar, and he was asked whether he knew the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Way. My Lord, the boy picked him out before he came from the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I could prove that I was not there, for I was on the 3d and 4th, and part of the 5th of October, on board a ship in Greenland Dock.</p>
               <p>Jury to Lavy. Was there any body else in the dress of a sailor besides this man? - I cannot say, the watch-house was full.</p>

               <p>Did they stand crouded together, could the boy see the trowsers, or must he speak from the face the prisoner? - He stood among the croud.</p>

               <p>Court. What did you find? - We found a cutting engine and this instrument, I do not know what it was, it was fixed to the side of the cutting engine, there was a couple of bits of cork, and some scowering paper in this place that looked like a kitchen, I went to the house again on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did you stay in the house that first time? - I suppose three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you all go away together? - No, Jealous, Carpmeal, and I, were sent to the house were we heard Wilson lodged, in another part of the town, Clarke staid; we went and found the woman that went for Mrs. Wilson, we asked for Mr. Wilson, she said, he was gone out, she did not know where.</p>
               <p>Where were these lodgings? - Somewhere near Brook's Market, I cannot tell the name of the street; we searched these apartments and found nothing in them; then we went back to the house in Tennis Court, and we found Wilson in custody of Clarke; then we got this cutting out press and the other things into a coach, and brought the prisoner to Bow-street, and the things to Clark's house, and Wilson was committed, this was on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Court. When you went out did you fasten the door? - It was locked I believe: On Monday we went to New Prison and found a man of the name of Rowe, in company with Mr. Wilson, and his wife in the gaol, we took Rowe into custody and brought him away, and went to the house, and he pointed out where the different things that were found in the house were.</p>
               <p>When you came to the house was the door locked? - I believe it was locked, for we were obliged to get a boy to get over and let us in.</p>
               <p>What things did you find there? - In the back parlour there were some bricks that had been taken out of some place in the house, and they were laid carelesly upon one another; Rowe said, take them bricks down and you will find some cecil, I did so, and found some cecil rolled up in this paper as it is now. (The cecil produced.) Then we went up into the two pair of stairs room, there is no garret, they call that the garret; he told us to stoop in under the chimney place and turn upon our left-hand, and upon a little jet out there, we should find a piece of linen cloth and something in it; I did so, and I found this cloth with this parcel of shillings in an unfinished state; there were these pliers, and this scowering paper, and cork.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the cellar? - Yes, I saw Carpmeal pull out a quantity of shillings that had been finished out of the wall, there was a place where there had been bricks taken out, and they were put into the wall, and some mortar laid on the front of them, Carpmeal has the shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Pray who is that Mr. Rowe? - I do not know, I never saw him till I saw him in New Prison.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath you never saw him before? - Upon my oath to my knowledge I did not.</p>
               <p>Did he take much intreating to go with you? - No, Sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>Every part of that house seemed to be known to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he conducted you to this hiding place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you any thing more at that time? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>When you, and Clark, and the rest, went to the house in this court, you say you broke open the house, and there was nobody in it? - No, Sir, not that I know of.</p>
               <p>You went to the lodging which you conceived belonging to the prisoner? - So I understood.</p>
               <p>And you searched that lodging and there you found nothing at all? - No.</p>

               <p>You was at this house in Tennis-court? - Yes, there was a press fixed.</p>
               <p>What do you call that press? - A cutting-out press, it is used by a fly, the use of it is to cut out round blanks in any thing.</p>
               <p>What instrument is this? - It is such an instrument as I never saw before in my life, when I first saw it fixed up, it appeared that whoever had made use of it, had been used to round the edges of something, there were two centers, and any thing put between it turned it round with it, and putting a file to the edge of that, it made it round, it all run round together, and holding the file to it, it took the rough edge off.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any thing to determine that this had been used in that manner? - There were some remains of filings.</p>
               <p>Was there enough of them to distinguish the metal? - There was not, they were swept all over the room that we could not take them up to produce them.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure they were filings? - I could be sure they had been made use of in that instrument by somebody, but who I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>In your judgement this is an instrument of which that use might be made? - Yes; this is called cecil, it is a composition of silver or metal, that is run down to a size in a flatting mill, and then it is put between them two instruments, and by turning the fly every time round so, it forces one of these pieces out.</p>
               <p>Court. That is the remains of the metal flatted, from which round blanks have been cut out? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What other things are there? - Here is sand paper, and cork, and here are some of these blanks, which are supposed to be shillings, and some unfinished.</p>
               <p>On those that are finished, is there any impression? - None at all, they are all round blanks, here is a pair of blank dies which I found in the cellar on the first day, I found them there while they were gone to the other house to search, here are two blank dies and two blank punches.</p>
               <p>Court. Of what use were they? - These dies appear to me to be for blank halfpence, and these punches are for this, after these round blanks have been cut out it makes them directly flat, the cutting them makes them a little round, after they have been cut out by the press; I staid at the house after the other two were gone, I saw the prisoner about a quarter of an hour after, he came to the door and I opened it, and took him into custody, and if I recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290075"/> right, he asked me if the carpenter was not at work, says I, Mr.

               <p>Do you remember seeing any body come with Wilson? - There is a man who is called his carpenter, I should know him again, I have frequently seen him, and drank with him and Mr. Wilson.</p>

               <p>When, what day, what month? - I cannot justly tell the day, it was about a month before he was taken up, when he came to me first I was at No. 9 in Lilly-street casting brass cocks, he asked me what I had a week, I told him I had twelve shillings, he said that was but a small trifle of money, if I would go and work with him he would give a good deal more money, I asked him what to do, and he said to make shillings, I agreed to go to work along with him, he took me to the house in Tennis-court,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290076"/> court, Middle-row, we cut them out with the press, and then rounded them in that press with a smooth file.</p>
               <p>Is that the press? - Yes, I can swear to that press, we first cut them out of white roll metal, that is the sort, then he turned it round while I rounded them, that is the instrument to round with, there was another piece of wood on the opposite side, and we put them between, then turned them round, and smoothed the edges with a file; then we scowered them with emery paper and cork, and then coloured them with aqua fortis; we used to go about of nights passing them about the town.</p>
               <p>Where did you leave them afterwards? - There was some in the garret chimney, and some in the cellar where the press was, them that were found in the garret chimney were left there till we came again to colour them, because we had taken as many as we wanted to colour at that time, to No. 55, Leather-lane, where we used to colour them, we did every thing but colouring them in Middle-row, and then took them to Leather-lane to colour.</p>
               <p>How many did you make in a day? - Sometimes one hundred, sometimes more or less.</p>
               <p>Have you ever coloured any in Leather-lane? - Yes, never coloured any where else.</p>
               <p>Were there any in the cellar that had actually been coloured? - Yes, some of them wanted colouring over again, so we were to colour them over again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Who has persuaded you to give this evidence against the man at the bar? - I never was persuaded by any one, I was taken up, he sent for me to New Prison on the Saturday when he was taken into custody, and told me the best way was to get the things out of the house as fast as I could, I drank two pints of beer with him there, and two gentlemen came and took hold of me.</p>
               <p>Was there no persuasion made use of to you? - None at all, but as they took me to the Justice, I told them if they would admit me an evidence, I would tell them the whole truth.</p>
               <p>You have been at the house yourself? - I was there along with him.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect making any declarations of the innocence of this man to any body afterwards? do you know a man of the name of Thomas? - There was a man named Thomas, that was to repair the windows of this house.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation with any man since the prisoner was committed? - Wilson sent a man to me in Tothill Fields. I have not had any conversation with anybody about this business.</p>
               <p>Have you never declared to anybody that the officers of Justice persuaded you to make this kind of information? - No.</p>
               <p>Never said anything of that sort to anybody? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>You knew the consequence of the crime you had been committing? - I did not at first, when I came there the Justice told me the danger I was in.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was you gave the evidence against Wilson? - I told them I would tell the whole truth if they would admit me as an evidence.</p>
               <p>You have never declared the innocence of Wilson and your own guilt? - I never declared any thing to any body.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. What are they? - Bad ones.</p>
               <p>Are they like shillings? - There are a great many such.</p>
               <p>What would you call a shilling? - A shilling.</p>
               <p>But you call it so from bearing some impression on it? - There is no impression upon these.</p>
               <p>How is it possible you can say they are bad shillings then? - I cannot to be sure, I can say they were not made at the Tower.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290077"/>I want to know of you how it is possible to say that flat piece of silver which passes as a good shilling, that that is like a shilling, you cannot furnish me with the example to which to compare it.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. Would that pass in currency? - Upon my word I cannot say, I should not take them in their present state, but I take many as bad when I do not look at them.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose whether they will pass or no depends on the degree of skill and knowledge of the subject, that a person happens to have to whom they are tendered? - Certainly, it is very difficult to say of those that have been in the mint, but it is easy to say of those that have not been in the mint, and these have not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Is it, or is it not, a familiar thing that the current coined shillings circulate till the impression is entirely defaced? - Very common, there are more so than are not I believe.</p>

Give the Jury any account for what purpose you rented that house? - I had not possession of the house three days, the key had not been delivered to me three days, there was a key, this man knows they could not find the right key to the house, and he could find no key that would fit the lock, the lock was obliged to be taken off, and no other man had possession of the house but Rowe; what he did I do not know; Rowe was to be a lodger of mine; and no other man had the possession but him, whatever was done there or carried there I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Give the Jury an account of your reasons for buying that cutting press? - Mr. Rowe asked me to buy a press of his mistress, he was a button-maker by trade, and he said, he could get his living genteelly; I parted with the press to Rowe, he was to give me so much a week for the use of it; and the rent of the room.</p>

The person informed me that Wilson was taken up with another man on suspicion of coining. He thought they were at Tothill-fields: I went down there, thinking to see Wilson: I enquired, and the keeper told me there was a person there, and when I went in he shewed me this man here: I asked him where Wilson was; he told me in Clerkenwell: I asked him what he was in custody for; he told me on suspicion of coining, he and Wilson were taken up: I enquired into the affair, and this man told me all the particulars of it; he told me he had had taken apartments of Wilson, and he was a button-maker by trade, and the people that took Mr. Wilson and him up, took the implements that he made use of, and he could not do without them in his business: I enquired afterwards whether there was any thing else found; he told me there was nothing at all found in the house but these implements; but, says he, I had got some button-tops, and I took them and hid them in a wall, and put a brick before them, and nobody knew that they were there but myself; and he declared to me that Wilson never saw them; he told me afterwards, my Lord, that it was very hard with him, and that he was very poor, and had not a shilling in the world; but he says immediately, says he, I could have money plenty if I would turn evidence, and swear Wilson's life away; and that the people that took him offered him money at different times, and told him that if he did not turn evidence he would be hanged himself; but says he, God forbid I should take an innocent man's life away, for Wilson never saw them, nor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290078"/> did not know where they were.

               <p>Now recollect yourself. You have seen her since this man was taken up: What did you go there for? - I went on no particular business.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself: Do not be in a hurry. - I did not go there.</p>
               <p>Did not you go to desire her not to appear against the prisoner? - Upon my oath, my Lord, I did not; upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>You never desired her to say that, that press was not bought of her by the prisoner? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Who went along with you to her? - There was a person along with me that went by the name of Wilson, but the conversation was nothing at all to me.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear the conversation? - I heard nothing of that conversation.</p>
               <p>Then you never heard either Mrs. Wilson say, nor you yourself never desired this Mrs. Peake not to say, that the press was bought of her? - I never did. She might; I cannot tell; but I never did.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell: Oh, I understand; it was here in the passage at the Old Bailey? - What, to-day Sir, did I say such a thing, this very day?</p>

               <p>Had you said any thing to him? - I asked, first of all, where Wilson was: he told me all as I have said. I never saw the man in my life before.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you he had described the place to the officers, and gone and shewn them where it was? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Then you did not know, at that time, that these people had got the possession of the things? - No.</p>
               <p>You do not know that buttons are the cant name for bad shillings? - I never saw any of them, so I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did not you desire Rowe to take upon himself the bottom of the house? - I never did, because I did not know that Rowe lived in the house, nor that Wilson had a house; I knew he had lodgings.</p>
               <p>You mean to say, as you did just now, that you never desired Mrs. Peake not to say that the prisoner bought the cutting-press of her? - I did see her, but I did hardly speak to her. She said she had been in the Court, and came out; and that the person that was coming to speak against Wilson was there. I said I did not want to see him. That was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Who first told you that Wilson was in custody? - I believe his name is Burgess, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>When did you first see Mr. Wilson? - I believe it might be two or three days. Nobody desired me to go. I only heard it, and was sorry to hear it. I went of my own accord. I had seen

               <p>Has he spoke to you to-day? - He said he was coming on Mr. Wilson's trial, and had a subpoena.</p>
               <p>What else? - That was all; he did not say any thing else.</p>
               <p>Then you had no conversation at all with him but that? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>You said nothing to him at all. - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then you did not tell him who was examining, or any thing of the matter? - No: he asked me if Mr. Wilson's trial was on, and I told him it was; he said he was subpoened for Wilson.</p>
               <p>And that was all that passed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Peake. What was there passed between you and him? - He said it was better for me not to say that I bought the press.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Somebody is talking to her.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. My Lord, she says, she thought she had better not mention that now.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Peake. He said, I had better not say that I sold it to the prisoner, I said, I should not say any thing that was wrong; I did sell it to Wilson; I did not sell it to anybody else.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Why would not you tell the gentlemen so at first?</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you tell us this before? - I forgot it.</p>
               <p>Who put you in mind of it? - A gentleman that stands here asked me if he did not mention the press.</p>
               <p>Who is that gentleman? - This.</p>
               <p>(Pointing to Carpmeal.)</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. My Lord, I saw her speaking to Thomas in the passage when he went away, and asked her what he had been saying to her, and she told me, and I told Mr. Vernon's clerk of it.</p>
               <p>What did you say to her now to make her recollect? - When she went down from speaking, I said to her, did not you tell me about the press? Oh Lord! says she, yes, but I thought it better not to mention it; several gentlemen about here heard her.</p>
               <p>Court to Rowe. You have heard what Thomas has said.</p>
               <p>Rowe. That gentleman came to me when I was in Tothill Fields, he asked me how I was for money, I told him, I had but little, says he, if you will say you took the lower apartments of Mr. Wilson you shall have money plenty, and if not you may stay here and starve, I cannot particularly say the day.</p>
               <p>Thomas. My Lord, so help me God, if I said any such thing,</p>
               <p>Rowe. He came in and asked for me, I asked him his business, he said, he was come to see me, I said. you are a stranger to me, says he, I am come from Mr. Wilson, do you want any money? I said, I had but very little, says he, if you will say you took the lower apartment; I will give you plenty, and if you will not you may stay here and starve.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the keeper of Tothill Fields Bridewell here? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Is any of his people here? - No.</p>
               <p>Thomas. My Lord, the keeper of the prison that shewed me in would directly contradict this man's evidence.</p>
               <p>Rowe. He called me to one corner of the prison to speak to me when he came in.</p>
               <p>Court to Rowe. Is it true that you told him, God for bid you should accuse an innocent man? - I told him that I had told the Justice the truth, and I would not tell any thing else.</p>
               <p>Thomas. He never mentioned the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. As to the objection of the Prisoner's Council about the impression on these pieces of metal, I am of opinion that a blank that is smoothed and made like a piece of legal coin, the impression of which is worn out, and yet it is suffered to remain in circulation, may be sufficiently to the similitude of the current coin of this realm to bring them within the statute; these pieces having some reasonable likeness and similitude to that coin which has been defaced, and yet passes in circulation. (The learned Judge then summed up the evidence on both sides and added.) The great question is, whether credit is due to this man (Rowe), who appears here in the light of an accomplice; and something will depend on his own manner of telling his story,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290080"/> and I confess if it is a made up story, it is wonderfully well fabricated; and with respect to Rowe's being found with Wilson in New Prison, it staggers me to believe, that the man who was alone guilty of this transaction, after the house had been ran sacked, and many of the things found, should have chosen to go into the place where an innocent man was confined, in order to talk with him about it.</p>

               <p>After calling the hour of three on the 26th of September in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man passing on the other side of the way, the prisoner with a sack on his back, I crossed to them and they walked faster, I got to the prisoner at the end of Bromley-street, Drury-lane I there attacked him, and asked him what he had got, I imagined by the answer he gave me, chips, I said, what carpenter yard is there open, he then said, it is a trifle of sugar brought from Temple-bar, and going up to St. Giles's; he then said, quarter-day is so nigh, and as I am under a little straitness, I am obliged to move, says I my friend you must go to the watch-house with me, and we went along very jocose together, he desired me not to take him to the watch-house, otherwise he should lose his goods, he then said he had brought them from Wapping, I suspected then he had brought them from the fire, he said he would satisfy me well if I would go into Church-street, the next door to the Hammer and Trowell, I said he must go to the watch-house, he then said the goods were not his own, but that a man gave him one shilling to carry them; I then passed three watchmen, I said it signifies nothing, and I was opening the bag to see the contents, and he desired me not to tumble the bag, for there was candles in it, and I should break them; he rehearsed almost every article that was in the bag, and I took him and the sack to the watch-house, I never saw him before to my knowledge? he did not make any forcible resistance.</p>

               <p>On the Thursday evening before this happened I went to Wapping to see an acquaintance, I staid drinking till after two, and at the lower end of Fleet-street I met with the young man that had the bag, the bag laid down, he asked me where I was going, I said to St. Giles's, he asked me to carry the bag and offered me a shilling, I agreed with him, he told me he lived next door to the Hammer and Trowel in Churc-street, he was along with me all the time, and when the watchman stopped me; he had before told me when I wanted to rest, to take care, for there were candles and soap, and such things in the sack, and if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290083"/> put them down, I should break them.

               <p>I live at No. 20, New Gravel-lane, Wapping. My husband is a <rs id="t17831029-26-viclabel144" type="occupation">clock-maker</rs>

A lodger of mine having gone away from my house, she took a warrant out against me for striking her, and the prisoner is the person that took me to New Prison in a coach; it was the 11th of October, about three o'clock in the afternoon, as near as I can guess: the prisoner would not give me time to stay till my husband could get bail, but he hand-cuffed me in the public-house, and while my husband was gone to get bail, he took me away; he took me away in a quarter of an hour after my husband went. I had a shilling in my hand, and I told him if he would let me stay till my husband came back, I would give him that shilling, or half a crown: I was hand-cuffed with a man, though there was nothing against me but that warrant.</p>
               <p>When did you expect your husband? - He was gone to seek a gentleman to bail me, and he could not come till the evening. My husband was out at work when the officer came to take me at my own house, and I offered to send for my husband before I went before the Justice, I was very much terrified. I had a shilling in my hand, and the prisoner took it out of my hand, and said this will get us glasses a-piece.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you did not give him the shilling? - No, I did not give it him. As we was going along the road, he called at a public-house in Long-lane; I think it might be about Barbican: he asked me if I had any more money: the chap that was hand-cuffed to me, rather shook my pocket a little, and the prisoner said, if I had as much as would pay the coach, I should not go to prison, for he was sorry for my children; and the prisoner took three shillings out of my pocket, and said, I shall bring you back from prison: I said, I am very unhappy to go to prison, because the thoughts of my children distresses me; and he said, I shall bring you back again.</p>
               <p>Court. And did he take the three shillings out of your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you give him the three shillings? - He took it from me; but if he had brought me back, I should have been willing he should have had the three shillings to pay the coach.</p>
               <p>Did he bring you back? - No; he carried me to prison hand-cuffed to the chap, and put me into the prison so: this might be about four in the afternoon, when he took me to New Prison, and my husband came about eight, with an order from the Justice to take me home.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure he took this money out of your pocket without your consent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290084"/>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Though you would have consented if he had brought you home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a house? - Yes; we have a house of ten guineas a year. I have two children.</p>
               <p>Court. There was no danger of your escaping from him? - He hand-cuffed me, my Lord, and I thought it was cruel; I thought he had no right to do that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How long did the prisoner stay to indulge you, before he carried you to New Prison? - It might be about half an hour.</p>

               <p>Did not he stay from twelve o'clock till three, waiting for your husband? - No, he did not wait half an hour for my husband; it was about two when we set off, and then we waited above an hour before we could see the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. The charge was only for an assault: this is a very material thing as I have tried this whole sessions.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. After I had done at the Justice's, he did not wait half an hour: he treated me very ill, and he put me into a nasty stinking place, where there were fellows.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Do not you know it is the common place where the Rotation Office is kept? - It was at the King's Arms, a public-house.</p>
               <p>You were in a room there, in that house? - There was the chap that came in the coach with me, and two chaps more.</p>
               <p>Did you propose any thing about bail? - Justice Green did not say any thing about bail: I think the Justice said we might go and make it up, but I am not sure: we would have had it bailed in an hour's time: the bail was not spoken of by the Justice at that time.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner take you away till Mr. Green was gone? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you drink going to prison? - Yes; I took a glass along with him in Long-lane, because he told me he should bring me back; we had a glass of gin a-piece.</p>
               <p>Did you pay any thing for the coach? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not, give him the shilling to pay for the gin? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you agree to be a quartern of gin? - No, I did not, he took the shilling out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Did not that shilling pay for the gin? - He changed it to pay for the gin, and he took the change.</p>
               <p>Did you pay any thing for the accommodation of the coach or did you not? - I did not pay any thing.</p>
               <p>Or was it agreed that the residue of that shilling and the other money should pay for your coach? - No, there was no such agreement.</p>
               <p>Court. What occasion was there to carry that woman to goal in a coach handcuffed?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I believe it is reckoned an act of humanity to put them in a coach.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a very odd act of humanity to hand-cuff people in this manner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The prisoner put a handkerchief to my mouth when he took the shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you express any dissatisfaction when you stopped to drink? did the coachman drink? - The coachman drank, I never spoke when he called for the gin, I never spoke when he changed the shilling.</p>
               <p>When did he take the three shillings from you? - About ten minutes before we came to the public house in Long Lane.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it there? - I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it at the prison? - Not then, but they put me backwards, and I mentioned it to some of the women in prison, and when my husband came I mentioned it to him, and to the young man; I went to the keeper very simply, and said, Sir, I am to go out again, and he said, no, you are to stay here now you are here, I told the keeper of it before I came out; when people are frightened they have not all their wits about them just at the time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290085"/> I spoke of it to some of the women that were there.</p>
               <p>Had you a coach from your own house to the Justice's? - No, from Shadwell to East Smithfield, Justice Green was gone from Shadwell to East Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Did you pay for that coach? - No.</p>
               <p>Did that coach wait till your examination was over? - I cannot tell that, I did not know whether the coach waited, or whether they called another when I was to go to prison I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure you begged to stay till your husband came? - I went down on my knees to him, and he handcuffed me, I was so frightened; and he kicked me all the way into the coach before him, just as if I had been a dog.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. This man did not take you from your own house? - No.</p>
               <p>You were taken up by the parish constable? - I do not know who it was, it was not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did not you make your escape from that constable? - As for making my escape, I did not think the thing was of any consequence, my husband was to get bail, and I was told I might go up to bail it at any time.</p>
               <p>You were apprehended by a lawful warrant by a constable, now I ask you simply, did you or not escape from that constable? - They gave me liberty to come home, and we were to find bail, and he said, we might come up in the evening or any other time; and then the runners persuaded the woman to take me up with another warrant.</p>
               <p>How came you before Mr. Green? - This prisoner took me there.</p>
               <p>Did not you escape from him? - No, I did not, he gave me leave to go home, and then he came and took me with a warrant again; a man came to me in the evening and told me to come up in the morning, for Justice Green advised me to make it up.</p>

             a headborough at Shadwell, for she had escaped from him: Now my Lord, the reason she did not get a warrant that way where she lives is because her name is so bad, she is so well known: So they having both escaped, I said to the man, I will marry you together.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon my word Sir, I am quite ashamed to hear things talked of in that manner, I never heard such an expression before; marrying them together by handcuffing, I never heard any thing like that in my life!</p>

               <p>Court. Did your husband refuse to have any thing to do with you or not? - No, my Lord, he is too good a husband to behave in that manner, says he to me, the man will not take you to prison before I get back, them were the words my husband said.</p>
               <p>Court. What crime was the man taken up for, to which this woman was handcuffed?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. For an assault and for making his escape, and there were three detainers laid against him for assaults.</p>

               <p>I am a coachman, I drove this coach with three people to New Prison from East Smithfield, it is three weeks ago last Saturday; there was another man in the coach, and this woman, they were hand-cuffed together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you call on the road any where? - Yes, we called in Long Lane Smithfield, on the left-hand side before you get into Smithfield, and ordered some gin.</p>
               <p>Did you see the behaviour of the people in the coach? - There was no bad behaviour, they drank together and paid for it.</p>
               <p>Did the woman drink like a woman that was refreshing herself with a glass of liquor? - I did not see her refuse it.</p>
               <p>Who paid for the liquor? - Mr. Gascoyne paid for it, I am sure he gave a shilling, I was at the coach door when they drank it, I heard no complaint, I believe he gave it to he landlord with his hand.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any objections from tho woman? - None at all, I did not know whose shilling it was, she never said a single syllable that it was her shilling, or whose it was.</p>
               <p>Did you drive them to New Prison? - From there I went upon the box and drove them to New Prison, I heard no disturbance in the coach all the way, as if a man had been robbing a woman; the windows in front were down, and the side windows, and the two prisoners sat at the back of the coach, and Gascoyne sat in the front of the coach: I should imagine I must have heard if there had been any robbery committed in the coach: When she got out of the coach she desired the prisoner to take her back; she said, I will pay the coach back, or I will satisfy any thing if you will not take me into prison.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she say, or pretend to say, that she had already paid for the coach, or any thing about it? - She did not, the prisoner said, he must take her to his master, he could not carry her back.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Was that money all you had? - I had five shillings and sixpence in my pocket when I went up to East Smithfield, and a bad sixpence, and there was a tankard of beer, and I changed the good sixpence to pay for it, I had four shillings in my pocket, and three shillings he took out, and one was got into the lining of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it altogether? - It was altogether in my pocket, but one shilling was in the lining of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Then that was all that he could come at? - Yes, that was all he could get, he could not get the other shilling, for I had much ado to find it myself when I got into prison.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him before he put his hand into your pocket and took out the three shillings, that he might take it? - No, I did not tell him any thing of taking it, I said, I had none; but after he took it, I told him, I would be content to pay the three shillings, if he would but bring me back from prison, and he promised me he would.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you had any connection with him lately? - He lived near me, and I never heard any thing amiss of him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. When were the three shillings taken from you? - About ten minutes before he called at the public-house. The shilling was taken away out of my hand before the three shillings were taken away; then we stopped at the public-house: he said that shilling would get glasses a-piece; and as he promised to bring me back, I would have been willing to have paid the coach, if he had done so.</p>
               <p>Court. There was some change of the shilling? - That he got.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. How much was the change out of the shilling for the gin? - I do not rightly know how much he got back: there were four glasses of gin.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, this is an indictment for a robbery on the highway, which is a capital offence; and the question is, whether, under all the circumstances<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290088"/> of the case, you are satisfied (for so it must be) that this hand-cuffing, and this carrying away in the coach, against the power and without the consent of the prosecutrix, whether this carrying her in a coach, when she begged not to go, was a means used by the prisoner to get this woman into his power, and under his controul, with a felonious intent of taking her money away. It is certain, that in all felonies, the mind must be guilty; and it is the inte nt with which money is taken, that must constitute the offence. It is not absolutely necessary in every robbery (though you see this was in the street on the highway) that they should be committed in the usual way, with a pistol held to the head; for if there is a means made use of colourably under a specious pretence of law, or of doing justice, when the real intent is to rob a person of their money: the robbery may be committed, though the pretence is quite for another purpose. If a man comes to your house under a pretence that he has a search-warrant, or an authority to make a distress, and you open the door, and he gets in by that means, no man that is not acquainted with law would think that was a breaking and entering; but the fact is, that if he had no search-warrant, or no right to distrain, it would be in point of law, if it was in the night-time, a burglary, and if in the day-time, it would be a breaking and entering the dwelling-house. It has been determined, that where a man charges another, or threatens to charge him, with sodomitical practices, and tells him he will carry him away to a Justice of Peace (which was the case of Fielding), he then being in the street, and being then under immediate apprehension that he would be so carried before a Justice of Peace, and charged with that crime, out of fear and terror he parts with his money; that was construed by all the Judges as an highway-robbery, because it was only trying an ingenious scheme with a fraudulent intent to get the money from him against his will, being the owner; and it was intimidating him, by threatening to carry him before a Justice of Peace. With respect to the present case, I declare, for my own part, I never did hear such an one in all my life; and I do hope, from my heart, I never shall hear such another; and the question, under the particular circumstances of this case, will be, whether there has been any thing done more than was necessary to do, to put the poor woman in that state, that it was impossible for her to make any defence; and that the prisoner could do what he pleased with her, without her being able to make any resistance. Now, what would be so effectual to secure her property, as to handcuff her? What pretence for it? The woman was only charged with an assault; no felony: no fear of her escaping from him: she was no dangerous person; she would have walked with him if he had insisted on it, without being put into a coach, and linked, as she was, to another offender, let it be who it would; but it was not to a woman, it was to a man. Now, with what sort of view, or to what intent or purpose, could this be? Could it be with a good intent? Why, you hear, as soon as he comes into the coach, he takes a shilling from her: she would have given him all she had, to let her return to her children; but he is not content with the shilling; he puts his hand into her pocket, and takes all the money he could find: - What pretence for that? Then he begins to try to soften her a little, by telling her he would give her a glass of gin, and that shilling would pay for it; then he throws out, that he would carry her back to her husband (and the coachman says she offered to give any thing in the world): then it is that she consents to his keeping that money, on those conditions. He promises to do it, but does he do it? No, he carries her immediately to gaol. But if you had been robbed on the highway, and you had promised the robber that if he would do such an act, you would consent to his keeping your money, yet that leaves it in the same state in which he took it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290089"/> without the consent of the owner. I think this is a matter to be left to you entirely, whether you think he took this money from the prosecutrix with a felonious intent, putting her in a state of incapacity to make any defence, when he thought proper to invade her property; and if you think so, then, under the circumstances of the case, I think you may find the prisoner guilty of the felony charged against him in the indictment; and if you should find him guilty, I shall take the opinion of all the Judges upon it: but if you are not satisfied in your mind and conscience, then some other mode of punishment must be found out for him; therefore, I leave it to you, If you think it was only a fraudulent scheme, a mere delusive invention of his to colour over a fraudulent and felonious intent to take her money, you may in that case find the prisoner guilty; if you are not of that opinion, you will acquit him.</p>

               <p>I live in Blue-anchor-yard. Last Saturday night was fortnight, I met a woman with a bundle; she says, Are not you a waterman? says she, What time or tide will it be high water, to go to Gravesend? She asked me to carry that bundle to Darkhouse-lane, and she would give me a shilling; she said she had to call at Fenchurch-street. I went with the bundle. Some of these watchmen stopped me: they let the woman escape: I saw her put her hand in her pocket, whether to give them any thing or not, I do not know. I said to the officer of the night, I do not know what is in the bundle, the woman has escaped, he said, I must take you to the compter, says I, I am very agreeable to go to the compter, I was brought before my Lord Mayor on the Monday, I said, I hope you will advertise, that the owners of the property may be found, and my innocence found, the next morning Box the constable and three women came to the Compter, and told me, if I could make them up the value of eight or ten pounds I should be cleared, I told them I could not, then says one of them, we shall have the reward.</p>
               <p>Court to Box. Is that true? - No, the first day he went very easy.</p>
               <p>Did you go with him to the Compter? - I went with Mr. Tisdale, they knew him by living in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Court to Box. Who went to the Compter? - Mr. Quick and these three women.</p>

               <p>When you was at the Compter, did Box propose to him as he says, that if money was advanced to him, he should be got off.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290092"/>Box. After he was committed to trial; he beat us and knocked us about, I never heard a man in my life behave so, I had occasion to go to the Compter, and I said, cannot you make your matter up, I never offered him a farthing nor asked any such a thing.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any witnesses? - No, the prosecutor came and told a friend of mine, that my trial would not come on till Friday.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you tell him so? - No, I did not, his own sister came to me and persuaded me to make it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Croker whether he did not dine with the prosecutor on Sunday? - Yes, I did go there about one o'clock, the first Sunday after the prisoner was taken up, and the prosecutor did tell me that the prisoner's sister had been there, and she said, she did not mind fifteen or twenty guineas, I said in answer, I hope you do not want to compound felony, I am sure I will not, for how should I look in a Court of Justice to give my evidence; I never saw his sister in my life.</p>

               <p>Did the last witness marry your daughter? - Yes, I had forty-five guineas in a japan box, which I saw the morning before the peace was proclaimed, I counted it on the evening of the same day a little while after my returning home, my son-in-law asked me for the keys to go to the drawers, the keys I had all the day, in my pocket, I gave them to him, he was called out by some person, and I believe he left the keys in the drawer, for I received them from my own child, he returned sometime after, I was in the parlour when he went out, and the same time this girl was in the bed-chamber making the bed, on the Wednesday morning I missed twenty guineas; upon missing it, I talked this girl as nobody had access there but her, she made some hesitation, and after some time, she said, she had not got my money; the landlady came and another lady, they said to the prisoner, Honnor, you have surely got your mistress's money, for Heaven's sake, say if you have, for she has left all in America but this little moiety; which she has left to live upon; you know she has been a good mistress to you; the girl was silent, this other lady said, that is not the way, let them have the room to themselves, perhaps she will return her mistress the money; they all retreated, and I sat down, and I told the girl to sit down; Honnor says I, consider with yourself before I take the steps which I shall, I will surely prosecute you.</p>
               <p>Court. You told her if she would confess yon would spare her? - I told her if she would confess, I would shew her as much lenity as I could, I might have said that, but I was unacquainted with the laws of the country, she upon that said, well mistress, and burst into tears, I took your money.</p>
               <p>Court. By the rules of the law I cannot examine you further as to what she said, because you gave her an expectation of favor if she discovered; therefore the law does not suffer it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Were not these the words, Honnor, if you know any thing of the money tell me, and if you have laid out eight guineas, give me the remainder, and nothing shall be done whatsoever? - I told her that if she would return me five guineas of the money, either in money or goods, I would pay her as much respect as the laws of the land would suffer me to do.</p>
               <p>Did not she tell you that twelve guineas was all the money she had taken? - Surely she did, she was known to make a purchase of a gown and two pettycoats, and a pair of stays, I had paid her no wages, for she said she was not necessitated, she came to me on the Sabbath morning, she had been with me not quite a month.</p>
               <p>Had you a good character with her? - Not so very good.</p>
               <p>How came you take her then? - When she first came to me, she passed under another name, there was a piece of deceit carried on, I was a stranger, and easily imposed on.</p>
               <p>Where is your husband? - He is at home, he came in another vessel, I came later than he, he took no account of the money.</p>

               <p>May not one hog be like another? - Yes, one man may be like another, but I am clear to the hogs as to my own brother.</p>
               <p>Should you know them among a number of others if they were mixed? - If they mixed an hundred hogs together that had no marks, it would be very difficult, but I am very positive I could pick out two of them.</p>

I said well, we must have a drop of beer first, and we had a pot of beer, and when I had sat a minute, I said, now I will go and get my man to light the copper fire, I went out to seek for Dinmore, and at last I found him.</p>

             to put some wine down in the cellar, and I saw a man looking over the bannisters, as I stood at the cellar door. My mistress was in the shop. I came up, and he asked me if Mr. Thompson lived there: I said, Mr. Thompson; no: I asked him what business he had there: I saw the salt-spoon lay on the carpet, through the crack of the door in the dining-room, with some salt spilt, which made me answer him so. He then ran by me, and ran out. I then saw the prisoner at the bar in the dining-room, towards the beaufet. When the prisoner came out of the door, I caught hold of his waistcoat, and cried, Stop thief! He turned round, and damned me for a bitch: what did I mean by that? and he hit me three times on the head with a stick. I was obliged to let him go, and he went out; and Mr. Reeves came up, and followed him: he did not come up in time to stop him in about twenty minutes he brought him back.</p>
               <p>Who was in the house besides your mistress, and you, and Reeves? - There was one Mrs. Elton in the next room. The door was shut. She was laid down.</p>
               <p>What is her Christian name? - I believe Elizabeth.</p>
               <p>How did these people come in? - I am sure I shut the door about five minutes before, and they must lift up the latch.</p>
               <p>Might not different people come in and go out from that time? - No.</p>

I did not come up immediately; then she called again, and I ran up: I ran with other people into Castle-yard. We have chambers in Staple's-inn, over our shop, which is at Holborn-bars. I turned round, and the prisoner turned round, and asked me what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Was he running, when you first saw him? - I did not see: I laid hold of him by the collar; says I, You villain, you have robbed me.</p>
               <p>How came you to think he was the man? - Because I had heard such kind of things; that when they have robbed, they will ask such questions; so I put my hand in his pocket, and found a cream-jug, a pair of salts, a table-spoon, and one salt-glass.</p>

               <p>Was that your mare? - I am certain she was. I have had her twelve months. She was a dun mare, with a black mane and tail; a long tail, and it was cut smooth even off at the bottom. I am positive to the mare. There was a remarkable scar on her withers: she was what they call three years old off.</p>

I told him I thought the mare would not suit me. I examined her, and found her perfectly sound. I enquired of the hostler how the mare came there: the hostler told me that he had brought no saddle with the mare, but he had an old bridle to put in the withers. He said he had broke his girths, and he had left it at the collar-maker's at Hounslow to be mended, and said he told the man to get it mended against he came back. I consented to lend him a saddle, and I stood in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290097"/> stable while they put a pair of stirrups to it. I asked him where he was going: he told me he was going into Hertfordshire, to find one Farmer

I told him Hertfordshire was a pretty extensive county, and he would be a good while before he found his friend out, and I could not spare my saddle: he said I had value enough. He wished again to sell the mare: I told him it would not do for me, and he went away. As soon as he was gone, the hostler came in and said, Sir, that man has cut part of the mare's tail off in the stable: I went in, and found he had scraped part off with a knife, and made her tail more of a switch. I then said, catch my horse immediately; I put on my boots and spurs, and followed him with a pistol in my pocket, and overtook him on this side of the Five-mile-stone, near to the

               <p>Then it must appear to you to be a very recent injury? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>You said just now you understood it to be occasioned by the bit of the bridle being upon her back? - There was a scar upon the wither, and she was very tender upon it.</p>
               <p>There was nothing at all appeared particular in this mare more than others? - Yes, she is a slim mare, and a gentle mare, and she is rather heavy under the jaws, she was a dun mare with a black mane and tail, the prisoner told me she was four years old, and he bought her at three, I told him she was no such thing.</p>

Pybus and Co. he said, it was accepted by the bankers in Bond-street, and was as good as a bank note, I took the bill and looked at it, and at first sight it appeared to be very feasible as a country bill, and I let him have three pair of buckles, which he promised to return in a quarter of an hour, he told me, he was going to the gentleman in Newgate-street, at the Horse-shoe, who was to chuse out a pair, and he left this bill as security for the buckles, he never returned, that led me to suspect it was not right, accordingly on the Monday morning, I went to the bankers, and they said it was a bad bill, the prisoner was taken that day week, he was apprehended for something else, I saw him about fourteen days afterwards at Bow-street; I knew him perfectly.</p>
               <p>How long was he with you when he left the draft? - About a quarter of an hour or ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Could you take so particular notice of him during that time as to know him again? - Yes, he endeavoured to make himself known to me, but whether I did know him before I do not know, I have not the least doubt of him now.</p>
               <p>When you saw him at the office did you charge him with it? - He had been charged with it before, he said, he took the draft as a good draft.</p>

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Mr. RUNNINGTON Council for the Prosecution thus opened the case.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>
               <p>You will favor me with your attention, as council on the part of this prosecution, and gentlemen, the offence with which the prisoners stand charged, is for feloniously stealing nine promisory notes, each of the value of ten pounds, and a bill of exchange of the value of above two hundred pounds; it behoves me likewise to state to you gentlemen, that this is an offence created by act of parliament, for until the reign of King George II. the stealing of instruments of this complection was not felony; the facts I have to state to you, are simply of this description: Messrs. Cotton and Gooch, who live at Yarmouth, were in possession of certain bank notes, nine of which are stated in the indictment, and a bill of exchange, all payable in London, those nine promisory notes, and this bill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290100"/> of exchange they remitted, as was their usual custom, through the medium of the Yarmouth coach, on the 22d day of January last; the remittance was made in the usual way by a parcel directed to Mr. Lee, in London, he being their agent and correspondent in this town.</p>
               <p>On the 23d of January, I am given to understand, about the hour of four in the afternoon, the Yarmouth coach arrived, and from every circumstance attending that conveyance on the 22d and 23d of January, there is every reason to apprehend and firmly to believe that this parcel arrived safely at the Green Dragon inn, in Bishopsgate, that being the inn where this coach usually puts up in this town: arriving at this inn, Mr. Lee who had had two informations of the parcel as early as he could, he made very diligent inquiry for the parcel, but it was not forthcoming, and he soon found it had been stolen, but was ignorant how it had been stolen; the parties themselves likewise remained ignorant of the truth of the transaction till the month of August last: in the month of August, this matter having slept from January till that month, they received information from a party, who, I am very ready to confess, is not of very immaculate description, but they received information sufficient for them to be active and enquiring about the felony that had been committed on these promissory notes; they were given to understand that this parcel with the notes had come into the possession of the prisoners at the bar, and, I am sorry to remark to you, Gentlemen, that the unhappy men at the bar, are, as stated to me, brothers; that they are sons to a man who is book-keeper to the Green Dragon inn; and a fact which I am now to state to you, is simply this; that on the 23d of January, these young men, the prisoners at the bar, sent for one Barnett, the party to whom I just alluded, and sending for him, he was in company at that time with one Hart, and which Hart I am likewise very ready to confess is not of that correct line of conduct that I could wish him to be; Hart going to Barnett, Barnett was given to understand, that the Jordans wanted to speak to him.</p>
               <p>The Jordans, I understand, are the unhappy men at the bar, and that what they wanted with him was a matter of private concern; it was therefore intimated that it ought not to be communicated in the presence of a third person.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Barnet on this hinted that Hart was a friend of his; on that they immediately, or at least one of them, applied to Barnet, producing the notes now in question, and desiring him to get those notes paid, offering at the same time to him a very considerable inducement to the amount of 100 l. for the purpose of getting the cash. Barnet, of whatever address he might be in circumstances of this sort I know not, but he thought proper at the moment to make application to Hart the witness. All this, you see, Gentlemen, was in the presence of both the prisoners at the bar, and of Hart the witness. Hart, I understand, accepted this part of the business: he took the nine notes of ten pounds each; he took the bill of exchange of 200 l. and undertook, at the same time, to get cash upon them all.</p>
               <p>The nine notes, which were payable on demand, were upon the 24th day of January sent to the banker's house in London, the house of Messrs. Bevan and Co. in Lombard-street, and were there paid. The moment the money was received, it was given by Hart to Barnet, and by Barnet to the prisoners at the bar, in the presence of Hart, and for which I understand Barnet received a compensation upon the nine notes of thirty or thirty-five guineas.</p>
               <p>You will now, Gentlemen, entertain of the conduct of Hart, I am very well convinced, no very favourable opinion; but if he should appear to you and to the learned Judge upon the Bench in the light of an accomplice, you will recollect, Gentlemen, that he will at the most only be an accomplice after the fact was committed, notwithstanding what may have been his former conduct; and you will at least bear one thing in your minds and recollections, that in all transactions of this description, were it not for the communications of men under these bad habits and tempers of mind, very few individuals would be brought to this bar, and very few public crimes would be brought to public punishment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if the evidence of Hart should require corroboration, it is stated to me that his evidence can be corroborated by the evidence of a woman who was present at the time, when the information was given to Barnet to attend the persons of the prisoners at the bar, and who was likewise present at the time that the money was paid. If this evidence should satisfy you, I am apprehensive the fact will be sufficiently corroborated; but if you have a doubt of the evidence, if you think Hart unworthy of your attention, you will pay it no attention, and this prosecution must drop to the ground. But if, from the whole complexion of the case, you are satisfied there is some criminality in the defendants<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290103"/> you will call on them to shew how these notes were received; and if they do by evidence to your satisfaction prove themselves guiltless of the charge, independent of the evidence of this woman and Hart, much, to be sure, may not then rest upon their evidence. But I am instructed to say that that there are two other witnesses to be produced, not incorrect in their conduct, and altogether unknowing of any part of the transaction: they will not, I confess, go to the great line of the prosecution, but they will go to some of the minute parts of it. I have the evidence of the porter whom Hart procured to receive the money of the bankers, and who received the money upon the nine promissory notes at the banking house, and paid that money to Hart. I have likewise another witness of a similar description, who took the 200 l. bill of exchange, meaning to get it for payment; but not being conversant in business, and it being only for acceptance, the bill was stopped.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if upon the whole of this case you are satisfied in your own minds and consciences that the prisoners at the bar are guilty, you will discharge your duty and your consciences, and find them so: if, on the other hand, you think the evidence doubtful, if you think it ought not to be received, you will then exercise the other part of your conduct, and acquit them.</p>

               <p>I am one of the proprietors of the Yarmouth coach, I live at Braintree, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290104"/> is on this side Bury, it stops there to breakfast.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the coach coming to Braintree on the 23d of January last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect on that day any parcel being in that coach, directed to Mr. Lee of London? - Yes, Sir, very well, I took notice of the parcel, and read the directions, it was a small parcel, but whether it was brown or whitish brown paper, I can-recollect.</p>
               <p>Had you it in your hand? - I had, I took it up, and read the directions.</p>
               <p>After you had taken it up, to whom did you deliver it? - I laid it down upo n the rest of the parcels that lay in the yard, and I told the man who was loading the coach to be very particular in it, for I believed it to be a parcel of value.</p>
               <p>What might induce you to think that a parcel of value? - We frequently have those parcels from Mess. Gouch and Cotton to Mr. Lee; Mr. Lee was then I believe a banker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Being a parcel of value, as you thought, you laid it down on the other parcels that were in the yard? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that the way that you do with parcels of value? - Yes, the man was putting them in the coach.</p>
               <p>How many parcels were left behind that day? - Ten or eleven, but never a paper parcel.</p>
               <p>The others I hope were not parcels of value? - The coachman made a mistake, he unloaded his boot, and he left the guard to unload the remainder.</p>
               <p>Whether this parcel contained bank papers or any other papers, you do not know? - No.</p>
               <p>Or whether any thing had been taken out you do not know? - No, this is not one of the parcels that was left behind.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - By seeing the parcels in the way-bill.</p>
               <p>Then you only speak by the way-bill; but supposing any body had come in and taken one out of the yard, did not you think it very odd that these gentlemen should keep you from your proper due, by paying for this as a parcel of no value? - They commonly did so; they run the hazard.</p>
               <p>Who re-loaded the coach? - The guard did; he alone was the person that re-loaded the coach, not the coachman. We change horses sometimes, but not coaches. It stops no where to breakfast near town; they breakfast at Braintree, and come to London to dinner.</p>
               <p>Who had you in the coach that day? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How many had you? - Five from Braintree in the inside of the coach.</p>
               <p>What became of them? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Nor where the parcel was put? - I was informed by the guard it was put in the seat of the coach.</p>

               <p>Do you remember the coach bringing you on the 23d of January? - Yes: it stopped at the White Hart. I shifted the parcels. I recollect there were several parcels, papers, and others.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any parcel directed for Mr. Lee? - Yes, vastly well; I took it out of one coach, and put it into the other: I put it into the seat of the coach. It was a small parcel, as broad as my hand, inclosed in whitish-brown paper, directed for Mr. Lee: I saw no other parcel directed for him. My master came into the yard, and took up the parcel, and gave it to me, and said, Bob, take care of this, it comes to my friend Lee, and is of consequence. I put it in the fore seat of the coach, at the near corner, and came with the coach. We stopped first at the Angel at Rumford, to change horses; but nobody got out.</p>
               <p>Court. Could the coach seats be opened without all the passengers got out? - No: I came with the coach to London.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290105"/>Mr. Fielding, another of the prisoners Council. How many parcels were left behind at Braintree that day? - I cannot say. The coachman that drove there was coming to London: this man took some parcels out of the boot of the coach, and he bid me unload the coach. He took out five or six parcels. I suspected he had got every thing out. I never looked into the boot.</p>
               <p>Who were the people in the coach that day? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was not there a woman in the coach? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect whether there was a woman in the coach, or whether they were all men; that you do not know: Did you set any body down at Houndsditch? - Yes, a young woman; we took her up, and set her down at Houndsditch; she was an outside passenger. I do not recollect there was a woman in the coach.</p>

               <p>How long have you been guard to this coach? - Ever since the first of last September was a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect, now, in which seat of the coach you happened to put this parcel? - In the fore seat, next the horses.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the directions of any other parcels that came to the coach that day? - No; I have no business to look at the parcels: I should not have had any particular knowledge of that, if it had not been for my master.</p>

               <p>When did you miss the parcel in question? - As soon as ever I went into the warehouse, our book-keeper said here is a paper parcel missing, and I am afraid it is something of value.</p>
               <p>(The way-bill produced and read.)</p>
               <p>"A parcel directed to Mr. Lee, and one paper parcel directed to No. 10, and to take 1 s." - and the parcel was missing.</p>
               <p>Court. I see here are 9, 10, and 11 missing? - I came from Bury that morning, and I was obliged to come all the way to London; I desired the guard to unload the coach while I went home, and I took out five articles to put down in the weigh-bill: the guard thought I had unloaded the whole boot. When we first called them over, those three were missing.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. Did the other parcels arrive at any time? - They came by our coach the next morning, and all right.</p>
               <p>This parcel did not come, directed to Mr. Lee? - If it was put into the coach it came: I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. In what manner is the way-bill made out when the things are loaded? - We always call them over as we take them into the coach; the book-keeper makes out the bill, and numbers the parcels.</p>
               <p>Are the parcels numbered when they are booked, or when they are loaded? - When they are booked.</p>
               <p>When you load the coach, do you call them over by the number, and load them by the number; as thus, No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, regularly? - Yes, that is our usual way.</p>
               <p>Are not the numbers that stand next to one another in the way-bill, loaded next to one another in the coach? - That is according to the size of them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290106"/>Court. Then the number in the waybill is taken from the book, and not as they put them into the coach? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Because the three numbers that follow one another appear all to be missing: of what kind is your coach-seat? - The seat turns up after the cushion is taken off: there is a flap like a box-lid; it is not locked; we only lay the cushion over it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what number of passengers you carried up from Braintree? - Five from Braintree, and one at Mr. Wood's, which made six. I do not remember any getting out, but one at a time. I had never less than four in the coach at one time.</p>
               <p>Then the coach-seat could not be lifted up so as to put a hand in without the knowledge of all the people in the coach? - It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You never saw the parcel? - No.</p>

               <p>Then upon your oath, you do not know that Barnet and Hart took these notes themselves? - I do not, I never intended to have any thing to do with it upon my oath, Barnet was the man that brought the notes to the house, and Hart and Barnet went together.</p>

               <p>My Lord, in the first place, I declare to God, and I hope never to receive mercy of God or man, if I ever saw this man or woman (Hart and Canter) before I saw them in the Compter: I have witnesses here to prove that they did declare that they never saw me nor my brother; and as to my brother he is a pensioner, I do not believe I saw him from the time he took his pension for a month after; then I was very ill in bed of the rhuematism; which I have four or five times a year; as to being at the inn, I might, it is my duty as assistant to my father: if my oath was granted I should be ready to take it.</p>

               <p>Council for the Prosecution. Did you hear the name of the acquaintance? - He was a stout lusty man, a Jew, I could recollect his name if I heard it.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was it that said there were two other prisoners that would pay garnish? - One of the debtors in the prison.</p>
               <p>How could they know that there were two others coming? - Because the Turnkey informed us that they were coming over to the Master's-side of the prison, by reason one was very lame: So I paid the money, and very merry they were all together; we sat up till one or two o'clock.</p>

I ran out of the back parlour into the passage; she said, the thief was gone out of the window; I ran into the street to pursue the thief, presently I saw a number of people coming to the top of the street out of Coventry-street, and going nearer towards them, I saw the prisoner at the bar, and a servant of Capt. Hazard's bringing the prisoner along with several others; I assisted to take him to Litchfield-street Office, he was examined and committed.</p>

             the mantua-maker. When I went into the prisoner's fore-parlour, I saw one of my wife's gowns lying in the parlour, either in a chair or on the table: I laid hold of it, and said, You are a rascal, you have robbed me in this distressed situation. The woman prisoner, who was sitting, was struck with fear, and immediately ran past me into a back parlour; I pursued her to the door of that back parlour, and she had locked it: I could not get in: I told her she had more of my property there, and I insisted on being admitted, or I would break the door open. The door was opened; but whether I burst it open, or she opened it, I cannot say. When I got in, the woman had something tied in a white sheet, shoving it under the bed, or into a chest. I took it from her, and I opened the bundle, and found there a silk gown, and one or two silk petticoats, and some other articles, which I cannot now recollect everyone: I know them to be mine. She threw herself on the bed, and pretended to be very bad, and would not get up. I lifted up the pillow, which was under her head and shoulders, and under it I found a black silk gown belonging to my wife.</p>
               <p>Where was the man all this time? - He was wrangling with me, threatening to prosecute me for coming into his house in that manner, for I had no warrant; I had no time to get one. I was very well known in the neighbourhood, and I gave a constable charge of the prisoners, and of the property. The prisoners were in a good deal of confusion when the things were found; they said the things were Mr. Cochran's, and they believed them to be his property, and they saved them for him: he was my next door neighbour.</p>
               <p>How far did the prisoners live from you? - They lived in Anchor and Hope Alley, about a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Prisoner William. Whether I denied the goods, when he came into my house? Whether I did not fetch them to him when he demanded them? - No, he did not: after we found them, he did not pretend to deny them.</p>
               <p>Did not my wife bring the gown, and your spouse fetch the cuffs, and compare them to it? - That I cannot say. After we found the property, he told me to stay till Mr. Cochran came; and the moment he came, he laid hold of him, and said he was a rascal, and had robbed him at the fire: he said he had some knowledge of the prisoner before, and he came to his house to assist him at the fire, and had one or two loads from him. None of my things were in Mr. Cochran's house. I never saw the prisoner till I went into his house.</p>

               <p>I am a mantua-maker. I never saw the prisoner William till he came to the house where I was, and asked me if I would alter his wife some gowns; that was on the second of this month. I went with him to his house to speak to his wife about them, and he desired his wife to get me those gowns; she brought me one, and desired me to make it less; I told her I would do it: she wanted two done against Sunday, but I could not do them, and then she took one away. The gown that she shewed me was a blossom-coloured silk. I promised them to go the next day. I well knew they were not their own property, by reason I made the gowns for Mrs. Richardson, and nobody knew them better, excepting the owner. She shewed me one gown which I made, and a petticoat which I knew perfectly well: it was lined in the inside with the remains of two gowns that I had made. Mrs. Richardson made the petticoat herself. I went to Mr. Richardson, and gave information.</p>

               <p>I went with Mr. Richardson and he mantua-maker to the house of these prisoners, on the second of October. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290116"/> woman prisoner said, here are people in the house, the man prisoner sat in the chair, and would not stir at first; then he got up, and said, where is the warrant? where is the officer? I said, there is no occasion for a warrant, here is the the property: the gown and petticoat were behind the door. Richardson followed the woman into the next room; the door was locked; we got in and the man said the things belonged to Mr. Cochran; and he took out a gown, a pair of stays, a peticoat, and sundry other little articles; then Mr. Richardson took out a shirt. The bundle was just closed up at the time of the fire, and carried down stairs by their own people: they are not here.</p>
               <p>Court. How could these people get at the bundle? - When the fire came on so rapidly, they took it out of the back shop, and carried it down the rope-walk. When Cochran came, he flew at the prisoner with his fist, and said, You villain, you have robbed me.</p>
               <p>( The things deposed to by Mrs. Richardson.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER WILLIAM's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The night the fire broke out I was in bed. I heard the alarm, I put on part of my clothes, and told my wife I would go to Mr. Cochran's assistance, as he had been my friend. I went, and the door was shut. I stopped some time opposite to his house before the fire approached towards it. When the door was opened, I asked him if he wanted any assistance; he told me to take out some of the things in the front part of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. How did you come by these things? - When the fire went on, and Mr. Cochran's things were burnt, I came, endeavouring to get some of his things, and I could not get in. I turned back again, and the houses were on fire on both sides of the street. I ran back, and turned myself round, and this bundle fell from a window, which I supposed to be Mr. Cochran's, and I plucked it out of the water, and carried it home to my house, where part of Mr. Cochran's goods lay. I had just come home from the West-Indies. The next morning I went on board the ship, and I told my wife to deliver those things to Mr. Cochran and nobody else, without they proved their property. I went up to where the mantua-maker's daughter was, and I asked her daughter if she knew how to make a bed-gown or an under-gown for my wife, and her mother came down with me. I had lodged in the house where the mantua-maker lived.</p>
               <p>How came you to want these things, that you knew were not your own, altered for your wife? - I never mentioned any thing of the kind to the mantua-maker. What passed between my wife and her I am ignorant of.</p>
               <p>The prisoner William called two Witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the prisoner Jane is stated to be the wife of the other prisoner, and all the evidence that has been given in this case, affects her only jointly with her husband; there is no proof of her doing any separate act which the husband was not present at; therefore I am of opinion, that she is entitled to the privilege which the law gives to married women.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you see him do it? - My servant served him, I know nothing about it, my servant told me he had got something, he agreed for some clothes, and he desired a bill might be made out, and he would go to his master and fetch the money, then he went out, and I asked the man if he was sure he had any thing about him, he said he was positive he had a waistcoat in his breeches; I sent my man after him, he was upon the run, and he brought him back into the shop, and then he whipped out a white shirt out of his breeches, and laid it on some goods, and Mr. Marden the constable, who was there, went backwards and searched him, and found the waistcoat in his breeches.</p>

               <p>A neighbour and me went down at Well-close-square to see the fire, and as we were coming up into Neptune-street, we saw the prisoner go by with this heavy load, I was with two neighbours that are not here, somebody behind said, I believe that is a thief, and I said if I thought he was I would run and catch him; there was a woman in the street that a gentleman here had desired her if she saw any body go with heavy loads to cry stop thief, I run as fast as I could, and overtook the man. Mr. Sayer and Mr. Hind had caught the man before I came up, but the bag was not off his back, when I came up to him: we were up with him almost together: I am sure the prisoner is the man; this gentleman asked him where he got the things, and he said No. 17, I believe, but there is no such number in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. He says now No. 17.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There is such a number. Mr. Hind went to enquire for it.</p>
               <p>Benger. Then Mr. Nicholls the constable of the night came up and took the bundle away to his house: when Mr. Hind and Sayer had taken care of the prisoner, they came back to me and I went to Nicholls's house, and there was the bag tied up; this is the same bag. I have known Mr. Sayer several years.</p>

               <p>I had these these things in my custody, I was the officer of the night, I took several other things that night into my custody, and they have been in my possession ever since; I looked at the bag, and being part new and part old, I observed it was what we call a thief's bag, I know the prosecutor well, I am of the same business, and I said these are poor Davy Richardson's things, I went to him next morning, and informed him where he might find them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Hind. Whether he did not meet me in Virginia-street, where I was employed by a man to carry this bundle, and he offered me one shilling to carry it to his other shop in Rosemary-lane? -</p>
               <p>Hind. He said he would not go at first without an authority, I told him every man had an authority to take a thief.</p>
               <p>- SAYER sworn.</p>
               <p>I assisted in taking the prisoner. When we first took him he said No. 72; I am sure he said so at first: at the watch-house: he said No. 17.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No. 72 was the number of my house in Wapping. I have no shop in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>Hind. When he said it was 17, I said you said 72 before; he said he did not: then I gave it up, for I had my doubts.</p>
               <p>Sayer. I have no doubt in it at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had witnesses last night, when I was called up, and my trial postponed, but I have none this morning: they would have proved my character and every thing.</p>

I was at work at a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290120"/> neighbour's house when the things were taken away; between one and two I went home. My room door was loc ked when I left it, and when I found it. I found the prisoner in the room when I unlocked the door. I found the property with him folded up in the great coat. I left the property in the box, and when I came in it was laying on the floor. The prisoner was in by the property. It is a one pair of stairs room. The window was shut when I left it, and so I found it. I never saw the prisoner before: he had no business in my room: I cannot tell how he got in; I stopped him; he was searched. I had but one key to the door. The prisoner was taken by a man that was coming along Rosemary-lane, and he vowed and protested he would do for us all if he got through the hobble.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - I was a sailor.</p>
               <p>Have you any friends? - None in London.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The felony depends upon whether you believe that this man got into the room for the purpose of stealing the things; that he took these things out of the box, and put them into the great coat for the purpose of carrying them off.</p>

               <p>I was driving the Marlow waggon from London, going into Smallbury Green, on the 1st of October, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I got into the waggon to ride, and I put my hand into a hamper, and caught hold of a man's hand, and it slipped from me like a bird; I looked into the hamper, and the hamper was empty. I did not see the man at all. I got down from the waggon, and I said, I am robbed from head to stern. Says a post-boy, who came by just after, What is the matter, farmer? Says I, I have lost sugar and sugar-loaves. Says the post-boy, there is

            . I am a stranger to him: I never saw him by daylight to my knowledge, but when he was at Bow-street, I followed him and stopped the cart; then some people took to the cart, and ran after him. I do not know who it was; it was in the middle of the town, and they brought back a cart with two sugar-loaves, and a quarter of a hundred of sugar. The cart was stopped at the Bell at Hounslow: the man, as I understood, jumped out of the cart, and went away.</p>
               <p>Whose sugar was this? - It was Webster and Montague's.</p>
               <p>How did you know it? - By the direction there is upon it.</p>
               <p>Was it part of the sugar that had been in your hamper? - Yes. Nobody pursued after him that night. I lay at Hounslow: I was afraid to go any further. I gave information at Bow-street next day, and the next week after, as I came through the turnpike at Smallbury Green, the turnpike man said to me, Aldridge, you may have your goods again.</p>
               <p>Whose cart was that that was brought back? - It was left in the custody of a person at Hounslow; the cart was one Bennet's, as I heard: he came and fetched the cart away; it has his mark upon it: it is written upon the wood,</p>

I was stooping to take it up, and a neighbour of mine says, South, what are you at? they are hallooing stop thief up the town; he has robbed somebody. I threw down the paper parcel again; the man ran out into the road, and cried, Come along, here he is. In the mean time the prisoner jumped out of the cart, and ran away.

When I came to Smallbury Green, the farther end, it was about ten, and very dark, and there was a man had overturned his cart, and an hostler had brought out a light, and helped him up with his cart. The hostler came to me, and said, Do not you know who it is? I said, Yes, I know who it is, very well; it is Mr. Frame; I have known him some years: I says to him, Mr. Frame, where are you going at this time of night? he said to Hillington. There were two loaves of sugar that I saw lie on the ground, and he put them into the cart, to the best of my remembrance: he then says to the landlord and his hostler, Come, we will go and have something to drink. I kept on in my chair, and overtook a man in his waggon: I hallooed out, says I, Farmer, what is the matter? He said he had been robbed from head to stern. I asked him what he had lost, and he told me he had lost sugars and other things; he did not know what. Says I, there is Frame has just overturned his cart, and I saw two loaves of sugar in the road. I went back with him at his request to Huggins, the landlord's, and just within ten yards, I met the prisoner coming on for Hounslow in his cart, the waggoner went to the house, says he I have been robbed, and this post-boy tells me it is the man that has overturned his cart, I drove on and got before him within an hundred yards of Hounslow, the man jumped off to lay hold of his horse, he whipped his horse and ran off, and I followed him crying stop thief, stop the cart, and the cart was brought back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. At the publick-house he was drinking with Huggins, after that you kept on? - I did not stop at all, the waggon was three hundred yards off.</p>
               <p>You do not know how long he had been there before? - No.</p>

               <p>But in your lenity to the prisoner, you informed him that if he would give a clue to the goods, he should receive favor? - He said, I had been the best of masters, and he would tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Do not you apprehend he expected favor? Was not he threatened by the Magistrate? - The Magistrate behaved exceedingly well throughout the business, and that you said yourself: You said, he knew the law very well.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of September, I think it was on the Wednesday, I went out to dinner, I left my son a child between nine and ten o'clock in the shop, I returned about five; I left nobody but him with a particular charge, which I gave him from the time he had been with me in the shop, always to keep the shop door locked, and to admit nobody into the shop on any account, but those he knew; when I returned I missed off one of the hooks a watch; I did not know then that it was a gold one, I happened to have a good many watches of other peoples, and several going abroad, and I did not miss any of them; the child replied, papa it cannot be, you must have hung them up contrary to your usual method, for nobody has been here, I was clear in my own opinion that a watch was missing, though I could not ascertain what watch it was; I told the child he must be mistaken, for somebody must have been in the shop, I told him particularly to tell me the real truth, that I might be easy in my mind, for I was confident a watch was missing, though I could not ascertain which; after that the child confessed he recollected that a Black had been in the shop; after that I did not find the watch, nor did I ascertain this gold watch, which was my own property till Friday; on Friday came a messenger from Mr. Heather, the pawnbroker, in Long-acre, I then looked over my books, and I found this watch missing, which had the maker's name of Darwood.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it was by the examination of your books that you found this watch was wanting? - No other way, Sir, I ascertained the name; I have had that watch in my possession about three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Court. In that time you have sold several watches? - Yes, but I did not mean to sell that in the state it was, I meant to chase it, or to engrave it, I am perfectly sure to the watch, I am perfectly sure I had not sold it.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body that sells for you besides yourself? - Nobody, I always examine all my watches in the morning when I go out.</p>
               <p>Court. Yes, but you was not able to ascertain which watch it was till you examined your book? - I was clear in my own opinion that a watch was taken from off that pin, and there was no other missing but that; I am perfectly clear there had been a watch on that pin, I knew the watch immediately, there was one of my papers in it, which was the cause of Mr. Heather so readily sending to me; I know nothing of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290129"/> the prisoner, I never saw him till I saw him before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Prisoner's Council. Your watches were hanging as all watches are? - Yes, in the window.</p>
               <p>You know it is usual, when people come into a shop to take down sometimes one watch, and sometimes another? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Now your son sometimes moves a watch? - No, he is particularly ordered never to move them.</p>
               <p>That is another thing, he is but a boy; boys do not always do as they are bid? - No, I believe they do not, I am sure they do not.</p>
               <p>Whether the watch had been moved by any body when you was in the shop you cannot tell? - O then I am sure nobody moved it.</p>
               <p>Why? - Because I do not suffer any body to touch the watches but myself.</p>
               <p>No! why but if I was to come into your shop? - If you was a stranger, I certainly should not permit you to do it; I should say, Sir, if you will give me leave to take it off, for sometimes the watches stick.</p>
               <p>Yes, but from a man's appearance, you would be cautious of saying a rude thing? - Certainly, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know from your own knowledge, how the watch got out of your custody at all? - I have said it, Sir.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday the 17th of September, about four or five in the afternoon, the prisoner brought this watch to pledge with me; he wanted a guinea and a half on the watch, seeing him a Black I opened the watch, and perceiving it was gold, I asked him what he gave for it, he said he gave two guineas and a half for it, I knowing he could not purchase it for that, stopped him, and took him to the Public Office in Bow-street, and he was committed; on the Friday a very humane good lady, whom the Black had lived with, and in whose family he and five other brothers were born, promised him if he would tell the truth, where he got the watch, she would do all that she could for him; in consequence of the lady's promise, he said, at the Royal Exchange, but I do not believe he knew the house; he was never out of custody after that, I have no doubt of the identity of the man.</p>
               <p>(The watch deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, I submit to your Lordship that this is evidence arising from the man's own confession, and it is in consequence of promised favor to him he discovered where he had the watch from, in consequence of that discovery, the prosecutor is found out.</p>
               <p>Court to Heather. Was there a paper of Mr. Storr's in the watch? - After he said he took it from the Royal Exchange, then I guessed, seeing Mr. Storr's name in the inside, I then thought it was Mr. Storr's.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Sylvester. I do not conceive the rule of law with respect to confessions made upon promises, to extend to all facts connected with those confessions; if it did, it would shut out all evidence, but it only shuts out the confession being given in evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Nares. The objection you made I think is such as ought always to be made where faith is given, and where a poor man depends upon promises made, where he makes discoveries by which his life may be taken away; but I think this case stands abstracted from that; for here is a watch lost by Storr, here is a watch brought by the prisoner to Heather, and by him taken from the prisoner; and abstracted from any thing else, there is evidence enough to go to the jury, because Storr says that is his watch that he lost between three and five, and this was the watch that was offered to be pawned between four and five the same day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder: The evidence in this case derives no advantage from the confession whatever; we do not know that the prisoner made any confession.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290130"/>Mr. Justice Nares to Heather. Who was the lady that appeared? - One Mrs. Weale, the Rev. Dr. Weale's lady.</p>
               <p>Court to Storr. What age is your boy? - Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>How old are you little boy? - Nine years and four months.</p>
               <p>Have you learned your catechism? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard the nature of an oath upon the Bible? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know the consequence of speaking falsely and telling a lye afterwards? - Going to the Devil.</p>
               <p>And do you know you are liable to be punished here if you speak an untruth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>SWORN.</p>
               <p>Court. What happened after your father left you at home in the shop, did any body come in? - Yes that Black.</p>
               <p>You do not know him? - I knew the Black again.</p>
               <p>Did you see the man take the watch off the hook? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you see him about the hook? - No, I only saw him sit down by the desk, he sat down, and he said, he came from a Captain to speak to my father to take me on board a ship.</p>
               <p>How long did he stay in the shop? - He staid about half an hour, he came once before that, then he called about half an hour after, and said, he must stay to speak to my father, I cannot say I saw him take it.</p>
               <p>You think that was the person that came into the shop? - Yes, I am sure it is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How came you not to tell your father of it? - I did not recollect him then, I did not recollect that any body had been in.</p>
               <p>No! why when did your father come in? - I suppose my father came in about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>What o'clock was the Black there? - First at three, and then half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Did not you recollect either of the times? - No.</p>
               <p>Now was it not because you was affraid to let your father know the watch was stolen? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You see your father questioned you two or three times, very minutely, and at last you told him, was not it because you saw it go, and was affraid to tell him? - I did not see it go.</p>
               <p>My dear boy, what was you affraid of? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell him? - Because I did not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you any suspicion that any thing was stolen at all? - None at all.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner sixteen years, his general character is a very good one, he was a slave to my father in the West-Indies; the whole family of them belonged to me, he bore a good character, during that time, he lived with me some part of the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Nares. This prisoner was with me a year or more, and I never saw any thing amiss of him but childish tricks, he was quite a child not above nine years old, and he went over from me, I returned him to that lady who had a great regard for the family, I thought it was much better to let him go home again.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Weale. Has he been with any body abroad lately? - He came to England last year in a Merchant's ship, he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, in the first place, it is but justice to observe, that nobody in the City of London carries on that critical business of a pawnbroker, with more caution or in a better manner, than Mr. Heather; for I have seen many instances<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290131"/> where his conduct has been the means of detecting prisoners. As to this case, in what manner the prisoner stole this wat ch is not so precisely proved, upon that therefore, you may exercise your judgment, if you can rely on the evidence of the boy, then the whole matter is proved; otherwise, if you think that circumstance is not sufficiently proved; and you are satisfied, that he is the person that stole the watch, without being able to declare in what manner he stole it, then you may acquit him of the capital part of the charge.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Nares. It is not to be understood that we mean to cast any aspersion upon this little child.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very natural that the child should be affraid, having disobeyed his father's orders, but that takes away the full reliance on his evidence.</p>

               <p>The prisoner took three guineas and a crown piece out of my drawer on the 23d of September, about five in the afternoon. Nobody was in the room but she and me. The drawer was locked, and I found it locked. Whether she picked my pocket at night, or whether she had a false key, I cannot say. I saw the money and things three weeks and two days before I missed them. I had opened the drawer in that time, but did not look for the money till I went to take out a guinea to pay my quarter's rent, and I had none. The prisoner carried two guineas over the way to the chandler's shop, and she had not an half-penny when she came to me, and she took her things out of pawn, and she gave half, a guinea to her sweetheart, to pay for a bed, and buy liquors. She lodged with me six weeks. I never looked in her pocket: I found nothing on her. She went to Chiswick to a place the day before I missed the money. She was taken before the Bench of Justices at Hammersmith, and she owned she took it, and at the board she offered to pay me half a guinea a month for the money.</p>
               <p>What did she say, as near as you can recollect? - Says she, I promise Mrs. Kelly to pay her half a guinea a month, till the money is paid.</p>
               <p>Did she say whether she had or had not taken it? - She did not say.</p>
               <p>Did she give any reason for offering that? - No: she said she had taken it.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her say so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Somebody is speaking to her: Pray, how came you not to say so before that person told you just now? - I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290134"/> Sir, that she offered me half a guinea a month.</p>

               <p>I am a shoe-maker. I was with the prisoner at Chiswick. I heard her say that she took the money. The prosecutrix asked me to go with her.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you go before the Grand Jury? - I did not know. I went with the prosecutrix to Chiswick to the prisoner: the prosecutrix said, you served me very prettily in taking the money, and she said she did not take so much, and would pay the prosecutrix half a guinea a month: afterwards she confessed that she had taken the money.</p>
               <p>What did you or the woman say to her? - The prosecutrix said she had a constable just at hand, if she would not confess.</p>
               <p>And what was the constable to do if she would not confess? - I do not know. Nobody was present when she owned it, but the prosecutrix and me.</p>

               <p>I did not promise her any such thing. She came to me and said she would not hurt a hair of my head. I was just got into a new place, and she took me up. The guinea I changed was lent me by my brother. I have no witnesses, because I did not let my relations know.</p>

               <p>I was fourteen the 29th of last May. I took this box on the 21st of October to the George and Blue Boar, Holborn; I saw a man standing under the gateway, and I asked him where the book-keeper was; he said he was gone home, but he would shew me where he lived: I went along with him to Red-lion-street, to a street on the right, and there was a man standing by a lamp, and he said that he was the bookkeeper; I gave him the parcel, and told him to book it, and he took a little book out of his pocket, and a black lead pencil or a pen, I could not see which, and booked it; then he gave it to the man that went with me, which is the prisoner. I cannot be sure whether he is the man or no.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. The prisoner is not the man you gave the parcel to? - No, I gave it to a tall man, and he gave it to another man.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of this month, about nine o'clock, coming up Holborn, just by Gray's Inn gate, I met the prisoner, and a tall man with him; the prisoner had this box under his arm. The moment I stopped him, the other man ran away. I asked the prisoner where he got this box; he said a man had given it to him to carry; I told him he must go with me; he said with all his heart. I took him to Sir Sampson Wright's, and broke open the box, and we found the bill of parcels, and where the prosecutor lived. I sent for the prosecutor, and he said it was his box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you enquire what business the prisoner was? - A fellowship porter.</p>
               <p>Jury. What made you stop the man in the street? - If it is thought a question proper to be answered, I will resolve it.</p>
               <p>Jury. I think it is? - I knew the man at the bar.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I went up as far as Bloomsbury market, and returning back, just by the White Hart, a man asked me to take that box down Holborn; he was along-side of me: Jealous met the man and me together; I told him I had a box belonging to that gentleman, and I pointed to the gentleman, and I went along with Jealous, and the gentleman ran away; I thought he had been by the side of me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Had these shirts any particular marks that you know them by? - Yes, there is my name on them.</p>
               <p>Allen. The prisoners said the things were their own, they had been having them washed, or something to that purport; in the morning a printer's boy came to me with a handbill, and I then found that it answered to the property that I found on them.</p>
               <p>PRISONER TASKER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, me and Best were both together, we had been at Wapping, coming home we called at the sign of the Blue Boar in Rosemary-lane, where we bought these things; it is a house frequently used by people of this kind, who sell these goods, and we bought these things there.</p>
               <p>Court to Allen. Did they say so to you? - My Lord, they said they were their own, and they had been to get them washed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290137"/>Prisoner Tasker. You asked what we had, and we told you it was our own property? - Allen. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Allen. You do not know whether they said they were coming from the wash, or going to wash? - I cannot say, they said they were their own property.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. We have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. A burglary must be committed in the night time, when there is not light enough to discern the face of a man; therefore it is punished so severely. If a man will take the advantage of night to commit a robbery in a dwelling-house, the law thinks proper to punish that always capitally. If a house is broke into, and things are taken away, or if the things are not taken away, if it is done with an intent to take things away, it is a burglary. Now this was on the 9th of September, and the prosecutor came to town between six and seven; there is not a doubt in the world but it is light at that time: the things, you observe, were not missed till eleven that night; therefore, whether they were taken in the night time or not it is impossible for us to say; but I suppose it is not light longer than eight, about the sixth of September. Nothing serves to ascertain the time when they were taken, but from the time when they were found; now that was about twenty minutes past eleven; then, you see, they had come two miles; and allowing them to be taken at twenty minutes after ten, it would be in the night - ten would have been in the night, nine would have been in the night; therefore that is a circumstance (though there is no positive evidence whether they were taken at night, or before dark) which makes it likely they were taken at night; and I cannot help saying, that one would hardly think that any body would go to break open the door of a room at a public inn, whilst it was day-light. As to the breaking, you will observe, Gentlemen, there must be an actual breaking, or a constructive breaking: it is not necessary that the door should be broke open, if it was upon the latch, and an outward door; the opening of it is in the law a breaking, because you have opened that door which the owner thought sufficiently fastened. If it is opened with a false key, picking the lock is as much a breaking as if the door had been broken all to pieces. Now it must be one or the other, because the key was in the same place where the man hung it up.</p>

               <p>With respect to the goods found in the possession of the prisoners, if a man cannot give you a reasonable account to satisfy you that he came honestly by the goods in his possession, the law says he is the man that took them.</p>
               <p>There seems to be no doubt in the world with respect to the single felony: how far it is burglary depends on the observation I made to you. If you doubt whether it was in the day-light, or at night, to be sure you will not take the lives of two men away if you have any doubt. You will consider the case, and, I dare say, give such a verdict, as in your consciences you think yourselves bound.</p>
               <p>If the goods stolen in a dwelling-house are above the value of 40 s. that constitutes a capital offence; but, however, no particular value has been set upon these things.</p>

               <p>What ship did he come home in? - I cannot say, he lodges at the White Hart in Shadwell-street, I live there right opposite, I have lived there these two years, he is often at our house, he is a very honest lad, I saw the prisoner buy a hat of a Jew, as I was going of an errand for my mistress at the bottom of Red Lion Street, by Rosemary Lane, he gave eight shillings for it.

I went on board the ship after he was taken up, I saw the Captain, he said, he was a very honest lad, and all the time he was with me he was a very honest lad; he brought the hat to my house about two days before the fire in Wapping, which was about the 22d or 23d of September, then he took it the Friday morning, and the fire was on Thursday, to Mr. Russell to have it cocked.</p>
               <p>Court. The first time you saw the hat was two days before the fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know this girl? - Yes, her mistress lives opposite to me.</p>
               <p>Is there any connection between the prisoner and her? - None at all, I believe the lad never knew any thing of her, if she had passed him an hundred times, he would not have known her.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect she has told us that he used to come backwards and forwards to the Black-lad in her house? - The two Blacks were intimate together for about nine or ten days.</p>

               <p>Then did you, or did you not, turning to the prisoner, say, Father, look at this bill; it is not a good one? - He snatched it out of my hand: I was no judge of bank notes, so I did not know much about it:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290147"/> my wife asked the prisoner if it was a good note, and upon reading it he said it was a good note; he said he would be bound it was a good note.</p>

               <p>And so far as the form of it, it is a good note? - In a few days after, the prisoner at the bar came to me, and said, Son, will you do me one favor, to lend me a guinea; my wife went and fetched him a guinea, and he went away, and never came back afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner quit his own habitation? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. What was your complaint before Justice Blackborough? - I told him the same as I have told my Lord Judge.</p>
               <p>Was not the prisoner committed for a fraud? - Yes; but at Hick's Hall they said it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>He had been in prison first of all for a fraud? - Yes; then he bailed it, and afterwards came to Hick's Hall to discharge his recognizance.</p>
               <p>You did not discount the note for the prisoner at the bar, but for Harrison, and you gave the money to Harrison; the note was in your hands, and in your wife's hands, before it came to him for his opinion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Harrison lived in some credit, then? - Yes; the prisoner went away before Harrison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether Harrison did not contract a fresh debt afterwards, and pay him every halfpenny? - Yes, but I did not know that this was a bad note; he paid me and overpaid me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You would have trusted Harrison when you gave him cash for this bill, without the bill? - Yes, with a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Court. You have said more than once, if I understand you, that you took the bill on the faith and credit of the prisoner? - Yes, I would not have taken it on the faith of Harrison.</p>

I knew Aris when I made him the clothes; he lived at No. 17. New-street Square; from there he moved down to Horsham, and he told me he was going on a smuggling party. As to value, I never had any in my life of them for it, so help me God. Harrison was a housekeeper in the same street, and lived in credit, as they both did at that time, and I worked for Harrison. Mr. Butler, the Justice, was the other man that told me such a thing as this was against me. I went to withdraw-my recognizance; I appeared every day last sessions; I withdrew my recognizance. If I had ever been guilty of the forgery of that bill, I would never have gone into Court to have withdrawn my recognizance. Here is the accepter of the note.</p>

               <p>(He writes the word accepted on a piece of paper.)</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose, Sir, you are ready to pay this note? - No, Sir; I have had a letter from Harrison within these few days.</p>
               <p>Jury. Why did not you pay it when it was due? - It was not demanded of me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have been there twenty times, and upwards.</p>
               <p>Green. I was there at the time I accepted the bill.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. This is directed to be left at the sign of the Horse-shoe, Ludgate-hill.</p>
               <p>Green. There I received the letter. I am very often in the city. I am seldom at my lodgings after I come out in the morning, till night.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a very curious letter about</p>
               <p>"people behind the curtain." (The letter read.) Signed J. Harrison, addressed to Mr. Richard Green, to be left at the sign of the Horse-shoe, on Ludgate-hill, London.</p>
               <p>"Shipton, in Yorkshire, Oct. 14, 1783.</p>
               <p>MR. GREEN, SIR,</p>
               <p>"The difficulties which always attend</p>
               <p>"me in leaving London, unavoidably made</p>
               <p>"me behind when I was to have seen you</p>
               <p>"at the Swan in Queen-square; and you</p>
               <p>"not having patience or thought to wait</p>
               <p>"for me, though I left several things undone,</p>
               <p>"and friends unseen, and came all the</p>
               <p>"way from Cripplegate to Southampton-row,</p>
               <p>"to see you, in a heavy rain, and</p>
               <p>"got wet through all my clothes; and I</p>
               <p>"had to ride two days and two nights, on</p>
               <p>"the outside of the coach, at the risque</p>
               <p>"of my health and life, which I would</p>
               <p>"not run again for 500 l. Your time of</p>
               <p>"appointment was five, and at five minutes</p>
               <p>"after six I got to the Swan; at any rate</p>
               <p>"I believe I was within half a minute of</p>
               <p>"seeing you, as the landlord said he believed</p>
               <p>"you was gone to the necessary.</p>
               <p>"I remember your saying that Kaye</p>
               <p>"was in custody; but since then have been</p>
               <p>"informed he was in Newgate, and that</p>
               <p>"you had been at Mr. Pilkington's, vow-destruction</p>
               <p>"against him, if he would not</p>
               <p>"inform you where I was. How far you</p>
               <p>"can account for this I cannot tell. I</p>
               <p>"look upon myself no way obliged to</p>
               <p>"Kaye, nor ever was: he always acted</p>
               <p>"with deceit to me: I never deserted him,</p>
               <p>"but he me, without any cause. - Not so</p>
               <p>"much as to acquaint me, but kept me</p>
               <p>"two months in the dark. If he still remains</p>
               <p>"in trouble, and I could render</p>
               <p>"him any service, I would do it.</p>
               <p>"But now to renew our old state discourse.</p>

               <p>"not both honest and unshaken: - in a</p>

I went with them to a room just by, in a court: I lay down upon the floor, and fell asleep, and awaked in the morning a little before four o'clock, and my watch was taken out: they could not get it out without cutting my breeches, I had it when I went to sleep: they were both in the room when I went to sleep, and when I awaked they were both there: I asked them where it was, they said they knew nothing of it. About five o'clock I went to my work; about ten I had them both taken up, and the watch I found.</p>

About two hours afterwards, a man from the Rotation Office in East. Smithfield came to enquire of me if I had taken any silver watch that forenoon; I told him I had taken in one, and he called in the owner, who identified it. I attended the Justices in the evening, and the two prisoners were there: I thought I had some faint idea of the shortest, though I could not positively swear. She peremptorily crossed me in my evidence, that it was no man that pledged the watch at all. I was then struck more forcibly with the identity of her person, and I am of opinion that it was that woman herself, disguised in sailor's clothes; that was

               <p>This pawnbroker, I never saw him, so help me God, till I saw him in the Justice's office, if I am to be believed as a Christian at the bar. I drank part of a pint of beer with the prosecutor; he was out of my company very near three quarters of an hour; he came in again, and went out sick; he went into the open street, there was about a dozen women, and he had one of them in the house, and made her sing songs, and then a fighting arose, and he was in the midst. I did not perceive any watch he had about him. He said to me, I should be glad to lay down any where, it is too late for me to go home. I worked at hay-making with this woman; I asked her to let him lay down; I covered him with a blanket on the floor. I went to bed immediately with this woman. He awaked in the morning, and asked this woman for his watch. The last word he said, when he went out of the room, he said, I had my watch in the public room, but I will not be positive I had it here. He desired me to come where he lived, if I heard any thing of it.</p>

That is some apology for your conduct; but Mrs. Smith, if this thing ever happens again, and there is any thing pawned at your house, and you do not produce to the Court the person that took it in, I will immediately order the parties to go before the Grand Jury to prosecute you as a receiver of stolen goods; for there is nothing so abominable as your carrying on your trade in any other manner, than being able to prove at all times of whom you received the articles; and nothing but your never having been here before, is the reason that I do not now order a prosecution against you.</p>

               <p>One morning this young man and the other woman came and asked me for a bed, the woman that keeps the house, one Bet Bowyer said, is the bed-chamber empty, and they went up to the bed, and the woman sent me for a quartern of Hollands; she laid about an hour, and left the young man asleep; she came down stairs and said, can you shew me to your necessary? she said, I want to speak to you, I have no money, if you will take this breast-buckle, it is no odds what name you put in, as long as you bring a duplicate; she said it was her husband's, and they just came from Plymouth together; as I was coming back, Mr. Moses took me with the duplicate in my hand. I have not a friend in the world.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council, Mr. Fielding. I understand that in this house in Union-buildings you never saw the prisoner at the bar? - No, I never saw him there, I saw his wife there.</p>
               <p>When you went to the house in order to take away the goods, you took away all the things that you found on the premises, the greater part of the moveables? - Them that he took from my premises.</p>
               <p>Yes, but you mentioned some things that were found in the back kitchen; those were taken away by you and your companions? - Not by me, the constable took them, he was with me the first time, he put them in a coach, and drove them to the publick office.</p>
               <p>Then all those things that he thought came within that description he took away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. You said you took those goods that he brought from those premises; did you know those goods? - Best part of them, the rest the maid shewed me that belonged to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I live in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Did you let any house to the prisoner at any time? - I was asked that question in Bow-street, they sent for me, I could not positively recollect him, I saw him so short a space of time in my shop that I could not recollect him, not my clerk who went with him could not recollect him; it was a house in Union-buildings, the man that came to take the house said his name was Harris.</p>
               <p>Did you ever receive any rent for that house? - I believe not, he left I think a guinea earnest, and a gentleman left another guinea on taking away some few things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Yo do not know the person? - If it is the same person, he is very much altered, he had either a wig or his hair curled in his neck, the size is the same, but I am not clear, and therefore I would not say.</p>

               <p>What did you find in the back kitchen? - We went down stairs in the back kitchen, and we found a copper pulled up, and a furnace built in its place; by the side of the furnace there was a large square tub, I call it, it had some fine mould in it, and there were some crucibles found in that tub, about two or three, and about four more found by the side of that tub, I found some flasks, some large and small crucibles, a pipkin, sand, copper, and scouring paper; the flasks were found by the side of the furnace, one of the crucibles had som e base metal in it; here is some base metal and some arsenic, and four double wicked candles, and a pipkin with something black in it; here are three or four pieces of cork, and about a dozen of files, and scouring paper; I found some copper clippings in the left hand closet in the front kitchen; I have had all these things in my custody ever since, and they are exactly as they were when I took them from Union-court, and a shilling and three bad sixpences that Mitcham found the second time, and gave to me to keep.</p>
               <p>What did you find at the second search? - This shilling and three bad sixpences, which Mitcham found in a little bag in the parlour, I was present at the time, here is a screw box with some clippings, I found them upon a lathe up stairs in the garret.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You have been employed for many years for the mint, and therefore you can describe to us the several implements that are there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Take them as they were produced in evidence? - Here is, my Lord, one pair of flasks and an odd one.</p>
               <p>Court. The pair of flasks is compleat? - These are compleat without the sand, these double wicked candles are used to smoke the mould, for when the sand is damp if it was put in then, it would blow it as they call it, that is fill it full of holes; the candles are to dry the sand.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the sand when dried in that manner, is as it were caked together? - Not a doubt of it my Lord, and that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290154"/> gives it the colour of black on the face of the sand.</p>
               <p>What is the use of these crucibles? - For melting the arsenic in, to flux the colour with; by throwing it into water it throws one degree of whiteness, this is what they call blanch copper, which is melted, and then fluxed by this arsenic, it makes it what they call a white copper, not quite so white as tutenage: They scour them with the scouring-paper in order to make them take the white the better.</p>
               <p>What is that little pipkin? - It has been proved in this Court, that after they are cleared this leaves them bright, it is a kind of stuff made of black lead in order to make them look old, the aqua fortis is to draw out the white of the silver, then it is put into water and scraped with sand, then it leaves a black upon it, then it is taken off by sand, then this is put upon it in order that it should not tarnish with the strength of the aqua fortis, it takes away the brightness of rubbing with the sand.</p>
               <p>Is there the whole apparatus for coining compleat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at these shillings, are they cast or struck? - They are cast.</p>
               <p>What are these filings? - That is what is cut from the edge after they are cast, it runs round the edge, it is clipped off and then filed.</p>
               <p>Look at that metal in that crucible? - There is silver among that.</p>
               <p>Is that the same metal of which these shillings are cast? - I have not a doubt of it, but it is too nice to swear to, without an assay being made, that it is the same, but I have not a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>I understand so far as the exterior instrument goes it is compleat? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. You apprehended the prisoner? - Yes, I did, it was on Friday the 10th of this month, at Tuston-street Westminster, there I found two compleat sets of coining tools in the cellar, as compleat, as compleat could be. (The Tools produced.) There are the gets, two of these have been used.</p>

               <p>Court. Mr. Clarke, if I am wrong you will correct me, each of these little projections of each side, are the parts that adhere to the shilling or sixpence? - Not a doubt of it, my Lord, there are two gets that have not been used, the metal remains on the other.</p>
               <p>Court. These things called the gets are the real conductors to each mould? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the metal remains on the conductor itself, as well as communicates to the other? - Yes, it is the main channel of the mould when the shillings and sixpences remain on, then it is called a spray, when they are taken off it is called a get; before it is used it is a plain piece of lead, but when the metal is poured in part of it adheres.</p>
               <p>Court. Go to the Gentlemen of the Jury Mr. Clarke and give them an account? - Yes, my Lord: When it is poured it runs down the sand, and it lodges itself to each of them pieces; then it is all joined.</p>
               <p>Court. When the metal comes in, it forces itself into these interstices or vacant spaces, and then it connects itself.</p>
               <p>Clarke. In the cellar I found that melting-pot, in the back parlour in the closet I found about six pounds-worth of shillings.</p>
               <p>Are they good or bad? - They are all rough cast.</p>
               <p>Court. They are not yet in the similitude of shillings? - No, they are not.</p>
               <p>Do you mean six pounds in weight or in enumeration? - In tale, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Jury. What is that piece of metal? - This is not in a state of being used at present.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Did you find any thing else Mr. Clarke? - Yes, I found the patterns from which they were cast.</p>
               <p>Then these are the patterns from which these were cast? - Clearly so, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you find them? - I found them all in the closet in Westminster.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. What name did he go by there? - He called himself by the name of Brooks, I called him Harris,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290155"/> and he said, his name was not Harris; one of the officers that was with him knew him better than I did, he said, Joe, your name is

               <p>Prisoner's Council. How long was it between the time when this discovery was made in Union Buildings, and the time you apprehended this man? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>It seems at Westminster there is something that makes the apparatus more compleat than those that were found in Union Buildings? - The things in the casting way are both compleat, but there was no get that I have seen, that was found in Union Buildings.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of the prisoner, other than an honest sober man, he lodged with me, he left me about the 9th or 10th of October.</p>
               <p>When did he come to your house? - About four or five months before.</p>
               <p>Did he lodge by himself? - There was a person called his wife.</p>
               <p>What was his character? - He came home at nine o'clock to breakfast, and at twelve to dinner, and in by ten at night; never was a night absent.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Where do you live? - In Prince's-street.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A brush-maker by occupation, he always paid me good money like a working mechanical man.</p>
               <p>Jury. You never heard him say what business he was? - Not to my knowledge, I believe I might ask his wife, and she said, in the watch way, but the watch way has many branches I made no enquiry.</p>

               <p>About five or six months ago, I believe it may be, this gentleman that is at the bar, came and took a lodging of me at two shillings per week, I believe he told me he was in the smith way, he kept exceeding good hours, he was very quiet, and paid me justly; I have kept a shop in Prince's-street, Westminster, this six or seven years, a brushmaker's shop.</p>
               <p>Was there any woman with him that went as his wife? - Yes, there was, a tall thin woman, a very pretty behaved genteel woman as ever was.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner. On the 30th of July a watch was brought, but I am not sure it was the prisoner that brought it. I lent two guineas on it; it was pawned in the name of William Hall. The next morning I saw a warning of the watch, and I took it to Mr. House the watch-maker, and he took me to Mr. Allen, and I delivered the watch to Allen, and told him, if the person should come again, I would stop him. On the 9th of October last, this man came with the duplicate for the watch; I asked him if he was not the person that brought it, he said yes; he said, if you remember, Sir, when I brought it, I told you that my room was broke open, and I had been robbed of every thing I had, and therefore I was obliged to get money on my watch; which words I remember were said when the watch was brought.</p>

Two days after I was robbed of my coat and waistcoat and bed. I wanted to buy some things and some leather: if I had stolen the watch, I never should have gone to fetch it out from a pawnbroker's. A young man said he would buy it of me.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner about four years. I live in Bridgewater Gardens. I am a closer of shoes. The prisoner is a shoe-maker. I worked for him, but not these three or four months; it may be longer, I cannot say rightly; I worked since and before at Mr. Giles's in Aldersgate-street, I have worked for Mr. Giles ever since I have been a child on and off.</p>

               <p>What day of the month is his birth-day? - The 22d.</p>
               <p>Where was he when the prisoner bought it of him? - At the cock in the Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>How came you to be there? - He made a pair of shoes for me, and a pair for my cousin. The watch was in pawn, and the prisoner was to by it of my cousin, and he went to fetch it out: he gave him two guineas for the watch, to fetch it out, and two guineas and an half he lent him; then there was half a guinea due to the prisoner, that made five shillings over, and that five shillings he promised to pay him the first opportunity: my cousin was gone about a quarter of an hour to fetch it out: he gave him to the amount of five pounds in all for the watch.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner a married man? - No, a single man; he works for himself, and keeps a stall.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any accident happening to him? - No, I never heard of any accident happening to him in my life-time.</p>

               <p>Jury. Did you ever here that he was robbed? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of character has this man borne? - A very honest, just character.</p>
               <p>Court to Hill. When was this watch pawned? - On the 30th of July.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two other Witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Cooper. Are you positive it was in the month of August? - Yes, for my cousin's birth-day was in that month, that makes me remember it.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The words of this statute are privately and without the knowledge of the party. Now, you observe, the prosecutor said he did feel a twitch. This girl has fixed upon a time, when it was impossible for Dickinson to have the watch, for the pawnbroker could not be deceived. Now, if on the 30th of July this was in the hands of Hall, it could not be in the hands of Dickinson in August; but if her story is true, and she should have mistaken the time by accident, you will judge of that. I cannot but say she seems to tell her story without any confusion in her countenance, for I observed her.</p>

               <p>Who shut the door after you? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Can you tell with certainty whether it was shut or not when you went out? - I cannot tell: I went out a little after eight.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you know of the young woman's going out with the child? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the door shut after she went out? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>- SWIFT sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to Mr. Brewster's chambers on the alarm: I searched the prisoner and found this pick-lock key under the buttons of his left knee, and under his right I found this.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I wanted to see a relation whom I was informed lived with Mr. Brewster. The door was open, I went in, and Mr. Brewster and his wife were playing at cards; he came out and took me. The door was open.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290160"/>Court. How came you by these keys? - There was a hole in my pocket and they dropped through.</p>

               <p>"76 l. 18 s. Peton and Swift." I am sure of the draft, here are the initials of my name, which I wrote immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Prosecutor. Was there any particular crowd in going into the play-house? - Yes, I believe the play had begun, I felt my pocket-book about an hour before I came from the Castle in Wood-street, I had not drank I suppose more than half a pint of wine, I believe I did not lose it going in; I did not get into any company there, I stood in the pit, whether I lost it in the house I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did you examine your pockets when you came out of the play-house? - I did not, I then went to Medley's coffee-house in the Strand, to spend the evening, I staid about an hour and an half, then I came home to the Blossoms-inn.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to nobody coming home? - There were many girls that laid hold of me, some by the sleeve, and some by the coat; I talked with one of them, she was a west country girl from Exeter; I did not stay with them any considerable time.</p>
               <p>You could not part with your country woman immediately? - I staid with her a minute or two, we were not familiar at all, she asked me to give her a glass of wine or to sleep with her.</p>
               <p>You refused all her solicitations? - I asked her why she gave herself to this way of life, I said it was a pity, she said she was in and could not get out.</p>
               <p>The minutes might slip fast away; had she any west country women with her? - Not as I know of, there were many women round her; I do not know exactly whereabouts it was.</p>
               <p>You did not keep your hand in your pocket all the time I suppose? - No, I did not put my hand in my pocket that night.</p>
               <p>Did you find any more of your country women going home? - No, nor no other women.</p>
               <p>Was your coat buttoned or not as you went along the Strand? - I do not know, it was very hot in the play-house, I remember unbuttoning it there, but whether I buttoned it after I cannot tell; I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any reason to fix upon any place where you lost it? - I have not, I look upon it that when I was with the women, was as likely a time for my losing it as any in the course of the evening; it was rather past twelve when I left Medley's.</p>
               <p>You do not remember seeing the prisoner at the play-house? - I do not remember seeing him in my life till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On the Saturday morning a woman brought the note to me, and asked me to go and receive it; accordingly I went with it and they stopped me: here are gentlemen that can prove where I was that evening, the woman could not read I believe.</p>
               <p>Court. What woman was she? - I believe she was an unfortunate woman, she said she would meet me at twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>How do you know it is the same man? - I am confident it is the same man I saw with the glass, and that passed me when I returned with the glass; I had a full view of him, and I am very sure it is the same person.</p>

               <p>I was standing at my door the 25th of October, I live next door but one to the prosecutrix, she came out of their house and said, stop that man, he has stole my looking-glass: I saw him then with the glass under his arm, I did not notice him before, I followed him and he was taken in Lothbury; I never lost sight of him, I am sure this is the same man.</p>

               <p>I was going to Mr. Jones's, an attorney in Castle-yard, Holborn, No. 16, about some money, and going past that place, I am not acquainted much in London, I came from the West Indies, and a woman asked me to carry this glass: soon after the woman came and said, young man the glass belongs to me. I have no witnesses, but there are several gentlemen that know me, and they may be in this Court now, or they would come to my character tomorrow.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of last month I was going to Houndsditch between eight and nine; the prisoner picked me up, she carried me to her lodgings, to Mr. Lyons's, I had some supper with her, and then called for a bed; the landlady said, it is customary here to pay a couple of shillings for the bed, before you go to bed; it was about eleven when I went to bed, and the prisoner went to bed along with me; then the prisoner said, it is common to pay before we go to bed; very well says I, what is your demand? she said three shillings, I gave it her; after I gave her that I had two guineas in a purse, and seven shillings, and a watch, I was sober, I counted my money before ever I went to bed, and put my purse and my watch in my stockings, as I lay in a strange bed, and put it under the side of the bed I lay on, and a pair of silver buckles were in my shoes; after she was gone to bed, I got up and bolted the door, and saw all was secure, and when I awoke in the morning, between four and five, I found nobody in bed but myself; then I went to look at the door, which way she could get away for I found the door fast, as I made it, then I went and looked at the window, and found it open, and I shut it the night before: It was one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose she got out of the window? - Yes, when the runners were after her, she jumped out of another window, she could nor get out of the other room, because it was locked, and the landlady had the key: I never found my things, I am sure of the prisoner, she was taken up the next day.</p>

               <p>What did you with the money you received? - I kept it, laid it out, and spent it; on the 18th Davis and Sutherland went on shore, and brought as much money as came to eighteen shillings a piece.</p>
               <p>What quantity of liquor might you send on shore while you lay in the river? - Eight gallons at first, and about three gallons that I drew off, and three gallons and a half that Colvin and Davis drew off; the money was divided down in the forecastle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You say when you was about this business at first Davis asked you what you was about, you told him, and he told you, you had better have a light, and Colvin brought you one? - Yes.</p>

These liquors we are accused with, we bought at Ostend out of an outlandish vessel, ten gallons of brandy, which we stowed in the hold, and we could not get at it without breaking this forecastle door, we were going to stow a tier of brandies where this liquor that we had stowed in the forecastle was, we were not allowed to bring any liquors in the ship; when we came to Cuckold's Point, we put it on shore and sold it, I went and took the money and came on board with it, and then from thence we went to the moorings, the officers came on board to search the ship, and asked for the keys of our chests, and what trifle of liquors we had, and this tobacco was brought upon deck; Mr. Sebre saw it, and there was so little of it, he said it was not worth while to take it from us, as we was poor fellows; on Sunday evening we were on shore, and Dighton went down into the forecastle, and saw the door, he called this man into the forecastle, and offered him two guineas and a half, and made him almost drunk, if he would say we took liquors out of the cargo, then he sent for Tilbury, he went to the captain's house, then they took him to the Justice's, and he was sworn, he was locked up till we were fetched by the runners, and when we went into the place where Tilbury was, he was crying, and said he was distracted: deny it if you can!</p>
               <p>Tilbury. I do deny it with a safe conscience.</p>
               <p>Davis. And while you was in Clerkenwell, the Captain was there with you, and gave you a guinea, and told you to keep your heart up, for them villains would hang you if they could, but to stand to your integrity; it is nothing but bribery, and a malicious information.</p>
