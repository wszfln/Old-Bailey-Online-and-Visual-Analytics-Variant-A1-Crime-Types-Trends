                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant H</hi>). From information I received I went with Bolton to 59, Wentworth Street, Whitechapel, about half-past 4 in the afternoon of 16th January—we went to the back room on the third floor; the door was shut, I pushed it open and found the two prisoners there sitting at a table near the window, upon which was a quantity of counterfeit coin spread over—Christy had this small file in his hand, and was filing the edges of the coins—he had a coin in his hand—when I went in he jumped up and rushed to the window, and threw something out; the window was open—in getting up some of the coin was swept off the table on to the floor, I should think he did it with his hand—I rushed up to the window after him—I could not say where what he threw out fell—I heard something rattle; it appeared to rattle down in the yard below—I held Christy—Donovan rushed out of the room and downstairs—she had been sitting in a chair at the table, doing nothing—I called out "Stop that woman," and she was brought back by Inspector Peters—I searched the room: I found 22 counterfeit florins in different parts, some on the floor, and two or three on the table, and a small piece of metal—I did not make any further search at that time—I left Bolton in the room while I had the prisoners taken to the station—I said to the prisoners "How do you account for the possession of the 22 counterfeit florins?" Christy said "They don't belong to me, I have been to work ail day, they were made in my absence by a man I don't know;" Donovan said "I know nothing about it, I was not in the room"—when I took possession of the coins some of them were warm—there was a bright tire, just getting down a little—on the 18th I was present when Bolton found a florin mould dated 1871—the date of the florins is 1871</p>

               <p>—the mould was found on the roof of an outhouse or pothouse of the Carpenters' Arms Tavern adjoining—it was quite possible for anything to be thrown there from the prisoners' window; it was about seven or eight yards, and much lower than the window—the prisoners were searched at the station: one good shilling was found on Christy, and one good shilling on Donovan.</p>

               <p>from his pocket this packet and commenced to break it open—I immediately rushed out from where I was secreted and burst the closet door open in which he was—I found this packet by his side—I said to him "What are you doing with that packet?"—he said "Nothing"—I said "Come out"—he refused—I took hold of him and dragged him out, and in the pan of the closet I found this label addressed to Miss G. E. Frimley, Bagshot, Surrey—it was quite dry; it bears the postmark of Millom of January 10th—I asked if he knew me; he said "No"—I said I was a police-constable, and I took him to the police-constables' room—there was a letter inside this—that was with the cardboard box and the cotton wool on the seat—on the way to the constables' room Mr. Frazer, one of the overseers who was with me, stopped, and pointed to a window ledge which we were passing—I looked, and picked up this packet—it is addressed to J. H. Glasse, Esq., Jubblepoor, India, bearing the postmark of Bridgnorth, January 12th—in the constables' room I searched the prisoner, and in an inside coat pocket that he was wearing I found these two packets, one addressed to Miss Goddard, The Lodge, near Lothbury, Leicestershire, the other to Mr. Hancock, Dartford, Kent, bearing the postmark of Paisley of the previous day—those two were unopened—I said to the prisoner "Can you give any explanation of having these packets in your possession?"—he said "I dont know how they got there, I did not know they were there"—I asked him where he lived—he told me 18, B block, Peabody Buildings—the packets were both opened by me before the Magistrate—the first contained some wedding cake, and the other some labels, and the third a pocket book and memorandum book—I went to his address, and to the rooms which he said he occupied—I made a search, and found under his bed a quantity of articles, a lot of letters open, and in different places in the room, in boxes and elsewhere, I found a large number of articles, of which this is a list, and I have the property here—there were four boxes altogether—when he said he did not know they were in his pocket I said "If you did not know they were there why were you so anxious to throw away one?"—he said "Because I wanted to get rid of it"—he was perfectly sober—it was 6 o'clock in the morning; he had been on duty since 4 or 5, and he did not leave me after that.</p>

               <p>he was there—he next left the office about 5.40, and was absent till a quarter to 8—he would be going to his tea at that time—I saw Mr. Kirby that evening about a quarter to 5—that was when the prisoner went to make his second collection—on the Thursday night following Mrs. Lath<lb/>leen came and made a communication to me, and I wired to Mr. Kirby next morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At some of the collections there would be seven pillar-boxes to collect from, at some five, and some four—the prisoner would not have seven to collect from the second time—it would be quite a different set of boxes at the second collection from the first; he would only have one receiving house to collect from at the first collection, and two on the second—there are about 52 men at work at the Stoke New<lb/>ington office—the bags are made up nine times a day, and there are six deliveries—the stamping table is a different one from the sorting table—there are divisions of about a yard between the men who are sorting, merely an iron bar—the face of the table is quite open; the table goes against the wall—the prisoner's proper time for coining in from his first collection would be 4.24—I said before the Magistrate it was 4.19; it was a mistake, I was confounding the two collections—I knew he was late—another man was doing his duty and stamping; that man was slow—I don't think I said when the prisoner came in, "Here is Nicholsburg, he will do it in no time; "I dont believe I said so—he did begin stamp<lb/>ing when he came in; he stamped very few, and then went to the sorting again.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I saw the prisoner again about 8.45 at the Stoke Newington office as he was starting to make a delivery—he had been stopped by Shayler by my instructions—I said to him, "I am from the Secretary's department of the General Post-office, and in consequence of numerous complaints of the loss of letters containing valuables passing through this office I have been directed to make inquiries; this afternoon at 3.50 a packet enclosed in a buff-coloured paper, containing an Abyssinian gold chain, was posted in the Lordship Park letterbox, a collection from which was made by you afterwards"—he said "Yes"—I said, "The packet was addressed 'Mr. Francis, 13, New Road, Winchmore Hill;' I am informed it is missing; have you any recollection of it?"—he said, "I recollect seeing a packet like the one you have described, I cleared it away from the box with my letters, which I took to the post-office"—I said, "What did you do with the contents of your bag on arriving at the office?"—he said, "I turned them out on the table"—I said, "Did you then see the package?"—he said "No"—I said, "Did you face up your letters?"—he said, "A portion of them; I separated the packets, I put them on the packet table and placed the newspapers on the side, after which I was called away to stamp the letters"—I then said, "Have you about you any articles that do not belong to you?"—he said "No"—I said, "Have you any objection to be searched?"—he said "No"—he was then searched by Shayler, but no trace of the missing packet or its contents was found—there were a number of postage-stamps, seven penny ones and two halfpenny ones, all unobliterated—they appeared to have been removed from a circular or letter—I asked him to account for the possession of them—he said "The penny stamps I have taken off letters of my own which I have not sent"—I said "As</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188401280014"/>
               <p>regards the two halfpenny ones, how many were there?"—he said "I got them off circulars which I had to deliver; the stamps were loose, and I thought it no harm to take them"—I then proceeded to the prisoner's lodging in company with Shayler—I there made an examination, and found several articles of jewellery, among which were ladies' rings, brooches, solitaires, and articles of a similar kind—I produce a list of the property—I did not find the Abyssinian gold chain or anything relating to the packet—I then went to the Stoke Newington Post-office where the prisoner was detained—I asked him what he did when he left the office at 5.45—he said "I went home and had some tea"—I said "Did you go into your bedroom?"—at first he said not; ultimately he said he did for the purpose of washing—I then suspended him from duty—I did not give him in custody then—on Friday morning at 11 o'clock, in consequence of a communication which I received, I went to the house adjoining the prisoner's lodging—I saw Mrs. Willis, the landlady, and she handed me this Abyssinian gold chain, which I identified as the one I had put in the packet on Wednesday, the 9th—I then went into the prisoner's lodging and saw him, and said to him "I have called on you with regard to the packet about which I spoke to you on the 9th; I have had information that a chain had been found in the next garden by the proprietor of the house; I have seen the chain, which I have identified as the one enclosed in the missing packet"—he said "I know nothing about it, but I must say it looks very black against me"—I said "It could easily have been thrown from the window of your room to that place where it was found"—he said "I know nothing about it"—I then gave him into the custody of the police officer, Beck, who was with me.</p>

I live at 8, Norfolk Street, Strand—at present I have no occupation—on 12th December I saw the prisoner in company with a man named McVay—the prisoner asked me if I would change this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for him, which he showed me, together with this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said he had received the cheque from the writer of the letter, an old friend of his father's, Mr. Waddy, living at Harley House, Bath—he said the cheque was a good one, and was given him to defray the expenses of his outfit, as he was going to the Congo—I said if he would come back again for it I would let him have the money—he came back to my rooms in the evening of the same day, bringing the cheque to mo, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against it; it was all the change I had—next morning I saw him, and he asked me if I could change the cheque then; he had left it with me overnight—I said I could not change it myself, but I asked my landlord to change it for me, and my landlord gave me an open cheque of his own for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "Will you bring back the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when you change this open cheque?"—I was induced to part with the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the assurance on his part and his friend Mr. McVay that the cheque was a good one—I handed the cheque to my landlord, who afterwards made a communication to me about it—I next saw the prisoner on 29th December—I said "What about that cheque; are you going to settle it?"—I did not tell him that the cheque had returned marked "No account"—he said "If you give me time some arrangement will be made"—no arrangements having been made I afterwards gave him into custody—during the interval he told me he lived at 15, Red Lion Square—I went there with Sergeant Gregory and made inquiries—they knew him there; he was not living there—I took out the warrant on the 2nd—I am not certain what date he was taken in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a single woman, of 62, Russell Road, Holloway—on Sunday night, the 20th inst., between 10 and 12 o'clock, I was in Izant Road, a turning out of the Hornsey Road, when I saw the prisoners on the same side—Bryant put his arm round my neck; I released myself, and then he followed me and put his arm round my neck again—Dean came up as if he were going to protect me, and asked me what he was doing to me—I put my hand up and found Bryant had my brooch in his hand—I said "You have made a mistake, it is only a common one," and then he let go a bit, but he never took his arm away from my neck the second time—by that time we had got into the road where I lived, and one of them said "Now let us seduce her"—they did not effect their purpose—they got me against the railings on the opposite side—my dress pocket was turned inside out and the things gone, consist<lb/>ing of a silk handkerchief, bunch of keys, one large key, a purse, and two sixpences wrapped in paper in the purse—I ran down into a neighbour's place and told them what had happened, and two gentlemen came up the steps with me but could not see anybody, and they took me home—that was about fifty doors from where I lived—I told my mother and brother what had happened, and went to the station to give information—I next saw the prisoners at a florist's in the Seven Sisters' Road, nearly opposite our turning—I identified them and gave them in custody—I went to the station and saw them searched—two sixpences in a piece of paper were found on Bryant, and a silk handkerchief on Dean—the keys and purse were thrown away—I am sure the prisoners are the men.</p>

               <p>that is the other one; that is his companion"—I told them they would have to go to the station with me—they made no answer—the prosecutrix's brother assisted me—Bryant went quietly, but Dean got obstreperous, and I had to knock him down twice with my first—I had my stick drawn and told them what I should do if they attempted to get away—I took them to the station and they were charged with stealing a purse, two sixpences in a piece of paper, a silk handkerchief, a bunch of keys, a large key, and a brooch—I searched them and found two sixpences in the left hand trousers pocket of Bryant—on pulling out the two sixpences this piece of newspaper came out and fell on the floor (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prose<lb/>cutrix told the inspector before that the sixpences were wrapped up in paper, and also told what was on the paper—the paper was shown to her and she said that was the paper which her sixpences wero wrapped in—I then found 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in Bryant's watch-pocket—on Bean I found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 3 1/2. in bronze, and in the right-hand coat pocket a silk handkerchief with the initials which the prosecutrix told the inspector were on it, "J.

I live at 3, Albert Terrace New Church Road, Camberwell, and am a night hall porter in the employment of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, Printing House Square, where I have been for 23 years—on Sunday, 2nd December, the prisoner was employed in the engineers' department at the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> office, having to look after the electric light—in consequence of instructions I received I went to the prisoner at about 11.45 p.m. and told him that I had been informed he had insulted one of the overseers, and it was simply my duty to see that he immediately left the office—he told me iu reply that he had not insulted the gentleman—I told him I did not wish to have any argument with him, I had only to see that lie left the office—he requested that I should allow him to go or send upstairs for his character, but I persisted in not doing so, and he repeated that I should allow him to go up—I told him he must go—he asked me if I would allow him to finish his supper—I said, "Yes, but go imme<lb/>diately</p>

               <p>after"—I left him for a few minutes, and then returned and said, "Come my good fellow, come along"—he rose from his Beat and followed me up the staircase to the wicket-gate—he then made a firm stand, and persisted still that ho should be allowed to go ups'airs, but I remained firm and would not allow him, and he said, "You aro no man"—I called on the messenger to pull the catch to open the wicket-gate—the prisoner passed out, and I followed him to the folding doors inside the office—he then made a firm stand, still persisting in his demand to be allowed to go upstairs—I still refused, when he made use of a vile expression, which I cannot remember, and called on me to come outside—I did not go outside—I felt a blow in my groin immediately those words fell from his lips—I raised my arm, and felt two stab wounds in my left shoulder—I called out to George Putnam at the wicket-gate, "George, I am stabbed"—as I staggered round the prisoner followed me up with another blow in my back—I fell to the ground and partly lost conscious<lb/>ness—Putnam put me into a cab, when I was taken to Bartholomew's Hospital, where I was an inmate for 16 days—I still feel very low, and am an out-patient of the hospital—I have not been able to resume my duties.</p>

If I get the <hi rend="italic">sack</hi> from this office you will remember me the longest <hi rend="italic">bleeding</hi> day you ever lived"—that was in the engineers' shop, within two yards from where the tools are kept—I then said "You shan't touch another electric light here to-night, so you must leave the office"—I then went upstairs in the composing department to look after the lights, as the prisoner had knocked off, and I remained there some minutes, and then came down, and the prisoner was within about five or six yards of me—he said "If I go upstairs again I will punch Masson on the b——nose"—he is an over<lb/>seer upstairs—I immediately complained to Mr. Kilburn and to Fletcher as I passed the door, and said to him "Do not let him go upstairs any more to-night, as I have asked him to leave the office"—shortly after a policeman came and brought me this tool (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is called a rimer—it is sharp-pointed and tapers—there would be plenty of them in the engineers' shop—it was not the prisoner's duty to use such a tool or to carry one with him.</p>

I had two bottles of medicine, one of quinine, and one of cod liver oil. The doctor said I was very low and weak, and was to live as well as I possibly could.

                  </hi>. I am a painter, of 15a, Green Street, Chelsea—Matilda Sainsbury was my landlady, she was a widow and was forty-four years old—she had been ill for a long time and had been attending some dispensary, but had not obtained much relief—she was suffering from cold and difficulty of breathing, and complained that she was almost strangled in the night with phlegm, so she asked me to go to the prisoner and get some medicine for her, because her son had been under him with a bad cold—he had also given me medicine when I was ill—on Monday, the 10th December, I went to the prisoner's shop, 34, Bath Street, City Road—he is a herbalist—I told him that Mrs. Sainsbury had been under medical attendants three months, and they did not do her any good, and she was very weak, and not able to get out, that she was choked with phlegm, and that if he could give her some stuff to get rid of it I thought she would be all right—he gave me a phial filled with some fluid which he said was an emetic—it had written on the label "From a teaspoon to two table-spoonfuls"—he said that the whole of it would not hurt her—he then gave me some powders, and some plasters to be applied to her chest and back, and some pills—I paid him half-a-crown—he did not say how often the medicine in the bottle had to be taken—he said it would make her sick and remove the phlegm—the plaster was applied about 6 o'clock, and a little before 11, before she went to bed, she poured out in a wine glass what she considered was a table-spoonful of the medicine in the bottle—what she took was just down to the top of the label at the shoulder of the bottle—she only took one dose—her son was not present, he went upstairs shortly before she took it—about ten minutes afterwards she was taken with diarrhoea and used the utensil—she asked me to get her a little brandy and water, I did so, and she put it to her lips, but did not drink any; she handed it to me and sat in the arm chair—I turned to put the brandy on the shelf, and she got up and staggered—I caught her in my arms, she was unconscious—I called for her son, who went for a doctor, and I sent for my mother—I then put Mrs. Sainsbury on the sofa, my mother said "You can lay her</p>

                  </hi>, L.R.C.P. I live at Fulham Road, South Kensington—about 12.15 a.m. on 11th December I was fetched, and saw Mrs. Sainsbury on the sofa—I examined her, and in my opinion she had been dead about half an hour—she was cold, flabby, and covered with cold sweat—her pupils were rather dilated—I was shown this bottle, and took possession of it—exactly half had been taken from it, which would be a little over two table-spoonfuls—I tasted it, and so did my assistant, and came to the conclusion that it was hellebore—I sealed it up, and gave it to Dr. Stevenson—I made a post-mortem examination on the 13th, and found in the right lung adhesions to the chest, and she was suffering from chronic bronchitis—the left lung was very much contracted from disease, and almost gone, condensed—the brain was congested at the posterior portion, but not very much—the inner coat of the stomach was inflamed, and the bowels also—I took a portion of the stomach and a portion of the bowels, with their contents, put them into a jar, sealed it, and handed it to Dr. Stevenson—I tested the contents, and came to the conclusion that it was hellebore—I found some granules in the stomach, and handed some of them to Dr. Stevenson—the effect of hellebore would be almost the same as lobelia—the cause of death was collapse, syncope,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188401280044"/>
               <p>and my opinion is that she died from an irritant poison acting as a de<lb/>pressant on the heart's action and causing syncope—I have since heard that the stuff is lobelia; that is used as an emetic—I have never done so, but I use it very frequently as an expectorant—I use the tincture—I never use the powder or the seeds—there is a tincture made with spirits of wine and one made with other; that would be quite clear, and free from seeds—lobelia is Indian tobacco—about three grains of the dried seeds would be a dose—that is the way the prisoner uses it—I use from 10 to 30 drops of the tincture—30 drops would be equal to about four grains of the dried seeds—I should consider 28 grains a dangerous dose—if such a large dose fails to act as an emetic it would act as a depressant of the heart's action, bringing on faintness, and the appearance of the corpse was consistent with that death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made a mistake as to what had been taken; I thought it was hellebore—that is a poison which I believe is in the list of poisons forbidden to be sold—lobelia is not included in the list—I said before the Magistrate "The posterior portion of the brain was much congested"—I left out the word "much" to-day—there has been a great deal of discussion as to the properties of lobelia in medical works, and certain extracts from them were read to me at the police-court, with which I did not agree—I would give 30 drops of the tincture to a grown-up person—I do not agree that "In cases of diarrhoea a drachm of the powdered herb and seed of lobelia would be a proper dose"—I do not know Dr. Skelton, and have not known his books as an authority—I do not agree with this: "What is the form of the disease which we are called upon to treat must be the first consideration; if it is simply diarrhoea, prescribe lobelia, powdered herb, and seed, one drachm; cap<lb/>sicum (powdered cayenne) 10 grains; podophyllum peltatum (powdered mandrake), 20 grains"—that is a dangerous prescription—I understand the expression "powdered herb and seed"—in proper doses it is a proper remedy in cases of spasmodic asthma—I never heard of Dr. Elliottson, and do not know that he is considered a very great authority in the medical profession; I never heard of him—I agree that lobelia inflate is a most important medicine in proper doses—I have not heard of Dr. Kinglake as a medical authority—I agree with this if the patient is watched during the process of vomiting: "In some instances of difficult respiration it proves beneficial without occasioning nausea, but when sickness results from its use, so far from that being a reason for discontinuing it, it is an additional inducement for pressing it until full vomiting and additional relief is obtained"—I do not agree with this: "No particular heed need be entertained of its acting deloteriously;" nor with this: "It may, there<lb/>fore, in cases of oppressed respiration, especially when of the spas<lb/>modic character, be fearlessly administered"—I do not know that Dr. Elliottson introduced it into Europe—I do not agree with this (<hi rend="italic">From Breach's "Materia Medica</hi>"): "When a man is so sick as to be past cure, this emetic will relieve him and cause him to live longer and easier except in mortification, "I think it would act as an extinguisher—I do not agree with all American authorities—the books you have brought forward are probably herbalistic books—herbalists are not very popular with the medical profession as a rule, not being qualified men—homoeopathists are qualified men—I agree with homoeo<lb/>pathy to a certain extent—chloral hydrate is used to a great extent; it is dangerous—I prescribe it very often—it is often used by City gentle<lb/>men</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188401280045"/>
               <p>when they want a night's rest; they get a bottle and take it—I think people who deal in stocks and shares are the people to take it, and gentlemen who cannot sleep without it—fatal mistakes very often occur through it—if the lobelia does not produce vomiting I should not expect death to be instantaneous; the time would depend upon the state of the patient—the deceased's lungs were in a very diseased state, but the other parts were pretty healthy—you often get congestion of the brain during the death—I said at the police-court that the woman was in a dangerous state of health; that is true—the immediate cause of death was syncope; that means collapse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I consider lobelia a poison, but according to the manner it is used it may be a poison or a useful medicine—there are many dangerous poisons not included in the prohibited list, carbolic acid for one—it is not conclusive as to the poisonous nature of a substance if it is not in the list—I do not know Dr. Elliottson as a professor of mes<lb/>merism, he was before my time—I know that a man named John Stephens was tried here for administering lobelia with fatal results—I was not here—I have heard of John Stephens as a medical author of repute, not of good repute—Dr. Alfred Swaine Taylor is an authority on poisons—I agree with this: "Within the last few years there have been several inquests and trials for manslaughter in this country as the result of the improper administration of the leaves of the <hi rend="italic">Lobelia inflata</hi> by ignorant quacks calling themselves medical botanists and dealers in vegetable medicines. The medical evidence given on these trials showed that in large doses lobelia is a most noxious drug. Those impostors who profit by the prescription and-sale of this drug among the ignorant poor, maintain the doctrine that it cannot kill, and never has been known to destroy life. From inquiries recently made I have reason to believe that deaths from lobelia still frequently occur in northern countries. The noxious medicine is taken in secrecy under the direction of quacks, and any death arising from it is either concealed or referred to other causes." I agree with that—I know Woodward and Tidy on Forensic Medicine and Toxicology—Dr. Tidy was often called as an expert in prosecutions by the Treasury—speaking of <hi rend="italic">Lobelia inflata</hi> he says: "It is imported from North America in the form of compressed oblong cakes, which are sent over by the Shaking Quakers of New Lebanon, and are principally used by the quack botanist doctors who revel in the ominous name of <hi rend="italic">'Coffinites.'</hi> Coffinism is no innocent, harmless system; its absurd theory is that 'Heat is life, and the want of heat, disease,' and so cayenne pepper and lobelia are the two principal medicines of its professors, which they administer with no cautious or measured hand. Over and over again they assert what has over and over again been disproved, that lobelia cannot kill." I agree with that—I have known of many deaths from taking chloral incautiously.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am Professor of medical jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital—on 18th December Dr. Whitmarsh gave me a bottle and jar, one containing human stomach, the other one ounce of fluid matter; up to where I have marked the bottle—some is in the bottle now—I analysed it, and found it to be an acetic solution of lobelia very turbid, and there was a deposit of the herb, the seeds, and remainder of the leaves—the bottle when full would contain two and a half fluid ounces; a tablespoonful would be half an ounce—supposing it to have</p>

               <p>been full, half an ounce was missing—the strength was 28 grains of the seeds and leaves to an ounce—there would have been 70 grains if the bottle had been full—I examined the jar containing the stomach, and found a quantity of the lobelia and fragments of the leaves—the fluid shown to me contained six grains of lobelia in the half, which would be equivalent to 12 grains in the whole—the granules Dr. Whitmarsh spoke of were in the stomach, they were lobelia seeds—I found the stomach reddened, and the symptoms I heard during life are what I should expect in a case of death from lobelia—the stomach was congested, and if she had lived longer it would have gone to inflammation—it appeared as if some irritant had been given, and lobelia is an irritant—I should add that the acetic acid in which the lobelia is dissolved would also act as an irritarit—I do not think the death consistent with her having been choked or suffocated with phlegm—I have heard the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances and the mode of dying, and it does not appear a case of suffocation—there was no appearance which I should expect to meet with in death by suf<lb/>focation—two table spoonfuls of lobelia would not be a proper dose of lobelia such as you have here, but I think there would be no particular harm in a teaspoonful; I mean medicinal tablespoons, the old-fashioned tablespoon—a teaspoonful would contain 3 1/2 grains of this mixture of lobelia; that is the full medical dose—3 1/2 grains is the maximum dose of the British Pharmacopoeia—I have seen people suffer from great depression from full medicinal doses when they have not vomited—it is stated on high authority that thousands of deaths occurred from it at that time in America—it is well recognised among medical men as a very potent medicine and a poison—its bad character is not confined to England; it was introduced in America, and there have been trials there for murder and manslaughter by it, and there are works of authority upon it—some powders were handed to me; they were harmless, and the pills and capsicum were harmless in the dose in which they were given—the object is to cause vomiting when the drug is given in large quantities, but it is never so used by respectable medical authorities; they have given it up, owing to its dangerous character—if it does not act as as an emetic there is danger to life on account of its powerful depressing action.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never saw a person die from lobelia—I have not tried it on animals—I said before the Magistrate "Whatever authority might be quoted to me, I must retain my opinion that 28 grains is a dangerous dose."</p>

That fool of a doctor who gave evidence yesterday knows nothing about it; the medical science of this country is a fraud. She died of her ailments. God made the world and supplied it with herbs for every complaint, but those fools of doctors don't know how to use them; I do, they are enemies of mine"—he added that lobelia was struck out of the list of poisons by a Committee of the House of Lords either in 1857 or 1867—I went with him to his shop, 34, Bath Street—there were bottles and drawers there, just the same as a chemist's shop.</p>

I gave him some pills and powders and a plaister for the back and chest, also a small bottle of an expectorant, as he said she was choking and could not get up the phlegm. In the bottle was the acid tincture of lobelia. I told him to give her a teaspoonful as an expectorant, but she might take the whole bottle if she liked, it would not hurt her. I have given it to all ages, up to 80 years of age. On the bottle I wrote a tea-spoonful as an expectorant, but she might take a tablespoonful or the lot, it would not harm her. I have taken double the quantity myself; besides, the young man knew the use of it; he had taken it himself, several doses. There was no bottle like the bottle of lobelia near it, except there are two sorts, one weaker for children, and I think it was that sort I gave her. They are both acid tinctures. I keep no poisons in the house, so I could not have given her any. I do not keep any hellebore. I have been practising 34 years. I put down in a book what I gave to the woman. I knew the young man before; he came to me when giddy and when he had the gout. I buy my herbs and powder from the whole<lb/>sale herbalists.

                  </hi>, M.D., M.R.C.S. I practise at Brighton—I have been in practice over 32 years, during which period I have been in the habit of prescribing <hi rend="italic">Lobelia inflata</hi> daily, and have taken it myself in three-drachm doses—I have watched its effects and properties in different cases—it is not a poison, most emphatically not—I have administered it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188401280048"/>
               <p>to innumerable patients during the past 30 years, I can hardly give the number—I have a large practice—it is an invaluable medicine; there is nothing like it in the whole <hi rend="italic">Materia Medica</hi>—it is the most valuable medicine in the British Pharmacopoeia and in the whole of the books of medicine, either American or European—I have taken it myself in powder, in pills, and iu drachm doses; I have taken it in the Pharmacopoeia tincture and in syrup—I have administered a table-spoonful of the syrup every three hours with much benefit to a child very delicate and in a dangerous condition—when I have wished to produce emesis I have given three-drachm doses of <hi rend="italic">Lobelia inflata</hi>, of the thing described as such a dangerous drug, which I utterly deny; half seed and half plant—it is a tonic, an expectorant, and a pseudoretic, it is in my judgment the best emetic, and Mr. Bravo would have been alive now if he had used it—I have tried to poison animals with it—when the poison Bill was brought into the House we got guinea pigs from Covent Garden Market and tried to kill the little wretches, but they would not die, they grew fat instead, and Professors Clark and Jones struck it out of the poison list—I have heard the account given to-day by Doctors Whitmarsh and Stephenson that the unfortunate woman died from syncope—I come to that conclusion also, but she died from other things as well: from exhaustion, arising from long continued disease, having nothing to do with lobelia—no doubt the mucous accumulation in the bronchial tubes lessened the heart's action and caused fatal syncope—I have heard that she complained of being almost strangled, and that one of the witnesses had to pull some of the phlegm out of her throat; that is confirmatory of my views—the mixture given by the defendant containing 28 grains to the fluid ounce, if she had taken the whole bottle and there had been sufficient strength to throw off the accumulation of phlegm, the woman might have been alive now; but the table-spoonful which we know she did take would be perfectly innocuous in my opinion—in my judgment and experience I do not believe that the dose of 30 grains could in any way have accelerated her death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MEAD</hi>. I consider that there are no dangerous properties at all in the drug; it is impossible that there can be an excessive dose of it so as to endanger life—I know Dr. Taylor's book on poisons, but do not agree with him on this subject—I attribute the opinion of that eminent doctor to the copies of American writers, and the prejudice in the profession has caused all the bother and these many trials—the extract from Dr. Taylor's book ("Within the last few years," &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">as before</hi>) is not a medical opinion but an assertion—it is doubtful whether 10 to 20 grains of lobelia would act as au emetic in all cases—I have had to give a drachm dose every ten minutes until I got emesis, until the emetic effect was produced; it is so uncertain that you must watch it, there is such a difference in the constitution of individuals, idiosyncrasy I call it—it operates in one way on one and in one way on another—you have to give repeated doses until it produces emesis, but of course if you did not want an emetic I should not give you one—it is doubtful whether "When administered in 10 to 20 grain doses, lobelia acts as an emetic," I have never known it to act deleteriously in the largest doses—I never found any quantity to produce fatal effects in my 30 years' experience.</p>

Supposing emesis is not produced after four doses there is not the slightest danger—according to me it may be administered with impunity—if it is not thrown off it passes through the bowels as a gentle aperient—it has no special effect on the heart, not mischievously—I have not found it in my practice to have any action on the heart; the books say so, but it is not true—I pledge myself as a man of science that, failing to act as an emetic, it is not true that it acts upon the heart; I flatly contradict that—t, act as an emetic it would act, not on the heart but on the stomach—if it acts as an emetic and is rejected its action on every organ is stopped, but if it is not ejected it passes through the bowels.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MEAD</hi>. The cause of death so far as I have heard was syncope, failure of the heart's action, produced by the weak condition in which she was and the amount of disease and that alone—I consider that that would be sufficient to account for death—I have not known lobelia to affect the heart—I do not think it possible that that dose of lobelia could have affected the heart so as to have caused syncope—I am speaking from my personal experience alone—I should, be guided by the opinion of eminent authorities with regard to lobelia and its effects—I have read Dr. Taylor's work and recognise him as an eminent autho<lb/>rity—great weight is due to his opinion—it is not my experience that "the medical evidence given on those trials shows that in large doses lobelia is a most noxious drug"—I do not think that worthy of weight against my experience—I have not observed it to act deleteriously when administered in larger doses than from 12 to 20 grains—I should say that there is such an excessive dose as would be dangerous just as much as you may take a large amount of common salt and inflame the stomach and the person may die—I have known a patient take a tablespoonful of <hi rend="italic">Lobelia inflata</hi> in a dose, not of the tincture, but of the powder; that would be from three to four drachms, 240 grains, and with beneficial results, and that person was my mother—whether that is as potent as the tincture supposing the same quantity of material is used, depends on what you make the tincture with, not if you make it with acetic acid—a little water would have to be added to the 240 grains in a solid form, for it to be</p>

               <p>taken into the stomach—water would not extract the solid principle in a short time—a tincture made with acetic acid which would take out the alkaloid would act more powerfully; there is no doubt about that—what I wish to show is that a large quantity could be taken—I do not say that an unlimited quantity would not do harm—sometimes an excessive dose would be more beneficial than a small dose, because vomiting is what we want, but if it fails to act as an emetic I do not consider there would be any danger; it would pass through the bowels—I have not noticed that as it passes through the bowels it might do mis<lb/>chief as a depressant on the heart; I cannot say that it would not—it is uncertain in it a action; some people require more than others—you have no occasion to watch its action very closely—there is no danger if you do not—28 grains of the tincture is not unsafe in a suitable case—there is such an expectorant action that in some cases I should not give so much—in the deceased's condition I should not order the whole of this bottle-ful, 70 grains, to be taken without being by to see what its action was, for fear; not exactly for fear, but in case it did not have the emetic action—I should give it in smaller doses, twice instead of once; you cannot give all patients alike—if it was given all at once we might obtain more emetic action than we required, the sickness would be heavier—I have not observed any action on the heart; I do not think I would pledge my reputation that it has not—I said that it might be dangerous in an exces<lb/>sive dose, and it would be more so in the case of a weak person—if a person was nearly suffocated by phlegm, and had gone from dispensary to dis<lb/>pensary, and seen doctor after doctor, I should think it prudent to see the patient; and in any case. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Some of the authorised books give warning about lobelia being an uncertain and dangerous thing; would you think it right to run the risk of sending a bottle of that size to a patient you had never seen, a perfect stranger, knowing nothing at all about her; would it be safe to send her that bottle fill in the face of that warning; would you feel justified in risking it when you did not know the patient, and when she was in the state this woman was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The label on the bottle was two teaspoonfuls for an emetic; that would not be too much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potato salesman, of 6, Russell Street, Covent Garden Market—the prisoner was in my employment about three years ago as salesman and manager—in the course of business he would have to write in my books—he went to Jersey on business, and while there wrote these seven business letters to me—the first was on July 5th, 1883, and the last July 13th, 1883—when he came back he brought a woman to the place, he said his and her father were friends—I came home once or twice and found her in the room with him having tea, and I said she should not hang about the place—she went away, I saw her outside again afterwards—that was the end of the discussion at that time—the prisoner left my service in October, I think—with the exception of that discussion we were on friendly terms—between that time and the 20th December I saw him fiye or six times, I should think—my father died on the 23rd of November—between 11 and half-past 11 on the morning of the 20th of December I saw the prisoner in Covent Garden Market—we and some others went into the wine bar attached to Roberts's Hotel—we stayed there a long time, but the prisoner only stayed about two minutes; he had one drink and then said "I have an appointment, I am in a hurry," and went away—the next morning, Friday, 21st, I received this letter "A" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in this envelope, with the postmark Rugby Station—my mother gave me this letter "C" on the Sunday—when I received my letter I thought it might be some fun on the part of my friends, and I took it round the market and treated it as a lark, until I heard that my mother had received one as well as Mrs. Stafford—after I had received my third letter on Saturday morning I sent a man to Scotland Yard—I made inquiries at Euston, and about a week afterwards I got a photograph of the prisoner from Mr. Davis—on the Saturday week after receiving the letters, I saw the guard Hunt; he gave me a description of the man who had given him the letters to post anywhere out of London—after he had given me the description I showed him this photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which he identified—the Monday after that identification at Euston I consulted my solicitor—I went to an expert the day after receiving the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate "I never to my know<lb/>ledge had a quarrel with the defendant, he always treated me with friendliness and respect"—I offered a reward of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the station master on the Saturday after I received the letters, for the identification of the person who gave the letters to the guard; it was not put up—the notice was simply for the guard to come forward—that was a week before I saw the guard—I gave the guard 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after I had shown him the photograph—he gave the description and I showed him the photograph, which I had with me, at the same interview—he said the man had a largish nose and a thick black moustache—I asked him to come and have a drink—he was a teetotaller and drank coffee—then I showed him the photograph—I said "Is this at all like the man?" and he said "Yes"—I saw him on the Tuesday or Wednesday after that, and just spoke to him—I met him nearly every day that week—I went to watch him—I do not trust anybody—everybody has his price.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I got Mr. Inglis's report as to the handwriting on the 29th, the Saturday week after getting the letter, that was before getting the photograph—the guard said he should know his voice if he heard it—I went to the station master on the 22nd, the day after receiving the letters—I did not see the notice, it was put up by the station-master—I never saw any notice of reward—I watched the guard because the prisoner had been round to two of my witnesses, and I thought he might try and get the guard.</p>

I live at 15, Whitehall Place—I have known Mrs. Stafford fifteen or twenty years; she is a widow—I know nothing of the prisoner or Mr. Scott—I received this letter marked "B" and the envelope "B 1" on the morning of 21st December—I saw Mrs. Stafford and then went to Mr. Scott and put the letter into his hands with the envelope—on Saturday, 22nd December, I went to the place mentioned in my letter as "Tom Andrews, 96, Spitalfields," and saw the prisoner there—I said "I have come under rather unpleasant business; I don't know you or you me"—I told him what was in the letter, that I was asked to come and see him, and he would tell me something further, and that it was a seduction case concerning Mr. Scott—he said "Nothing of the kind; I know nothing of it; I have always found Mrs. Stafford quite respectable; I saw Mr. Scott only the day before yesterday, and he seemed all right to me then; I cannot make it out; I haven't written the letters, and know nothing whatever about them; if I had been you I would have torn it up and put it in the fire"—I said I had gone to Mr. Scott—the prisoner made an arrangement with Mrs. Stafford and me to meet him; he was in a cab; it was on the following Sunday weeklthink—I won't be sure whether he had been summoned at the police-court at that time very few words passed then; he said he hadn't written the letters, and if I didn't come to the Court he would subpoena me—I told him of course would come, as the matter did not concern me.</p>

                  </hi>. I have made the formation of handwriting my study—I have been a facsimilist for thirty years, and since Mr. Chabot's death in 1882 have been employed by the Treasury as an expert in hand-writing—the letters 1 to 7 and "A," "B," "C," with the envelopes" A 1," "B 1," "C 1," were given to me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a facsimile tracing from the letters "A," "B," "C," of particular words, and side by side the same words from the real handwriting of the letters 1 to 7 from Jersey—in "Russell" on the letters 1 to 7 and on envelope "A 1" the "R's" are alike, the "11's" are the same, the space between the "e" and "11" is similar—the word is done with one operation of the pen in both cases; the hand is not lifted from the paper—the figure "6" on 4 and 7 is identical with the figure "6" on "A 1"—the capital "8" of street on 4, 6, and 7, and "A 1," is begun about half way of the letter, and at a distance to the left of the downstroke; the top loop of the letter is small—the capital "C" in "Covent," 4 and "A 1," is a small "c" enlarged, and the "o" is very open—the capital "D's" in "Dear" and "December" in "A" and "B," and 1, 4, 5, and 6, have the top of the "D" carried on with a sweep of the pen to the next letter, "e"—the final "k's" are carried below the tail—in the word "better" there is the same curve to the "b" and the same "r," only one is more perfect—"one" in "A 1" and in 2 and 4 agree—under the "r" and "rs" of "Mr." and "Mrs." there is a slanting line or dash—there is a habit of compressing a word at the end of a line and running it down—the capital "E's" are of the same formation—in "A 2" and "B 1" and 4 and 2 in the word "told" there is an extra space between the "o" and "1," and the "1" is under the crossing of the "t"—in every instance the pen is not lifted from the paper—my opinion is that the same person wrote the letters and envelopes "A 1" and "B l"—after I pad made my report I saw Mrs. Scott's letter, and that confirmed my judgment.</p>

I have been an export in hand-writing for 35 years—for many years I have been engaged at the British Museum as facsimilist, and have published several works on autographs—I attended at the solicitor's and examined the letters in this case, and drew up a report—in my judgment the handwritings of the admitted and disputed letters have some similarities, but so have all writings—when a man writes a series of anonymous letters ho uses different styles—these look to me like a handwriting not disguised—there is a similarity in all the anonymous letters; the "Andrews" is precisely alike in all the libels, and is spelt with an" s," whereas Andrew spells his name without—I should attach no importance to what Mr. Inglis has pointed out—the sloping down at the end of the line is done by all people—the turns of the "k" are not all alike—I should not depend on one of the things he has pointed out—the figure "6" is as common a 6 as you will find—the "s's" are not alike in Russell; the "R" and, "H" are very common, the "D" is not joined, it is separate; the "C" in "Covent" is a very common form of C; the "r" and "o" are not alike in the different letters—the bottoms of these "D's," in Dear, are very different—the words "better" are not alike, the final "r's" are very different; the words "one" are not alike, because the final "e" turns round with a curl, and the other one is dragged out—I don't know if the "Mr." is put forward as being like Mrs.—there is no rosemblance—here there is only one dash, and there there are two—I don't consider the capital E's alike, one begins with a nice upstroko, the other is twisted round with a general flourish—the "o's" in the anonymous letters are sometimes made like a "v"; some of the disputed "o's" are open, and one closed, and in the admitted letters the "o's" are closed—the "Andrews" would not bo so aliko in a disguised handwriting—the anonymous differ from the admitted letters in the letter "f" and a particular kind of "p," the top of "i," and "t"—I should expect to have always found those in his handwriting—I have seen the</p>

Andrew came I told him he came to me at his peril, and if I found him out he would only be throwing his money away—the anonymous does not differ from the admitted only in being more upright—I think "E" in "Kussell" is not formed alike in both cases, and the "r" in "better" is different—I cannot swear that the word "better" was not written by the same man as wrote the memorandum—I was a witness in Sir Francis Truscott's case—I gave my best opinion that it was his writing.</p>

Hales is pretty well known in Clare Market as "Jimmy Hales"—he was originally five feet seven inches in height, but has shrunk down to his present size, his legs being bowed out—I have been in my shop 12 months—I cannot say how many people have occupied the workshop during that time—there was a fat</p>

               <p>woman on show there—I remember some dispute or the show being broken into—Hales and his companions used to go into the shop before Mr. Morley had it, and caused a great nuisance by the noise they made—I know there is a fruiterer's shop there, but I do not know thtit Hales works there—I know he has a potato can and stands outside the Arti<lb/>choke public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Clare Street, Clare Market, and was with the last witnes on 28th December shortly after 1 o'clock—as we were going into the house I heard a noise and saw lights through the fanlight of No. 16—I did not know what it was, and being rather inquisitive I went to look over the fanlight, and as I was going to get up, Hales opened the door—he shut the door again and stopped inside for a few minutes, and my uncle, Mr. Hubble, went upstairs—I stayed outside—Hales came out and said "Are you going upstairs?"—I said "Not just yet"—he said "Good night, my <hi rend="italic">sonnie</hi>" and went down the street and I went upstairs—I also heard heard him say "good night" to somebody inside I thought—I did not hear anything about it until the next morning—I did not know that the shop was occupied.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant E</hi>). Between 10 and 11 o'clock a.m. on 28th December I went to 16, Clare Street and examined the door in the passage which leads into the shop—I found the flaps and padlock had been forced off, apparently by some instrument—in consequence of inquiry I searched for Hales, and found him at about 9 o'clock the same evening in the "Sun" public-house, Clare Street—I said "I shall take you into custody Hales, for being concerned in breaking into the shop, No. 16, Clare Street, and stealing 11 chairs, value 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "You have made a mistake"—I then took him to the station and placed him with seven other men, and he was picked out by Hubble as the man he saw in the shop at 1.15 a.m.—he was then charged—at about 9.45 the same evening I was in Stanhope Street, Clare Market, when I saw Varnell wheeling a costermonger's barrow up the street, with something on it covered over with a rug—I stopped him and said "What have you got there?"—he made no answer, and I pulled this rug off and found four of the chairs on the barrow which had Been stolen from the shop—Detective Kenna was with me, and he had some conversation with him and he took him into custody—I afterwards found all the other chairs at 39, Lower George Street, Chelsea, a secondhand clothes shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Vestry Clerk of the parish of St. Mary, Islington—I have held that position since March last—on 25th March a contract was made between the Vestry and the defendant Williamson with reference to the supply of flints and other road materials—I produce the contract—since that date he has been the contractor for road materials—Clarke has been surveyor to the Vestry for a number of years, and was so up to 6th November last—Jordan was principal clerk in the Highways department; Clarke was his superior—there is a High-ways Committee of the Vestry for the purpose of controlling and con<lb/>ducting tho business of the highways of the parish—for the purpose of the roads and highways the parish is divided into two districts, the eastern and western—for the eastern district there are three road foremen, Ward, Byford, and Barber, each having a certain section of the roads under his sole control—the Highways Committee usually meet for business once a fortnight—when materials were required for the repair of the roads the foreman gave information to Clarke or Jordan as to his requirements—it was Jordan's duty to enter those requirements in a book called the Surveyor's report book, which book was placed before the Highways Committee, of which Mr. Bradfield was the chairman—Clarke would always be present when the requirements were discussed, and since I have been Vestry Clerk I think I have always been present—discussions would frequently take place between the members of the Board and Clarke—when the materials were passed, the book was initialled or signed by the chairman—a bookwas kept called the Road material order book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was Jordan's duty to enter in this book the amounts required of the contractor to each road, on the order and on the counterfoil—the surveyor would be the authority, and his signature would be required to the half that was torn off and taken away—I have the order of 11th October before me—the counterfoil is in Jordan's writing, and the initials at the bottom are Clarke's—I am dealing with the Cottenham Road only; there are two orders of the same date—there is an order for Cottenham Road, 250 yards; Andover Road, 200; Fairbridge, 95; College Street, 80; Charles Street, 50; Giffard Street, 50; St. Pancras Eoad, 100; Hilldrop Crescent, 150; Tufnell Park Koad, 150—I have here the flimsy of 11th October—I recognise Jordan's writing on it and Clarke's signature at the bottom—it bears the same date as the counterfoil, 11th October, 1883—in the flimsy it is: "J. Williamson, Cottenham Road, 200 yards of flints; Andoter Road, 150; Fairbridge Road, 75; College Street, 50; Charles Street, 40; Giffard Street, 30; St. Pancras Road, 80; Hilldrop Crescent, 150; Tufnell Park Road, 50." There is a printed notice at the bottom of the counterfoil: "N.B. No account will be recognised unless the order is given before the delivery of the goods or the commencement of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188401280065"/>
               <p>works, on a printed form signed by the surveyor." When the actual order is written out, a press copy of it is taken by the clerk—there is a foremen's room in the Vestry Hall—the flimsy, which ought to be an exact copy of the press copy, is sent to the foremen's room in order that the foremen may learn what quantity to expect on their respective roads, and after they have taken the quantities I understand the flimsy was destroyed—the accounts were sent in monthly, and were placed before the Highways Committee—I always understood that Jordan and Clarke were present before the Committee, but I was never present myself, so I cannot speak to having seen them there—I have before me the Sep<lb/>tember account for the eastern district, which was passed and paid, and it is signed "Correct as to quantities. B. W. Clarke, Surveyor"—that account appears to have been passed by the Committee—it was paid in another cheque for a larger amount—I have that cheque and William<lb/>son's receipt for the amount—on Nov. 6 there was a meeting of the High-ways Committee at the Vestry Hall, at which Clarke was present—Jordan was in attendance in the building, ready to be called if necessary—the sur<lb/>veyor's report book was placed before the Committee by Clarke, showing what materials he required for the parish; a discussion arose between him<lb/>self and the Committee asto certain materials—I did not take much notice of it until a question arose as to 50 yards of flint said to be required for Cottenham Road; upon that he was asked by some member of the Com<lb/>mittee what quantity of flints he had already had for Cottenham Road—he replied 250—the foreman, John Barber, was sent for, and he was asked what quantity of flints had been delivered on Cottenham Road—he replied 200—Clarke was then asked to produce the Road journal—he left the room with a view of getting Jordan to find it, or finding it him<lb/>self—ultimately the Road journal was produced; Cottenham Road was referred to, and there were found debated to Cottenham Road 250 yards—then certain tickets were sent for, and were brought up I think by Jordan—I remember distinctly this packet of 23rd October—this bundle of tickets particularly attracted my attention, because the foreman Barber was asked how many yards he had had in Cottenham Road on 23rd October, and he referred to his green memorandum book, and he stated that 18 yards were delivered on that day—he was then shown this bundle of tickets, and asked to look at the endorsement—he appeared quite surprised, and said he could not understand how the 48 came there—the endorsement shows 48—he was quite taken aback—he offered no ex<lb/>planation; he simply said he could not understand it—Jordan was in attendance during this time, and he and Clarke were asked if they had any explanation to give—I do not know that Jordan said anything; I am not positive—Clarke stated, as far as I remember, that he knew nothing about it, or could not understand it, or something to that effect—the Committee suspended them forthwith, and directed me to take-over their papers and the keys of their office and desks—I think Clarke gave me his keys in the room where the Committee were sitting—I went downstairs with Jordan; he took out of a locker in his office, which was unlocked for the purpose, the remainder of the October tickets; that account not being passed, he had them locked up in his desk—I asked him for them, and he gave them to me and his keys—I have had the tickets ever since, except when they were being examined—I then locked them up in the office of Clarke and Jordan—Clarke's room was away</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188401280066"/>
               <p>from what we call the Highway Office—we also impoundod the foremen's books—I returned to the Committee, and the meeting broke up in con<lb/>fusion—I caused a further examination to be made of Jordan's office next day, and also of Clarke's room—I handed Mr. Henderson the keys of Jordan's desk, and he brought them back during the day—when I looked through the books I found these pieces of black paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a few days afterwards Mr. Henderson handed mo this stylus—as far as I know, Jordan and Clarke had no use for that or for the black paper in the ordinary legitimate business of the Vestry—I see on the black paper "10 yards flints" very distinctly, and under it a name, which has been destroyed since I first saw it—when I first saw it, it was Thurlow—J. Thurlow was one of the foremen of the western district—I can see the name with this glass—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the ticket of October 18,1883, signed by Thurlow—it is endorsed, "10 yards of flints, Giffard Street, J. Thurlow"—I discover on the papertraces of that endorsement—I have in the same bundle what I take to be the genuine signature from which it has been traced—there are the marks of the stylus distinct upon it—there is a mark as of a thumbnail across the name Thurlow since I found it—on November 7, by the order of the Committee, I sent for Williamson to the office and told him the Committee required his October account—he came, and at that interview he produced, not the account, but this statement in Jordan's writing, which be gave me to understand he was to make his account from—I asked for the counterfoils of his delivery tickets for October, and for the original orders—he gave me a heap of counterfoil tickets but no orders; I think he said he did not keep them—the Vestry have nothing to do with the tickets; they are provided by Williamson—I don't think the Highways Committee were aware of the flimsies at all—these are the counterfoil tickets of October 11: Andover Road, 9 yards; there are 5 tickets, 4 twos and a one, and in the account in Jordan's writing 38 yards of flints are charged on October 11—Williamson's tickets for October 12 are missing, but on October 13 here are 16 of his tickets for 32 yards of flints, 28 in Andorer Road and 4 in Fairbridge—the statement says 52—the tickets found in Jordan's desk are 26 for Andover Road, showing 48 yards, and 4 yards for Fairbridge, making 52—looking at the endorsement I find "13th October, 1883. Andover Road, flints, 48 yards. J. W. Barber"—as to the 4, something has been erased, and the 4 or part of it has been sub<lb/>stituted—I find a mistake has been made in the heading of some of the tickets, and 15th October has been put for 13th—on 15th October Williamson's counterfoils add up 44 yards, and the 44 yards in Jordan's account is correct—I find that on the 16th the delivery ticket brought me by Williamson corresponded with what is charged in Jordan's account, and the same answer applies to the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, and 22nd—I see no alteration in the figures or any mark of the stylus; the initials are signed by an ordinary pencil—Williamson's tickets for the 23rd represent 18 yards, and the statement is 48 yards—Jordan's bundle says "23rd October, 1883. Cottenhani Road, flints, 48 yards. J. W. Barber"—I see signs of an erasure on the 4—there are 26 tickets—certain of the gangers' initials appear to have been traced with a sharp-pointed instrument which has marked through to the back—on the 24th and 26th the accounts tally—on the 26th Williamson adds up 83 yards; there are 17 tickets, 6 are ones and the others twos—the account for the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188401280067"/>
               <p>26th is 53 yards, and Jordan's bundle says "Flints, 53 yards"—the 5 is an alteration—the ganger's initials appear to be marked with a different pencil, and there is a similarity about the writing—the 30th tallies—on the 31st Williamson handed me four tickets representing 7 yards of flints in Canonbury Square, but the statement shows 27 yards of flints, and Jordan's tickets show 27 yards; the alteration is not so palpable because there is no erasure, but I am sure there has been some<lb/>thing because the incline of the figures is different—the day journal for October agrees in every case with Jordan's tickets—each road is debited in the Road journal, and the total amount debited in October to each road corresponds with the additions of Jordan's bundle of tickets, and in the accounts in Williamson's hands, and with the counterfoil orders—I went into the strong room and found a number of tickets relating to the delivery of flints at the eastern district in September; there are none on September 1, but there ought to be, as there was a delivery I know—on September 3 I find 54 tickets corresponding with the September account, and 54 are charged and paid for—there are none for September 4—on September 5 I find tickets representing 44 loads charged for and paid—I find 10 tickets for September 6 representing 20 yards; there are two endorsements, one by Ward, the road foreman: "6th September, '83. Brand Street. 20 yards flints. E. Ward," and the other, in Jordan's writing: "6 yards hoggin, 44 yards flints"—44 is charged and passed and paid for—on September 71 find nine tickets representing 18 yards, and another bundle of five representing 10 yards—the endorsement on the first lot is "September 7, '83. Brand Street, 88 yards flint. E. Ward," and o'n the next, "10 yards flints, Compton Road. T. Byford;" and another in Jordan's writing, "6 yards hoggin and 56 yards flints"—56 yards are charged and paid for; some of the tickets are gone—Jordan makes the final summary—I find on the 10th eight tickets representing 15 yards; the road foreman's endorsement is "13 yards flints, Alwyne Road. J. Byford"—the summary in Jordan's writing is "2 yards hoggin, 64 yards flints," and 64 are passed and paid for—September 11, 12, and 13 agree; there are no tickets for the 14th, but 39 yards are charged in the account—the 15th, 16th, 17th and 19th tally—on September 20th here are two tickets, "Durham Boad, flints, 4 yards. W. Barber"—the endorsement is "8 yards hoggin," and 60 yards are charged in the account and paid for—September 21st and 22nd are correct—on the 24th here are 15 tickets for Lennox Road, representing 30 yards, and four for Windsor Road, representing 88 yards—the endorsement is "Lennox Road, flints, 30 yards. T. W. Barber"—the summary is 1 yard hoggin; 75 paid for—on 26th September there are no tickets, but 94 yards are charged for—on the 27th there are nine loads, five tickets, there being a one—the endorsement is "27th September," 1883. Windsor Road, flints 9 yards. J. W. Barber"—the summary is 65 yards flints charged and paid for—September 28th and 29th and October 1st tally—there are 1,278 charges on Williamson's account as the total delivery to the eastern district charged and paid for, that is calculated at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard; and there is an overcharge of 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for flints in the eastern district in September—I produce three of Williamson's tickets tied together, which purport to be receipts for ballast on roads; they were found in Henderson and Jordan's locker—they are apparently genuine and are initialled "G. R." by the ganger—15 tickets were found</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188401280068"/>
               <p>in Jordan's desk with the others, representing 2 yaids of ballast, saved apparently by the carmen, but no initials of gangers—one is dated November 5th, and on the back of the three genuine tickets the endorse<lb/>ment in ink is "5th November, 1883. Drayton Point, 6 yards ballast. E. Ward, N. R."—that means new roads—before the 6 there is a 3 in pencil, which corresponds with the number of yards on the three doubtful tickets, so that if it had been entered over it would have represented 36 yards instead of 6.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. I should say that Clarke's duties would be principally out of doors—St. Mary's, Islington, is a very large parish; I cannot give the mileage, but it is 1,030 Statute acres, and I have the superintendence of all the roads in the parish, and visit them to see what is required according to their state of repair—Clarke's were principally outdoor duties—250 yards are ordered on a certain road; the tickets come in for three weeks by instalments, and until the whole of them come in and are seperated to the particular roads you cannot compare them with the order—if it is an honest transaction they would correspond with the tickets and with the amounts in the counterfoils—it was Clarke's duty to initial the counterfoils, and the bodies of the orders ought to correspond with them—it was also Clarke's duty to write his signature in the corner of the original order—the whole oi the writing, with the exception of the initials on the counterfoils and the signatures in the corner, is Jordan's—a flimsy is supposed to be a counterfoil of the original order, and also repeating Jordan's writing, except the signature—if Jordan had destroyed the original order and substituted a false one and took the flimsy, he would not have had Clarke's name on the flimsy and the flimsy would not show the number—if he had made a false original he could have taken the whole of the body without the signature—it would be possible to do it if the other portion was covered with a piece of paper—there was nothing to prevent Clarke perfectly <hi rend="italic">bond fids</hi> when he saw the counterfoil was correct, or believing it to be correct putting his signature in blank before the original was filled in, if he trusted Jordan—I should say the Committee, at the end of each month, would go through the tickets and see that they corresponded with the amount in the counterfoils, but I am not positive—I know that it was Clarke's duty, but I do not suppose the Committee did so to the same extent—I do not think lean say that it was their duty, and I do not knot whether they did so or not—Jordan produced the October accounts from his own room and locker; they were in his custody—I cannot say whether the October tickets had ever passed into Clarke's possession at the time of the inquiry—Clarke voluntarily gave me his keys—this order-book was, I think, found in his room.</p>

When I saw Williamson on 7th November he produced for my inspection the account produced in Jordan's writing—I should call Williamson an illiterate man—I should hardly like to say whether he is capable of making up such an account as this—some of the contractors are men of education—when they were illiterate it was not the practice for Jordan to make up their accounts for them—I understood Williamson to say that his account would be made up from a statement furnished him by Jordan—I do not think he said any<lb/>thing about whether it had been examined by him or by any one acting for him—the interviews took place at my office, and I think he</p>

From the 1st to the 8th September in<lb/>elusive, no flints were delivered on my roads—I was not present then—it is from my book—I went away for my holiday on the 1st and returned on the 10th—on the 10th I have 9 yards in my book at Durham Road—that is all on that day—on the 11th, 25—on the 14th, Durham Road 5, Windsor Road 4—according to my book I did not receive 39 loads on that day—on the 20th September, Durham Road 4, Lennox Road 6,10 altogether—I did not receive 60 for those two roads on that day accord<lb/>ing to my book—on the 23rd, Lennox Road 20, Durham Road 31, and Windsor Road 8, that adds up 59 altogether, not 79—on the 26th, Elthorne Road 63, Kingsdown Road 1, that is 64, not 94—on the 27th, Elthorne Road 6, Windsor Road 9; 15, not 65—the totals I got in Sep<lb/>tember were Durham Road 200, not 250, Windsor Road 70, not 90, on Lennox Road 170, not 220, on the Kingsdown Road 100, not 150, on the Elthorne Road 150, not 200.</p>

Perhaps from 20 to 200 lineal yards of road might be under repair at one time—at one part men would be picking up, at another receiving, and at another spreading—from four to ten men were employed on the Cottenham Road—sometimes I had two lengths to attend to at a time; it may be in neighbouring roads, and I would go from one to the other and see they were properly picked, then spread and rolled—the ganger would superintend the delivery of the flints—I merely know of the quantity received by the endorsement on the tickets and the tickets I received—my duty was merely to receive the tickets and endorse them—this matter was brought to my knowledge on 6th September—I should have no personal recollection of what was</p>

               <p>delivered at any particular day unless I referred to my book—the reason I have beon able to give my answers is because I was permitted to look at my book at the police-court and before I went there—I was first asked about the matter before Committee, and my book was before me—the "3" of "38, Andover Road, 11th October," is not my writing—I could have sworn it was not my "3" without having looked at the book—I could have pledged my oath the "4" in "48" on 13th October was not mine without looking at the book—on 23rd October the "4" is not mine, and it is scratched; I never scratched; if I had made a mistake I should have written it over again on another ticket—I believe the chair<lb/>man on 6th November suggested I should hold it up to the light and see if it had been scratched—I should say the "4" is like mine—I never made the "5" on 26th October—I estimate the amount of flints required in my district, and other foremen in their districts—my estimate is to take the length and width, and calculate up by figures—I don't depend on the calculation within six yards at all times—an overplus would be added on to the next road repaired—they would go into the order I had given into the Vestry in the first instance—Byford took my place when I was away in September—I have no knowledge of what occurred at that time—I saw Mr. Dewey perhaps twice in connection with this matter after the interview at the Vestry, when the chairman drew my attention to these tickets—I once saw Mr. Bicketts, the prosecuting solicitor, at Mr. Dewey's office—my statement might have been taken down; I signed no document.</p>

Byford"—the "7" is my figure, but not the "2"—I remember I received seven loads on that day for Canonbury Square—in my book I have an entry on 6th September, "Compton Road, 4 yards;" on 7th, "Compton Road, 10, Alwyn Road, 8 yards;" on 10th, "Alwyn Road, 15."</p>

Y." on the tickets for 11th and 14th October is cut too far through the paper for it to be mine—this is the pencil I used for marking all of them—I don't suppose I have sharpened it for a month—I don't know that I have sharpened it since 11th October—I always have it in my pocket and never borrow anybody else's—I never had it sharper than it is now—the "J.

I am 28 years of age—I have been a clerk in the Vestry 10 years; I went there soon after Clarke became surveyor—I have pleaded guilty to this indictment—I recollect a conversation with Mr. Clarke about 12 months ago—he broached a certain subject to me; he suggested the idea of charging for more stuff than was put upon certain roads—he also said, in consequence of the Vestry not giving him an increase, which they had almost resolved to, that I ought to help myself, conjointly with him—I had asked for an increase of my salary from the Highways Committee; they referred it to the Vestry, and the Vestry refused it, and then this conversation took place—I don't know that the mode of doing it was suggested at that time—he broached it on several occasions to me before I fell in with the idea—the idea was to put more stuff before the Highways Committee than the foremen were to have afterwards allowed them—the "works required" book, that is the report book which was put before the Committee, showed say a certain amount, and if that was passed by the Committee the counterfoil was made to correspond with that, but the order should be so much less—I cannot tell you the date when we began to do anything in furtherance of this scheme; it was within the last year, about the end of July or August—some of the initials upon these tickets of 11th October were traced by me—sometimes I used the pencil; I used to have a hard pencil—the tickets were brought to me; I cannot always say who brought them; my messenger has given them to me; they have been left in the office&amp; they would not come to me properly; no doubt they oame from Williamson—sometimes Clarke has handed them to me, and sometimes my own messenger at the office has given them to me—these tickets of 23rd October are the same; the initials were traced by me—the endorsement is in Barber's handwriting—I altered the "4" into 48—in some of these tickets the figures have initials pat on by me, and the endorsement altered by me—when Clarke brought blank tickets to me he said, "These have been left for you this morning by Williamson"—these 26 are the same; the initials put on by me, and the endorsement altered from 33 to 53 by me—these of the 31st have been altered in the same way, and the endorsement is altered by me from 7 to 27—when the Highways Committee had passed certain quantities for different roads an order was made out by me next morning—I first wrote the counterfoil, and then wrote the order out on the other fiide—the counterfoils were not initialled or the orders signed in full by Clarke in blank to my knowledge—after I had made out the counterfoil and the order I obtained the initials of the counterfoil and the signature to the order from Clarke; I made both parts out in his presence—I learnt from him what to put on the body of the order—I have before me the counterfoil of 11th October, and on the counterfoil is "Cottenham Road, 250 yards," on the flimsy "200" only—Clarke told me to put the "200" there—Andover Road on the counterfoil is "250," on the flimsy is "200"—Fairbridge Road is "95" on the counterfoil and "75" on the flimsy—I got that quantity from Clarke—I copied the order of 11th October myself after Clarke had appended his signature to the order—he signed it in my presence—the order was still in the book when he signed it, it tad not been torn out—I have before me the order book of 25th July—</p>

               <p>I see Alwyne Road on the counterfoil, 45 yards of flint—an order would be made out on a piece of paper for that, corresponding with the counterfoil, excepting the quantity—that order was filled up in the same way as that of 11th October—speaking from, memory I should say that the same quantity was not put on the order as appears on the counterfoil; it would be less on the order than the counterfoil—I obtained the quantity to put on the order from Clarke—the Road journal was always kept in Clarke's room, and the Day journal also—I made entries from the bundle of tickets into both of those books—I made the entries in the Day journal from the tickets in the clerk's office, and I put on the initials there—Williamson's accounts were sent in monthly—he used to get them written out for himself from the rough statement supplied by me—I have done that pretty well since his con<lb/>tract commenced—the plan of charging too much was done principally through Clarke—I have had conversation with Williamson about it—I cannot call to mind what the conversation was; it was that he should supply the tickets and then charge in his account so much extra, that he should furnish blank tickets, and charge ultimately for the amounts entered upon them—I recognise this September account, which was paid for in October—I do not know the handwriting—I forwarded Williamson a rough statement—the accounts would be delivered by hand, and it would be Clarke's duty to check them—the book would no doubt be laid upon the table—Clarke would see it—it was put in a pigeon-hole in his room until it was really wanted to be used for checking and signing—he would check it with the tickets—I had the custody of tne tickets until the accounts were rendered, and then they were put in Clarke's room in the pigeon-hole—this is Clarke's signature "certified correct as to quantity"—I should say that September account has been paid—the cheques don't pass through my hands; I never saw anything of the money—I have received money for the overcharge from Williamson after each account has been paid; it was generally handed to me in notes—I have had it handed to me at the Vestry—I cannot say that I have seen Clarke and Williamson together after an account has been passed and paid—I have had conversation with Clarke after accounts nave been paid—they have had reference to the smallness of the amounts of money—he has asked me how mucli the amount of overcharges has been, and I have told him, and then he has remarked that it ought to be so much each, not so much to divide among three—a cheque was given for the account of 23rd October—I could not say that I had any conversa<lb/>tion with Clarke after that—I was suspended on 6th November—I can't say that I had any conversation with Clarke in reference to any of these matters after 23rd October—this statement of the October account is my handwriting; I gave that to Williamson on that afternoon, before the Highways Committee met—I can't say that I had any conversation with Clarke about that October account—nothing more than usual passed be<lb/>tween me and Williamson when I gave it to him, only that that was his account to be made out, nothing else—after the accounts had been passed the tickets were put in the basement in the Muniment Room—a messenger put them there—they were thrown in the Highways Department, and he tied them up in brown paper, and he took them downstairs—some of the September tickets were burnt; I believe I burnt them—Clarke was present—they were burnt in his room, so as not to show the overcharge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188401280077"/>
               <p>if any one looked at the amount upon them—I had no conversation with Clarke before they were burnt; they were burnt directly after the Com<lb/>mittee had broke up when they had passed the September account—I had no conversation with Clarke except that the tickets were to be burnt—he held the door, and I burnt them while he held the door—I had burnt tickets before that—I don't know that he was present on previous oc<lb/>casions—they were always burnt in his room; at least, I beg pardon, once I believe I burnt them in the furnace downstairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. I pleaded not guilty to forgery yesterday—I don't know whether you term altering the tickets forgery; I did alter the tickets; I can't say that I know that that is forgery; I did not know that it would be constituted forgery—I changed the figures on the endorsements; I did not look upon that as forgery—I thought when I pleaded not guilty to forgery that I was telling the truth—I understood from my Counsel yesterday that I should be called as a witness; that was the first time I had made up my mind to be a witness—I do not expect to get anything by doing so—in a great measure I did it to further the ends of justice—I have not furnished a statement to the prosecution—I have not written a statement; I have not made any statement whatever—I have not seen anybody as to what statement I was to give; I was only asked by my Counsel to give evidence, nothing else—it was Clarke's suggestion that as I was not to get a rise in my salary I should do the best I could to help myself, and I did help myself conjointly with him—I can't say that I have ever seen Williamson hand Clarke a single coin—I spent the money I had; I can't say that I spent it all on myself—I have given money to Clarke—I don't know why I did not tell Mr. Grain so; he did not ask me, that was the reason—I gave the money to Clarke at the time I received it, in notes and gold I believe; I can't say particularly where; sometimes I have handed it in his room, another time I recollect giving him some in the Florence public-house, which is next door to the Vestry Hall; I could not say anywhere else—there have been people by when I have given it to him, but they have not known what I have given to him—people were standing by on the occasion in the Florence public-house; I could not name them—I handed him notes; I could not tell you the amount; it may have been 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I could not say the exact amount; I gave him a third, not a third of what I received from Williamson, half of what I received, a third of the whole amount—I could not say how often I have handed money to Clarke, four or five times it may have been—I do not keep a pocket-book or note-book; I kept a record of the amounts per month on a piece of paper—it is not in my possession; I could not tell you where it is; it was left at the Vestry Hall when I was suspended; in Mr. Clarke's room, by the side of the cabinet, under other papers—I believe there were one or two months' records there—I say there are at the present time, if they have not been destroyed, one or two pieces of paper with records on them—I believe they are in my handwriting; I last saw them there on 6th November, the day I was suspended—I did not go back to Clarke's room after I was suspended—the keys were taken away from Clarke at that time, and from me as well—at that time these pieces of paper were in that room—I don't suppose they would show that Clarke had received a share; it was merely a record of what quantities we put on in the month, and stolen; I don't think I stole them—there would be nothing on the face of the papers to show that I had not received it all myself—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188401280078"/>
               <p>there would not be anything upon the paper to show than anything had been received—there was nothing upon it to show that there had been a division of the profits of this fraud between us three, nor was there any<lb/>thing to show that the money had not passed entirely into my pocket—it was a record of the overcharge that Williamson had made; it was just rough scribble; it would be in my handwriting entirely—I will swear that Clarke held the door while I burnt the tickets—the tickets could have been taken away; I could have carried them away in my pocket, and so could Clarke, or thrown them down the water-closet—I first wrote the counterfoil from his book and then I wrote the body of the order—I took the impression of the whole of the order from the flimsy; I will swear that I did not take an impression of Clarke's signature alone; he was the person who suggested the whole fraud to me—I have been under Clarke for ten years—I could not fix the time at which he first made the sugges<lb/>tion to me; it was about a twelvemonth ago I should say—he said that the Committee having recommended my increase, and the Vestry not sanc<lb/>tioning it, it served me right; that I should help myself, and he sug<lb/>gested that we should both do it—it could not be done without his assistance—he said it would have to be done, and he could not do it without my assistance, so he had to unfold the scheme to me, he unfolded the whole scheme to me and the manner in which it should be done—I was very unwilling at first; he persuaded me, having known him so many years—it didn't require a great deal of persuasion that I know of, my small salary and the prospect of making more money otherwise induced me to join in it—I cannot say that I required such a tremendous lot of persuasion—I thought it would be a very risky thing, and I told him the risk that we ran, and he remarked to me that he could guard off any inquiries if it should arise, and then I consented—I did not consent when he first broached it to me, in fact I didn't understand what he meant—we had one or two conver<lb/>sations before I consented, then I could not help understanding him, he made it so plain—it was all by conversation, not by writing—he didn't sketch out in writing any manner in which the fraud was to be practised—I do not know that there is any piece of writing in possession of the Vestry connecting Clarke with these frauds—pretty well every document is in my handwriting, except that he signed all the orders—I don't think that there is any other document in his writing; it is all my writing except the foreman's requirements—when I had supplied the forged tickets they would correspond with the counterfoil of the order—if he had known that the tickets were forged and had compared them with the counterfoil thoy would no doubt have corresponded in the total-Clarke suggested the stylus, that I swear, and he wrote the order for it in his own handwriting—the stylus was not an instrument belonging to the Vestry; there was one about eight years ago, but that has been missing up to the present time; I know one was ordered, the Vestry paid for it, it would be necessary to have it—the piece of black paper was suggested by Clarke—I was not innocent of the whole mechanism of the fraud, I knew all about it—I didn't suggest the stylus—I used a pencil previously—I didn't suggest the black paper, I knew it would have to be necessary—I cannot sad that it was taught me; it was the subject of conversation between the two of us, it was concocted between us—the stylus was found in my desk, also the black paper and all the implements.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FULTON</hi>. This fraud was suggested to me on several occasions—it did not begin at the end of July or the beginning of August, it was suggested some time previous; I could not state the time it was first suggested, we began it as regards this contract at the end of July or the beginning of August—Williamson's contract commenced in March—I have stated that I prepared Williamson's account pretty well since his contract commenced—I supplied the rough materials, and in fact supplied the account that was sent in, except that it was afterwards copied by some person, I don't know who, a clerk I suppose—the only statement which the Vestry received was mine, except that it was not in my handwriting—Williamson only had the contract in March—I had been in the habit of making out statements for other contractors as well, pretty well every one of the contractors—there was no fraud about those—I got a little pecuniary advantage for making out the accounts, I don't suppose that it was known to the Vestry, I didn't make it known to them; I have no doubt many of them did know it, Mr. Henderson and Mr. Major knew it—the accounts are very difficult to make out—I cannot eay that the contractors are illiterate men as a rule; some of them employ clerks—Williamson is in a measure an illiterate man, I should say; he was able to make out such accounts as these; he is able to read and write—I should say that the September account which was sent in was a copy of mine—that contains charges for material sup<lb/>plied on 25th July—I cannot speak for certain whether that was the first account that contained the overcharges; as near as I can tell it was the first in this contract—I believe the October account has never been paid, I cannot speak for certain—I never had any of that money—money has been handed to me by Williamson I should say three or four times—I could not tell you the date of the first occasion; I could not fix any time—it may have been in the four months, July, August, September, or October—I cannot tell the month in which I first received money from Williamson, and I should not like to swear to the place; I should say that it was at the Vestry Hall, but I cannot recollect—he has given me money at other places, once at the corner of Park Street, Islington; he met me—I couldn't tell you the month it was in, it would be impossible for me to tell—I cannot say that the September account was the first fraudulent one that was sent in in connection with Williamson's contract; I couldn't say without reference, to the best of my knowledge it was—if I had the books in front of me I could tell you very likely—the September account was not paid till the 23rd of October, according to this—I should believe this to be correct. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the September account was the first fraudulent account rendered by Williamson, and that was not paid till the 23rd of October, do you mean to suggest that you received money from Williamson in July, August and September?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not say that it was so—I could not say that the September was the first account, I cannot say without references; to the best of my knowledge it was—I had all the papers in front of me when Mr. Grain was asking me—I cannot without reference to the books tell you whether the September account was the first fraudulent one under this contract—if the September account was paid on the 23rd of October I should say I received the money in respect of that on that day, but it is getting on for six months ago, and I cannot recollect—I was suspended-on the 6th of November, and I have had no access to anything from that day—I should say this</p>

               <p>matter has not occupied my mind and attention—I was represented by an experienced solicitor before the Magistrate—I didn't furnish him with information with reference to these accounts, no dates whatever, just a <hi rend="italic">resume'</hi> of the case—I was counselled yesterday as to giving evidence—I had not considered the matter before that—I had not suggested to any person that I was guilty of these forgeries—my relations have known it, my brothers have known it, but no other person; not my solicitor—I could not say when I first had a conversation with William<lb/>son about these matters—I cannot fix any time—it was some time after his contract commenced—I couldn't tell you the month, I should say it was before the end of July—it is impossible for me to say where it was, I should say it was at the Vestry Hall—it was not at his private house, because I never went there—I occasionally saw him about in the street; I met him casually, as I should meet anybody else—I didn't suggest this to him—I couldn't fix the date when I first had any conver<lb/>sation about money in connection with these contracts—I have no doubt Clarke was present, nobody else—I have received a pretty fair education—of course, the conversation was about this matter, that there was so much to be put on and charged for—I have no doubt all of us spoke in turns—I couldn't tell you who poke first; I have no doubt it was Clarke—I don't know what part I took in it, or what part Williamson took in it—we all talked on the purpose; there is no doubt about it—I couldn't tell you when or where it was; no doubt it was at the Vestry Hall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There would be an account of Williamson's paid in August and July—the August account would be paid before the Sep<lb/>tember one, and the July one in August—I am not certain about the date when the first frauds were committed, without referring—it is the Report book that I wish to refer to (<hi rend="italic">It was handed to the witness</hi>)—this book does not help me.</p>

I live at 2, Albert Villas, Albert Square, Stratford—I have known the prisoner and been keeping company with him about three months—he is a painter—he has visited me at my mother's house—I had a quarrel with him on the Sunday night, the 13th January—on the 14th I met him outside the place where I work as a machinist, in Myrtle Street, St. John's Road, as I came away from my day's work—I had told him on the Sunday not to come down—he was the worse for drink—I said "What do you want with me? I told you not to come down"—he made no answer—we walked on together till we got to the corner of Great Eastern Street—I then told him I would not go out with him any longer—I then went home—about a fortnight before he had said "If you give me up I will blow my brains out and throw myself on the lines"—about 9 o'clock the next evening I was at Maryland Point Station with my mother—I saw him there and asked him" What do you want with me?"—he said "I want to speak to you"—my mother then came up from another part of the platform, and the prisoner said nothing, but walked away down Forest Lane—I and my mother went down Forest Lane in the direction of our home; the prisoner was in front of us—we proceeded a short distance till we got to Albert Square, at the corner of which the prisoner was waiting—my mother then said "If you molest her, I will see what I can do"—I don't think the prisoner replied—this was a very short distance off our home, in the direction of which I and my mother went—I was a few yards from the door when I heard the report of fire<lb/>Anns; I turned round and saw the prisoner, who had got the revolver pointed at me, down Albert Square—he was about 20 feet from me then. (<hi rend="italic">The witness then pointed out the distance, which was about 12 yards.</hi>) I heard another report and saw the flash as soon as I turned round; and immediately afterwards I heard a third report, and then the prisoner fell down himself—I was much frightened and came over faint and fell down and my mother took me indoors—I know nothing of what occurred</p>

My attention was called to Mr. Parry's house at the time in question—he came down and opened the door—I went upstairs and got out on the roof at the back of the premises, where I saw the prisoner—I also noticed the skylight over the back drawing-room was broken—I said to the prisoner "What are you doing here?"—he said "I know what you have come for; I will settle you," and he made two blows at me with a knife he had open in his hand (<hi rend="italic">Producing a pocket knife</hi>)—he had one of his boots in his other hand—I had my stick drawn and made two blows at him and missed him—he was about three feet above me—I went up another flight of stairs and got out at the attic window—I called out to Mr. Parry for a revolver—the prisoner then said "Don't hurt me; I will give in"—I told him I would assist him down if he would shut the knife and put it in his pocket—he</p>

E. Kemp" is my writing—later in the day Kemp brought it back to me and I told my son to endorse it "E. Kemp"—I had not to my knowledge seen the prisoner, before the lead was brought that morning—he has brought things to our premises; I can't remember the dates; he has been in the habit of dealing with us on several occasions; I have known him for years—I was examined before the Magistrate—I did not to my knowledge see him on the morning of the 29th—I should not like to swear whether I did or not—I believe I did not have any conversation with him about lead before this—I believe I did before that morning; there was a conversation about lead, I can't say whether it would be that morning or no—I had told him I could not give more than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt.—on 1st December Kemp brought in his cart 5 cwt. 21 lb. of lead; the prisoner came about half an hour afterwards, while Kemp was there—the price of that lead was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave Kemp this cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a sovereign—Kemp asked for silver—I did not see the prisoner at that time; I don't know where he was; I saw him afterwards standing outside the door—I did not see him give my men a shilling for weighing the lead—I gave silver for the sovereign—on 4th December I bought 4 cwt 3 qr. 19 lb. of lead of Kemp and paid him in cash—on Saturday, 8th December, Kemp came about 8.30; he spoke to me—I then refused to buy the lead and he took it away—he told me it came from Beckenham—the prisoner was not present.</p>

I was sent for to the barn on Lime Farm—I looked through a hole in the woodwork on the opposite side to Smart—the door does not quite close to, and I got a good view of what was going on inside—I saw Goodson and England stripped to the waist fighting—they had no gloves on—I saw each receive blows; neither of them went down—there were about 70 people I should say, some standing on the ground and some sitting on hay—there was a ring about 16 feet one way, and 18 feet the other, formed with ropes and staples, at the side of the barn—Goodson and England were the only two inside the ring—I watched about a minute—I saw Hulls standing on some<lb/>thing at the side of the ring; he looked at his watch and called time, and entered something in his pocket-book, which he had in his hand—he called time twice—when he did so two other men stepped into the ring and wiped the two men down with some loose hay and a cloth; there were two pails of water there—then Hulls called time again, and the two men went out of the ring, and the two prisoners began fighting again—I saw Goodson get a blow on the chin and England one on the lower part of the neck—I saw no gloves while it was going on—I could see their hands quite plainly—I and the constable entered together, and I saw Goodson taken—he had no gloves on when taken—I took Hulls just inside the barn; he was running out, and pulled me with him—he said "Let me go, I am a married man with a large family"—he was very violent—Rosen<lb/>dale came to my assistance—Hulls slipped out of both his coats and tried to throw me down—before Rosendale came I picked up a brick and threatened to strike him if he was violent; I did not use any violence—on the way to the station he got his hand into his overcoat pocket and dropped some papers—I don't know who picked them up, they were handed to the police.</p>

The people were standing at each side of the ring, at the two long ends of the barn, there was nobody standing in front of me—I heard time called when the men were actually fighting—I have never seen persons fight, nor the rules of fighting—they were large folding barn doors, fastened from outside—I moved the stones and the other constable the wood—we did it very quietly—there was a great rush out, and it was a second or two before I could get into the ring.</p>

               <p>a room on the top floor—they had been living on my premises since last October—they had three children; two lived away from home, and one lived with the father and mother; she was three years old—on 27th December, about a quarter-past 3 in the afternoon, the deceased came to me, and we went to a public-house called the Blue Pump for the purpose of meeting the prisoner; he was not there—we waited, expecting he would come, up to about 4—while we were waiting there we had a pint of beer, which the deceased paid for; the landlord made us a present of some spirits, which we put into the beer, and we shared the beer and spirits between us—when we had finished the drink we went home, and found the prisoner at the door with a man named Cook—he was drunk; Cook was not quite so bad—we all four went into my parlour on the ground floor—the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, and gave his wife 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and said "You called me a b——tinker, and that has stuck in my heart for you"—she said "Well, I didn't mean anything by calling you so"—he said "If I am a tinker, Mrs. Donovan, you come out with me; it is the first time I have had the pleasure of taking you out since you have been confined; come out and I will treat you"—Cook said "Uncle, what is the good of being cross, what is the good of being foolish?—Cook is his nephew—Cook said "Let's go and have a quiet glass together and treat Mrs. Donovan"—all four of us then went into the Blue Pump, and the prisoner called for a quartern of gin, which I and the deceased shared between us—Cook and the prisoner had a pot of beer between them, which they upset—I am not quite sure who paid for it, but the prisoner paid for the gin—we left the Blue Pump about 6 o'clock, the prisoner and Cook going out together first—as we were going home he asked his wife to get him something for his tea—I believe he had been out before, and he said there was a nice plaice, and the price was 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he told her to go and get it, and she said "All right"—he wanted her to go and she wanted him to go and get it himself—she went and came back and told him there was no such thing there—she then went to get something for his tea, and I went to a neighbour's house—I waited there some time and then came back and stood at my door—the prisoner came out of my parlour and asked for his wife; I got him in again and asked him to have a sleep, and I would go and see if I could see her—he went in and I then went and met his wife, who was coming back with a rabbit for his tea—I went out and left them in the parlour and went back to the neighbour's house, where I had been a short time before—they used the parlour as a cooking place—while I was at the neighbour's the deceased came and the prisoner came after her and asked her to come back—he told her to come back home to get him some<lb/>thing to eat, that he had had nothing to eat all the day—he was rather angry—she went with him; I didn't see her again that night—I saw him about 11 o'clock asleep in his own room on the floor—I went as far as the door looking for my little boy, and he had got my little boy lying by his side asleep—I had previously put him in his own bed; he must have taken him out of bed and carried him up—I took him away and put him in his own bed—I said nothing to the prisoner—ho was sound asleep; I didn't wake him—his wife was out at that time—I sat up till 2 o'clock in the morning waiting for her to come home; she didn't come home, and I want to bed—I heard no more of them till next morning about 8 o'clock—I then heard them quarrelling, and I heard the prisoner call out "Wait till I catch</p>

Oh, George, he has stabbed me, he has done for me!"—I ran up and met her doming downstairs bleeding from the neck—she went out into the court; I followed her, and fetched a policeman, and when I came back she was gone—I went up to the prisoner's room with the policeman; he was lying on the floor—he gave the policeman the knife, and said "I am a man; I don't deny it; this is what I done it with"—he was taken to the station—I afterwards saw the woman dead in the dead-house at Guy's Hospital.</p>

On Friday afternoon, 28th December, about 4.45, I was called to No. 4, Princess Court by Mrs. Donovan, and I went at once to a room on the first floor, where I saw the prisoner lying on the floor with his head resting on the side of the bed, which was on the floor—I asked what had become of the injured woman—Mrs. Donovan said she had been taken to the hospital—Cook was also present—I asked what it was done with—the prisoner rose up and said "I was always a man, I don't deny it; this is the knife I done it with"—he banded me the knife with his right hand; it was then shut—I opened it and examined the blades—the prisoner said "It was with the small blade I done it"—I found marks of blood upon the small blade—I then told him he must go with me to the station—he said "I will go with you"—I took him there—I afterwards went to the hospital and saw the woman there dead—I examined the clothes that she had on and found these six pawn-tickets in her pocket; two of them are for blankets, one pledged for a shilling on 28th December, 1883, in the name of Carney, one in the name of Ann Plampton for two shillings, one blanket pledged the same day for a shilling in the name of Ann Carney—I also found three pawntickets on the prisoner.</p>

On the afternoon of 28th December, a little before 6 o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the Southwark Police-station—he was charged in the usual way with the murder of Emily Maria Plampton by stabbing her in the neck with a knife—he said "That is right, sir, that is quite right; she ought to be dead years ago"—I saw these three tickets taken from him; one is for a saw pledged on 31st March, one for a coat on 10th September, and the other for a handkerchief on the 11th—I saw the knife—there appeared to be blood on the small blade—he appeared to be recovering, or he had recovered, from the effects of drink—he was then sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital on 28th December, about a quarter to 5 in the afternoon, when the deceased was brought there—I attended to her directly—I found that she was dead—her clothes were covered with blood—I saw that she was wounded—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—I found two wounds, one just under the ear on the left side about half an inch below the lobe of the ear, the other one was farther back, and two inches below the ear—the upper and front one was the more serious—it was such a wound as I should expect to have been inflicted by a stab of a knife—at the lower part it was one eighth of an inch deep as measured by the probe, and about one eighth of an inch in width—it had punctured one of the principal veins in the neck—the other wound was three-quarters of an inch deep, as measured by the probe—both wounds extended down<lb/>wards and inwards—the second one had not severed any of the principal veins—in my judgment she died from loss of blood—I examined all the organs of the body except the brain—she had not a drunkard's liver—there was no appearance of injury to the liver from drink, it was quite healthy—those wounds might have been inflicted by the small blade of this knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Neither of the wounds would have caused deach neces<lb/>sarily, if they had been attended to directly—if any one had been present who knew what to do she might not have died—if pressure had been put upon the wound it would have stopped the hæmorrhage—I should say from the position of the wounds that they had been inflicted from the side—if very great force had been used I should have expected it to have been deeper—I should say that it had been inflicted by the right hand, because they were on the left side of the neck—I don't think that they were such wounds as I should expect if in a scuffle the woman had fallen against the knife.</p>

I am a single woman, of Woodbridge, near Stoke, Guildford—I was with the last witness at the time in question, when I heard the prisoners say the first civilian they should upset—I don't know the other words they used—three of the prisoners went round Jackson, and Bryan took me by the shoulders and tried to assault me by pulling my clothes up—I told him if he did not leave me alone I should scream—he told me to scream, and I did scream—he then struck me on the chest—I scratched his face—I identify all the prisoners—I did not see what they did to Jackson—Bryan hit me a second time, and got me down in the road—they then went off towards the barracks—I followed with Jackson, and when we got to the barracks Bryan had been there about two minutes—we took about 20 minutes, perhaps, to get to the barracks—there were no other soldiers going towards the barracks—when we got to the barrack</p>

I live at 80, Cambridge Street, Avenue Road, Camber<lb/>well, and am an omnibus conductor in the employment of my father, who carries on business there—at about 11.30 on 9th January I was in my father's stables—the prisoner came to my father bringing a very handsome cream-coloured pony—he said his father had sent him to Smithfield Market to sell the pony, and that his father was hard up—I asked him what his father was—he said a greengrocer at Richmond—he said he wanted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. At first—my father said to me "Well, put him in a cart and see what he is like"—my father put him in a cart and went out, and came back and said in the hearing of the prisoner, "It is very good, too cheap to be true; the best thing would be to put him in the stable and send a telegram to your father to see whether it is true or not"—the prisoner said, "It is no use sending to my father because he will be on his milk round"—my father said to me, "You had better put a pony in the cart and drive the prisoner down to Richmond to see his father"—my father cut off some bread and meat for the prisoner—I put the pony in the trap to drive the prisoner to Richmond—we stopped three times on the way to give the pony a rest—on the way the prisoner said he would take 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. For the pony—when we got to Richmond Green the prisoner got out at Paved Court, and went up the court—he came back and said, "Father has not arrived yet"—I said we would go round the town and see whether we could find his father—I went with him; we were not able to find any one he said was his father—I went toseveral public-houses, and then he said his father had gone to Selby—he asked me to let him go back with me to Camberwell—he ran away from me once—I said, "Tell me where you got the pony from, and I will let you go"—he said, "We will go up Paved Court and see if father is at home"—I said "All right"—he said, "When you see a light in that middle front window father will be at home"—I said, "There is a light at the window"—he said, "Don't go near the woman, for father only engaged the room he sleeps in, and if she sees me she won't let me in"—ultimately I did not see the father, and I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

               <p>morning with a boy with some goods—I did not see either of the prisoners there—the goods were returned to Mr. Westerway—on the 9th instant I arrested the elder prisoner at 44, Barnes Road, Walworth—I told him the charge was having forged a cheque of Mr. Westerway's, and obtaining various articles—he said, "I don't know what you mean"—he afterwards said, "I did pass a cheque to Mr. Westerway, my son gave it to me"—his son was present then—I asked him if it was true—he said "Yes"—I asked him where he got the cheque from—he said he found it—I asked him where—he said Kennington Park—I asked him whether he found more than one—he said "No"—on the way to the station the younger prisoner said, "I will tell you the truth, I stole a coat at Beckenham, and in the pocket was a cheque-book; I filled in the cheque for my father. He knew nothing about it. I did it to get my father food. I am very sorry"—he said "The rest of the book I burnt."</p>
