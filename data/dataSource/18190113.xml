My house is separated from Silverside's, it is over it. I then went to his door, and asked him to open it, he spoke to me through the door, and said he could not open my door, as his was a separate house. Two men then came up to me, and asked me to go and have something to drink. I told them I did not want any. One of them came on each side of me; the one on the left side took 4 s. 6 d. out of my left-hand breeches pocket. I know I had that money in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let him take it - A. I could not prevent it; at the time he took it another man came up, and stopped my mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other take the money before the man stopped your mouth - A. At the time they were rifling me, the other man came up, put his left hand before my mouth, and his right at the back of my head - neither of them took hold of my arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you might have resisted - A. As soon as they got my money the man who stopped my mouth took my hat off. I then collared one of them, I do not know which it was. I tore the collar of his coat off, called for assistance, and kept fast hold of him - we both came down together, and he got away, there was no struggling at the time my hat was taken off, he merely let go my head, and took my hat off with both hands. The other two stood on each side of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the prisoners - A. only Lynch - I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were intoxicated cannot you be mistaken - A. No. It was a very foggy night, but there was a lamp opposite my landlord's door - I could see the men by the light of the lamp. Lynch was the man who took my hat and put his hand over my mouth, and behind my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Why could you not resist - A. The two men standing on each side, and the other man coming up, and putting his hand before my mouth prevented me from resisting or calling out - I cannot swear to the other man.</p>
               <p>LYNCH. Q. How do you know it was me - A. I live in Westminster, and he has been pointed out to me several times before with other men. I have seen him several times, I have been in his company several times, and am sure he is the man. I could see him distinctly.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 22d of December I was on my beat, at the corner of Pear-street, Westminster. On this night I saw the three prisoners together, I knew them before, they passed me a little before twelve o'clock, and went down Pear-street towards Pye-street - the prosecutor lives in a court, which joins Pye-street. The prosecutor had passed me a few minutes before, and went the same way. I was walking backward and forwards, and saw the three prisoners go up to him - the fog was just cleared off. I was about fifty yards from them, and saw them cross the road and go up towards him. I heard them dancing on the ground, but could not hear what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all go up to him together - A. All three went towards him together - they were abreast. I heard the call of watch, ran back to my box to fetch my lanthorn, went to the place, and found the prosecutor, but none of the prisoners; I could see nobody else - I saw no more of the prisoners. I am certain they are the men who went up to him. They came out of a door next to my box, I was standing at my box at the time, and had seen them go into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor when the men went up to him - A. I saw him at his door, which is about two yards down the court. I saw him go into the court, beard him knock, and then saw the men go into the court after him - I could not see him at the time.</p>
               <p>SELBY. Q. Is the court a thoroughfare - how could we get away - A. There is a low wall at the bottom of the court, people often get over it - they could then escape. It is not above a foot higher than I am; there are holes in the wall which serve for steps - they can get over very easy.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130004"/>COURT. Q. How long might it be before you got to the court - A. Five or six minutes - they might have escaped into a house in the court - the prosecutor gave me a piece of a coat. When the prisoners passed me Martin had a coat under his arm.</p>

             re-examined. Q. When they attacked you, were you in the court or in the street - A. I was in the street, about two yards from the court - it was a foggy night, but the fog had gone off a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did the men go - A. I stood at the end of the court; one of them came into the court, the other ran into No. 1 or 2 in the court - this was after the robbery. I believe the other two ran down Pye-street in a different direction to the watch-box, but I am not positive. I tore a piece of one man's coat off, the man had the coat on, not under his arm - the watchman came up in about five or six minutes.</p>

They sent a man named Roberts to me, he said he would make every thing up to me. I said 15 s. would not satisfy me. He then threw down 9 s., and left the room.

               <p>Q. Were you not an unfortunate girl - A. No. I did not know the prisoners before, I had not been drinking with them that night, and was never in the public-house in my life. I cannot say how they knew that I had money, I had told nobody of it. I received it in Tothill-street, of a gentleman who is butler to Lord Grenville. I met him there about eight o'clock, he asked me what I did in town, and gave me the money to go home again. I was in a public-house with him till near this time, and received the money of him as I left the house - I was never in any other public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. They said that if you did not deliver the money they would take your life - A. They said if I did not deliver what money I had they would. I saw them next morning at Queen-square Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not then say that thirty persons were round<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130005"/>the door - A. I said about twenty. I should know the man who took the money if I saw him - it was neither of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoners do before the money was taken - A. Two men struck me, it was neither of the prisoners. After they took my money I called out that they were thieves.

            . I am a watchman. I heard a noise in the passage a little before twelve o'clock; there are two passages which go into the court. I heard the prosecutrix call out, and heard both blows, but only saw the last struck - there were a great many men in the passage. The prosecutrix fell on the ground, and the blood was running from her head. I went to spring my rattle, as there were so many, when two of them fell on beating me with a stick, another gave me three blows with a poker - they broke my lanthorn in the passage. I do not know who struck me, I cut the man with my cutlass, but have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners - A. I saw all of them except Mackintosh, outside the door of the house. I am sure they were there. I knew them before, two of them struck me several times. I could not lift my arm up, they all kept beating me until some more watchmen came, they then ran away - there was about twenty of them. Next day I went with the officers, and took the five prisoners, they all live in the neighbourhood. I went to the prosecutrix, she laid in the passage, and while the men were standing round, she said she had been robbed of 20 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was moonlight, I could see half through the passage. I could not see who struck the prosecutrix there were so many round.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the four men you saw - A. They stood outside, and the prosecutrix laid outside the door. When I was struck they all told the man to give it to me well.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are sure it was neither of the four prisoners who struck the prosecutrix - A. I do not know who struck her - she lives in a lodging-house - there are married women, and girls of the town live there. I saw the prisoners distinctly, and know several of the others by sight.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at Stanwell. About eight o'clock in the morning of the 16th of December, I saw the prisoner in the Stanwell road, driving two cows. I asked him where he was going with them? he said they were for sale, and the price was 26 l. I offered him 12 l.; and after a little hesitation, he agreed to take 12 l. I told him to bring them into Mr. Stevens's straw-yard - he said he would, and went there with me. When he got there, Stevens asked him where he got the cows from? he said they belonged to his father-in-law, Webb, of Colnbrook. I left him there, and went to Hounslow, returned, and found him at the Swan, public-house, at Stanwell. Stevens had been and returned from Colnbrook. In consequence of what Stevens said, I ordered Sexton to take the prisoner in charge.</p>

            . On the 26th of December, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the coffee-room door shut rather quick. I went out, and saw the head of a man through the glass. When I got to the corner of Grosvenor-street, I saw two men together, about twenty yards off, one of them had a white greatcoat. Knowing that I had one of that description in my care for Mr. M'Alister, I ran back and missed it off a seat in the coffee-room. I pursued, and saw the prisoner with it - the other man had it first, he ran away; the prisoner did not run, but walked quick. I took him, and asked him where he got the coat? He said a gentleman gave it to him - he refused to go back with me.</p>

On the 26th of December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening the prisoner came to the shop, and asked to look at some ribbon. I shewed her a drawer of ribbon. She concealed one piece in her pocket, and asked for some narrower than the others - I showed her some more, and saw her take another piece out of that drawer, and put it into her pocket - she bought one yard of twopenny ribbon. I asked her to step back into the warehouse, as I wanted to speak to her. She immediately ran out, I pursued, and brought her back. I sent for an officer, who searched her, but could not find them - they were found on the ground near the spot where I took her. I saw her conceal them - another woman stood close to her, but did not appear concerned with her - she remained in the shop, and bought some goods.</p>

I went, and searched his lodgings in St. John-street, Clerkenwell, and found fourteen unbound books, which the prosecutor claimed. The prisoner said he had stolen them, and sold some to Simmon, in Barbican, and said he did it through distress. I found some duplicates of books on him, which the pawnbrokers gave up.</p>

On the 6th of June, about two o'clock I heard a noise of paper rustling, turned round, saw the door open, and heard somebody going out of the passage. I followed into the street, and saw the prisoner with a piece of Irish linen under his arm. I ran up, and asked him where he got it? He made no answer. I said he must come back. I took him back, he asked me to let him go, I refused, and he struck me - I gave him in charge. The officer has the property - he is not here.

            . I am an officer. I was informed of the robbery - the shoes were described to me. On the 28th of December I was passing a pawnbroker's shop in Houndsditch, was called in, and found the prisoner, Taft, pledging one pair, which corresponded with the description I had received. I asked how she came by them? She said she had robbed her master, Mr. Abrahams of Camomile-street, who is the male prisoner, she said her master had more. I went there, found him in the counting-house, and asked if he had lost any shoes? He said he had got shoes, but did not know that he had lost any - there was a quantity in the counting-house, which corresponded with the others. I told him he must excuse me, but the property was stolen. He said I must be mistaken; I said they corresponded with the description I had received. He said he knew the gentleman whom he had them of very well. I told him he had only got to prove that before a magistrate, and all would be right. Both the prisoners told me who brought them - they agreed in the account. I went to the man's house, and found he had left. I found 123 pair of shoes in Abraham's house - I found no trunk.</p>

I moved towards the road to pass, and thought I felt a catch at my coat-pocket, I turned round, and saw the prisoner scrambling my handkerchief in his hand, he had got it out of my pocket - two other boys were with him. I seized him, and he passed it to one of them. I laid hold of him, and he passed it to the third boy. In trying to take him I lost the other, but never let the prisoner go.</p>

            . I went to Mr. Thompson's, Hatton-garden with the goods, they refused to take them in. On my return I put the truss down to rest myself on Holborn Bridge. The prisoner came up, and asked me where I was going with it? I said to Cheapside. He said he was going that way, and asked me if he should carry it a little way. I let him take it up, he carried it as far as Newgate-street, and then met another man, who stopped him and said</p>
               <p>"Ah, Jack, is that you?" and asked him to go and have a glass of gin. They turned down a street to a gin shop, and put the truss down at the door - they asked me several times to go in, and take a glass, but I refused, took the truss up, and came on with it. I had not gone far before they overtook me again. The prisoner said he was going to Cheapside, and would take it a little further for me, he took it off my shoulder, put it down, and told the other to take it up, which he did, and gave the prisoner his hat to carry. Just before we got to Ivy-lane another man came, and almost knocked me backwards, by running against me, then held up his fist, and said</p>
               <p>"Mind who you are shoving". I never saw the man with the truss afterwards. I am certain the prisoner is the man who took it off my shoulder, and gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. He was taken the same evening. When the other man went away with the truss, I asked the prisoner if he saw which way he ran? He said he would go with me to see if he could find him. He ran down Ivy-lane and Paternoster-row with me; when we came to Lovell's-court, he ran up there, and pretended to look after him, I went up too. He ran out before me, shut the gate, and ran away, I opened the gate, ran out, and called Stop thief! and Mr. Murdoch stopped him.</p>
               <p>JOHN MURDOCH. I was in Newgate-street about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, and heard the cry of Stop thief! the prisoner ran by me with a hat in his hand,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130009"/>I followed, and took him in Bagnio-court - he dropped the hat in the kennel - he had his own hat on. I took him to the Saracen's Head.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the man in Smithfield, he said he had been pushed down; I offered to carry the truss - he met a man in Newgate-street, and took him to a gin-shop. He gave me the man's hat to carry, and helped the truss on his head - he missed the man, I ran to look for him, and was taken.</p>

            . Since my arrival in England six months ago, I have frequently missed notes and silver out of my pockets - I counted my money several times at night, and missed some next morning. On the 8th of December I had ten 1 l. notes in my pocket, the numbers of which I took on a piece of paper, which I put in a book, in my bed-room, and left the notes with the other money in my pocket rolled up. In the morning, after dressing, the prisoner gave me my clothes, and in going down stairs I missed a note. I sent to Mr. Daker, the magistrate of Marlborough-street, Foy came; I gave him the numbers of the notes, and pointed out the one I missed - it was the third note in the roll. The prisoner was called into the room, and I asked him if he had got any money? he had told me the lay before that he had none. He appeared surprised; I repeated the question, and desired him to put on the table all the money he had. He then took from his pocket several pieces of gold foreign coin. I asked him if he had any more money? He said No. I then asked him if he had any bank notes or paper money of any kind? He said No. I then pointed Foy out to him, said he was an officer, and told him to mind what he was about, for if he denied it, and was found to have money it would go very much against him - he continued to deny it. I told him it was the same if he had it on his person, in his room, or anywhere else - he still denied having anything else. Foy then said he must search him, which he did, and found a piece of paper rolled up in his breeches pocket, on opening it he made a snatch at it, and said</p>
               <p>"Oh no! Oh no!" Foy found the note in it which I had lost.</p>

About the 4th of January I hired another servant, not intending to discharge him, some circumstances however induced me to suspect him. I told him as another servant was coming, it would be proper to look at the plate - he produced it and in calling it over I missed three table-spoons, and asked him where they were? He said they should be there, as he had counted them two days ago. I said they must be produced, as it had a bad appearance. On searching further I missed the property stated in the indictment. I said he must produce them; he looked about him, and then left the room - I heard him walking about, and then it ceased. I called the servant, and found he had left the house. About six o'clock in the evening I was informed he had returned; I sent privately for a constable; when he came I went and found the prisoner by the kitchen fire, I asked him for the things, he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out several of them, saying, here they are all, but one desert and two egg-spoons, which are still in pawn - I gave him in charge. He fell on his knees, and intreated forgiveness, saying, that it was the necessitous situation of his wife that induced him to commit the offence. I told him that public justice required that I should not connive at it.</p>

I have some land in the parish of Wilsden, Middlesex, round the village - I had some sheep there. On Saturday evening, the 2d of January between four and five o'clock, I examined, and found them all right. On Sunday morning, between nine and ten o'clock, I missed one. I searched round the field, and found the place where it had been stuck, there were marks of blood, and footsteps where it had been caught in the corner of the field. I traced the blood and footsteps over hedges and ditches to Shade-green, which is near the prisoner's house - it appeared to be the footsteps of only one person. I searched the house of a man named Mason, but found nothing. I searched Tilbuy's house - he gave us information. We went over to Wells's house, while we were there, we saw a woman come out of the prisoner's house with three joints of mutton - it was his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this - A. On the Sunday, towards the evening, just before dark. She dropped one joint as she went along, and threw the other two into a ditch, at the end of the house. I examined the ditch, and found two joints there, and the other which she had dropped - the constable went into the house. Next morning, we found the skin of a sheep in the privy - it appeared to have been killed seven or eight days. We found another skin on the adjoining premises, which is the skin of my sheep - it was buried in a bank; we also found the paunch of the sheep there - they appeared quite fresh, and must have been killed on the Sunday morning, or late on Saturday; it was marked R - I knew it to be the skin of my sheep; I compared them with the mutton which the prisoner's wife threw into the ditch, and they corresponded with the skin. The prisoner was not at home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORRIS. The prisoner was not at home. I am sure the skin was mine.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was with Mr. Tomlinson, and examined Wells's premises. In consequence of information, I was going to the prisoner's house and saw his wife standing at Wells's door, which I had mistaken for the prisoner's, and went in there - they are both under the same roof. I afterwards went to the prisoner's apartment, and found two joints of mutton hanging on a nail over the bed - they did not appear to be concealed - the prisoner was not at home. I went and saw Tomlinson in the ditch with two joints of mutton - I did not see him take them out. I was with him next morning, and saw the skin found in the bank; I compared it with the mutton found in the ditch and in the house, and it all appeared to belong to the same sheep. I took the prisoner into custody on Sunday evening on the adjoining premises, when he came home, and asked him how he came by the mutton? he said he had it sent to him as a present from his friends.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I came from Tomlinson's house on the 3d of January, I got over a gate, saw something laying there, and heard somebody go through the hedge. I found it was meat, brought it home, and said I would not cook it to-morrow, and that if any owner came they should have it. It is clear, that if I had committed the robbery, I should not have concealed the skin in the mould, as I was going to work there next day.</p>

On the 23d of December, a few minutes before nine o'clock in the evening, I left the shop, and went into the next room. I heard a crash at the shop-window, as if the glass was broken in. I instantly ran out of the door - (it was a few minutes after nine o'clock) - and heard somebody cry</p>
               <p>"There he goes!" and saw a man running with a drab-coloured coat on; he was immediately joined by another man, who came from one side of the road - they ran together, I followed them as far as Plough and Harrow-lane, which is not one hundred yards from our house. I turned down the lane after them - I followed them out of that into a narrow lane, then into Sound-lane - when they got down there they stopped; I went to them. One of them said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, mate! have you lost your way?" I said,</p>
               <p>"No, I have not lost my way, but you are the persons who have broken our window." One said they had broken no window, for they had just come from Brentford. The other laughed, and said</p>
               <p>"It is not us." I asked them to go back with me - Baker said he should not go back with me, but asked me to go with them, and they would show me where they lived. I said I was without my hat, and should go no further. Baker took off his hat, and offered it to me, I said I should not take it, and then came away. When I got to the top of the lane, I called out,</p>
               <p>"I know your name is Baker, and I shall have you to-morrow" - I knew him before. The other man was the prisoner, Wilkins; he is a watchman. I am sure he was the other man.</p>

            . I live at Hammersmith. On the 23d of December, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was opposite Mr. Wheatley's shop, and saw a man dash his elbow through the window - I only saw one man. I crossed over to Mr. Wheatley's immediately. I was about twenty yards from the man, and saw him take something, but could not see what it was - it was the prisoner, Wilkins, I knew him before - he is the watchman; he ran away across the road. I had been used to see him before, and am sure he is the man. I saw no person with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. He crossed opposite. It was foggy. There were two windows with lights in them - I saw his face. I have seen him in Hammersmith before.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended Baker the same evening (the 23d of December) about nine o'clock in a narrow passage, within three doors of his own house, talking to a man in the passage - Wheatley was with me, and gave him in charge. I told him he must go to the cage with me; he swore he would not go that night, and threw the knife down which he had in his hand. I went to collar him, and he struck me - I had charged him with the robbery. He told Wheatley, jun. that he did not know how many pins he had lost, nor the value of them. On the Thursday morning, about ten o'clock, I took Wilkins at Hammersmith - he was a watchman of Hammersmith at that time, and on duty the night of the robbery - his beat was rather below the prosecutor's house - I believe Sound-lane is in his beat. I charged him with the robbery; he denied it, and said he had been to Brentford that night. Wheatley gave me the pin.</p>

               <p>BAKER'S Defence. About five o'clock, on the night of the robbery, I was going to see if we could get a job to run and light the coaches, it being very foggy - we could get nothing to do. As we were returning home we had some beer at Hammersmith; we met a girl, and gave her a glass of gin. I left Wilkins at the public-house, at the corner of Plough and Harrow-lane, with her. I returned, and overtook Wilkins in Sound-lane. Wheatley came up, and said he suspected we had broken his father's window, as we were the first men he overtook, and he had been told we had ran down the lane. He asked me my name, and where I lived? I told him to follow me home, and offered him my hat. I was taken up at supper-time, and refused to go, as the constable had no warrant - I never struck him.</p>

On the 14th of November, the prisoner brought sixteen yards of sarsnet, which he wanted to pledge. I asked him who it belonged to? He said to his aunt. I told him to go and fetch her. He went away and did not return until the Tuesday following, and then brought a woman who he said was his aunt; she wanted to know why I stopped the sarsnet. I said I was sure it did not belong to him. She said she would go to Bow-street, and make us deliver it up to her - they both went away. I heard nothing more until the prisoner was in custody - I kept the silk, and have had it ever since.</p>

            . I am a silk manufacturer, and live in Fort-street, Spital-square, Bishop lives near me - his house is in the parish of Christ Church, Middlesex, it goes by that name only. I employed Bishop to make the sarsnet for me, it is my property, I have no doubt but that produced is part of the same, it corresponded with the part at home where it had been cut; sixty-two yards had been cut from it - it cost me 2 s. 6 d. a yard.</p>

On Monday night, the 11th of January I was sleeping there, I had a blunderbuss which I had charged a fortnight before with shot, No. 3 and gunpowder, and primed it. About three o'clock in the morning I heard a man in the carpenter's shop, in the premises, which awoke me. I got up, took the blunderbuss in my hand, went to the door, and met the prisoner. I collared him, and told him to stop, or I would shoot him, as he was my prisoner. He took hold of the blunderbuss, and a scuffle ensued between us, in which we both fell to the ground - and by seizing me by the throat, and other means he got the blunderbuss from me, and stepping back a few paces, he levelled it at me and pulled the trigger. It flashed in the pan, but did not go off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the flash of the flint only - A. Yes the priming did not flash. He turned round, and ran away, I followed him, and called to him three times to throw the blunderbuss down. He ran, until he came to some pales, and then threw it over the pales into the high road. I caught him again as he was trying to make his escape over the pales.</p>

The watchman brought it to me a few minutes after he threw it away - Mr. Colville, jun. took it into his possession till the morning - he then went with it to the watch-house; I went with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was anything done with it in your presence - A. It was fired off accidentally that day at Queen-square office by a butcher's boy, I was present. I produce a specimen of the shot with which it was loaded.</p>

            . I am an officer. I produce the blunderbuss - it was discharged by accident in a room at the office - the shot went into the wainscot. It appeared to me to be shot - I believe it flew back. I examined the wainscot, and found a hole in it about the width of the muzzle; the hole was not through. There appeared to be little holes from the shot within the large hole. I have not ascertained whether there was any shot in the wood - the mark was not there before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might not the mark be from the wadding - A. There were small holes, as if it were shot - it was fired about two feet from the mark. It must have been something hard, to have made the impression in the wainscot. I believe it is a deal wainscot.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not have been something that rebounded - - A. It might. It was brought to me at the watch-house by Billingsley, about ten o'clock in the morning. I took it to the office, and had it in sight until it went off. No person could have loaded it while I had it. I suppose the powder must have shook into the pan.</p>

             re-examined. I always keep the key of my room, and never leave it open. No person could get at the blunderbuss after I loaded it. Nobody had been in my room during the last fortnight. I make my bed myself, and always lock the door. I go into the room to my meals, and live there by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not go out sometimes without locking the door - A. Never. I loaded and primed the blunderbuss myself. My room is on the ground-floor in the garden - the window is left open sometimes. It has only two panes of glass - a boy could not get in. I am certain he levelled it at me. I primed it when I loaded it, and did not examine it afterwards.</p>
               <p>JOHN M'BRIDE. I am a watchman. On Monday morning I heard the cry of murder in Mr. Colvill's grounds. I went to the spot as soon as possible, and saw M'Cabe, the watchman, coming towards me, and stopped him. I saw the blunderbuss in the road. A watchman, who is not here, came off Chelsea Common, and picked it up - it was in his possession. I went away. M'cabe was present.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM M'CABE. I am a watchman. I saw the blunderbuss lying in the road - another watchman picked it up. Mr. Colvill came, and he gave it to him in my presence. It was out of my sight for five minutes before Colvill came. I returned, and saw it still in the watchman's possession, and saw him give it Mr. Colvill.</p>

            , JUN. I came up, and found the blunderbuss in the possession of Barnet, a watchman of Sloane-square. The prisoner, M'Cabe, and my man were there. The watchman gave the blunderbuss to me - the pan was open and the hammer down. I took it, and kept it in my bed-room till nine o'clock the next morning, as I went to bed again. In the morning I brought it down myself, and took it into the breakfast parlour, and then took it to the watch-house. It was out of my sight about a quarter of an hour, in a room in the nursery.</p>
               <p>Q. Any one could have got at it then - A. I do not know - I cannot say exactly where I left it. Billingsley brought it to the watch-house. I did not see it discharged. I found some shot on the ground. I got to the office about eleven o'clock - it was then gone off - the room was full of smoke. Maybank was in the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going into the country to get work, and got over the fence for a necessary purpose. I went across the place, and the prosecutor said he would shoot me if I did not stop. We fell, and in the fall I heard the trigger snap - I ran and threw it away, to prevent his doing me any harm. I never pointed it at him.</p>

On the 15th of December, about half-past five o'clock, as I sat in the parlour, opposite the shop-door, I heard a noise at the door, as if something snapped. I went into the shop, missed the tray, and saw the prisoner running across the road with it - I followed him up Holles-street. He turned round, saw me, and threw it down - I took it to the office. He cut it down. He could not see how it was fastened without kneeling down, and going inside the shop. Another boy was with him, who got away.</p>

A young man came in, and wanted a waistcoat; while I was engaged with him, a person might come in, and take the coats without my seeing them. The prisoner said it was his first offence, and begged of me to let him go - I gave him in charge. I only rent the lower part of the house, and sleep there - the landlord does not live in the house. One coat cost me 2 l. 10 s., and the other was worth 7 s. or 8 s.</p>

            . On the 30th of December, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, I was passing along the Strand, and saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's shop in a very suspicious manner, stopping down with the coats under his arm. I suspected he had stolen them, followed him, and told him to take them back from where he took them. He asked for what? came back with me, and said I might take them back myself; just before he got to the door he threw them down. I collared him, picked them up, and took them into the shop with him; I merely pushed him into the shop, and asked the prosecutor if he had lost anything? I gave them to him, and said the prisoner had taken them - I then left the shop.</p>

Risley called me by name, and said his father had sent them to change the poney away for a larger one, as it was too small for him; I knew him before - Lawrence said he only came with him for company. I showed him two horses which I had, and said I did not like to have anything to do with it unless his father came; he said his father was busy in the garden, and could not come, but he trusted to my generosity to do justice. He went away, returned, and said it was all right, for his father came honestly by it, and gave 5 l. for it in Smithfield; I detained the poney - nothing more passed. I went to look for his father at Ponder's-end, Enfield Wash, as he gave me that direction. I could not find him there - I have never found his father out.

            . I keep a horse and cart; I was employed by Mr. Riley, one of the assignees, to accompany him to No. 20, Nelson-square, Stoke Newington. On the 6th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I went with him, and rang at the bell. No answer being made, I got leave to go through the next house, and entered at the back door, which was open; I found a man, in a sailor's dress, cleaning knives in the back kitchen; the prisoner came down with a pistol in each hand, asked my name, and what authority I had there? I told him that I was regaining possession by a deed of assignment to the assignees. He asked where the authority was? I took the assignment from under my waistcoat, and showed it to him; he said I must give it to him; I said I must not part with it, nor would I, but if he would come down stairs, and lay the pistols down like a gentleman, I would read it to him - he was on the stairs, and I was on the kitchen floor. He said if I did not give it to him he would blow my brains out; I told him he certainly must, for I would not give it up to him - he then went up stairs. I then went, and beckoned to Riley, and he came in the same way that I did. As soon as he entered, the prisoner came down again, and was in conversation with him for a quarter of an hour; he said he had bought the things. Riley told him to act like a gentleman, and anything he could prove belonged to him, he should have.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it that he attempted to fire at you - A. He was talking about our going out for about ten minutes, and said he was master of the house, and that it became every man to defend his castle - he presented a pistol in his right hand, and fired it at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything to the man in the kitchen - A. He called out to him, Oliver, to come up - he did not go up; he immediately took an aim, and fired as quick as he could - he stood about seven stairs up, and I was about a yard from the bottom; I put my arm up, and felt something strike my wrist, which numbed my arm from my fingers to my elbow - I received no further injury then. He immediately presented the other pistol in his left hand, and fired it, he said nothing - I felt nothing from that - I found a mark on the kitchen door next day.</p>
               <p>Q. After the pistols were fired what was done - A. He ran up into the parlour, Riley and I pursued him - we entered the parlour, he then presented a naked sword at me; I hit his arm up, and Riley knocked it out of his hand with the tongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer him any personal violence before he fired at you - A. No, nor did I touch anything in the house - he was taken before the magistrate, and admitted to bail, being charged only with an assault; my coat and waistcoat were quite unbuttoned when he fired - next morning I found a ball in my left-hand waistcoat-pocket, which I produce; I showed it to my father, and accompanied him to the kitchen, and only found a graze on the door, apparently with a pistol ball, in the direction which he fired the second pistol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How do you live - A. By my horse and cart, at the Cock and Magpie, Kingsland; Riley asked me to go with him, and gave me the assignment.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pistols had you in your hand - A. None, I had one in my side-pocket, but not in my hand; I had put it there to be repaired - it was empty. The kitchen door stood on my left-hand, Riley was behind me; the graze was at the top of the under panel of the door. He took a deliberate aim at me - he was about four yards from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the magistrate about anything striking against your arm - A. Yes, there was no hole in my coat; the skin was grazed, and my shirt was a little bloody; Riley knocked the prisoner down, after he had attacked me with the sword - some blood came from his head - we afterwards took him out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever go by the name of Barlow - A. No; some people call me so, as it is my father-in-law's name.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you present any pistol at the prisoner - A. No; he got his head cut, by Riley forcing the sword from him - he threw both the pistols on the table.</p>

            . I am one of the assignees, and live in Finsbury-place. I never saw the prisoner until I went to the house with Dale to regain possession. Dale got through the next house; I remained in front, and saw Cooper in the parlour, he moved his hand at me, as if to say he would not come to the door. I went round, and entered in at the back; Cooper came down with a pistol in each hand, about five minutes after, stationed himself about the sixth stair, and demanded of me my authority for being there; Dale handed me the assignment, I showed it to the prisoner, requested him to lay down his pistols, and I would read it to him, and if he could prove that any of the property belonged to him, he should have it; Dale stood between the stairs and the kitchen door. Cooper took an aim at him; seeing the flash, and hearing the explosion, I ran to the kitchen fire, and took up the tongs - before I came to the door, the second pistol was fired.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the pistols pointed - A. Downward, in the direction Dale stood; he retreated up into the parlour, and we followed, When I entered into the parlour, he was making a cut at Dale with the sabre; I knocked it out of his hands with the tongs, and cut his head, which produced blood.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Dale produce any pistol - A. No; no violence whatever was offered to the prisoner, except what I did with the tongs.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you say regain possession, did you suppose force wanted to be used - A. Yes; Cooper asked me up into the parlour to read the assignment; I said I could not, but if he would come down, I would read it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Dale said nothing to him - Q. Cooper d - d his eyes, and Dale did the same - he showed me the mark in his arm.</p>

            . I live with the prisoner as his servant, and was in the house when this happened. The prisoner told me two or three days before, that if I went to his closet, not to touch the pistol case as they were loaded, for fear they should go off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I believe I am not of a vicious disposition; Dale entered the house with a pistol in his hand - I heard a noise, came down, and asked him why he was there? He produced his pistol, and said that was his authority. I then went up stairs, and got my pistols, which I had got at a distress for rent. I supposed that I had a right to the property, as I had paid for it; he took hold of my pistol. Dale d - d my eyes, presented his pistol at me, and turned his head on one side, as if he thought I should fire at him; I found the assignee there. One of them was armed with a crow-bar, and the other with the tongs; he said he would knock me down. I presented my pistols, and told Dale that if he did not remove his pistol, I would fire; he pulled the trigger of his pistol, but it did not go off. I then fired mine, but held it in a direction that it should not hurt him - the balls were so loose in, that they both fell out, and I picked them up. When Dale was at the office, he said if they had been loaded they must have killed him - I was bailed. An indictment was found against me at Clerkenwell, but I did not get out of the way; they said if I did not come to their terms, they would capitally indict me - I should not have fired if Dale had not presented his pistol at me. I had written to Mr. Gurney to tell him, that if they came I would give them plenty of powder to frighten them, but would not hurt them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HERRITAGE, clerk to the magistrates of Worship-street, was called on the prisoner's behalf, and read the deposition of Dale, which exactly agreed with his evidence.</p>

On Saturday fortnight, about half-past seven o'clock at night, the prisoner accosted me at Temple-bar, said he was in distress, had nothing to eat, or anywhere to lay his head. I told him I had no money, and could give him none. I went into a shop in Fleet-street, and on coming out he accosted me as before; I gave him five-pence or seven-pence, and as I passed down Fleet-street I was surprised to find him following me, he repeated the same tale, and said he was sure I could give him more money; he kept following me, and pushing his arms against me. I could not get rid of him, and asked him for what I was to give him money? he said gentlemen had given him money when he asked, and I could if I liked - and he dare say I could; and that a quaker gave him 14 s. a few nights before. He kept elbowing me, standing in my way, and repeating this story. I became alarmed. He said he certainly must and would have money - that I must give him what I had, and meet him next day in St. Paul's church-yard, and bring him a 1 l. note. I gave him 4 s. 6 d., and promised to meet him there at ten o'clock the following day. I was taken very ill, and confined to my bed for three or four days. It was my intention to have given information to the Lord Mayor, with a description of his person. I came to town on the 8th of June, from the Hackney-road, and called on my solicitor at the Royal Exchange, he not being at home, I went down Cheapside to buy some things, the prisoner came up to me, and said I was the very person he had been looking for, that he would have money, and would follow me to hell, but what he would have money. I told him I had several places to call at. He continued following me, pushing and elbowing me, and threatening me in the same manner. I then went into a public-house, opposite the Mansion-house, to find an officer, but none was to be found; he still kept following me, and said I had got a watch, and he would have it. I said I had got no watch, but I had got the duplicate of one. He asked if it was a valuable one - I said it was. He said that would do for him, and I gave it to him; he then said he would not leave me until I could procure some money. I then went to my solicitors', Messrs. Draper and Bird, Exchange Chambers - he remained on the stairs. I sent for an officer, who took him, and found the duplicate upon him.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. He accused you of nothing - A. No. I parted with the money under the impression of fear.</p>
               <p>Q. What fear - A. That he would charge me with an abominable offence - he hinted at it.</p>

I took her into a room, and proceeded to search her; she opened her right hand, there was two 1 l. notes, and 17 s. in it. I asked her where she changed the 5 l. note? she said at Mr. Pound's, the Royal Oak, Pitfield-street. I then asked her where the other property was? She put her hand into her pocket, gave me the watch, and said she would go with me to her grandfather's, who lived at the Royal Oak, and there was the rest of the property. I went there with her, and found her grandfather lived there. She delivered all the property up to me there that was lost, except the rest of the change of the 5 l. note. She had given her grandfather 8 s. Pound said he changed the 5 l. note for her - I took her to the office. I have the 5 l. note, the candlestick, watch, spoons and a purse.

On the 5th of January, about one o'clock, I was in Aldermanbury, and saw the prisoner drag a truss of tea from a cart, which stood at the Axe Inn, fully loaded - he passed me, and went up Three Nun-court - I suspected him from his manner. I saw the carter come up the Axe gateway, and told him. I took care of the cart while he ran in pursuit. He returned in about ten minutes, and said he had taken the man with the tea, and had given him in charge.</p>

            . I am the carman. I was at the Axe Inn, with the tea in the cart. I went up the yard to see if there was room to drive up, and returned in two minutes. Redmead came, and said a man had taken the truss. I pursued, and overtook him in Basinghall-street, about twenty yards beyond Coopers' Hall, with the truss on his shoulder. I asked him where he got it from? he said a man gave it him to carry. I took him into the Justice-room in Guildhall-yard.</p>

I told him I did. He asked me if I had seen him that evening? I said I had not. He looked round the shop, turned round again, and said, this must be the shop, and asked for a pound of 8 s. tea, I served him; he then tendered me a 5 l. note - I wrote Mr. Godfrey's name and address on it.</p>

Next day I tendered the note in payment, and it was objected to, upon which I sent to Mr. Godfrey, but could learn nothing of the prisoner - (looks at a note) - this is it, it has the address on it.</p>

            . I am an inspector of bank notes to the Bank, and have been so above twenty years; experience enables me to distinguish good notes from bad. The Bank use a particular sort of paper. I have been in the daily habit of seeing the paper, and have seen an immense quantity of it - it is my business - I am acquainted with the character and texture of it, likewise the engraving, and the signatures of the different signing clerks - there is a watermark made in the fabric of the paper - (looks at the note uttered to Hopkinson) - it is not a genuine bank note - it is not bank paper, but an imitation of it; there is an imitation of the water-mark, which is put on after the paper is made. It is thinner than bank paper, and has a different appearance altogether; it is not the impression of the bank plate - the date line is engraved, but in a genuine note it is printed. It is signed J. Lambert, but is not his signature; I know it well, and am in the daily habit of seeing it. The other four notes are the same in every respect, and impressed from the same plate, the same date, and two of them are the same signatures. They are all different numbers, but the numbers consist of the same figures, 12,750, but are transposed - the numbers are printed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the bank ever use two notes of the same number and date - A. I believe it has happened - I have known three or four instances of it, it is not the practice, and is very unusual, and must arise from inattention to the machinery.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Lamb's-street, Borough, and am a paper-stainer, in the employ of Messrs. Heath, Ashness and Co. Queen-street, Cheapside; I have been employed by them two years; they had two boys in their service.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of suspicion that fell upon those boys, did you make any application to them - A. I communicated my suspicions to my master, and had some conversation with Lucas, who was one of them; I went with him to the Angel Inn, Fleet-market, and saw the prisoner, Dent, there - I only saw him then.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Lucas introduce him to you - A. At the latter end of November, at the Rose, four or five days after I had seen him at the Angel. I was sitting at the Rose, Lucas introduced me to the prisoner, I directed him to ask the prisoner to let me have a note; he whispered to the prisoner, Lucas turned round to me again, and asked for 6 s., which I gave him. Dent went out with Lucas.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to ask Lucas if the prisoner could furnish you with a 1 l. note - A. By my master's direction, and the direction of the Bank. I was directed by my master to find out where the boys got some notes which we suspected they were dealing with, and I made application to the prisoner, through Lucas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they return - A. Yes; Dent came and sat down. Nothing passed - he never spoke to me then - Lucas came and put a 1 l. note into my hand, across the table - both sat at the same table. I put it into my waistcoat-pocket.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130022"/>Next morning I took it to the Bank, and marked it - (looks at one) - this is it, it has his name on it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. On the 8th of December, I saw him go into the Rose, by accident - he frequented the house; he asked me if I had done it up? by which I understood, whether I had passed the note I took of Lucas. I said, Yes. He then asked if I wanted another? I said, Yes. He said,</p>
               <p>"then come along with me." I went with him to the pig-market, in Smithfield; he told me to wait there till he came back, and asked me for 6 s. which I gave him. He was gone about a quarter of an hour, returned, and put a 1 l. note into my hand - I put it into my pocket - I had no other. Next morning I took it to the Bank, and marked it - (looks at one) - this is it; and has</p>
               <p>"Dent, December 8, 1818, I. S." on it, it is my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. I saw him several times between the 8th and 12th. He asked me if I had done it? I said I had not yet. He then asked when I thought I should want any more? I said not for a day or two - we parted. On Saturday evening, the 12th, between eight and nine o'clock, I was sitting at the Rose, he came in; I told him that

We then crossed Smithfield; in the way he asked me if I wanted any? I said I would take one, and if I got that off I would come back for another. We went towards Cloth-fair - he told me to stop at the turning going up Cloth-fair, and asked for the money - I gave him 6 s. They went up Cloth-fair together. In about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, he returned and put a note into my hand, which I put into my right-hand waistcoat-pocket. He asked me where I was going to pass it? I said I did not know yet, but I must go and look for a place; he then said I will tell you where there is a sure place, and asked me if I knew Whitecross-street; he went with me to St. John-street, and directed me to Whitecross-street, to a grocer's. I went through a back place, by a dead wall, which led me to Aldersgate-street; he said it was a little grocer's shop, opposite to a sheep's head shop - I could find no such place. I went to Mr. Lamb's, grocer, in Whitecross-street, bought some sugar, and paid a good 1 l. note for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you go there - A. To make him believe I had been, as I was to return for another note. I had kept the note he gave me in a separate pocket until I got home, when I locked it up. I took it on Monday morning to the Bank, and marked it - (looks at one) - this is it. I marked E. D., for the prisoner's name, 12th December, 1818.</p>

            . On the Monday following, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw him again at the Rose; he asked me if I had done it? I told him I was obliged to lose it. Meaning that I was obliged to leave it in the person's hands where I attempted to pass it, and not return for it. I told him it was rubbed and disfigured so - (looks at one) - this is it; the numbers were rubbed in this manner when I received it. He asked me when I should want any more? I said, in a day or two - he said he was going into the country. I did not see him again until the next week, when I saw him in Smithfield. He asked me if I should want any more? I said,</p>
               <p>"Not for myself, but I knew a person who wanted half a score." He asked me if it was sure? I told him it was. He asked me what he would give? - I said I did not know, but I had told the person I gave 6 s. a piece for forged notes. He told me to ask him what he would give - I left him, and saw him again the same day at the Rose, in Smithfield. He asked me what the person said? I said he would give 5 s. 6 d. - he told me to see if he would not give 5 s. 9 d.; I said he stuck out for 5 s. 6 d., and asked him if I should get the money, if he was agreeable to take it. We appointed to meet at the Flying Horse, Charterhouse-lane, next day. I communicated to the Bank what had passed between us.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you these conversations with him of your own accord, or by direction - A. By direction of the Bank and Mr. Heath, who introduced me to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by communicating to the Bank - A. Mr. Rooker. We met at the Flying Horse about a quarter after one o'clock. He came and asked, in a low tone of voice, if I had the money? Mr. Freeman, the inspector, stood by the fire, reading the newspaper at the time - it had been planned that he should be there. I told him I had got the money, but could not pay him without a receipt. I spoke loud, that Mr. Freeman should hear me. Dent said,</p>
               <p>"Very well." I took the money out of my pocket, and gave him a 1 l. note and 35 s. in silver, and named the amount, 2 l. 15 s., loud enough to be heard. He said, if I would go with him he would give me a receipt - he could be heard. We went out - he said he did not like the Flying Horse, because Long Tom, the officer, lived near there, and he would show me a sure house. He took me to the Travellers' Inn, Long-lane - it is a very dark tap-room, with a window that looks into a back court. When I got there I told him I should not go in then - he appointed to meet me there, and said he would fetch them by half-past two o'clock. I then went and told Foy what had passed. I went to the Travellers' Inn, and waited there till four o'clock - he did not come. I waited about twenty minutes longer, and then went to the Rose, and found him there. He told me he had not got them, and asked me if I should want them before six o'clock? I said I wanted them as soon as I could have them - he said he would bring them at six o'clock. I said I would stop at the Rose till six - he went out, I remained there. At half-past six o'clock, he came and told me somebody wanted me - I followed him out. He put a small paper parcel into my hand, and said there were but five, and the next day I should have the other five and to meet him at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130023"/>the Travellers' Inn at half-past twelve - we parted. I kept the parcel in my hand, and went to the Crown tavern, on Clerkenwell-green, where Freeman and Foy were. I opened it, counted five 1 l. notes, marked them, and gave them to Freeman - (looks at the notes) - these are them. Next day, at half-past twelve o'clock, I went to the Travellers' Inn; he came in soon after, and asked me if I was going? I said Yes - he went out, I followed. He went up an alley close by the inn, and put something into my hand wrapped up, and said, that the half-score were of no use to me, as they would not pay my expenses. I had told him we (meaning I and the other person) were going into the country with them. He said it would not pay my expenses under fifteen or twenty. I said I would see what I could do with the other person, to see if he would take any more. He said</p>
               <p>"Do," and we parted. I put the paper into my pocket, took it to the Bank and marked it - (looks at five notes) - these are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Dent again - A. Yes, on Monday, the 21st, at the Rose; he asked me what the man said? I told him I would get what money I could, to get mine. He asked me how many? I said I could not tell, but I would be sure to bring the money on the 22d, and said I did not like the Travellers' Inn, as I saw a gentleman there in boots - I had seen no gentleman there, but told him so because I did not want to go there again; he said</p>
               <p>"Go to the Fox and Anchor, Charterhouse-lane, and wait there until I come to you." Next day I went there about half-past twelve, and he came there soon after; we went out together - he took me up the same court, and said he did not like that house, on account of an officer, and said I had better go to the Travellers' Inn. I said I did not like that house, but if he liked I would walk round Charterhouse-square; he said</p>
               <p>"No, go to the Fox and Anchor, and wait there until I come to you." I went with him to the door, and watched him out of sight; I then went up to Foy, under the archway in Charter-house-square; he sent me to tell Plank, who was at the Flying Horse, which I did, and I went out of the way until I heard he was taken - I had told them which way he was most likely to come, and to keep a sharp eye on the Fox and Anchor - he was to bring me five more notes then; I had given him a 1 l. note, and 7 s. for them, the last time that I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any transactions with him, except by the direction of your master, and the Bank - A. None at all, Mr. Rooker furnished me with the money for dealing, and Freeman gave me the last note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Nobody but yourself was present - A. No, except at one transaction at the Flying Horse, Mr. Freeman was present.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you brought up to - A. I have been at sea above twenty years - I went of my own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever transported - A. Never, the last six years that I was at sea, I was in the King's service, on board the Rambler, and other ships.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any circumstance in your life to raise a suspicion of your being transported - A. None whatever - I served last in the Caledonia.</p>

On the 18th of December, I gave him 2 l. 15 s., to buy ten 1 l. notes at 5 s. 6 d. each of the prisoner, Dent. At a quarter after one o'clock I went to the Flying Horse, as he had informed me of an intended meeting there - he and two or three other people were there; I was in the tap-room, and took the newspaper from Shobel, and stood by the fire. About half-past one o'clock, the prisoner came in, and sat down by Shobel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or hear anything pass between them - A. I heard Shobel ask him if he had got a receipt, for as the sum came to above 2 l. he should want one - Shobel counted out 2 l. 15 s. loud enough for any one in the room to hear it. In about a minute after Dent said, if you will come with me I will give you a receipt - they went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the evening did you see Shobel again - A. At seven o'clock I saw him by appointment at the Crown Tavern, Clerkenwell-green - he had a parcel in his hand which he opened; it contained five 1 l. forged notes; I made him mark them before he gave them to me - I also marked them myself - (looks at some) - these are them. On the 19th of December, he came to me at the Bank, and produced five 1 l. forged notes, I made him mark them, and marked them myself - (looks at some) - these are them.</p>

I unbuttoned his overalls, they buttoned all the way down, and then a small paper parcel fell out of them on the floor. The prisoner put his heels on it, and drew them together, so as to confine the parcel - it fell at his feet. I took it from under his feet, and asked him where he got it, and what it was? He said he knew nothing of it, it did not belong to him, but he observed something laying on the the floor when he came into room, and he put his foot on it. I opened it, and found five 1 l, notes folded together, and ten others rolled up, and tied round with a piece of thread, separated from the five - there was also a 5 l. note folded up separate; all of them were enclosed within a piece of brown paper - (looks at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130024"/>them) - these are the same, they are all marked by me, and this is the paper they were in.

            . I am one of the firm of Heath, Ashness, and Co. Queen-street, Cheapside, we are paper-stainers. Shobel has been near three years in our service, and would have been now, if he had not been engaged in this business - he will be in our service again. In consequence of what occurred in my house I give him directions to detect persons uttering forged notes. I afterwards reported to the Bank every particular from day to day - he was employed by me for that purpose. I know the history of his life, and am certain he never was transported.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What character had you with him - A. I referred to the parish books, and found he was a parishioner - I took him before the Lord Mayor, and had him bound over to me. He was very industrious, and quite worked himself into my favour. I found him very honest and grateful. I became acquainted with him by his applying for relief when I was churchwarden. I consider him an honest man, and shall employ him again.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEES. I am an inspector of bank notes - (examines the note set out in the indictment) - it is forged - it is not bank paper. It has an apparent water-mark, which is put on after the paper is made, by pressure. It is not the Bank plate. The date line is engraved - in a genuine note it is printed. It is not C. Tabor's signature - I have known his signature many years. The letters No. before the number are engraved - in a genuine note they are printed. The whole of the twenty-nine 1 l. notes are forged in every respect, and off the same plate; they are different numbers, and are not genuine in one single instance, and are not the signatures of the signing clerks - they are signed Stock, Tabor, Conset, Lowe, and R. Clough. They are different numbers, but every number consists of the same set of figures, viz. 12570, but transposed. The 5 l. note is forged in all respects, and has the same figures in the number. The paper found in the prisoners pocket has the name of A. Consett five times on it, and A. C. several times - it has also R. Clough wrote on it. They are imitations of their hands.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell when a water-mark is made on one paper, and put on in another - A. Yes, I have seen it done in a common manufactory - these are made by pressure. My knowledge is not from practice but from theory. I have a general knowledge of engraving, so as to say whether notes are worked off one plate, and can say all these 1 l. notes are off the same plate.</p>

            . I am signing clerk of 1 l. notes at the Bank, and have been so for six years - there is no other of my name - the note has not my signature to it. There are six others bearing my name - none of them are my signature.</p>
               <p>(The note was then put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I stand here innocent of the charge. I never sold a note. The evidence of Shobel is false - he has often applied to me to get him forged notes, I refused. He said he had been transported. I found the paper in the square. They found nothing on me. They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130025"/>took me into the parlour, where there were pipes, glasses, and tobacco, as if somebody had been there. The officer picked the parcel up, and said,</p>
               <p>"This is what we want." I said it did not belong to me. At the office they said they did not see me drop it, but they had every reason to suppose I did. It is a conspiracy to take my life away.</p>

I had seen the prisoner in the tap-room about ten o'clock that morning - the tap-room door leads to the stairs; the property was taken from the second-floor. About two o'clock I met him in Jewin-street, with a bundle under his arm. I told him I did not see him go out in the morning. He asked me for something to drink - I said if he would go home with me I would give him some. We walked together to Cloth-fair; he ran down a passage into Smithfield. I called Stop thief! - he was stopped before I lost sight of him. I took him to the Bear and Ragged Staff, examined the bundle, and found it contained the property stated in the indictment, except the quilt, the duplicate of which was found on him.</p>

Three boys came round me, making a noise like a parcel of dogs, they lifted up the lid of the basket, and took one 5 s. paper out, which was tied up in brown paper; another boy took the other; I did not see who took them, but am sure the prisoners are two of the boys - the other boy was taller. Rose and the tall boy ran down Houndsditch, and I called out Stop thief! My mistress caught the prisoner, tore his coat, and took him into a clothes shop - the officer found a few halfpence on him; I saw Rose at the Mansion-house the next day, and am sure he is one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR, ADOLPHUS. Q. Rose was looking in at the Mansion-house window next day, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130026"/>was brought in - A. Yes, and I said he was the boy, who took the first paper. They went away, returned, and then took the other; I do not know that Rose was one of the three who took the halfpence - I saw him before they were taken.</p>

As soon as I came out of my house, which is about two hundred yards from Houndsditch, some boys hustled me - I will not be certain that the prisoners were then among them. When we were in Houndsditch they hustled me again, I turned round, and saw the prisoner take the printed paper of halfpence out of the basket, and give it to another boy, whom I do not know; I seized the prisoner, and never let him go until I had given him in charge - I think Rose was one of the party.</p>

About the end of November, a person came to my shop, who I believe to be the prisoner, he bought one ounce of black tea, one ounce of green, and half a pound of sugar, which came to 1 s. 6 d.; he was served, and paid me a 1 l. bank note. I asked him for his address? He said Mr. Marchant, Ingram-court, Fenchurch-street, which I wrote on the note, and gave him change - (looks at one) - this is it. I paid it to my bankers, and it was returned to me two days after as forged. I went to Mr. Marchant's, and he showed me his lads, but I could not discover any of them to be the boy who brought me the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened on the 12th of December - A. About three o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner came to the shop - I am certain it was him. As soon as he entered the threshold of my door, the impression upon my mind was, that he was the boy who had given me a forged note a fortnight before, which I have spoken of. I thought I would see what he wanted, and if he paid me a note, I would notice him. He asked for two ounces of 8 s. black tea, and one pound of 9 d. sugar; I served him - it came to 1 s. 9 d.; he then presented me a 1 l. bank note. I took my pen, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now my lad, what name shall I put on here?" He said Mr. Watson, No. 5, Bell-yard, Gracechurch-street. I then took my hat, took hold of his hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"I know you are telling me a great falsehood, for a fortnight before you brought me one of a different address, and now my man, you and I will go to Bell-yard together." I went to Bell-yard with him, the house that is called No. 5, having no number on it, there was a difficulty in finding it - it was the fifth house, and went in the direction as they were marked - it is the Excise Permit Office. When we got opposite to it, I said, we have passed No. 5, the prisoner said No, it is further on, and took me into the George and Vulture Tavern, George-yard, Lombard-street - Bell-yard communicates with George-yard. I asked for the landlord, and asked him, in the prisoner's presence, if he had any knowledge of the prisoner? He said No. I then asked him if he had any knowledge of the note? He said No. 1 then related the circumstance to him, and asked him to let me see the waiters - they came; there were two or three; I asked them if they had any knowledge of the prisoner - they said No - the prisoner said nothing; the landlord reproved him very severely, and as we went out, he said he found it. I returned home with him, left him in charge of my shopman, and went for an officer. On my return I found him in charge of Sheppard, at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then give any account of himself - A. He said his name was Williams, and he had either a brother, or friend, who was a silversmith, and lived in Smithfield - I think he mentioned a number, but I do not know what; he said he found it at the top of Lombard-street - it was a very wet day, and the note was quite clean - he was given in charge of Sheppard. I then went to the inspector's office at the bank, and marked the note there,</p>
               <p>"Watson, No. 5, Bell-yard, Gracechurch-street" - it was never out of my possession until I had marked it, except in the hands of Draper, whom I had fetched, his master, and Sheppard, but I never lost sight of it, and am certain I marked the note that he offered me - (looks at one) - this is it. The inspector returned with me to my house to the prisoner, and asked him his name? He said Williams.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Can you undertake to say that the man who passed the note a fortnight before, represented himself as coming from Marchant, or that his name was Marchant - A. As coming from him; Marchant showed me two young men, and said he had another, who was out; the second time he represented himself, as being sent by Watson - there is about twelve houses in Bell-yard; I could find no such person. I understood him to say he got it from the George and Vulture; it looks into Bell-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. A person might suppose it to be there - A. No. I had told him it was forged, and the constable had arrived when he said he found it - he was alarmed.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. When you said you had passed No. 5, what did he say - A. He said further on, and took me to the George and Vulture; the landlord and waiters denied giving it to him; he did not say he took it of anybody else. When he first mentioned Bell-yard he did not say the George and Vulture - the George and Vulture cannot be considered as in Bell-yard.</p>

               <p>Q. When he came out of the George and Vulture, did he propose going to any other house in Bell-yard, to find out any other person - A. No; the constable was sent for - I said I thought it was forged, he then said he found it.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 12th of December, I was fetched to the prosecutor's house, and took the prisoner into custody; I searched, but found nothing on him. I asked him his name? He said it was Williams; I asked him where he got the note? He said he found it in Bell-yard, and that he lived with his brother, who kept a silversmith's shop, No. 15, Smithfield - the streets were very wet and dirty on that day. I took him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130028"/>towards Giltspur-street Compter? he asked me where I was going to take him to? I said I was going to take him to Smithfield, to his friend's. He smiled very jocularly, and said</p>

               <p>"It is no use taking me there." I took him to the Compter, then went to No. 15, Smithfield, and found it was a private house. I looked round Smithfield for a silversmith's shop, but there was no such a shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He knew you was a constable - - A. Yes. You can go from Lombard-street to Bell-yard, but you must go through the George and Vulture and St. Michael's-alley. He said he had just found it in Bell-yard.</p>

            . I am an inspector of bank notes. It is my business to discover genuine notes from forged - (examines the note uttered on the 12th of December) - it is forged in every respect. It is not the bank paper nor water-mark - it has the imitation of one, which is done afterwards, by pressure; in a genuine not it is made in the paper. The date line is engraved - in a genuine note it is stereotype. It purports to be signed by R. Clough - we have a cashier of that name; he is not a signer of small notes - he was once, but was not at the time this is dated - it is not his hand-writing; I have known it for years. The letters No. are engraved - in a genuine note they are printed. The first note paid to the prosecutor is also forged in every respect, the same as the other, and the same plate and signature - one is 75112, the other 75052. In neither of these numbers do the figures 34689 occur. The dates are different. Clough was not a signing clerk at the date of either of them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If they are both off the same plate, how can the dates be different - A. I suppose the date line may be done with a slip plate, which is run into the plate - it can be done so.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you do things with the greatest accuracy at the Bank - it is almost impossible to make a mistake. Look at this note - (handing one) - A. It is what I have often seen before; it has no signature, but is a genuine note.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Have you ever seen plates with a slip line for the date - A. I think I have.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any appearance of a slip-line being used - A. No. I am not aware that it would make a difference - it would be easier to stamp a note without a slip.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not known forgeries so executed that they have been received at the Bank - A. I have; they have been passed by the inspector.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. The slip-plate merely contains the date - the impression could make no difference in the appearance of it - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many instances of forged notes having been passed at the Bank, have you known - A. Several. Some of them were, new and some worn.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the least doubt about these two notes - A. None whatever.</p>

            . I am a publican, and live in Golden-lane, St. Luke's. The prisoner has often been at my house three or four times a day. I knew her by the name of Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever pay you a note - A. She came one day and changed a note; it was very new, and had no mark on it at all. I do not think she bought anything. I wrote</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Johnson, No. 72, Golden-lane," on it, as a man named Johnson, who lived with her, told me that was her name. It was afterwards returned to me as forged. I inquired, and found she had moved. I saw her again at the police office, in custody - (looks at a note) - this is it. I paid it away twice after I received it.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you pay it away twice - A. I paid it away, received it again the same evening in change, and paid it away in giving change for a 10 l. or 15 l. note. I have known the prisoner about eleven weeks - she never offered me any other note. The man she lived with once paid me one - I wrote the same direction on it; I do not know where that is. The person I paid the note to is not here - his name is Shooter. I received it before Christmas, for I paid it to him on the 12th of December. I did not ask the prisoner for any name, but wrote that on it - (looks at a note) - it is the note I took of the prisoner. I wrote the name and address as soon as I took it of her.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes - (looks at the note) - it is forged. It is not Bank paper, plate, nor A. Consett's writing. There is the appearance of a watermark, which is impressed. The other notes are also forged, and of the same description with the last, and off the same plate. The date-line is different. The only way I can account for that is by a small plate being slid in with the date, or the 13th of August being burnished out, and another date inserted in the original plate. The numbers are stamped as they are in a genuine note, but the letters No. is engraved - in a genuine note it is printed. One is signed Tabor - it is not his hand-writing; the other is signed A. Jones - there is no such person a signing clerk.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of its being the same - A. I had not at that time, but I have since doubted it, as I think I might have mixed them.

On the 24th of October, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I received this money from Mrs. Clarke, at the Star and Garter, public-house, Old Bailey, which I took home and locked up. About seven o'clock I called at the Star and Garter, and saw the prisoner there. Mrs. Clarke asked me, in her presence, if I had taken care of my money? I said I had locked it up in my box. I told the prisoner I had drawn a guinea in gold. I left, returned in about an hour, and found her still there. She asked me to let her go home, and sleep with me, as she was tired, and had a long way to go - she went home with me about half-past ten o'clock - I took 2 s. 6 d. out of my box, and gave it to her to fetch some supper; I showed her the guinea. She said,</p>
               <p>"The sight of gold was good for sore eyes," and returned it to me again. She got some beef, and I then gave her 1 s. to get three half pints of beer; she stopped a long time, and then returned; I told her that I thought she was lost: she said she had met a friend. I asked her for the change two or three times, and she said she would give it to me by-and-by - we went to bed. I locked the door myself, and asked her to put the candle out; she wanted it to be kept alight - I agreed to it. She only pulled off her gown, and took one bone out of her stays, nothing else. About half-past four o'clock I awoke, missed her, and found the candle gone. At daylight I found the key of my box in a different place to where I left it - the box was shut, but not locked, and the money all gone. I got an officer, but could not find her at her lodgings - she was taken on the 30th of December.</p>

               <p>Q. You was never in custody of a watchman, or any one else - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that it was not a guinea that you lost, but a new gold coin - A. The prisoner said it was a new coin.</p>

Fletcher asked for the change four times, but the prisoner made her no answer, She gave her 1 s. to get some beer, and I went away - next morning the prosecutrix missed her money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had the prosecutrix lodged with you - A. Fourteen or fifteen months - she left me before Christmas.</p>

The prosecutrix called on me, and said my sister had robbed her of 5 l. 16 s. all in silver, except a new gold coin, and unless the money was brought forward, she would hang her. I saw my sister, and called on the prosecutrix at Curtis's; Mrs. Curtis said the prosecutrix was so drunk that night that she wanted to go out with my sister, but she persuaded her not to go, fearing that if she got down stairs, she should not be able to get her up again.</p>

            . I am a labourer to the East India Company. On the first of January, about ten o'clock, I heard a noise in the adjoining room, went in, and saw the prisoner on a pile of wood, drawing tea out of a chest - he had no business in that room; I said nothing to him. He asked me if I had found an old pair of shoes, which he had put there? I said No. He went into the passage with me and then returned; I followed gently, and heard him rattling the tea in the store-room; I returned to the passage, and pretended not to notice him, He came to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have been endeavouring to get some rest, but cannot, I am so full of pain, I will go and get half a pint of beer." I told Mr. Lines, who was coming up at the time - the prisoner then passed us, and Mr. Lines charged him with it. He denied it, and offered to be searched. I went away.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HINDS. I am an assistant elder to the East India Company; Irons gave me information. I stopped the prisoner, and, told him I understood he had tea about him, he said he had none, and was willing to be searched; Lines came up, pulled off his hat, and found 1 lb. 20 z. of tea concealed in a dirty bag, like the lining of his hat; the chest contained the same sort of tea - about that quantity was missing. He said he was sorry for it.</p>
               <p>JOHN LINES. I searched the prisoner's hat, and found the tea there.</p>

On the 10th of December I was in the office, and saw him pass into the yard; as he went down the steps I saw silk between his breeches and his apron - I told Pope to wait there till he returned; Pope then desired him to walk in to Mr. Ackroyd, the elder, who asked him for the skein of silk which he had in his possession; he said he had none. Ackroyd said he had, and desired he would give it him. After a little hesitation, he took a skein out of his pocket, and said he meant to return it. Ackroyd asked him if he had any more? he said No. Shires was sent for, and found in all nineteen skeins on him - four of which were were fastened with thread to a button of his breeches, and suspended between his thighs.</p>

            , who lives at Muswell-hill, Hornsey; he had a quantity of shrubs in the pleasure ground, which is fenced all round. On the 23d of November, at seven o'clock at night, I saw them all safe; next morning I found a quantity of holly, saffrons, Rhoda bendrams, and other evergreens, cut and taken away. About eight o'clock the officer came, and produced shrubs of this description they had been partly cut, and then torn away; those produced tallied exactly with what were left, and I am certain are part of those lost; they will never return again to their proper maturity. The damage done was upwards of 20 s. The prisoners lived at Highgate.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 23d of December, a little after one o'clock in the morning, I was with Davenport, and met the prisoners in Coney Hatch-lane with two bundles of holly and other evergreens - one had his bundle on his head, and the other on his shoulder, with a pole. Fisher said he brought it from Hadley, and threw his bundle down, and said he would carry it no further. I asked them whom they had it from? they said they had it from a gardener, and gave 2 s. 6 d. for it. I have been a gardener myself, and told them I was sure no gardener would ever presume to cut such shrubs as those. Hummerston told Fisher he had better take his bundle up, and go along with it, which he did, and we put them into the cage. They said they had stolen them, but they did not say where from. I found a knife on each of them - one was a gardener's knife, was all green, and appeared to have been fresh used; the other was a shoemaker's knife - there was a notch in each knife, which being compared with the shrubs, agreed with it. I have no doubt but they were cut with those knives. No gardener would cut such shrubs as those. I shewed them to Brewer, and they tallied with the trees.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Burls. On the night of the 25th of October, I went to bed about eleven o'clock; I was the last up, and am certain all the house was fastened up, the stair case window, on the first floor was shut down. I came down about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and found the upper sash half way down, also footmarks on the window and in the house; there was a ladder outside, standing up against the window - anybody could then get in and out. I went into the front parlour, and found the shutter half-way open, so that they had been in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. The staircase window is twelve feet from the ground. It had been daylight sometime before I got up - I saw no appearance of a candle having been used.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BURLS, Esq. I rent a house in Gloucester-place, in the parish of St. Marylebone. When I came down in the morning, I found my silver snuff-box gone, which I had left in the parlour the night before; also a pair of spectacles, and a brooch; a work-box was emptied, and the contents gone. I missed a lady's gold watch, and a green net purse, with a clasp, from my wife's dressing-room, which joins our bed-room on the second floor; there was about 18 s. in the purse - I had seen them there when I went to bed. The thieves must have passed through my bed-room, to get to the dressing-room. I then went into the drawing-room, on the first floor, missed some packs of cards, and all the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth considerably more than 40 s.; the brooch was found at a pawnbroker's in the neighbourhood; I have also seen some of the silver, broken up - the robbery was committed on Saturday night, or Sunday morning.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Stafford-street, St Marylebone, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's. On the 29th of October, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner Chard came and offered a small gold brooch set with brilliants, in pledge for 5 s. I asked him whose it was? he said it was his own. I asked him where he got it? he said he bought it of a man at a public-house for 7 s., but he was informed that it was worth two or three times that money. I suspected him, and sent for a constable, who came; I showed him the brooch, which appeared to answer the description of one in a handbill which I had received before; I showed the constable the handbill, in the prisoner's presence, and went with him, and the prisoner to Mr. Burls; we produced the brooch, which he claimed; I left him in charge of the constable. I produce some silver, which appears to be part of the articles of a lady's work-box; here are two silver thimbles, and a silver purse-spring, with part of the purse. About an hour after I had stopped Chard, Jones came to sell them. I observed a green thread and tassel hanging to the purse-spring, which I pulled off; I weighed it, and gave her 2 s. for it. In the course of the day I got a fresh handbill, and thought they might be part of the property, and sent for Coates. I believe I sold Blanchard the pantaloons found at Jones's lodgings, about a week before the robbery - there is my mark on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say a man named Clark sold him the brooch - A. He mentioned no name - he did not describe the man.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner Chard, and took him to Mr. Burls with Gideon - as we went along, I asked him where he got the brooch? he said he bought it of a young man, named Clark, who had been a gentleman's servant, and that he had known him some years. I asked him where he lived? he said he did not know; I told him that was very strange, as he had known him so long; he said if he was let go, he dare say he could find him himself; I told him that was impossible, took him to Mr. Burls, and produced the brooch. About seven o'clock in the evening, Gideon sent for me again, and produced some silver, which answered the description in the handbill; he told me who he bought it of, and went with me and Smith to Jones's lodgings, No, 28. Mitcham-street, and took her into custody there; I searched the place, and found two packs of cards in a drawer; as soon as she saw me take them out, she put a pair of scissars into my hand - I found nothing else there, except a pair of trowsers, and other clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not describe Clark - A. He said he was taller than himself, and I believe he said he wore a light coat; I went to two or three houses to find Clark, but could find no such person as he had described - Blanchard absconded, and was never heard of, until last Tuesday - I took him on Wednesday morning at Chelsea.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was with Coates, and took Chard at Mr. Gideon's, he has given a correct account; Chard said he was pledging the brooch for money to take him to the fight at Moulsey Hurst, and that he was to meet the young man who sold him the brooch, in the Edgware-road, to go to the fight together. I afterwards went with Gideon and Coates to Jones's lodgings, and found two packs of cards, a pair of scissars, and some wearing apparel. I produce two neck-handkerchiefs, two silk handkerchiefs, a sheet, a pair of new boots, a pair of pantaloons, and a waistcoat.</p>

            . I was taken up for this robbery on a Thursday - Chard had been taken up that morning. I know Blanchard - he used to come backwards and forwards frequently, from September, until I was taken. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130034"/>had seen him on the Saturday evening that this robbery was committed - he left me about ten o'clock; I saw him on the Sunday afternoon, then on the Monday morning, and every day. I got the scissars from Blanchard, that I gave to Coates, either on the Sunday or Monday. I sold the silver to Gideon, and broke it up. Chard gave it to me on the Sunday or Monday. There was part of the clasp of a purse, which was either green or brown. After he had given them to me, he said that he wished me not to keep any of them, and so I broke them up and sold them; I showed them to him the morning that I sold them in the evening, in the same state they are in now. The clothes found at my lodgings are his; he had them sometime before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say why he wished you to sell them - A. On the evening before Chard was taken, I saw Blanchard with the brooch, he took it away, saying it was part which belonged to what I had got, and he did not wish me to keep the things he had given me, any more than he wished to keep the brooch himself; I destroyed every thing he gave me, except what is now produced - he gave no reason why I was to destroy them, only that there was something in the papers about them, that he did not like.

             re-examined. The brooch is mine; I have had it three years, and wear it myself - I know the scissars, the clasp, and the thimbles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say that you suspected a man, who you saw with your servant the day before - A. No, when he said the brooch was given to him by a servant I asked him to describe him? he said he was a little man - I had occasionally seen a man in the Mews, but he was a large lusty man.</p>
               <p>BLANCHARD'S Defence. It is useless pretending that I am entirely ignorant of it, I will explain every thing. On the night of the robbery, I was coming from the play, and met Clark, went with him to Gloucester-place, and waited while he got over the wall, and returned with the things which were taken to my lodgings. In the morning he went away, took most of the things, and left those that were found at my lodgings. In a few days I met him, and he told me to keep out of the way, as a young man, who he gave the brooch to, was apprehended.</p>

            . I am a journeyman carpenter, and live in the Edgeware-road. Chard lodged with me at the time he was taken up, and for two months before. On the Saturday before he was taken, he came home at half-past ten o'clock, and went to bed. I saw him come in - he sleeps in the next room to me. He did not go out until seven in the morning - if he had I must have known it, as he must pass through my room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I live about half a mile from the prosecutor. My wife sleeps in the same room with me, and knows this as well as myself - she is not here. I did not go before the magistrate to tell this, as I was not sent for. He was never out later than half-past ten o'clock.</p>

            . I live in the parish of Stoke Newington. On the 7th of January, I went out between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, and fastened the house up quite safe. I secured the window with a nail, and saw all the articles stated in the indictment safe in the house when I left. One pair of boots were almost new, and worth above 10 s. - there were two pair of shoes also, worth 10 s. I was the last person in the house. In consequence of information which I received, I returned home between twelve and one o'clock - I was the first person that got home. I found the door and window open; the window was broken, and the nail with which it was fastened laid under it. All the drawers were opened, and the property taken out.</p>

            . I am a journeyman baker. On the 7th of January, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw a donkey, with a pannier on his back, come out of the lane where the prosecutor's house is. I saw the prisoner come out of the house with a pair of top-boots in his hand; he ran down the lane as soon as he saw me. When I had got about a hundred yards he returned, and went after the donkey. There was another man with the donkey - they came down the street, towards the town, which leads to the common. I saw a bundle in the pannier, and gave the alarm, but could not follow.</p>

I took him back to the shop with the great-coat on his back. There was nobody in the house. He took the coat off, and put it on the counter. Lawrence came in, and I sent him for his master - he fetched him. The coat was given to the beadle with the prisoner.</p>

            . My house is in the parish of St. John, Hackney. I was sent for, and found the prisoner in the shop, in custody. Mason said, in the prisoner's presence, that he saw him come from the shop with the great-coat on his back. Suspected he had something that did not belong to him, pursued him, and brought him back. The prisoner said nothing. I gave him in charge.</p>

On the 2d of January, about eleven o'clock in the morning, two men came for a pianoforte, which was on the ground-floor. I took them into the back parlour for it, and left the street-door open. I followed the men out, and immediately missed the clock off the mantle-piece in the front parlour - I saw the footmarks where the clock had stood - I had seen it safe just before. There was time for a man to go in and take it while we were in the back parlour. I ran to the door, and told the people of the robbery. The men could not take it; I was with them all the time. I saw the clock at the watch-house about a week after.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 2d of January, I saw the prisoner and another man in Castle-street, about a quarter before two o'clock - they went up Nottingham-court, which is about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house - the prisoner was carrying the clock, concealed in an apron. I laid hold of him, and asked him where he got it? he said a gentleman gave it to him at Charing-cross to carry to Holborn. I took the prisoner, and my brother took the other. I advertised the clock, and no owner coming for it in the course of a week, the men were discharged. I afterwards showed the clock to Brunton. On the Wednesday following my brother brought Jones into the watch-house, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night. I cannot find his companion.</p>

The landlord does not live in the house - there are other lodgers - the shop door opens into the passage.

I saw his face by the light of a lamp which I had burning, and took particular notice of him. I am sure the prisoner is the man. He took a watch which hung in the window; I immediately seized my pen-knife, and attempted to cut his hand, to prevent his taking it - I do not know whether I cut it or not; I got hold of the chain, as he held the watch - the chain broke, and he got the watch. I have never seen it since. My wife tried to open the door and go out, but somebody held it with a string. The daylight was quite gone.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR STEVENS. I am near eleven years old, and live in Gardiner's-lane, York-street. Last Thursday night, about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner running as hard as he could, in a direction from Jacobs's shop; I did not see him at the shop; Jacobs was running after him - he was about twenty yards from the shop; I am certain it was the prisoner. I saw his face by the light from a woman's stall. He was about two yards from me. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I was going past Mr. Jacob's window, about ten minutes before eight o'clock, and looked if I could see Mrs. Jacobs through the window. I saw the prisoner looking through the window - he appeared to be looking at Mr. Jacobs, who was at work. The lamp in the window threw a great light on his face, and there was another light from the shop opposite - I am certain he is the man. I saw his face distinctly. I did not stop two minutes, and left him there.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Aldgate. On the 15th of January, about one o'clock at night, I saw the two prisoners and two others in Rosemary-lane, near the house; they passed my box, and turned up a turning opposite my box. I went round to cry one o'clock; turned up a turning, put my lanthorn behind me, and went into a dark court to watch them - and saw them all four come down the turning where they went up, and go towards the prosecutor's house. They stopped about the door, walking backwards and forwards, until half-past one o'clock. I am certain the prisoners were two of them. They were tossing halfpence with each other under the gas-lamp, which is over the prosecutor's door - I did not see them do anything to the house; I went away, called the hour, put my lanthorn in my box, and went there again. I slipped up the street, keeping close to the houses, and stood at the corner of Derby-street; I saw Sullivan leave the other three, and come down on the opposite side. I then saw one of them standing at the prosecutor's door watching; he saw me, immediately turned round, and said, there is the watchman; Driscoll, and another young man bounced out of the house, and ran across the street; all three of them ran into Blue Anchor-yard. I went over to the house and found it open - the staple was drawn, and the till laying on the floor; I heard the patrol call - we both went in together, and the prosecutor came down. I took Sullivan about two o'clock the next morning, coming by my box, and pretending to be in liquor; Driscoll was taken next day about ten o'clock - I have known him two years, and am sure he is the man.</p>

Williams and I followed, and saw the prisoner coming out of a court leading to Rosemary-lane with two others; one of whom I saw lurking about with him, and was with him when he took it.

Jacklin resisted very much, and asked what he had done? I told him he was trying to break into my house, and had been watched ever since six o'clock - I took him into the tap. Before the officer came he put his hand into his left-hand breeches pocket, and dropped a key on his boot, and then gave it a kick. I picked it up.</p>

About half-past seven I was going out, saw Jacklin leave the door again, and put something into his pocket. I watched him, and followed him into Fleet-street, to the corner of Water-lane, where he stopped and conversed with Lee, I crossed over to watch, and saw them return towards the court together - Jacklin went down the court, and Lee went further up Fleet-street, towards Bouverie-street. I crossed again, went to Monk's tap, and informed him. We went out, and saw Lee peeping round the corner, towards Boar's Head-court, looking towards the Bolt in Tun yard. Monk went between them, and asked Jacklin what he was about? he tried to strike him. I called the watch, and they were taken.</p>

Jacklin resisted very much; I laid hold of Lee, he was quiet. They were taken to the tap - Jacklin followed behind - we sat down in a box with Lee, I thought I observed him drop something under the table, Jacklin was fighting at the time, so that I could not ascertain exactly. As soon as the officer secured him I found a bag, containing three skeleton keys, and on searching further I found a single skeleton key; Lee put his hand under the table, which made me suspect he was getting rid of something.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. Q. It was foggy - A. It was dark. Lee had not been in that part of the room where I found the single skeleton key. There were several people in the room.</p>

On the 29th of November, at eleven o'clock, I put him on sentry at the front gate of the barracks - he was to remain sentry until one o'clock, but would be on guard until ten o'clock in the morning - the guard was stationed in the guard-room in the yard - no person could get out of the front gate without his knowing it. There was another sentry at the back gate.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was that person - A. The prisoner, I knew him before. I saw him come back, and suspected him to be the same man, and told him it was not a right time to bring a box down, he said they were in a hurry to go to Windsor - I saw no other soldier. He had no box with him then. I was a quarter before one o'clock when he returned, not when he passed.</p>

            . I am a corporal. I went to the barrack-yard, about eight o'clock on the Monday morning that the portmanteau was missed. I examined the list to see who was on guard that night; I suspected the prisoner, and went to search the stables in Seymour mews, where he had the care of his master's horse. Lieutenant Greaves is his master - the stables are rented by the regiment; only his master's horse stood there - the prisoner did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130039"/>sleep there. We found the portmanteau in the loft over the stable, covered over with hay - we broke the doors open; the prisoner occupied the loft at the time. I took it to the barracks, and shewed it to the watchman, in the prisoner's presence, between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>"Here is a shilling for you." I said,</p>
               <p>"I don't want your shillings." He said Take it," which I did, and put it into my pocket. They then took the potatoes over the place. Head went back his quantity, and put both of them on the wood-stack, out ten yards from the barn - they then took them into the road, and then into a field where Wiggins had been hedging the day before, and put them under some wood which they had cut up for the hedge. It was moonlight. I went and told the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell the watchman - A. About nine o'clock at night. Nobody was at home before that - my master was absent - I told nobody of it before. The watchman and I went to the field - I showed him the potatoes. We watched them all night, until seven o'clock in the morning - nobody came for them - in about three hours after they were gone. They must have broken the boards down to get at the barn, as the doors were locked and bolted. I saw Wiggins stick the boards up again as I was in the privy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was he in putting the boards up - A. About five minutes. I watched them after I received the shilling. I returned to the privy again to watch them. I knew the prisoner well.</p>
               <p>Q. The full moon was on the 12th, at four o'clock in the morning - it would be down much sooner than when they came - A. It was full moonlight. The privy is about ten yards from the barn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at White's house during the day - A. Yes, and saw the maid. I inquired for the bailiff. I did not think it right to tell the maid.</p>
               <p>Q. After you left off watching, what became of you - A. I went to bed. I did not move them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not surprised at Wiggins's giving you a shilling - A. I was afraid of Head, which made me take it, as he had several times threatened to shoot me when I was watching in the fields. I was once discharged from my place for a week, as the foreman and I fell out - I do not remember what it was about. Wiggins came to his work as usual, and was taken.</p>

I stood at the window sometime, and saw the two prisoners on the flat, taking up the lead - they could not see me. I opened the window, went out to them, and called Male to assist me. Brown said to Ebbs,</p>
               <p>"D - n it, we're done!" I ordered them into the room - they came in, and surrendered themselves. I gave them in charge.

            . I am servant to Mr. Colville, and sleep in the shop. On the 11th of January, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I was disturbed by a noise in the carpenters' shop. I got up, and saw the prisoner there, taking the tools off the bench; I went down to meet him at the door with a loaded blunderbuss in my hand - I found great difficulty in taking him; I collared him in the shop - he had broken it open with a chisel; I found the chisel near the door. He made a desperate resistance, and both fell to the ground - he got the blunderbuss from me. I at last secured him, returned to the tool-house, and found his hat there.</p>

            . I am a publican. On the 24th of December, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I was at Acton with Mr. Bailey - it was dark, and foggy; I heard somebody coming on. We stopped opposite the Red Lion, and two men came opposite us, one had a bag on his back - the prisoner had a basket. I crossed over to them, and asked the man what was in the bag, as I saw it was something alive; he said they were hares. I asked him where he got them? he said out of the country. I put my hand into the prisoner's basket, found feathers, and asked him if he had got pheasants? he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, and a few fowls." I asked him if he got them from the same place? he said Yes. I collared the other man, and told him he must go with us, to see what he had got. I had not got ten yards when the prisoner passed me on the road, in Bailey's custody. He got from him, and ran by me. I gave the other man to Bailey and collared him. The other man then got from Bailey. I kept hold of the prisoner, took him to my house, searched him, and found a flint, a gimlet, and three or four pieces of raw beef in his waistcoat pocket. I asked him if that was to stop the dogs from barking? - he made no answer. I found nine hens and a cock, dead, and a small liver, in his basket. There were seven live rabbits in the other man's bag.</p>

I heard a strange step coming down stairs, went to see who it was, and saw the back of a man going out at the back door, which goes into the street; I went up and found the room in great confusion. Sometime afterwards, the prosecutrix came home and said she had been robbed. I told her, a tall man with a blue apron went out - I thought it might be her husband. The man was the same size as the prisoner. He appeared to have a fustian jacket on.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. I was coming from work about a quarter before nine o'clock, and met the prisoner and two men in James-street, Haymarket. I passed them, turned round, and saw them go up to the spout. a gentleman passed them - the prisoner crossed the road and returned again to them; a gentleman passed them again - the prisoner crossed the street again, went back, and I saw them take the pipe from the wall, and go across the road with it. I went to meet them and passed them some distance. When they saw me, they stopped under a dead wall; I passed them again - they still stood under the wall with the pipe. I went towards my house, met my wife, turned back and met the tallest man of the three; then met the prisoner. His brother stood in Oxendon-street with the pipe on his shoulder. I went and told the prosecutor that three men had stolen his pipe, and I knew them very well; I knew them before - I am sure the prisoner was one of them. He was taken next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not take them that night - A. I could not find a constable. I knew the prisoner and his brother before, by seeing them about the street; the other man was a stranger, but I knew him by sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You left them in the street with the pipe - A. Yes; to give information to the prosecutor. I live in St. Martin's-street, Liecester-fields. I am positive the prisoner is one of them. There was a lamp over the door. I have done work for his brother. He fetched his shoes away. I did not carry them home. I do not know where they live.</p>

            . I was going over to the Haymarket, and met my husband at the corner of the street. He said there was a lead pipe coming down the street, and told me to watch where it went to. I saw the prisoner's brother take it on his shoulder, into No. 50, Whitcombe-street, four doors from James-street. The prisoner and another man assisted in taking it in. The prisoner stood at the door while the other two went in, and then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130042"/>followed them in - he came out and walked up and down for about half an hour. I went over, looked through the window and saw the lead in the shop - it is an old iron shop. I am positive the prisoner is the man - I have known him a long while about the neighbourhood. His mother used to keep a house behind the Haymarket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you walk up and down Whitcombe-street for half an hour - A. Yes; the watchman called nine o'clock. I did not give him in charge. The house has only a shop door, which is kept open. I saw a woman in the shop. The house was searched next day between ten and eleven - the lead was not found.</p>

               <p>THOMAS CAWKWELL. I live at Hoddesdon, in Hertfordshire. On the 11th of December, at half-past ten o'clock at night, I met the prisoner on this side the Cock, at <placeName id="t18190113-85-crimeloc483">Edmonton</placeName>

               <p>"For what?" he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130043"/>" Your money!" - he spoke plainly, I could hear him distinctly. He collared me, and said,</p>
               <p>"I will have your money, or I will blow your brains out, for I have a pistol." He did not produce one. I collared him, struggled with him, and said I wanted money as bad as he did; that I had a 1 l. note, and he should have half of it - I showed it to him. I looked in his face, and said,</p>
               <p>"I thought you was an Irishman, but I see you are an Englishman, and shall have part of it. If you will go with me I will give you some beer, and will join you for the note. He refused going to Edmonton, but at last he did - we went to the Bell public-house, the landlord pushed us out. When we got out he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, what do you mean by asking for the landlord? if I thought you meant to betray me I would mill you directly." I said,</p>
               <p>"If I meant to betray you I could have done it before now." We then went to a watchman, and asked for a house - he directed us to one - we could not find it. I met another watchman, and gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am a clothes-salesman, and live in Cable-street, Whitechapel. On the 29th of December, in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop, and offered to sell me three duplicates of the articles produced. I suspected him, and left him in the shop, under pretence of going to examine them, but I got an officer. When I got back he was gone. He returned in about ten minutes, and was secured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not tried here - A. Yes, and acquitted.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS FREEMAN. I am an officer. I took the prisoner at Lewis's house, and found the direction on him which the prosecutor had given him.</p>

I left the coach, and was walking on the footpath, the prisoner came to me, took my hat off my head, gave it to another boy, and told him to run away with it - I am sure the prisoner took it; they were the two boys who pushed me against the coach; the other ran away - I have never got my hat. I followed the prisoner for my hat into a dark passage; he then beat me, and said he had not got it. I followed him into Spital-square, where a gentleman collared him, as I informed him of it. I gave him in charge. My father bought the hat for me.</p>

I then went to Elliott's, and found six egg-cups, a decanter, and a soup-dish; I found three eggcups at Massey's, and a custard-cup at Bradley's. I then went to Williams's, and found a water-bottle, and three wine-glasses. I went home, and in the evening Jacobs was requested to take my child out as usual - she said she was going up stairs to fetch her bonnet; while she was up stairs, Martin went out; Jacobs then came down, and went out without her bonnet; we followed her into Bradley's shop; she put the child on the counter, took three custard-cups from some part of her person, and put them on the counter. Martin went into the shop, she fell on her knees, and begged for mercy, saying it was her first offence. I got an officer, and took him to the shop, where the property was found - they were ordered to appear on the thursday, and were committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR ADOLPHUS. Q. How many ladies lodge in the house, besides your own family - A. None. I never let lodgings to ladies. I was never in custody in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in this Court before - A. Never, except to hear a trial - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never stood at that bar - A. No, I was never tried. I was charged with housebreaking, but was not tried.</p>
               <p>Q, Were you ever in custody - A. I believe I was one night in a watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. How many days were you in Newgate before you were brought to trial - A. I do not know whether it was three days or ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever convicted of keeping a house of ill fame - A. Yes, about twelve years ago - I was imprisoned three months for it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How long is it since you was tried here - A. Twelve or fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. You was charged with burglary - A. I suppose so; I was taken to the watch-house - and then to Clerkenwell prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you imprisoned for keeping a disorderly house - A. In Tothill-fields.</p>

I found Jacobs in the shop, and three custard-cups laying on the counter; I asked Bradley if she had bought anything of the girl before? she said she had bought one custard-cup before, for twopence halfpenny. Isaacs then took me to Williams's, in Cirencester-place, Titchfield-street; I found three wine-glasses, and a bottle there; we found three liquor-bottles at Lettis's, in Fitzroy-market.

I asked him for some laperne-dishes; he said he had some, but he got them out of the house immemediately, for he sold them to some Jews; he told me who the Jews were, and I went to them, and found eleven laperne-dishes. I went with Isaacs to the other prisoners' houses, and found part of the property - I returned to his house.

I went to Gee's-court; there are several old iron shops there, but could not find it. As I returned, I found the prisoner in custody in the shop, with the moulding broken up. I put him into a coach - he called to somebody in the crowd, to go to the White Hart, public-house, Drury-lane, and tell them he was taken.</p>

            . I was crossing from Prince's-street to Hanover-square, and saw the prisoner stop and put something down - I heard it rattle. He went on - as soon as I turned the corner of the square, I met Folkard; he asked if I had met a man with some brass - I returned with him to the spot, and found the prisoner there, stooping again. When he heard us, he got up and was going away. Falkard called out Stop! he immediately stopped, and asked what was the matter? we took him, with the brass, to the prosecutor's. I am sure he is the man who put it there. He put it close to the railing of the garden.</p>

I ran out, and met White in Hanover-square; he said he had seen a man put something through the rails. We went and found the prisoner at the spot.</p>

I have never found it. I had been told that somebody wanted me at No. 50, Wheeler-street - I went there, but found it was not true.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police constable. On the 4th of December I was on duty near the Docks, about a quarter before five o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's premises with two cans; I asked him what was there? he said nothing. I found 56 lbs. of lead in them. He said it was only a little, which it was customary to take to get some beer.</p>

On the 9th of December, about eight o'clock in the morning, I found the barn broken open - the lock had been forced off; I had locked it the night before, and left thirteen sacks of wheat in the chaff there, and a quantity loose about the floor. I missed four sacks of wheat in the chaff, which would produce ten bushels of wheat; there were foot marks of above two persons in the granary - I traced them into Nicholls's yard, which leads to both houses - I traced them to both houses; the shoes of one man had iron tips on them, but one was only half-tipt, as if it had been broken - they appeared to be the mark of one man; the other man had no particular marks. I have since seen a pair of shoes in possession of Mead; they corresponded exactly with the marks of the tips; I tried them with several, and have no doubt but they were the shoes that made them. I went with the constable to search Tyler's house between twelve and one o'clock that day, and found a sack there with loose chaff in it, also some chaff, and kernels of wheat on the floor. I then went to Nicholls, forced open the door, but found nobody there; I found about two sacks of loose chaff on the floor, in the sleeping-room; it appeared to have been lately separated from the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130050"/>wheat - it was scattered as if it had been sifted. The four sacks of wheat would produce two sacks of chaff; we found no sacks there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Can you say whether the marks were made at night or in the evening when they left work - A. The marks appeared fresh - there were marks where they appeared to have rested.</p>
               <p>Q. Might they not have gleaned it - A. If wheat is gleaned, it is generally taken to the mill immediately, and not kept until December.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Had Nicholls any business in the granary - A. No, it is in the orchard close to the house - they came to work at six o'clock the next morning; I found four sieves and a pan, at Nicholls's.</p>

The prisoners and two other young men came into the tap-room, and wanted to fight with me and another man, I refused; the other man fought with him, they went out, and I missed the boots from my side. I got an officer and found the prisoners at No. 3. Parker-street, a few doors off. The boots stood on a chair in the room.</p>

On the 29th of December, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, I went to shew the house to a gentleman. While he was gone for a light, I went to open the street-door, pulled the key out, and found I could not open it. When the light came I looked into the key-hole, and found there was a key inside. I knocked at the door three or four times very loud - several persons came round. Some of them said there were two persons running across the roof of the house. I went into the next house, got over the wall, and into my own yard - I found the yard-door open. When I got on the back-door landing-place, two men made their escape out of the street-door. I ran to the door, and called out Stop thief! the prisoner was brought back in about two minutes by Woodward and Smith. I went on the roof, and found the lead which covered the top of the door taken off, doubled up, and left on the party-wall. I saw it compared with the place, and am certain it is the lead - they had pulled the nails out, and taken it away. I found a sack on the garret landing-place.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130056"/>The key in the lock was the key of the door; I had left it with Mrs. Johns to show the premises.</p>
               <p>JAMES WOODWARD. I am a tailor, and live in Fitzroy-place. I was going up Buckingham-place, and saw several people standing about the prosecutor's house - the prosecutor was knocking at the door - I looked up to the roof, and saw a person walking in the front gutter. I told the prosecutor, who went through the next house. Presently afterwards, the street-door opened rom within. I saw the prisoner, and Salmon, come out. I pursued and took the prisoner - I never lost sight of him - he ran very fast. I brought him back, and gave him in charge.</p>

In about a minute Salmon came to the watch-house door; I secured him, and found a pair of pincers on him - I also found a pen-knife and a pack of cards on the prisoner. I went to the house, found the nails had been drawn out, and the lead entirely moved away - it fitted exactly, and weighed 17 lbs. There had been an attempt to take more.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Long. He sent me with the prisoner to take the knives and forks. When we got out I asked him where they were going to? He said they were going to some young people, who had just set up in business, and he would take me there. He said my master had allowed him 2 s. 6 d. for getting their custom, and I was not to say a word about it to the people. He took me up a passage leading from Holborn into Hyde-street, gave me 6 d., and told me to go into the front door of the Bull's Head, public-house, as that was the house - I was to call for a pint of beer, give him the knives, and he would take them in at the side-door, to prevent suspicion of our coming together - I gave them to him. I stood at the corner of the house to watch. Instead of going in at the side-door, he ran down the passage into Holborn. I pursued, and took him at the corner of Newton-street. He resisted - I took him back.</p>

            . I am son of the last witness. On the 1st of November, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I went from my father's house to the shop, and found the doors forced open, and the property stated in the indictment gone; we heard nothing of it till a fortnight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130058"/>after, when the father of the witness, Munton, informed me where they were sold. I went to a shop kept by the prisoners, Hinton, in Peter-street, Wardour-street, and found a pair of copper scales hanging in the window, a tea-urn on the table, and four papers of brass goods; the officer went backwards in the passage, and found a basket with some flask, and old copper in it - they both denied knowing anything of it, and said they never saw it - I am sure the property is ours. I know one of the papers of brass goods - the paper being a particular sort.</p>

            . I live in South-place, Knightsbridge. On the 31st of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I saw four persons go up to Mr. Phillips's shop, and look through the keyhole - one of them came to me, and bought a pennyworth of apples - they went about twenty yards off, and whispered to each other, then returned, and went up the yard, to the back of Mr. Phillips's premises - I saw them looking in at the window - they were standing about all the evening, but I saw nothing particular; I left them there about ten o'clock - Baker bought the apples, and gave them to Lee - Munton was with them; I knew them before - I am sure there was four of them.</p>

            . On Saturday, the 31st of October, about six o'clock in the evening, Baker, Lee, and I met together in Exeter-street, Sloane-street, Lee said he should like to go into Mr. Phillips's shop - Baker and I agreed to it. We went about eleven o'clock at night, and all three set our backs against the doors, and burst them open. Lee and I went inside, Baker stood outside - we took two tea-urns, a pair of copper scales, a tea-pot, and several brass articles, put them on a table at the back of the shop, we came out, shutting the doors, and met Baker in front of the house; we went towards Hyde-park corner for two hours, then we all three came back to Phillips's shop. I went in at the back door, and handed all the things out to Baker and Lee, they put them into a basket which we found at the back of the shop, and concealed them in a ditch in a field at the back of Knightsbridge; Lee said he would take us to a place where they would buy them of us; we all three went together to Peter-street, Wardour-street, and knocked at Hinton's door - he keeps a marine store shop - we received no answer, and came away. Lee and Baker went home to their lodgings. I went to mine, but could not get in, it was about three o'clock in the morning. I walked about until near six o'clock, then went and called Lee. We called Baker, went to the field, and got the things - we took them to Hinton's, Lee went in, Baker and I waited outside. Lee called me in with the things; I took them into the parlour behind the shop, and put them on the table. Hinton and his wife were there. I and Lee came out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the things - A. Left them there; there was no agreement about them; Lee said he would call again that morning - I heard no conversation about them. I was hardly two minutes there. When we got to the bottom of Princes-street I left them, and went home. I met Lee and Baker about eleven o'clock, they gave me 2 s., and I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not think that a small portion of your profits - A. Yes, but I said nothing. I met them a few days after - they ill-used me. I never saw them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with yourselves from six o'clock until eleven - A. We walked round about Sloane-street, went up to the shop, and looked into it between seven and eight o'clock. Baker bought some apples of Mrs. Griffiths, and gave some to Lee. I am sure there was only three of us. We looked into the shop, both front and back. They told me that they got 8 s. for the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you tell this to afterwards - A. To Mrs. Phillips, and told her where the things were. I was going to enter into the American service.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where did you live at the time - A. In the New-road, Knightsbridge. I went to school for two years, then I turned thief. Lee and Baker lodged in Exeter-buildings. We got to Hinton's about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see there - A. Mr. and Mrs. Hinton, and a little girl, were the only persons there. The prisoners beat me afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you said you would be revenged - A. No; I thought it would be best to leave their company, and told Phillips of it.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. On the 25th of November Phillips, Westcoat, and I went to execute a search-warrant at Hinton's house. I saw Mrs. Hinton, and asked her if her husband was within? she said No, but she expected him in every minute. I asked her if she had bought a tea-urn, copper scales, and those sort of things? she said there was a tea-urn and some scales. I went in - the tea-urn was on the table; Phillips claimed it, and the scales, which hung in the window. Four papers of brass-work laid in the window, for sale as I suppose - it was an old-iron shop. I told her there was another tea-urn and a tea-pot, which came with those - she said she had bought nothing else but these. On searching further, I found the basket, with some boxes, in the passage, brought it into the shop, and Phillips claimed it. I asked her how she came by it? she said she did not know how it came there, unless the children might have had it to play with in the street. I asked her if she thought she should know the person who brought them if she saw them? she said she thought she should. Her husband came in, and said he was a harness-maker, and did not deal in the shop, but his wife did, and that he did not buy them. I found some new harness up stairs, he said he made it. We took them to the magistrate, and he was set at liberty until we could find the prisoners. On the 27th of November I went to Exeter-buildings, and found the prisoners at their lodgings - they live about five doors apart. I apprehended Munton the same day on board the Cyrus, at Limehouse-hole.</p>
               <p>Cross examined. Q. It was a broker's shop - A. Yes. The things were exposed for sale. The scales are not perfect.</p>
