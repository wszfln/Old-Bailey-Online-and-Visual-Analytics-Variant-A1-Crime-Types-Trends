                  </hi>. I am a salesman, of 36, Ludgate Hill—on Saturday, October 27th, I was standing outside No. 36 about 9.30 p.m.—I saw a man coming down the street waving a flag—about half a dozen men ran into the roadway and surrounded him—I saw the two prisoners going through his pockets—he was standing up—the two prisoners went into the roadway and went towards St. Paul's Cathedral—my employer was with me—I followed the prisoners—opposite Warwick Lane I saw a man, who is not in custody, walking on Pinnock's left and saying something—I saw Pinnock look at his own hand, and I saw a watch in his hand—I was about 1 ft. away from him—I waited till we got to where there were two constables, when I said to them, pointing to Gibson, "Seize him"—Pin<lb/>nock made a rush towards the left of the crowd—I followed him—he passed his right arm through the crowd—I seized his arm, and caught hold of his hand—there was no watch in it—I handed him over to the police.</p>

I am barman at the Crooked Billet, Cable Street, St. George's-in-the-East—on October 20th, about 11 o'clock, the prisoner came in with another female and called for two classes of ale—she gave me a bad florin—I said, "Are you aware that this is a bad coin?"—she said, "No; it is all right"—I waited a little longer, and she gave me a good shilling—I gave her 6d. and 4d. change, and gave her the coin back, and they left—she was perfectly sober—this coin (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) resembles it, but I cannot swear to it.</p>

I have been robbed of my money and struck in the face"—he appeared to be dazed—I took the prisoners to the station, where the prosecutor identified Gray as one of his assailants—they were charged—Jones said, "I am innocent of it; I never saw that man in my life before," pointing to Gray—Gray said, "It is right; I ran away, but it was to get away from the crowd."</p>

I am house surgeon at St. George's Hospital—between 11 and 12 on September 27th Frederick Platt was brought to the hospital—he had a small wound, about 3/4 in. long, at the base of the skull, near the middle line—it was necessary to trepan, and I assisted in the operation—the inner part of the skull was depressed and pressing on the membrane of the brain—there was no immediate danger, but danger from after troubles—so far as I can see, he has now completely recovered, with the exception of the scar—he was detained from Septem<lb/>ber 27th to October 17th—the belt produced is a likely weapon to have caused the wound rather than a stick—it would require to be used with considerable force to have done so.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I work for the last witness—I speak a little English—I was with him in the New Cut on a Monday—the prisoner and another man came in the evening and asked my gover<lb/>nor for studs—he gave them one, and they went away—they came back and asked for a better one—he gave them studs, and they said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> we won't harm you anymore"—when the stall was being packed up they came back—I think it was about 9—they asked for money, and my governor objected—they said, "If you will not give no money we will beat you"—the other man took my governor by the handkerchief and brought him to the ground—the prisoner kneeled on my governor—I ran for a policeman—when the policeman came the prisoner was gone away.</p>

                  </hi> (154<hi rend="italic">L</hi>). About 11 p.m. on November 5th I saw the prisoner in Blackfriars Road, talking to a man outside a public-house—I went towards him to arrest him—he ran away; I gave chase, and arrested him—I told him I should take him into custody for being concerned with a man named Tyndall in an assault, with intent to rob—he made no reply—when charged he said, "It is a lot of falsehoods; I am getting blamed for what the other one done"—he was identified from a number of men by the prosecutor and the witness—I arrested the other man, Tyndall, on June 18th—(<hi rend="italic">See Vol.</hi> CXXXII., <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> 638)—I know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "I met Tyndall in the evening, and he asked me to treat him, and after refusing once I did treat him. I wanted to get away from him, and later Tyndall went up to the prosecutor, and asked for two studs, and said he was going to have two more, better ones. We went back and got two more. He was having a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with prosecutor, and I went back to save a bother, and got Tyndall away. I found them rowing. Prosecutor pushed him, and Tyndall hit him. I seized two lamps, which I took away from him. I went away. Presently Tyndall came after me and said, 'Run!' and I ran a little way, but stopped in the Cornwall Road, and went home. What prosecutor has said is untrue."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner repeated this statement in his defence.</hi>
