I keep the Coach and Horses, at Blue Anchor Alley, Bunhill Row—on Friday, 31st December, about 11.20, the prisoner came in for a half-pint of porter—he gave me a sixpence; I gave him change—he drank the porter and left—I put the sixpence in the till—there was other money there—I went to the till afterwards, and found a bad sixpence lying amongst the other money—the prisoner came in again shortly after, and asked for three-halfpennyworth of rum—he paid with a bad six-pence—I gave him his change, and put the sixpence on one side, on the lower counter—he went away and spoke to a woman outside—he came in again in about 10 minutes after, for another three-halfpennyworth of rum, and paid with a bad sixpence—I walked round the counter and shut the street door and said I should give him into custody for uttering two bad sixpences—he said he had not been in the house before—he asked for his change, and I said I should not give it to him—I sent for a constable and gave him into custody—at first he denied having been in before, but afterwards he admitted he had been—I gave the three sixpences to the constable—I don't swear that the sixpence he gave me first was bad—I strongly suspected he was the man—I only produced two in the evidence at the Police Court.</p>

               <p>Cranford Park, Middlesex—on Sunday morning, 2nd January, about 6 o'clock or a little after, I heard some guns in the cover—I was in a coyer called Churchyard cover—the sound came from one of the coven on the other side of the house—I went alongside the cover—I met the witnesses, Hill and James—I did not hear any more guns—I think it was three reports altogether that I heard—that was in the direction of the Beech Walk cover, which adjoins the garden of the house—we went to a part where the avenue ceases—it is a plantation which joins the cover—we waited there about two or three minutes—the three prisoners then came along in a direction from the covers—I rushed at Thomas Baldwin and apprehended him—he struck me over the head with the butt end of the gun—I guarded it off as well as I could with my arm—it caught me on the arm and on the head as well—I then hit him with the staff, and secured him—Hill and James secured the others—they all three had guns—Thomas Baldwin had three pheasants in his possession, and a powder flask—Henry Baldwin had two pheasants, and Mason three—it was between 6 and 7 o'clock when they were secured; I should say about 6.30, or something like that—the sun rose about 8.10 that morning—Henry Baldwin said, "This won't be settled at Uxbridge; we shall get two years for this"—in going to the station, he said, "You don't feed them very well"—I said, "You feed them pretty well yourself'—I afterwards went to the cover, and found the footmarks of three persons—I could distinctly trace them in and out of the cover.</p>

Taylor are plumbers to the Corporation—a man named Blewitt was in the service—he was my mate—it was Johnson's duty, as foreman, to send me to the work in the morning—on Friday morning, the 17th December, Blewitt was with me—Johnson called out the men's names, and sent them to their different jobs—he said to Blewitt "You can go on to your work at Guildhall, I want your mate to go round to Rood Lane to a job, to get some things away"—the men had then gone to their different jobs—I went to Rood Lane, and took a set of window cloths to Nimmo, the painter, and brought back a pair of steps to the shop—that was about 7.20 in the morning—Johnson then asked me if I could get rid of a bit of white lead—I said, "I don't know, I will try"—he said, "Go up and put a bit in a pail"—the white lead and pails was kept in the first floor—I wont up stairs, put the white lead in a pail, put another pail on the top, and brought it down stairs, as I had been directed—when I came down Johnson said, "Put it down behind the truck"—I put it down and stood a little while—he said he would go round to Rood Lane with me—he then said, "You go round there, and then go where you like and get rid of the white lead"—I left the premises about 7.40 or 7.45—Johnson helped me with the pails on my shoulder—I went down Eastcheap and up Rood Lane—I then turned back again, down St. Mary-at-Hill, up Thames Street, up the steps of London Bridge, over the bridge, down Tooley Street, down several streets which I don't know the names of—I went down several streets round Bermondsey—I walked about and got tired of carrying the load about—I went into Mr. Jackson's house—I did not know anything of Mr. Jackson before—he is a plumber, in White Street, Southwark—he was not in the shop—directly I got in at the door Mr. Davis, the officer, rushed in, and I went a step into the parlour, and there was Mr. Jackson, I suppose, and some children—I had not seen anyone to speak to in Jackson's shop—I did not know the officer—I did not know who he was—I thought it was some lion coming, or something, into the place, he came in so fast—I had not sold, or attempted to sell, the white lead—the officer pulled the things off my shoulder and said, "I am a police officer, I shall take you into custody for robbing your masters."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were charged, before the Magistrate, at the same time as Johnson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was not examined as a witness there—I have never made any statement before to-day—I have not told it to any<lb/>one, only to Mr. Wontner, who appeared for me at the Police Court—he told me to tell the truth, and I made a correct statement to him as to how the thing happened—he did not say it would be better for me—I don't know whether my sentence will be lightened in consequence—it has not been conveyed to me that the prosecutors will recommend me to mercy if I made this statement—this was the first time Johnson spoke to me about taking white lead—my regular work was the Corporation work—I had been working, the day before, with Blewitt, at Guildhall and the Sheriffs' Court</p>

               <p>—we were both to go to the Sheriffs' Court on the 17th—I and Coleman were in the habit of being kept back for the purpose of cleaning out the office at Mr. Taylor's, when we went at 6 o'clock in the morning; we were often kept till 9 o'clock—we should not go into the City to work till after we had done cleaning the office—florae of us used to go at 6 o'clock; the plumbers don't come till 7—we do not do the office in the winter, the boy Alfred Gunnell does—I had not been doing the office that morning—I used to stop and sweep up the place sometimes, when my mate did not come to his time; that was under Johnson's direction—he kept the time of the men, and distributed the work to which they went—there are a great many men employed sometimes, but only about six or eight at that time—Mr. Ascott, the junior clerk, was examined before the Lord Mayor, and also the boy Alfred—Mr. Ascotts' right time for coming was 7 o'clock, but some<lb/>times he was not there to his time—I think it was a little after 8 o'clock when I got to Mr. Jackson's—Mr. Taylor, senior, does not come to business every day; either he or his son is there every day—nobody in particular, that I know of, has charge of the material up stairs—if we want material, we do not go and take it, we have to ask for it; we do not go up and help ourselves, unless we are told by Mr. Johnson or Mr. Taylor.</p>

I am a hay salesman, of Hendon—on 15th December, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the White Lion, at Edgware, and saw the prisoner there—I left between 4 and 5 o'clock, and crossed the road to the footpath, and saw two men standing there, and a third not far off—I was struck on the back of the head, and a man on each side of me caught hold of my arms; a tall man was on my right—I was pulled to the ground, and kicked, and my clothes torn—the prisoner took my money and knife from my pocket, and said, "I have got it"—Port held me while I was robbed (<hi rend="italic">The Grand Jury had ignored the bill against Port</hi>)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187001100028"/>
               <p>—my fingers were cut, and my wrist was hurt—they then left me, and I got up, went to the White Lion, and told them I was robbed—a little before this I had lent 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a man named Yeals, and I had then 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in my breeches pocket—my knife was produced at the station—it was in the same pocket with my money—I was smothered in blood, from my hat to my shoes, and could hardly get away from the station, for weakness—I had been drinking a little, but can swear to the prisoner putting his hand in my pocket—I had seen him and Port together before, but I did not know their names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you say before the Magistrate that Port laid on you while you were on the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he knelt right on me—I swore that before the Grand Jury—I had had a goodish bit of money left me—I told the policeman that I had been robbed of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the prisoners—I thought I had lost a cheque for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but afterwards I found it in my pocket, smothered in blood—I had deposited the cheque with the London and County Bank some time, and this was not a cheque, but a deposit receipt—I was not wholly drunk, or I could not have sworn to them—a man named Yeals had given me a ride in a cart, and I lent him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was about half an hour drinking in the White Lion—I cannot say whether I had anything there, because I was knocked about so—I may have been into three or four houses before the White Lion, but not ten—I came out at 10 o'clock in the morning—Yeals' cart was outside the public-house—I did not tumble out of it, nor was I thrown out—the prisoner and Port struck me with the whip while I was in the cart, before the robbery—they wanted me to give them 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I would not; that was the first of it—I had not been in Edgware for ten years—I got out of the cart, and was knocked down and robbed about fifteen yards from the public-house, on the other side—I had been in the public-house about half an hour—I thought Yeals was coming, and got into the cart, but he was in the house—when they asked me for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I refused, and got out of the cart, and they hit me with the whip and knocked me down, and robbed me—cannot tell you what I spent, but I had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I started from home—the prisoners did not pick me up off the gravel—I have not seen Yeals since—he is a hay salesman—I do not want to see him—he has been to several places to find me, and I would not see him—I do not charge him—he was indoors at the time of the robbery—it was a very violent blow with the whip on the back of my head, and it cut right through my hat—I cannot tell how many blows I had with the whip, for I was knocked insensible.</p>

                  </hi>. On 15th December, about 4.30, I was going to my sisters', and saw Abrey in a cart opposite the White Lion—I heard the prisoner ask him for a shilling, which he would not give him—the prisoner asked him a second time, and Abrey said, "Let me get out of the cart!"—he got out, and the prisoner hit him across the back with the whip, bat not very violently—Abrey crossed the road to the bridge, and a man named Port said, "Let him alone, we will have him to-night"—Abrey went into the public-house, Robinson followed him in, and I heard him ask for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Port followed him as well—Abrey did not stay in the house above three minutes—I saw him come out again, and the prisoner then asked him for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he crossed over the road, and the prisoner followed him, and wanted to get him back into the White Lion—he refused to go back, and the prisoner caught hold of his shoulder and put him down on the ground—nobody helped the prisoner—he then put his hand into Abrey's right</p>

               <p>hand trowsers pocket, pulled it out, looked at something in his hand, and put it into his own pocket—I could see that there was something in his hand—he then hit Abrey across the head with the handle of this whip (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) while he was on the ground, and then went across the road into the White Lion—I did not hear Port say anything, but he picked up Abrey's hat, which was knocked off—the prisoner went in at the front door of the White Lion, and out at the side door—he did not stay in the house two minutes—he looked about, up and down the street, and then went into the village—Port stayed in the White Lion all that time—when Abrey was on the ground he cried out, "I am robbed I" and when he got back to the White Lion he told Yeals he had been robbed—he was not sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>I to pay you a shilling for?"—the prisoner said, "To pay the ostler"—Abrey said, "I am not going to pay anyone," and got out of the cart, and went to the other side of the road—I forgot to say yesterday (<hi rend="italic">before the Grand Jury</hi>) that Port said to Robinson, "Let him go, we will have him to-night,"and then Robinson stepped on the path—Abrey went down as far as the dealer's house; Yeals did not come out, and Robinson could not get him along, and Robinson and Port knocked him down on the road, and got hold of his shoulders, and knocked him up against the palings, and then Port went away, and Robinson followed him to the bridge, and knocked him down, and he fell, and got up again, and he knocked him down again—he was lying on his belly, and Robinson put his hand in his right hand pocked looked at it, and put it in his own pocket, and went away into the White Lion again, and came out and looked both ways, and ran up the town—I never saw him any more.</p>

I did not see her till 1863, when she was living with Mr. Stafford. I have seen him in her room at Horsely<lb/>down. I went away to Manchester, and came back in 1864, and then she was living in New Compton Street, still kept by this man. I took her away from him, took her to Manchester, and lived with her there; but she was locked up there two or three times for drunkenness. I took her to London, and in one of her drunken fits she told me that since she was married to me she had got married to John White. I then left her, went to Somerset House, found that she was married to John White, and have never lived with her since. I have no children by her, but I have one by my second wife.</p>

I live at 5, Maritime Cottages, Bromley-by-Bow, and am a widow—about 1.30 on the afternoon of 21st December I heard a knock at the door—I was in the house' alone and went to open it—I saw two men, one with a large beard and large whiskers, and the other was a young man not disguised at all—I said, "What do you want?"—they made no answer—I said, "You have made a mistake—they still never spoke—they then tried to rush past me, but I put my hand across the passage to prevent them going in, and I screamed out, and with that Pickford took me round the throat and held me tight over my mouth, and said, "If you scream again I will shoot you"—he had a pistol in his hand—I was still being held—I knocked his hand away from my mouth and screamed again—he then put his hand right down my throat—I am suffering now from something he has done in my throat—he said to the other man, "Pull down the pictures—he was in my bedroom, pulling down one—he said, "I can't get it down, and Pickford said, "Give it a pull, give it a pull "I tried to get his hand out of my mouth, and I bit his finger; but I was afraid of the blood coming into my mouth, and I preferred not biting them sufficiently to hurt him—I knocked the pistol up, and the cap fell off—I said, "The pistol is not loaded—he said, "Oh yes it is—I said, "If you want my pictures, take them and let me go"—I struggled a good deal and slipped under his arm—I rushed to the back door and made an alarm—I had seen Pickford</p>

I am an agent, at Manor Place, Poplar—I have lived in Poplar seventy-four years, and have been twenty-five years in this house—I have advanced money to Mr. Fayle, hundreds of times—I advanced him money repeatedly in 1868, sometimes 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and sometimes 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can't say how much I have advanced him altogether—he has had as much as 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at different times—I have lent him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. several times—I can't say how much he owed me at one time—knowing him for some time, I advanced him money for the sailon, when he was short of money—I knew of his having persons connected with the <hi rend="italic">Maggie Leslie</hi> in his house, and I advanced them money on Mr. Fayle's account—I knew Salthouse very well as Henry Salthouse—I have seen him at Fayle's house repeatedly—I took Salthouse and Fayle to Mr. Oldershaw's—they did not know Mr. Oldershaw before I took them there—I went with them five or six times, it might be—I also went with them to the broker's, because Salthouse told me Fayle was entitled to some money for the picking up of the <hi rend="italic">Maggie Leslie</hi>—the sailors were in very distressed circumstances, and had no one to assist them, except Mr. Fayle, for eighteen months—there was Buzzard, and Lewin, and Allen, and the steward, and the boat-swain, and there was the cook, and the sailmaker—they were all perished for want of money—I went into a public-house with six or eight of the men, in Doctor's Commons—they went into the back room, and drank brandy there, at Fayle's expense—Salthouse was with them, drinking, and, on one occasion, I said he was a drunken fellow, and he wanted to fight.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—I now live with my mother, at 5, Thomas Street, Doctor's Commons—I lived with the prisoner up to three weeks before this assault—I do not know where he lived at the time of the assault—I had ceased to live with him because he had been constantly ill treating me; and the night before, he took away the furniture, and broke up our home—I remained in the house till the next night, and then went to my mother—on 20th December I left my mother's house, unknown to her, and went to Forest Hill after my husband, as I heard that the Slate Club was held there—I found him there, beckoned to him, and told him I wished to speak to him—he beckoned to me to come outside—I asked him if he had not forgotten he had a wife, as he had not given me a farthing, but had promised me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he said, "Go in, and have your drop of gin-and-water"—I did not go in directly; but said, "Let me understand you; do you intend to let me have any money to-night? if not, I will go home to my mother, as I did not come out for gin-and-water"—he said, "Yes, I will let you have what I can," and we went into the house together, and he took the gin-and-water, and behaved very kindly to me, and introduced me to several of his friends as the <hi rend="italic">Old Queen</hi>—after his friends had left we went outside, and he began to insult me, and call me bad names—he walked away, and I followed him at some distance—he turned round several times, as if he was going to spring at me, and said, "What are you following me for?"—I said, "You know what I am following you for"—he turned round and attempted to strike me—I escaped the blow and ran away, and, when I saw he was pursuing me, I took up a handful of gravel, and, as I found he was gaining ground on me, I threw the gravel over my shoulder to confuse him, and he stumbled and fell, and I ran on as hard as I could—I saw a man, and said, "For God's sake! do protect me from his violence"—he came up very near to the man, who moved backwards and forwards before him—he tried to strike the man, who moved on one side; the blow came on my left breast, and I fell in the gutter—I sprung into a sitting position, and he seized me and beat me on the head—I pressed my face into my lap that he should not strike it, and he beat me ever the head with his fist as hard as he could—I felt my senses leaving me, and fell back—he jumped on me, and I found myself at Guy's Hospital next morn<lb/>ing, where I remained a fortnight.</p>

I did so, and she came home about 26th May, and she was at home, happy for a time, till William Spong traced her to London, and she used to see him daily without I my knowledge.

I said, "Do not; surely you are not going to sleep with that man." She said, "Yes; and I am three months gone with child by him." I then hit her with the handle of the hammer; but never intended to do her the injury I did do, and the poker I never used. She said, "See, I am bleeding, Charley;" and I opened the door and said, "For God's sake! ran for Dr. Willy."

I am a single woman, and live with a person named Fowler, a cabman—I am twenty-one years old, and have lived with him as his wife for about four years—we now live at 52, Britannia Street, City Road—I have known the prisoner for eighteen months or two years—I believe he has been selling shirts for a livelihood, and that he was a betting man—we pass as Mr. and Mrs. Hammond—Fowler is the right name—I remember seeing the prisoner on the 23rd June last—he came to my place about 7.30 at night, and remained till 8.30—Fowler was there all the time—they had been intimate friends for many years—I did not see that he wore a light overcoat that evening—the next day I saw him again, about 6 or 6.30 in the evening—he asked me if I had heard of the accident at New Cross to the licensed victuallers' train, and I said I had not—he said, "I am going to say I was there myself; I have been to Mr. Richardson,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187001100088"/>
               <p>and asked him how the accident occurred, and he has told me, and I am going to say that I was there"—I asked him what proof he had, and no replied, "I am going to say I am ruptured"—I said, "How long have you been ruptured?"—and he answered, "Ever since I was a little boy, through a kick"—he then wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the company, in my presence—after that, I and Fowler and the prisoner went to a beer-shop, in the New Inn Yard, where we frequently spent an evening—he did not appear to walk lame, as if he had been injured—the next day he brought a letter, and said he had received it, from the Company, and that they had seen to his case—he did not appear to be hurt in the least—on Sunday morning he came to our lodgings, and showed me a truss, and said, "This is one thing towards it"—he told me that Dr. Simpson had sent him for it, to a shop in the City Road, opposite the barracks—in the evening we went to his lodgings—I saw him again, when he said that two doctors had been to see him that afternoon, that he should not go out any more, but lay in—I saw nothing the matter with him then—I have frequently seen him since then, at his lodgings—I was not examined before the Under Sheriff—he never complained of his ankle, or of anything but the rupture—I was not aware that he was going to say anything about the knee at all—I have seen Selwyn, one of Fowler's acquaintances—he was at the prisoner's once—I gave information to the Railway Company, and went, myself, to London Bridge, about six weeks ago—it was about the 30th November—the prisoner promised, whilst the action was going on, to give me a watch or a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, for services rendered, for going backwards and forwards to see how he got on, and for supplying him with a little money, from time to time—he never gave me either the watch or the money, and so I went and told.</p>

I am one of the surgeons of the University College Hospital—I remember seeing the prisoner on the 27th June, the Sunday after the accident, at the request of Dr. Maclure, the surgeon of the college—he told me that he was ruptured, and he was wearing a truss—it was a remarkably strong truss, and it caused a good deal of pressure on the groin—it caused irritation, and would have been injurious in a recent rupture—there was swelling, which might have been caused by the truss—I found it was all gone in three days afterwards—he said that Dr. Simpson had ordered him to wear the truss—he called my attention to his knee, but I saw no bruises—I reported my impression of the matter to the Company—I did not believe his statement that he had been recently injured—I thought not, and I reported so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have, of course, A practical knowledge of the difference between rupture produced by physical force, and rupture produced by constitutional causes—is there any difference between the two? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think there is; but a good deal must depend upon what has caused the rupture—there are two kinds of hernia—his was supposed to be a virginal rupture—I cannot swear that I examined him well, but I remem<lb/>ber seeing his knee—he did not ask me to examine his ankle—it would have been my duty to have seen it if he had asked me—on the following Wednesday I found there was a slight rupture—I made a report on the Sunday—I was sent there, because the Company had received a letter, stating that Dickeson had received an injury, and they wished me to report upon it—they expect me to state what kind of a person the applicant is, and if there is any means of giving others the information, we avail our<lb/>selves of it—Dr. Simpson was with me on the Wednesday—we did not discuss whether it was a case of recent rupture or hernia, we simply agreed that there was a rupture—not a word was said about money then, or any<lb/>thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187001100094"/>
               <p>as to a compromise—I did not suggest to the Company any sum in liquidation of damages—I sent my report in to Dr. Maclure—I do not think that persons who have been seriously ruptured would be able to walk a considerable distance immediately afterwards—a great deal, as I have said, would depend on the circumstances of the case—muscular and physical exertion could not be taken immediately after a rupture has been caused, without great pain and suffering—there would be signs of inability to walk, and so on—if a man was bandaged up, and kept quiet for a fort<lb/>night, he might be able to get about with a truss—the prisoner's truss was not altered according to my suggestion.</p>

I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and Licentiate of the College of Physicians—I reside at 169, City Road, and have another establishment in Compton Street, Clerkenwell—I see about 200 patients every day—I remember seeing the prisoner on 24th June last, at my surgery—he was led in by a man named Hatswell—he stooped forward, complained of great pain, and said he had injured his ankle—I found it swollen, and slightly discoloured in two places on the right side—he also complained of pain in his knee; but there was no swell<lb/>ing there—he complained also of pain in the right groin, and I found the part swollen, and excessively tender—Mr. was a fluctuating tumour—I saw him again on the day following—there was nothing on the knee, and he only complained of pain there—I imagined, on the first occasion, that it was hernia; but the swelling in the groin masked it, to some extent, when I examined him on the first occasion—I told him to go home and remain quiet—I prescribed a lotion for him, and gave him a mixture, and saw him again the next day, Friday, the 25th—the swelling had then a little subsided; the fluctuation was distinct, but not the hernia—he was ruptured—I told him to get a truss, and directed him to go to Mr. Johnson, in the City Road, and I advised him to wear it as soon as the pain had sub<lb/>sided—I heard Mr. Heath say that the truss was too strong, and, by his advice, I told the patient to discontinue it—Mr. Heath told the prisoner that he ought to be perfectly still, and I advised him to keep his bed for eight or nine weeks—I saw him almost daily, and in bed—if hernia is caused by violence there would be considerable pain and some slight effusion; when hernia arises from constitutional causes there is hardly any pain at all, but some amount of inconvenience—this was a direct hernia, and I believed, from what he told me. that it was a recent one—on the first examination he told me that he had been shaken in a railway accident on the London and Brighton line, and was suffering considerable pain—he was in a very nervous state at the time—hernia that has broken through by force, requiring very considerable attention, in case it should come down and become strangulated—the life of the patient is in great danger then—it would be carelessness on the part of a surgeon if he allowed such a thing to take place—I attended the prisoner for eight weeks at his house, and saw</p>

               <p>him nearly every day afterwards At my surgery, making the period of my attendance upwards of four months—I attended his wife in her confinement—they were in poor circumstances at the time, owing, as he said, to his being deprived of his living—I believed all along that he was suffering from the results of the railway accident, and, as acts of charity, I advanced him email sums of money from time to time—this is the first case that I have attended in connection with a railway accident—I have attended oases of accident in which large firms were concerned, and I sent them my bill—Dr. Maclure, I believe, examined the prisoner on 3rd May last, and he told me to strengthen him as much as I possibly could, and to keep him quiet until the pain subsided.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you know this man before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never saw him, to my knowledge—I have attended to Miss Nunn, who suffered in this accident—she lived about half a mile from my house—I had every reason to believe what the prisoner told me, that he had not been ruptured before, but not that he was by that means about to make a false claim against the Company—I believed what he told me to be true—I think that Dr. Maclure formed his own opinion from what the patient told him—I had no idea of what passed before the accident—there is of course, a posibillity of medical men being deceived by what a patient tells them—there were cir<lb/>cumstances connected with the case that made me think it was a recent hernia, and now I have no reason to think otherwise—I still believe it was a recent rupture—I knew the man Hatswell, who brought the prisoner to my surgery—he is the son of a publican, living in St. John's Street, Clerken<lb/>well—he led Dickeson in on the evening of the 24th—he had his arm under Dickeson, and the man was stooping forward—I did not see him on the day before the accident—my bill of attendance amounted to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that was for my four months' attendance; but it did not include money I had lent him—I think I was paid a guinea for a subpœnaed, on the court of inquiry, at the London Terminus Hotel—I lent him, altogether, about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I found that he was in distressed circumstances at the time—he asked me to take a guinea for my kindness in lending him the money, and I accepted it; but it was not for interest—that was in addition to the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not keep books—I dispense medicine myself—I made about fifty visits, altogether, for the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I saw him very nearly every day—I sometimes charge very low for my visit, and often give medicine away for nothing—I sometimes charge as was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each visit, and that is the lowest—in this instance I made charges, because I knew that the Railway Company would have to pay them—I only know Hatswell professionally—I attended him seven years ago—I know Mr. Scott, an attorney; he is my solicitor—I sent the prisoner to him, when he asked me if I could tell him the name of any solicitor who would conduct his case—I have recommended a great many customers to Mr. Scott, and amongst them Miss Nunn—the prisoner had a severe sprain; but I did not think much of that at the time—the sprain to the ankle was very slight—I should not have attended the prisoner if he had had personally to pay—I attended him, and lent him money, because he had received, according to his own account, an accident in a railway train—I expected to get paid out of the money he would get from the Company—my charge was about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—he did not wear the truss for any length of time after Mr. Heath had requested him not to do so—I sent him to get the truss, on my credit, at a surgical instrument maker's—Mr. Scott paid me the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as well as the money I had lent to the</p>

               <p>of the first medical attendant, and of the patient—I had not the slightest reason to doubt the one or the other—Mr. Simpson said that it was hernia, and sent me a note—I think that a man who received a blow on the groin from a collision on a railway, so as to cause a rupture, on 23rd June, would be able to walk about with perfect freedom on the 24th—I think it quite possible that he could have walked the next day—I have seen cases where, in extreme strangulation, a person has walked to the hospital, and died in a few hours—he would exhibit symptoms of pain to a person conversing with him, but he would be able to walk—a person who had received an injury on 23rd June, could not walk with the same freedom as he did on the 22nd—whether he would be able to walk in a fortnight, would depend upon the injury received—I gave my testimony to the write of inquiry—I was called.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time do you say you saw him on the 24th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 2 o'clock—he said he was going to the Company—the Compasses is 600 or 700 yards from where he lives—he was not drinking there; he was not in the public-house—he was coming across the road, and seemed lame—he was by himself—I only stayed with him a few minutes—I saw him at 6 o'clock at my place, Trinity Street, Liverpool Road, about three-quarters of a mile off—a person, who was represented to me as his wife's mother, lives in Trinity Street—the prisoner has called her mother-in-law—she lodges in the same street as I do, but not the same house—I only know her by seeing her two or three times—I took the defendant to Dr. Simpson, in a cab; not from my house, we went to the pillar-post at Islington, which may be 300 yards from my house, and posted the letter, and then we took the cab, and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. fare—I never saw the contents of the letter, but he said that it was going to the Company—I did not see a cab at my door when he came—I was not holding him up, with my arm round his body, when we went into Dr. Simpson's; he laid hold of my arm, and we went in together—he leant on my arm for support, as if he was in pain—we discharged the cab there, and rode home in another from Dr. Simpson's, which we dis<lb/>charged at Swinton Street—we got in just outside Dr. Simpson's, just by the Eagle—it was another 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. fare, which I paid—I have been paid again—I have been paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by the prisoner, altogether, for what I lent him now and then—I have known him sixteen years—I am a journeyman in the chronometer line—I work on my own account—I never bet—I have never been to races with the prisoner, but I have seen him down there—I may go to the Derby or Ascot—I confine myself to that—Dr. Simpson used to pay him so much money while he was ill, after the accident, and I used to fetch it—I used not to take his I O U's for it—I had a small note in an envelope, and he used to give me the money, and I took it to the prisoner six or seven times—I got no interest for my 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had no agreement to charge interest—I was not at this accident—I never said to any one that I was at the Crystal Palace, at 8 o'clock, with the prisoner, and should come and prove it—I have said that I was there the year before, and I was there four or five years before—I said that I</p>

               <p>saw him there last year, at 8 o'clock—I told Sergeant Peek so—I am telling no falsehood—I did not go to the writ of inquiry at the London Bridge Terminus—I was summoned, on the Company's part, before the Magistrate, but was not called as a witness—I was not put forward to be identified, that I know of—I sat there—I do not know that I was pointed out—I made a mistake, and got up from my seat, when they called Atwell—I told the prisoner that Peek, the detective, had been making inquiries the very evening he saw me—I cannot tell the day—I have known Fowler eight or nine years—I do not know whether he is here—I knew the prisoner when he was in the House of Detention, in May last—I visited him there once, as a friend—I have never been in trouble, or charged with anything, or examined as a witness before—I do not know Entwistle or Selwyn—I have not seen the advertisements headed, "Railway Accident," but I beard from a party I am acquainted with, that there was an advertisement—the party was a female—I know a person named Osborne, by sight—he says that he is the prisoner's attorney—he. subpœnaed me, or I should not have come here—I did not hear of the advertisement from him, only from the young woman—her name is Miss Goldsmith—she lives in Trinity Street—that is the same street as I live in—she resides with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many times has Peek been to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four or five times—he asked me if I had been down to the Crystal Palace, and said, "You know Dickeson? I said, "Yes;" he said, "You know he was not at the accident at all;" I said, "I know nothing about it"—he came again and again, and put questions to me every time, and I was summoned to the Southwark Police Court—I think it was on the second examination, but I do not recollect the date—I attended twice, but they did not call me—Peek stayed an hour and a half one evening—he treated me—we had two pots of pale ale and a cigar each—he did not treat me on any other occasion—he took down, the second time, that I said I was not at the Crystal Palace—there is no pretence for the insinuation that I have been in trouble, I swear that—no one else was present when I said that I had been to the Crystal Palace the year before—Miss Goldsmith was present when I signed a paper to say that I was not there—that was the second time—the third time Peek came to the door, and then went over to the prisoner's mother-in-law's, which you can see out of our window—the house is opposite—I do not know how long he staved there—the last time he came was last Satur<lb/>day—the prisoner seemed rather lame when he went into Dr. Simpson's, and he said he was in great pain—he was in very poor circumstances when I lent him the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was out of charity, and it might have been a fortnight after the accident—he has returned me the money, without interest—I do not make a profession of betting, nor does he, to my knowledge—I bet occasionally, like other people—I nave seen him a great many times, with bundles of under shirts and drawers, for three or four years past—I have been at the Licensed Victuallers' Fete, at the Crystal Palace, four or five years, but did not go on this occasion, and it is very lucky that I did not—when I got up from my seat at the Police Court, somebody's name was called out, and I understood that it was mine, and went forward to show myself—I told the prisoner that Peek had been making inquiries, and had been several times with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been several years at the Licensed Victuallers' Fete; did you go by yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I went with Miss Goldsmith, never with the prisoner—we left after the ball-soom was closed, and got house</p>

               <p>about 12.0 or 12.30—Fowler's house is little over a mile from the pri<lb/>soner's—I did not go in, not seeing a light—I turned and went away—they occupy the top room.</p>
