About seven weeks ago the things mentioned in the indictment were missing: I was then in the parish-house: my sister missed them. I went to the pawnbroker where the prisoner frequented, and found one shirt and the body and sides of another. The prisoner sent another person to the pawnbroker, who was stopped with the other things upon her.</p>

I went with my sister to the pawnbroker's, where we found one shirt, and the body and sleeves for another: there was Esq; Henley's name upon the shirt, she had had that to make the others by. The pawnbroker stopped a woman about half an hour after we came away, with some of the cloth, and sent for us.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, I live at Mrs. Rodbird's, Black-friars; the prisoner pledged a shirt body and pair of sleeves and the pattern shirt for 2 s. the others for 6 s. She brought them both in the name of Mrs. Finley, who came and said they were her property: she bears a good character, and lives in our neighbourhood. She since owns she was deceived by the prisoner. On the 14th of December another woman came with other pieces and a petticoat, in the name of the prisoner. I got a constable and took Woolf<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160003"/> up. I took a piece of it upon her neck, and the other in her room where she lived; in the whole there were seven pieces. The prisoner acknowledged she took the things, and that she did it on purpose to be transported.</p>

             house, Old Gravel-lane, about a week or two before. I called for them: I took nothing with me but a chissel which I wanted to use next day. I went towards my lodgings near where I work. I went in at the Swan in <placeName id="t17660116-2-crimeloc10">King-street</placeName>

                        targets="t17660116-2-off7 t17660116-2-crimeloc10"/>, a public-house, about a stone's throw from my lodging: while I sat there I had two or three pints of beer. I treated two or three men there to make a friend, because a man is in danger of his life, if out late, it is a bad place: I staid about half an hour, I saw people I did not like made me go the sooner; this was between nine and ten. I was knocked down in the street before I was aware of it. The first blow I received on my shoulder, had it been on my head I am sure I should never eat a bit; it was with an iron bar. The next blow was on my head, then I fell: at first I was a little stunned, but soon recovered my senses, and saw it was the prisoner. I felt a tug at my watch, the chain broke; I put my hand to my watch and held it, he did not get it out. I lost a pinchbeck mettle seal: then he took my knee-buckle, and tore part of the strap of my breaches away with it; then he took my hat and wig.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body near you besides the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Dunn. I did several, but I did not know them: they came to assist him, there were some men and some women. I had hold of the prisoner, and I ran the chissel at him: I intended it at his throat, but I cut him on the left cheek. I was then standing up and the blood spirting upon me. Then I got out of his hands, and made the best of my way back to M'Donnel's, and told him what had happened; there I borrowed his hat and wig, and went home to my lodgings. The next morning I went and got a warrant from Justice Fielding, and brought two officers from there to take the man. I was told that day his name was Swinney. I met him in the street about a fortnight after, opposite M'Donnel's house: I seized him and said, You villain, you are the man that robbed me. I led him in at M'Donnel's; I charged four men with him, and went for an officer: when I returned he had made his escape. I found a bill of indictment against him last sessions, and on Christmas-eve I happened to meet with him again near the same place, and brought him into the same house, and got an officer and took him before Justice Fielding, and he was committed. I do not remember that he said a word in his defence, only that he said I struck him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the wound then?</p>
               <p>Dunn. I did: there was a sear, and it was a little raw.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Dunn. It was a dark night; when I was making my escape from him, I could not see the posts, but I am sure it was the prisoner, I could see his face when he had hold of me, there is the same scar now on his cheek. About a week after the widow Doudle, that keeps the house, delivered me my hat and wig before the Justice in Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Dunn. He had a blue jacket and trousers on.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed the other two times you saw him?</p>
               <p>Dunn. In the same dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before this happened?</p>
               <p>Dunn. No I did not. I got the warrant for one Swinney, whose christian name was unknown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went in at that house, the Swan, and got a pint of beer after supper, the prosecutor was sitting there; he went out and I sat in his seat: he came in and asked me what business I had in his seat, and bid me go and sit in my own seat. I said do not be angry. Said he, do you know who you are speaking to, you are talking to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160004"/> gentleman, and took a stick and struck me in the house; I took up the poker and said, if you strike me I'll strike you. Come out at the door, said he: with all my heart, said I. As I was coming out at the door he struck me four times with the stick, and almost stunned me; he got hold of me and knocked me down upon the stones, and ran a chissel into my cheek, with intent to take my life away. He lost his hat and wig, and I lost mine. There was a man named Mahony saw it all, he is here.</p>
               <p>Q to prosecutor. Did you see the prisoner when you was in at the Swan?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any quarrel there with any body?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you strike any body in that house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of an iron bar was you knocked down with?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was an iron poker.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am an Irishman.</p>
               <p>(The witnesses for the prisoner were examined apart.)</p>
               <p>Cha. Mahony. I lodge in Mrs. Doudle's house at the Swan. The prisoner used to come there almost every night for a fortnight or three weeks before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lodged there?</p>
               <p>Mahony. About nine months. I draw beer there. Dunn used to breakfast and dine there very often.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Mahony. He <rs id="t17660116-2-deflabel11" type="occupation">works with the bricklayers</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17660116-2-defend38 t17660116-2-deflabel11"/>. I cannot mention the day to be certain, but I was by when this dispute was. It was on an evening, between nine and ten o'clock; Dunn came in first and called for a pint of beer, I drawed it, then he called for a full pot; before that was out, in came the prisoner and a woman with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the woman?</p>
               <p>Mahony. I never saw her before to my knowledge. They sat down in the same room, Dunn on one side the fire, and the prisoner and woman on the other facing him.</p>
               <p>Q. What company else was in the room?</p>
               <p>Mahony. There was nobody else but a young fellow, a sailor.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were the prosecutor and prisoner in the house together ?</p>
               <p>Mahony. I believe about an hour, drinking together. Dunn said to the prisoner I know that woman: the prisoner said, what do you know of her? Said Dunn, I know her to be a bad woman. The prisoner said she was a married woman and an honest woman. Said Dunn, Do you know who you are talking with, and called for another pot; the sailor and I helped him drink it. When that was out he got up and said he would lick Swinney. He went out at the door and desired Swinney to come out. Swinney took the poker from the fire side in his hand, and when he was at the threshold of the door, Dunn struck him with a stick; Swinney throwed him down close to the street door; then Dunn got the prisoner down; they got both up; then Dunn made a step forward and struck Swinney with the chissel; Swinney never struck him with the poker. I said for God Almighty's sake do not strike him with it. The prisoner bled very fast where he was cut with the chissel; he came into the house and bled a great quantity. I went out and found Dunn's hat and wig, and Swinney's hat, they lay just by the door. Dunn went off.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay after this?</p>
               <p>Mahony. He staid better than half an hour in the house after.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Do you remember seeing this witness in the street when you was thus used?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He came with a candle and lanthorn to us.</p>
               <p>Mahony. I had a lighted candle, but no lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How far was you got from the house before you was attacked?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Seven or eight yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been out of the house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was rather under two minutes before I was attacked.</p>

            . I keep the Swan. The prosecutor and prisoner both used my house. Dunn was in that night before the prisoner; and called for a pint of beer; after that he called for a pot, and sat down by the fire. The prisoner came in and called for a pint of purl, a woman came with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the woman?</p>
               <p>M. Doudle. She lives in the neighbourhood. They sat down by the fire opposite to Dunn. There was no body else in my house but Mahony and one M'Carty, a sailor; they both lodge in my house, they are seafaring men.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were the prisoner and prosecutor in your house?</p>
               <p>M. Doudle. I believe Dunn was in the house about an hour; the prisoner not above half an hour. Dunn said to the woman, he knew her: the prisoner said, what do you know of her? Dunn said she was a bad woman. The prisoner said she was a lawful married woman, so words<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160005"/> arose. Dunn said, You puppy, who do you talk to? If you speak much, I shall get up and lick you well. He had a chissel in one hand, and a stick in the other. He was dressed in his holiday dress. He got up. The prisoner seeing that, got up too. Dunn ran out at the door, and the prisoner went after him; there was some engagement without, but I did not see it. I never left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>M. Doudle. I said, take care, he has got a chissel in his hand, he will do you a mischief; so the prisoner took the first thing that came to hand: he took the poker, and the engagement was at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What dress was the prisoner in?</p>
               <p>Doudle. He was in a blue jacket.</p>

             M'Carty. I live in the house of Mrs. Doudle. I was above. I heard a noise below stairs. I looked out at the window; I saw Dunn come out first, and Swinney after him. Dunn struck at him once or twice with a stick. Swinney struck at him again, and knocked him down; he got up again, and came with a chissel and drove it at Swinney. I saw the blood come out, then Dunn ran away and dropt his hat and wig.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>M'Carty. There was a candle in the street, and I had a candle in my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the fray from the door?</p>
               <p>M'Carty. About the distance of three yards.</p>

On the Friday he came about noon, and said he had changed his mind; he would not take him to market, he would go first, and see how the market went, and if it would not do, he would send him into the country. On the Saturday morning we agreed for the horse. I was to have given 7 guineas and a half for him; then he said he would take him away, but I believe he had not money to pay for his standing. I went to fetch the money, and the ostler brought me the Advertiser, where I saw such a horse described. I took the paper to the stable, and examined the marks of the horse, and found it to be a proper description of that horse; then I sent for a constable, and had the prisoner secured: after that he persisted in it that he had bought the horse.</p>

               <p>I lay at Oakham, at the Magpye, the last day of the old year. I set out for London by times in the morning, and a gentleman overtook me on this horse 2 or 3 miles on this side Oakham. I walked by the side of him about a mile; he asked me if I had a mind to buy a horse, and said he was short of money. I asked him what he asked for him: he asked 8 guineas. I bid him six. He went about a quarter of a mile farther, and said I should have him. I paid him 6 guineas for him.</p>

            . I live next door to the prosecutrix. On the 16th of December, about half an hour after 6 at night; it was sharp frosty weather, I was filling my two water tubs in the yard, the water running flush. I sent my girl to Mrs. Buterfield's, to borrow a pail. She went and borrowed one. The boy at the bar came out and walked backwards and forwards before my door. As I was coming with water I heard something Shap. I said, halloo, who is there? He answered, it is only I.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from the cock to the prosecutrix's window?</p>
               <p>Blaze. I imagine it to be about 30 yards.</p>

            . On the 17th of December I had been in the city about business. When I returned about 11 in the forenoon, I found the prosecutrix in my house. My wife said, this woman has been robbed. Said I, who do you suspect? She said, she suspected some neighbours, and desired my advice how to proceed. I told her to go to the Rotation-Office, and make her complaint, and I apprehended they would grant a warrant on suspicion. Mrs. Buterfield was there at the same time, and heard me tell the prosecutrix to get a warrant on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. What was her business at your house?</p>
               <p>Coves. She came to tell us of a neighbour that was deceased. I had business out. When I returned, my wife told me the boy at the bar had been at my house, and desired me to go immediately to his mother's. I went there. Then he and the prisoner Anne, told me there were part of Mrs. Furnican's things below in their cellar. I went down with them, there I found this parcel of things (producing best part of the things lost.) They lay in an old sieve, squeezed up together. The muslin gown was delivered into my care before the Justices. I asked the mother how the things came into the cellar; she and the other two answered, they were entirely ignorant how they came there. They desired me to go again into the cellar, and take notice there was a window that looked into their yard; it was flat to the ground; no shutter to it. Whoever, put them down, must come into their yard and poke them down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prosecutrix before?</p>
               <p>Coves. I don't know that ever I saw her before she came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Coves. I have known them a great while. I have been acquainted with them 8 years. I always took the boy to be an honest sincere had.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never heard but that the lad was a very harmless lad.</p>
               <p>The mother was asked if she chose to have her character asked of Mr. Coves. She answered, no.</p>

               <p>Porter. I had, two or three times, but never was in company with them. They sat down and said to their companions, we wish you would give us a dram. Said the woman, this gentleman will give you a dram, no doubt. I was pretty well dressed. I said, I would give them a dram of gin: they said they never drank gin, they drank rum. I said, call for a quartern, I'll pay for it. A man came in with a sort of rattan, and fell a laying upon Baker with it. I said, that is very bad usage; if she has done any thing amiss, you should take her to another place: upon that, the son-in-law to the woman of the house, said to me, Mr. Porter, come into this room: then the man fell a laying upon me. When I was out, he advised me to go home. I went out with that intent. I had not got past two doors from the house, before the two women came running after me, and said, now sir, you have seen us righted: if you will go to the King's Arms, in the Fleet-market, we will bring some men to see you righted. We went there; there was the prisoner at the bar. The woman said to him,

            , such a one has used Mr. Porter very ill, for taking our parts. Who are they, said he, and one Doleman. D - n them, we will see him righted. Said Wright, before you go, call for a pot of half and half, to put us in spirits before we go. I had a pot of half and half; then up we went to the Bell again; there they fell to writing, and asking one's name and another's name. I said, it does not signify, I have got no matter of damage, let them go. Said they, we must have something to drink: said I, what will you have: they said, a quartern would be too little, so I gave them a pint of rum: then the women said, we have seen you righted; we beg you will see us home, and as you are pretty well dressed, no body will meddle with you; they said they lived in Whitecross-street; at that time I did not know where Whitecross-street was: then we set out, and they went to Lingard's, at the King's Arms: there the prisoner and Doleman borrowed some money of me. I had known the prisoner on board the Africa, Captain Wood. He was a foremast man. I said I would stay no longer. I paid for all. We went out, and when we came to the White Hart, by Turnagain-lane, they said, this is the last house that will be up, let us drink here: they went in all four of them; I followed and treated them there with a pot of beer. There they fell to fighting one among another. There came in 8 or 10 watchmen. The prisoner and Doleman went away; then I and the two women went out, and up Turnagain-lane. When we came to the Blue Anchor, they said, where are you going? I said, I'll go no farther with you. They said, you shall go with us to Whitecross-street. At the time we were disputing, came 5 or 6 watchmen, and took us all three up to the watch-house, by St. Sepulchre's. One of them, named Chamberlain, knowing me, they let me go, but said, pray what women are these? I said, God knows. I know nothing of them no more than the dead. I know no ill of them. They let them go.

When we were 2 or 3 yards in it, I said, I do not understand this part of the town: they said, they would shew me the way to Whitecross-street. Are you afraid of this place more than us? I said, if a woman is not afraid, I need not. They turned on the left till they came to the second door; they knocked at the door, and I heard a whistle immediately in the court. I was immediately surrounded by three men, and the two women. The prisoner was one: he took a truncheon from under his coat, and said, you old blackguard, have we got you here at last? Mrs. Barnsley opened her door, with a candle in her hand (I found the house the next day.) They swore they would have my life, money, and cloaths, before they left me. I said, for God's sake have mercy, I'll freely forgive every one of you. They laid on me with a great stick. The blood ran down me, and I was in a miserable condition. I held by the women; they pinched me to make me let go. At last, one of the men catched me by the heels, and hawled me down; they drawed me to the next door, and from thence to the dunghill: there I catched the prisoner's hand in my pocket, with a handful of money. I held it. I can swear very safely to him. The man that pulled me down was a tall man, neither Doleman nor the prisoner. I lost a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160009"/> guinea, and 12 s. 6 d. after he had taken that, Doleman came and cut my pocket out; saying you old dog, here is your money, and totes. I heard it rattle. So the prisoner had not all, the watchman came crying the hour 12, then they quitted me, and ran away; the prisoner came back, and made a push at my hat; I got hold of him, and hawled him out into Chick-lane, and begged the watchman would assist me: he said he durst not, for if he did he should be murdered, there was such a gang of them; then came the other two men, and two women up, and rescued him.

             sent his wife to my house in Cow-cross, to let me know he wanted to speak with me. I went with her to her room up two pair of stairs, in Sharp's-alley; he asked me what he owed me: I said 8 l. he had got some foreign money, and wanted to pay me. I said I do not care to take it: said he do not be afraid, I found them in a box in Moorfields. I said I will give you my debt, rather than take them; by his persuasion I bought 7 l dollars, and some gold of him, for betwixt 22 and 23. He bid me sell them any where, for he found them honestly.</p>

               <p>Q. Is she married?</p>
               <p>Thompson. She says she is, a man lived with her. She lodged with me on her own account in the name of Plint, at 3 s. 6 d. a week. She did not say she was a married woman when she took the lodgings: the man says he is not her husband. She absconded, and sent a porter every day to let me know she was coming home. I found the porter came from one part of the town and she another. Then I had a suspicion of her, and went into the apartment and found the things mentioned in the indictment were gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she ever turn you over to the man to be paid?</p>

               <p>Thompson. When first the prisoner came she took them for a gentleman's clerk and his wife; that is about 12 weeks ago: she said the clerk had married one of the servant maids. But after that she took it in her own name for herself.</p>

In the morning I found my breeches were removed from the place, I examined them, and found the pockets had been rifled. I had some silver and halfpence and my watch left. I made a great bustle in the house in the morning.

             M'Ginnis. I am constable: on the 4th of this instant the prosecutor came and told me he had been robbed on the Wednesday night before, at a bad house in St. Giles's, at Atwood's in Church-lane. I went there, Atwood was in bed at one o'clock: I made him get up, and said if he did not find the girl he should go to the Gatehouse. Then he bustled about and found the prisoner at the Noah's Ark, dressed in a new cloak, and other new things. She was examined and owned she had taken 9 l. 13 s. 6 d. and mentioned the particular pieces of money, and mentioned the particular manner in which she took them, she said she thought to go to bed to him, and the toe of her shoe hit against the money in a paper, and she took it up.</p>

               <p>I was standing at the Noah's Ark door, the gentleman came by about half an hour after 12, he asked me if I would go in and have any thing to drink, they would not make any purl, their fire was out, he had nothing to drink but came out again; then he asked me where he might lodge, I told him he might lodge in the room where I lay; he went there and gave a shilling for the bed; there are many people go up into that room, any body that will give 3 d. may go up; there are three beds in the room. I found the money on the ground.</p>

As his cattle turned short to go to Black Mary's-hole, one of them turned into the field, I do not know whose field it was, there was no gate, it was quite an open place; he ran through that field and into the road again at the top of the field. In the mean time that bullock was gone, the others got into the field that was open; the deceased was leaning with his body on a post, he went from the post and went towards the bullocks, going to drive them out into the road to the other bullock. The prisoner, as I thought, came out of a smith's shop, and asked the deceased where he was going to drive the cattle. He answered he was going to get them into the New Road to the others. The deceased went up to the head of the cattle, in order to get them through that place, and in a minute the prisoner struck him a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you at that time?</p>
               <p>Vicar. I was about 100 yards distance, that was the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Vicar. No, he had not. The blow was just above his nose, and he fell directly down on his face. I saw but that blow: I was standing by the side of the rails. I got over directly, and said you have murdered the man; seeing him black in the face, I unbuttoned his collar. As soon as the prisoner had turned the cattle, he went to his shop again. I called after him several times, and said the man was killed. He came back again; I said you have murdered him: he said, God forbid! The man expired in about four minutes after he received the blow. My master came, I said Sir, here is a man murdered: he took a lancet out of his pocket and opened a vein, but before that he said he thought he was a dead man, (my master is a surgeon) the deceased bled but a trifle.</p>

I might be gone down about two minutes; when I came up again, the parlour door was open. I went in and found the drawers open, and a stomacher and gown on the ground. I called my wife to see what was lost. She came up and missed the two gowns mentioned in the indictment; then I went about to the pawnbrokers, and about half an hour after 7 o'clock, I found the silk and stuff gown pawned to Mr. Watson, in Coventry-court, Coventry-street. I found the other gown pawned with Mr. Fryer, in Knaves-acre. The gowns produced in court. The prosecutor produced pieces of the cloth each were made of, and deposed to them, as being the same he lost that night.</p>

            . On Saturday the 23d of November, the prisoner pledged this silk and stuff gown with my master. I was present at the time. The prosecutor came about half an hour after, and owned it. On the 17th of December following, the prisoner came again. My master charged him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160017"/> with robbing Mr. Jones of two gowns. He could not deny but he had such; all he said was, he defied any man that should say the gowns were stole. Then my master ordered me to take him to Mr. Fryer, the other pawn-broker. Going along Coventry-street, he wanted to go down Hedge-lane. I told him that was not the way. He would not go on. I laid hold of his collar, and said he should either go to Mr. Fryer's, or back to my master's. I brought him back to my master's, and took him to Justice Welch.</p>

             came to my house, and asked me if I suspected any body had robbed me. I told him I had suspected that some months ago, and had laid a scheme to discover the person, but did not succeed. He told me he had some brass in his possession, which he suspected to be not honestly come by. He brought me a quantity, which is now here. After examining it, I found I could be positive to part of it. I applied at Hicks's Hall, and got a warrant, and took up the person that Mr. Fleetwood had received this brass of, who said he had it of the prisoner at the bar (the brass produced.) Here is part of it; it is part of a brass mould; the other part I have now at home. Then I got a warrant of suspicion against the prisoner. I took him before Justice Girdler; he there confessed he stole the whole that I apprehended to be mine. Part of this brass he acknowledged he stole from Mr. Monkhouse, his master. He was asked what he got for it a pound; he said he sold it to

I went out on the Sunday night as usual, and when I came home on Monday night, I put the key in the door, and it opened; then I missed my crape gown, silk cardinal, and lawn apron. When the prisoner was taken, she had my silk cardinal and lawn apron on. I found a brass ring put in the place of the gold one, and five pewter spoons in the room of the silver tea spoons. She would not tell me where they were.</p>
               <p>Isabella Gray. The prisoner lived next door to me. I was at Mrs. Buckley's to drink tea last Sunday was se'nnight: every thing was safe. I told her to be sure and lock her door at going out. She put her foot against it, and said it was very safe. I think she put her white apron on some things on the table.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>When I came away, I left the things all of them in her room. Her ring and spoons I am innocent of.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Simonds. This was last Thursday 7 weeks, between 5 and 6 in the evening. They took what I had in my bag, and ran way with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet them, or did they come behind you?</p>
               <p>Simonds. They came behind me.</p>

               <p>Simonds. They wanted to know what I had in my bag, and said I should deliver what I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to you?</p>
               <p>Simonds. He was the first man that spoke to me.</p>

               <p>Simonds. He asked me what I <rs id="t17660116-22-viclabel144" type="occupation">dealt in, and I said in old cloaths</rs>

I said, come in the day-time, and I'll let you see them, and will be willing to sell you them. He would insist upon seeing them directly, and I would not let him. Then he asked me whether I had any money. While he was speaking, there came 3 men behind me; I said, I had no money; then the prisoner knocked me down; then the other 3 took my bag and ran away with it, and the cloaths in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in it?</p>
               <p>Simonds. There was a thickset frock and waistcoat, a pair of leather breeches, a pair of buckskin breeches, a single coat, and 6 pounds weight of brass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Simonds. I never saw him in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they search your pockets?</p>
               <p>Simonds. No. I lay upon the ground 3 or 4 minutes. The blow stunned me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sensible ?</p>
               <p>Simonds. I was quite out of my senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what was done?</p>
               <p>Simonds. It was a violent blow with a great stick. I did not understand what the damage was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in or out of your senses?</p>
               <p>Simonds. I lay about 3 or 4 minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Simonds. Because they all ran away.</p>

            . I am a pipe-maker, and live in Featherstone-street; I never saw the prosecutor with my eyes before this happened. I heard the prisoner offer him a guinea, in case he would take his note for it in a month's time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Simonds say to that?</p>
               <p>Twyman. He said that would not do.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be there?</p>
               <p>Twyman. I happened to be in a public house where Simonds came, and he asked me to go along with him to Grub-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What public house, and where?</p>
               <p>Twyman. It was a public house in Featherstone-street, at the sign of the Lion.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant is that from Grub-street.</p>
               <p>Twyman. That is about half a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Twyman. To the best of my knowledge it was last Tuesday night was se'nnight.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he want you to go with him for?</p>
               <p>Twyman. He desired me to go down to Grub-street along with him, he said there was an affair in hand; this man had robbed him.</p>

               <p>Twyman. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go that night?</p>
               <p>Twyman. We did, the prisoner was not there: the next morning he came to me again at the shop where I work, in Featherstone-street, and begged of me to go again; I did, then the prisoner was in the room, which I thought was the room where he lodged in Grub-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whole house was it?</p>
               <p>Twyman. That I do not know, it was in an alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it above stairs, or below?</p>
               <p>Twyman. It was a lower room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you along with Simonds when he went in ?</p>
               <p>Twyman. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then tell the first thing that passed ?</p>
               <p>Twyman. Simonds asked the prisoner about the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they his words ?</p>
               <p>Twyman. He asked him whether he would produce the things.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did the prisoner give him?</p>
               <p>Twyman. He asked him whether he would take his note for a guinea, in a month's time; and Simonds said no: I went away immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this from the place where Simonds came to you?</p>
               <p>Twyman. It is about half a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go along with Simonds ?</p>
               <p>Twyman. Simonds; proposed to satisfy me for my time, if I would go to hear what this man had to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know he was going to take him up?</p>
               <p>Twyman. No, I did not, he left me in the room, and went out, and I went out then.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first become acquainted with Simonds?</p>
               <p>Twyman. I never was acquainted with him in the world. I never saw him before that night in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Simonds desire you to go with him that night for?</p>
               <p>Twyman. My shopmates thought he wanted to bring me into some premunire, and they followed me: he was talking this over in a public house, to a watch-case maker.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he desire you to go for?</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I Never saw the prosecutor till last Wednesday was se'nnight, when he came in and asked me whether I knew him, he said I had robbed him with the other three. I board at Mr. Deschamps's, he is a pump-maker in Grub-street: said the prosecutor I want restitution for the things I lost; said I do you know me: he said yes. Mrs. Deschamps said if I would make it up with the man, she would be obliged to me: I said I would endeavour to make it up: she asked him if he would take half a guinea; he would not, and went away. He came again, and said he would have more; he wanted a guinea: she said she would endeavour to get him a crown. I did not offer any thing in my own behalf, I said if I was the person, why should he exact more on me than the rest. She went to get him a crown; I went voluntarily with them to my Lord-Mayor, and to the Compter.</p>

            ; this was last Friday was fortnight, he asked for Deschamps by name, and by trade; the prisoner said why do you know me; the man said yes Sir, he did, and should know him from an hundred: said the prisoner I never saw you before. The Jew said you have, he came several times, and said he did not desire to hurt me nor my children. We agreed to make it up for half a guinea, then he said if I would give him a crown, he would take a note for the rest of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has the prisoner boarded with you?</p>
               <p>H. Deschamps. He has boarded with me about 3 or 4 weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your husband been at home all that time?</p>
               <p>H. Deschamps. No, he has not been at home much since.</p>

            . I live in Red Lion-street Clerkenwell. Mrs. Bickerton sent for me, to let me know she had lost some things; I went to her, she told me she had lost a silver watch: she suspected her maid (the prisoner.) I advised her to search her box: she was searched, I only saw the linen which was found in it.</p>

               <p>When my master died, my mistress gave me the old stockings herself; I found some of the linen in an old rag-box in the garret, as to the rest of the things I know nothing at all of them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holder. How came the prisoner to tell you she had secreted the things in the garret?</p>
               <p>Holder. She called to me as I was going along the street, and asked me some questions about the family; we talked some little time about things indifferent, and afterwards we entered upon this subject; she acknowledged to me that she had left some things in the garret, that she was concerned about; she was afraid to tell my mistress, for fear she should get her displeasure: I told her she need not fear that, for if she would acknowledge the watch, my mistress had told her she would forgive her, and upon this expostulation, she told me where the watch was: I told her if she would not tell me where the watch was, my mistress would get a warrant and take her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she at that time in your mistress's service?</p>
               <p>Holder. She had been gone a fortnight.</p>

               <p>I had no intention of a defraud. My master required me to lay out my money for the support of his family, and I was unwilling to let him know my circumstances; and through this way I have involved myself, by changing one thing for another, carrying one thing to the pawnbroker's to fetch another out that was wanted. My wages was seven guineas a year. I desired my master to lend me six guineas to get them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160026"/> again, and I would serve him a year for it, and told him that a quarter's wages should lie in his hands for security till the whole was made up. My master was so kind as to advance this money for me at three different payments. I had first two guineas, and about a month after that I had two guineas more, and some time in November I had another guinea, and the last was 15 s. and I released the things that I had in pledge. After that I told my master, if he would do as other masters had done, to let me have a guinea every Saturday night, then I could go on.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not see it opened, and the things looked at?</p>
               <p>Morgan. No. I imagine that was done before I came. I saw it opened before Justice Girdler, and observed all the different articles there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I had been out with my bundle of cloaths, intending to go to my washer-woman. I met a man that had been in the same regiment with me. Staying some time with him, I came home again, instead of going to her, and staid drinking in the same room where the prosecutor was drinking. I was got pretty much in liquor. I went up stairs, and took that handkerchief instead of my own. I put it upon the bed, or under the bed, I do not know which, and going down again for a candle, I met the prosecutor on the stairs: he asked me if I had any thing belonging to him. I said, I had not as I know of. The gentleman found the handkerchief on the bed. I said it was my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did the prisoner appear to be in liquor?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He did not appear to be at all in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lee. What do you say, was he sober or not?</p>
               <p>Lee. He did not appear to be in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you see the prisoner bring a bundle into the house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He brought no bundle into that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other bundle there besides your own?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, there was no other but mine.</p>
               <p>Lee being asked, answered the same.</p>

               <p>Brown. His name is John. On the 29th of October last, the prisoner came to Mr. Puget's compting-house, and delivered a bill to me of a thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mr. Puget's compting-house?</p>

               <p>Brown. He enquired of me if Mr. Puget was at home. I said he was, and asked what he wanted. He told me he brought two bills for acceptance. I desired to see them. He delivered them both to me. This for a thousand pounds is one of them, and the other was for 900 l.</p>

               <p>Brown. It was a marshal's man, that was the person ordered by my Lord-Mayor to go to Virginia-street, but it was another person that the prisoner whispered to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell where he lived?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, he would not tell. He was asked several times by my Lord-Mayor, but he would make no answer. I think he was then desired by my Lord-Mayor's clerk to write his name, he said he could not write. I then asked him if he could read, he said he could not.

            , when he could neither write nor read; to which he answered, many a one did a great deal of business that could neither read nor write. He was re-examined on the 20th of November-last, before the present Lord-Mayor, then he said all that he had said before the late Lord-Mayor was false, not a word of it true. He said then he was born at a place called Lisbourn, in the north of Ireland, and that he and one Osbourn came over to London together on purpose to buy goods, and that they had been in London about one or two days when they found these bills in Whitechapel, wrapped up in a piece of paper, that they intended to sell the goods they bought here in the north of England. He was then asked where he lodged, he said he lodged at Mile-end, but he could not tell the person's name at whose house he lodged, neither could he tell whether he could go to the house was he set at liberty, then he still said he could neither write nor read. Upon that a question was put to him, whether he had not wrote a letter to the turnkey of Newgate, then he acknowledged he had, upon which he was remanded back to Newgate.</p>

               <p>Q. In whose hands has the forged letter been since you received it?</p>

               <p>Puget. I and my father have corresponded since the year 1716.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they ever sign any bills by their clerks?</p>
               <p>Puget. No never, they are always signed by one or other of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they all four partners?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear him asked if he could write?</p>
               <p>Puget. He was asked if he could write, he said he could not; then there was a question put to him, whether he had not wrote to one of the turnkeys at Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that question to be put to him?</p>
               <p>Puget. Mr. Akerman said a note had been received by one of his turnkeys, sent from the prisoner, and that he was ready to produce it. He was asked three times whether or no he could write, he said he could not. He was asked which of the prisoners in Newgate he had got to write the note for him, then he said he wrote it himself.</p>

I hope your Lordship and the gentlemen of the jury will consider, that no person has proved that I was the person that Forged these bills, or that I knew that these bills were forged. My trial was put off last sessions upon an affidavit by my application, not having any thing ready for my trial; and about a fortnight ago I wrote to Ireland to have an evidence in time, and I applied to the court on the first day of this sessions to have my trial put off till the next, with intention to get proper witnesses; I have been sick three weeks, or I would not have desired that of the court.

            . I have here an order of the court of Chancery, dated the 11th of November 1762, referring it to the master to appoint a receiver in the cause of Lee against Pringle. I examined this order with the entry of it at the report office, and found it to be a true copy.</p>
               <p>Council for prisoner. Then there is a book of entries kept at the report office, from which this copy was taken?</p>
               <p>Mr. Cory. I beg pardon for calling this order a copy, it is the original order from which the entry in the book was made.</p>
               <p>(This order was read.)</p>
               <p>Council for prosecutor. The original receiver being dead, another receiver is prayed, and the court referred it to the master to appoint one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cory. This is an office copy of the master's report, appointing Mr. Hunt receiver, dated the 26th of January 1763. I examined this copy with the original report, which is filed at the report office. (An objection was then made to the reading this report, by the prisoner's council, a prior report of approving the receiver's recognizance not having been produced, but the court over-ruled this objection, and ordered the report to be read.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Hunt.

               <p>C. for prosecutor. Have you got that letter in which he gave an account they were passed?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. Here it is (producing the letter.)</p>

               <p>"We have no objection to the change you</p>
               <p>"have made in that part of the estate late in the</p>
               <p>"possession of Mr. Claridge, and Mrs. Jarrett;</p>
               <p>"and as you think it will be of benefit to the</p>
               <p>"estate, to grant a lease of late Jarrett's, to Mr.</p>
               <p>"Payton; we are ready to consent: but Mr.</p>
               <p>"Payton must consider that the obtaining a lease</p>
               <p>"under the circumstances this estate is in, will</p>
               <p>"be attended with an expence of upwards, or</p>
               <p>"at least 10 guineas, which he must pay. If he</p>
               <p>"is desirous of having a lease under these circumstances,</p>
               <p>"you will please to let me know,</p>
               <p>"as soon as possible, and I will proceed to get</p>
               <p>"the master's report before the office is shut: you</p>
               <p>"will receive the book by the Stratford carrier,</p>

               <p>Lincoln's-Inn, 28 Feb. 1764.</p>
               <p>Counsel for prosecutor. What book is this mentioned in this letter?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. The receiver has a book which is sent up to the master, and when so sent it is usual to return it back to the receiver.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Did you afterwards receive a book?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. I did, by the carrier, and likewise this voucher or certificate at the same time, or very near the time; whether the certificate was inclosed in the letter or the book, I cannot tell. I thought it was quite right, and so laid it by without regarding the particular time, and way of receiving of it: the book I received after the letter.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. When did you receive this certificate, as near as you can recollect?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. I cannot tell whether it came in the letter or the book, the letter is charged 9 d. I rather think I received it in the letter.</p>
               <p>(The certificate is folded, and put into the letter, the folding corresponded well.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. I verily believe it came in this letter.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Had you at the time you received that letter, any other certificate besides this?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. No, none but this.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Did you afterwards return this certificate?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. No, I kept it, and have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. At the time had you any other certificate you could send up but this?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. No, I never had any other, this was my first account I ever had.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Is there nothing that you ever sent up to the master, under the name of a certificate?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. No, not as I know of, and I did not send this up, I kept it for my indemnification.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Did you receive your book of accounts?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. I did, that was the second account; It is a draft of the account for the subsequent year.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Is the writing in the same form, it was when you sent it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. Here are some alterations made in London, after I sent it, there are interlineations made in it.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Who did you send this second account to?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. I sent it up to Mess. Francis and Gibson, (produced in court.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Francis. The prisoner was my partner, (he takes the paper in his hand.) I found this paper among some of the papers at the chambers, and to the best of my remembrance, it was taken out of a drawer, that had been locked up by Mr. Gibson, and which I had opened by a smith after his unhappy confinement.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Look at the several parts, in different ink upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Francis. It is very visible. Mr. Gibson was my clerk for several years before I took him into partnership, so that I am very well acquainted with his hand writing.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. What is there in his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Francis. Here is clear rent received as by the foregoing account, 545 8 9 Balance of the last account, 437 13 7. Total charge, 983 2 4. This is upon the charge part of the account, the word charge, is Mr. Gibson's hand writing, in one of the columns on the charging side. The first article of the discharge also appears to be Mr. Gibson's hand writing, it is this. Paid into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160034"/> the Bank in the accountant general's name, pursuant to order of court, 437 13 7. The other part of this account I take to be Mr. Hunt's hand writing.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Look on the back of this bill, and observe the words, witness J. Gibson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Francis. This is the draft on Child, the words witness J. Gibson, are Mr. Gibson's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hunt. Should you have remitted any more money to Gibson, or Francis, on any other credit than this certificate?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. No, I certainly should not, I looked upon this to be my only indemnity; I mean the office copy, which I thought had been an authentic one, from the clerk of the Report-office.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cory. Look at this certificate, and observe the date at the top?</p>
               <p>Cory. I have not the least doubt but that the figures 20th and 1764, are Mr. Gibson's hand writing; I cannot be so positive to the word February, that seems to be more disguised than the figures.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you the prisoner's clerk?</p>
               <p>Cory. I was clerk to him and Mr. Francis, during the whole time of their copartnership, and am therefore very well acquainted with Mr. Gibson's manner of writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the body of the certificate?</p>
               <p>Cory. Here are many words in the body of the certificate, which I could point out, that are extremely like Mr. Gibson's usual manner of writing, which makes me believe the whole was wrote by him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Francis. Look at this writing, (he takes it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Francis. I have very carefully compared this with a great many writings of Mr. Gibson's; this writing in general is wrote in a fictitious character, ve ry much disguised, and different from Mr. Gibson's usual manner of writing, but I do believe the whole is his writing; perhaps the world may think I speak with partiality, being the prosecutor, but I am upon my oath, and shall be ingenuous, I do really think it is his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. What words are most like his writing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Francis. I cannot say words, but letters I can; the great letters T and F, thro' the whole writing, are so exact, that I can hardly distinguish them from his common writing.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Now Sir, without having made such comparison, could you have formed such a belief on barely seeing that paper?</p>
               <p>Mr. Francis. I should not.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Then your opinion is founded merely upon comparison?</p>
               <p>Mr. Francis. I am so well acquainted with the letters, especially the letter F, and the figures, that I do believe it to be Mr. Gibson's writing.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. But you had formed no opinion till you compared it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Francis. No, I had not; it is wrote in imitation of the clerk of the Report's hand: I think I could have founded my opinion from the figures on the top; it struck me very much when I first observed those very figures, this was before I compared it, but if I had not compared it, I could not have spoke with that satisfaction to myself I now do.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kiddell. I have known the prisoner two years, very near. I had been clerk to Mess. Francis and Gibson about a month before Mr. Gibson was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen Mr. Gibson write?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kiddell. I have, and have immediately copied it after he wrote it.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Are you a competent judge of his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kiddell. I think I am. I think I could know any man's hand writing, was I to set by him, in three weeks.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Look at this office copy, and see if any of this writing is like the prisoner's, (he takes the letter in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Kiddell. I think the date and the two capital letters F and T, are greatly like his hand writing. I mean the letter F in February, and the T to the accountant general's name, T. Anguish; I believe the date is his hand writing.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Look through it, and see whether you can find any more, that you believe to be the prisoner's hand writing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kiddell. To say I can swear to any word I cannot, but here are many letters I believe to be Mr. Gibson's hand writing: in the words four hundred there are some letters, I believe all the capital letters of T and F are Mr. Gibson's hand writing.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Perhaps you mean this instrument was wrote by somebody that does not know how to make T and F, and so they employed Mr. Gibson to do them?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160035"/>Mr. Kiddell. No, I do not. I think the e and b in February are his hand writing.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. My general question is this: from the view of this and the knowledge you have of Mr. Gibson's hand writing, do you think this is his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Kiddell. I do, indeed.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Where are Mr. Francis's chambers ?</p>
               <p>Kiddell. They are in Lincoln's-Inn, No. 7, up one pair of stairs.</p>

             is.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. How long have you been in that office?</p>
               <p>Ellill. I have been in it fifteen or sixteen years. The business of that office is committed to me, so far as relates to this business. I have been under him and his predecessors that time.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. How long has Mr. Rainsford been clerk of that office?</p>
               <p>Ellill. He has been in it about ten years.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. When any money is ordered from the court of Chancery to be paid into the Bank, by what method is it conducted?</p>
               <p>Ellill. The accountant general's clerk sends some certificates to me, and the Bank receipt annexed to it. Then we make out an office copy of them.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. What do you do with the originals?</p>
               <p>Ellill. They remain in the office.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Who makes out those office copies?</p>
               <p>Ellill. I do in general.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Have you any original certificate by you?</p>
               <p>Ellill. I have, (produced in court) by this you will see the nature of it. This is my writing.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. What do you call this?</p>
               <p>Ellill. This is an office copy of the accountant general's certificate.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Look at this instrument, ( the office copy in question) whose hand writing is it?</p>
               <p>Ellill. This is not made by me.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Is this the nature of an office copy?</p>
               <p>Ellill. It has the appearance of an office copy, as though delivered out by me.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Have you searched at the Bank for the original of this?</p>
               <p>Ellill. I have, there is no account at the office of any receipt of the money, nor no such thing filed.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Are you sure you never delivered this out of your office?</p>
               <p>Ellill. I am positive I never delivered any such, and there is no original certificate to warrant it.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Let me ask you again, are you certain?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160036"/>Ellill. I speak with great certainty, there is no original certificate of this in the office, nor never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are they delivered out by?</p>
               <p>Ellill. They are always delivered out by me. This part of the business is entirely done by me.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. What do you call yourself?</p>
               <p>Ellill. I am deputy to the clerk of the Report-office.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. They are sometimes called reports and sometimes certificates.</p>
               <p>Ellill. They are one and the same thing, we look upon them in the same light. We receive a certificate with a receipt at the Bank annexed to it, we call it a Bank receipt.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Am I to understand it as your opinion, that a certificate and a receipt are all one thing?</p>
               <p>Ellill. He sends his own certificate with the Bank receipt annexed to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you do with them when you receive them?</p>
               <p>Ellill. We make an entry of them.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. At your office do you not deliver out office copies to any body that will pay you for them?</p>
               <p>Ellill. Yes, we do.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Do they bare any marks: are they signed by Mr. Rainsford or you?</p>
               <p>Ellill. Nothing more than the word examined, with the entry.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Do you put no marks to distinguish what comes from your office?</p>
               <p>Ellill. No; we keep an account of what we receive for them.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. I have not the smallest doubt that you neglect to receive your fees.</p>
               <p>Ellill. We can tell when we see them, whether they are our hand writing or not.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Do you give office copies to every body that files them?</p>
               <p>Ellill. All reports that are filed the person that files them must have an office copy.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Had you ever any refused?</p>
               <p>Ellill. No, never; an office copy is made out from every report that is filed.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Do you make out your copies upon stamps ?</p>
               <p>Ellill. We do.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Why so?</p>
               <p>Ellill. Because there is an act of parliament for it.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. What is the accountant general's papers on?</p>
               <p>Ellill. They are on plain paper.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Have you any vouchers that the money has been paid into the Bank besides the accountant general's certificate?</p>
               <p>Ellill. No other whatsoever.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. What evidence has he to produce in order to prove that fact in a court of equity?</p>
               <p>Ellill. He has only an office copy made by me.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. What evidence has he to produce to prove that fact in court?</p>
               <p>Ellill. An office copy most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Is it possible for the party, according to the rules of the court of equity, to have the originals to produce?</p>
               <p>Ellill. No, they are not allowed. They are not allowed to be read.</p>

               <p>C. for prosecutor. Do you keep a journal?</p>
               <p>Ellill. We do: that is in the custody of the office; that is in my custody. It is the journal in which I generally enter all these certificates.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Do you make these entries alphabetically?</p>
               <p>Ellill. No.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Do you make these entries upon all accounts?</p>
               <p>Ellill. I constantly do upon all accounts brought into the office of the transactions of the accountant general's. They are made every day, and posted to the several accounts.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Is there no other besides you in that office?</p>
               <p>Ellill. Besides me there is another clerk in the office, but this branch of business is confined to myself, the other clerk never interferes in this business.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Have you never been out of order so as to be absent from the office?</p>
               <p>Ellill. I have been absent upon illness.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. Suppose during your illness a certificate is brought in, and an office copy is desired when you are absent, who does it?</p>
               <p>Ellill. There may have been certificates brought into the office in my absence, but none delivered out to my knowledge. When I come to the office again, that person who is in the office delivers an account to me of what has been done in my absence.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Was you absent in the year 1754.</p>
               <p>Ellill. I do not know of the other delivering out an office copy during my absence; no none.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160037"/>C. for prosecutor. Do you remember your being absent these two years past, so as he has made out copies?</p>
               <p>Ellill. I have been out of order not 12 months ago.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. If one calls for an office copy of 20 years standing, will it not be granted?</p>
               <p>Ellill. It will be granted.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the other clerk in your office?</p>
               <p>Ellill. His name is Moon.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of stamps are office copies made of?</p>

               <p>Ellill. On double sixpenny stamps.</p>

               <p>Moon. (He takes it in his hand.) No, it is not. This was never wrote in our office.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Was Mr. Ellill ever so ill as not to attend ?</p>
               <p>Mr. Moon. He had a fit of illness, that I believe was above 12 months ago.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Who made out the office copies then?</p>
               <p>Mr. Moon. No body but me, and that by way of friendship to Mr. Ellill.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Did you deliver those copies you made in the office?</p>

               <p>Mr. Noel. I am clerk in the accountant general's office. When I receive certificates from the Bank, shewing money has been paid in the Bank, upon the accountant general's credit, we make out a certificate, and carry it to the clerk of the Report-office.</p>
               <p>Counsel for prosecutor. Do you keep a minute of that?</p>
               <p>Mr. Noel. I keep a minute of that always: it is thus conducted: in the first place there is a direction given to the Bank of England to receive so much, that direction is entered into the book: when the banker's receipt comes back to the Bank, that is entered in the same book, and the date that the accountant general's certificate bears, he sends out two certificates; the first I call the direction. The party that is to pay the money, carrier that to the Bank, and leaves it there, and brings back a receipt from the cashier, and that is made an entry of in the accountant general's book, and likewise the date of the accountant general's certificate, which I always send to the Report office. But we have another book, which we call the report book, in which these certificates are put, and the name of the cause.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Have you searched the books in your office, in order to find any such report (as this in question) made?</p>
               <p>Mr. Noel. I have made diligent search: there has no money been paid into the Bank on such an account, neither is there any entry of a receipt or certificate, no direction ever applied for. In point of fact, there is no such thing to be found.</p>
               <p>C. for prosecutor. Who has been the accountant general for two years past?</p>
