               <p>in, there was about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. outstanding, and I said we should send state<lb/>ments to the customers, whereupon he seemed rather frightened—we did send out statements on the Saturday, and on the Monday several customers came and said they had paid the accounts; the three accounts in question were included—we then telegraphed to the prisoner, and he came to the office—he said "I know what you are going to tell me"—I said "That will save me the trouble of telling you; of course, we are bound by the Guarantee Society to prosecute you unless you can pay the money, there is no help for it"—I mentioned Brayziel's case—he did not say he had not had it—we mentioned several names, and told him it amounted to about 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not deny it—he said "If you had kept me on another two or three months I could have paid it all off, and I thought of doing so"—he came several times after that, but no salary was paid him afterwards—I produce a number of letters of the prisoner which I received—I sont him a letter on 27th May, 1884, which is copied in my letter book (<hi rend="italic">This complained that the prosecutors were kept waiting for the prisoner every night, and were kept in the dark as to what was going on in their business, and requested him to call four nights a week, and send a line when lie did not call.</hi>) I also wrote to him on December 5th, 1884 (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had not yet called, and that they should require a full explanation</hi>)—he came and explained verbally—I supplied him with a book made up of two parts, to enable him to keep a copy of his letters to us—many of his letters are written on the leaves of our book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined,</hi> In June I had a conversation with him with regard to these outstanding amounts—as far as my memory serves me an account of matters between us was furnished at the beginning of August or it might have been July—I instituted proceedings in September—the examination before the Magistrate was 17th September—I was obliged to institute the prosecution to recover money from the Guarantee Society, that does not depend on a conviction but on prosecution—I wrote this to the prisoner on the 17th August this year—this is the prisoner's reply on 19th August—the 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid as salary, I adhere to that—these words in blue pencil on this document are in my partner's handwriting, the alteration from 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is his writing, I don't think I ever saw it before, I knew nothing about it—the document is signed by the prisoner—I believe I gave him a memorandum to the effect that the increase of salary from 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was remuneration for expenses; it was under<lb/>stood as salary.

(<hi rend="italic">This was from the prosecutors in reply the prisoner's of the 17th August, and stated that with the exception of the 1 per cent, thy were agreeable to the terms he named</hi>)—the prisoner drew on account every week for commission and salary—he was to account for moneys received every Saturday and pay them over—that was a verbal arrangement and was acted upon—the accounts were rendered every Saturday in writing—the last I think is 13th June—he began to collect</p>

               <p>on August 12, 1884—I have got the weekly returns between those dates except for Christmas week—the payments to him every week are entered in the petty cash book, the commission based on accounts—he very largely increased our business in butterine and matches, he was a very good traveller in the beginning—we hardly did any town trade at all before we took him, and we sometimes had difficulty in executing his orders, and he drew attention to complaints from his customers that their orders had not been executed, one or two orders were withdrawn in con<lb/>sequence—I charged him in June with the embezzlement of about 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I entered into an agreement with him in August, which he subsequently stamped (<hi rend="italic">The letter from the prisoner on 11th August offering to sell matches and butterine on certain terms, and the prosecutors' reply on the 19th staling that subject to two alterations in commission for two brands of matches they accepted his conditions, were read</hi>)—I filled up the form required by the Society, I never heard that unless the prisoner was formally described as a clerk the Society would not enter, into the policy—I do not know Guarantee Societies decline to enter into cases were parties are com<lb/>mission agents—it is the first case of a Guarantee Society I have known—I have seen on the printed form that the person must be a servant and and I knew he must be a servant for the purpose of this policy—we are prosecuting the prisoner—I did not wish to do so if he could have paid us—I had no vindictive feeling and wrote to him, and At last he took no notice, and I told him unless he paid us I should institute proceedings—if the account had been settled up there would have been no prosecution—there has been no settlement between us since June up to this time—nothing was done under the agreement of August, he never sold under it—I was quite willing that he should effect sales for our matches on the terms of my letter of 19th August, if customers had paid us cash at once; we should have taken his commission on account of the money due to us which he had embezzled—I kept the matches and butterine accounts in two separate small books which I have sent for, I only got notice to produce them this morning—our principal trade is export, and for these matches and butterine we only keep small books—they are balanced every week—we balance our accounts half-yearly—I think that would appear from the books—I was not asked about them at the police-court, I will produce them—the prisoner's turnover was about 2,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per year for butterine and matches in town—he went to Wimbledon several times, when we paid for his trap specially—I swear he did not tell me in June he had got into confusion with his account—he simply gave me his account and we gave him our account, he never denied having taken the money—the prisoner did not repeatedly ask me to furnish him with accounts of sales effected by him in order that he might calculate his commission, he said he knew he had overdrawn—we entered into a fresh agreement in August after finding out the state of affairs in June.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 11 years old, and live at 7, Amiel Terrace, Bromley—I had a sister named Bridget; she was the wife of the prisoner, and lived at 17, Amiel Terrace, at the back of our house—on Wednesday, 27th October, I was staying with my sister at No. 17—I was there when the prisoner came home from work about 6 p.m.—he had tea and then went to bed—my sister then sent me out for some fish for supper—she cooked it and took some of it up to the prisoner for his supper—all that evening the prisoner and his wife seemed on very good terms—my sister occupied a sitting-room, a bedroom where they both slept, and a kitchen—on that night I had a bed made up in their bedroom, and about half-past 10 I and my sister went to bed—in the morning my sister called me—there is a clock in the room; it was 7 o'clock—I lit the fire in the sitting-room—my sister then woke the prisoner, and he said that Mr. Keenan would be wild at his losing a quarter, he ought to have been at work at 6 o'clock, and if he was not there then he would lose a quarter of a day—my sister then came down into the sitting-room and commenced preparing the breakfast—the prisoner came down and washed himself and then said there was a nail in his boot, and asked my sister for a hammer; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I gave it him and he was hammering the nail in his shoe—my sister then sent me out to get a basket of coke—up to that time I had not heard any quarrel between them—I was not out a full quarter of an hour, about ten minutes—when I came back the prisoner opened the door to me; he was dressed, but had not got his hat or coat on—he said "Maggie, go and fetch your mother quick, I want her," and I heard some one groaning inside—I then went over the fence and spoke to my sitter Katie and to my mother—my sister is about 15—she and I then came back to the prisoner's house—we went into the sitting-room and saw my sister Bridget lying on her side in a pool of blood—her head was at the edge of the table and her feet by the fire; her face and neck were covered in blood, she was groaning very much—the prisoner was not there at that time—I saw this hammer and knife lying by her side on the floor, crossing each other—my sister Katie picked up the knife and put it on the window-ledge outside, and put the hammer in the cupboard or fireplace, I don't know which—the furniture and the preparations for breakfast in the room wore just the same as when I left them—my mother then came, then the police and doctor, and then the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licentiate and a member of the Royal College of Physicians, and I practise at Bromley—on the morning of 28th October I was called to 17, Amiel Terrace, and got there about half-past 8—my assistant had been there before me—I found the woman lying on the floor in the room quite unconscious—I examined her, and found 11 wounds on the head, and also a small wound on the left cartilage of the nose; I thought at the time it was a cut—it could have been cut with a small penknife, but not with this knife—it could have been done with the hammer striking against the edge of one of the nasal bones—they were very serious wounds, and I saw the skull was fractured—at that time she was too ill to be removed to the hospital—I saw her again at 11 o'clock on that morning—she was then conscious for a time, and I sent for the Magistrate to take her statement—he came about a quarter past 1, but she had then become unconscious again—in the evening she rallied a little, and I thought it best to have her removed to the hospital, and she died about a quarter to 2 on the following morning—I was present just after the post-mortem had been finished—I compared the hammer with the wound over the temple-bone, and they corresponded—the wounds on the skull might have been produced by this hammer—the actual cause of death was, I think, internal injuries to the liver; it was lacerated—there were four fractures of the skull—there were four ribs broken; the breaking of them might have caused the internal injuries—it is possible that a fall with violence against the edge of a table might have broken these four ribs.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—we have been married 18 months the 23rd April last—on 14th October, about 6 o'clock in the morning, we were in bed—he awoke me and said in angry words "You kicked me"—I had not to my knowledge—I said "I didn't kick you"—he said "Don't you think I am afraid of you; I could smother you if I like; I could do it now if I took a pillow and put it on to you; I could soon do it"—upon that he took up a pillow and placed it on my face—I moved it, and screamed "Murder"—he replaced it again, and then I moved it again, and screamed "Murder" and "God help me"—the last time he put the pillow on my face he put his hand on each side of my face and I could not move it, and I scratched his face, and then he released me—I had two scratches on my nose; I couldn't say whether I did them or whether the prisoner did—I struggled with him altogether about ten minutes; it was only a few seconds that he held the pillow over my face; he held it quite tight—after I had scratched his face and he</p>

               <p>had released me, he sat on the bed for a little while and said a few words I did not notice, but the last he said was "This will be a warning to you; the next time I will finish you"—this is not the first occasion on which he has assaulted me—he started on me two months after I was married, about my money—he took me by the throat, and attempted to strangle me, but he was disturbed by some one coming in the shop—he also assaulted me one Sunday morning—I took a breakfast upstairs, and took it into the wrong room, and he punched me, and the prints of his nails were in my neck for some time afterwards—he said on this occasion he wouldn't strike me or make any marks, but would do for me in another way—when he assaulted me 16 months ago I went to the police-court and made a complaint, and he was cautioned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and Lecturer on Practical Surgery at St. Mary's Hospital—I made the post-mortem examination—in my opinion the immediate cause of death was inflammation of the lungs—he had a large bed-sore on the back—I found a patch of softening on the left side of the brain as large as a walnut; that was the result of a previous haemorrhage of several days' standing—the left kidney was entirely destroyed by stone—there was extensive long-standing disease of the lungs—the blood vessels generally were in a weak state—the haemor<lb/>rhage was of lone standing, several weeks; that might be caused by a blow, and it might not—any great physical exertion, or even mental excitement, would cause it—a blow would certainly be calculated to cause haemorrhage—I do not think that a blow on the jaw alone would cause haemorrhage in the brain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in works of art at 40, Gerrard Street, Islington—on 18th December, 1888, I issued his writ (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for dissolution ot partnership, and on April 4th it came before Vice-Chancellor Bacon on my application for appointing a receiver; I alleged that there was between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property in the prisoneri's,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188511160020"/>
               <p>possession; the Vice-Chancellor directed the fact to be tried in the Queen's Bench Division whether there was a partnership—it was tried on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of December, 1884—I gave evidence, and the Jury found that such a partnership did exist—I afterwards applied before the Vice-Chancellor and obtained judgment with costs—I was present on December 9th, when Long gave his evidence; he was sworn in the usual way by the officer of the Court; he then swore that he never paid a shilling towards the horse picture by Freemantle, but he gave me 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a present; that I had no further interest in the picture; he swore that there was no arrangement between us as to the horse pictures, but that I was his agent, and that there was no arrangement to go out together as partners, but that I went out with him to buy for him as his agent—that was quite untrue—I had known him for some years before 1883—our arrangement was to go to sales and buy and sell, and share the losses and profits, and we carried that out for a considerable time; we shared the losses and profits in a great many transactions, and that was all gone into at the trial—I received a letter and met Long in Tottenham Court Road in July, 1883, and accompanied him to Freemantle's, where there was a sale; Mr. McFarlane was there; he bought two horse pictures for Long and me; I was present when McFarlane bid for them, and for one or two more of us—there was a knock-out of which we were members—he bought them for us and others, they came with expenses to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. within a shilling or two, and Long took them himself to his premises—they always went to his house—I believe he had a larger connection than I had, and he disposed of them—he made these entries in his book a day or two afterwards: "Horse pictures, paid 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., by Alexander"—those words and figures are in Long's writing—there had been several horse pictures between us, but I swear that that entry applies to those bought at Freemantle's—at the time that entry was made Long owed me more than 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on our transactions—I ascertained before August 11th that he had sold the pictures—I saw him on August 11th, and he wrote these figures on this catalogue (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), showing a balance to me, after taking into consideration a sum of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., less 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I owed him—that left a balance of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as the account had been credited with the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is the receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is "August 11th, 1883, re<lb/>ceived of J. H. Long 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for goods bought of Freemantle, including the profit of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—that is his writing, and the signature is mine—these words "In full satisfaction as it is a gift" were not there when I signed it, they have been added afterwards—I gave it up to him, and it has been in his possession ever since—that receipt acknowledges that I had received 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. profits—on 11th August he gave me this IOU for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is in his writing—he had not given me 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a gift, or any sum—I never saw that receipt after signing it till I saw it at the trial—he took up his IOU on the 13th by this cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was duly paid—that closed the transaction—Mr. Sawyer afterwards made a com<lb/>munication to me with reference to the pictures—towards the end of 1883 Long had property value between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in which I claimed partnership; he still retains it—I heard that he disputed the partnership, and consulted a solicitor—I afterwards had an interview with Long, who asked me to sign a receipt in full discharge—I refused and went on with my litigation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not aware that I tried to settle the case—if any</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188511160021"/>
               <p>one has suggested that Long should pay me a sum of money, that was done without my authority—Mr. Abrahams was my solicitor first, and Mr. Lazarus afterwards—no offer was made from me for a settlement—this letter of 19th June, 1885, was not written by my authority—it is in Mr. Lazarus's writing—he was acting as my solicitor at that time—I do. not know whether he was acting for Abrahams or for himself—Mr. Abrahams had the case in hand at first. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was dated January 19th, 1885, Alexander v. Long, and stated:</hi> "I understand an offer has been made from the prosecutor's former solicitor of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for costs, and the delivery up to him of the goods admitted to have been fully paid for by him. Kindly let me know by return whether the defendant will accept those terms, as I am instructed to deliver the brief to-morrow.") I still say that I never endeavoured to settle the proceedings—what he has sworn falsely is that I never paid anything towards the two horse pictures bought at Freemantle's, and that the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a present, and that I had no further interest in the pictures, and that all the goods there were for him to sell for me—he swore that I was not his partner, but his agent—I said in answer to you at Bow Street that I did net pay half towards the horse pictures; I misunderstood you—the case took three days—I buy goods, and Long does the same—I had money to buy goods with when I started with him; I cannot tell you how much, but I had not quite sufficient to buy all the goods we bought altogether—I did not ask him to make this entry in the books that I should not appear to be a pauper—when we bought goods we used to enter them in this book—nothing was said about a pauper; I know that he swore that that took place—when I signed this receipt it stopped at the word "profit;" this blotch was not on it; he swore that the blotch was there when I signed it, but I swore that it was not—I found 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. towards paying the auctioneer for the pictures, and they were knocked down—I paid that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Long—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque he gave me for it. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated August 7th.</hi>) I found 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. towards it, but I paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. first—I did not find any of the money at the time the auctioneer was paid, except the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these figures on the back of the receipt relate to a picture he bought and sold again, and I paid for it 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I got half the profit on that, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and also half my expenses on my journey to Whitby in Yorkshire. (<hi rend="italic">The witness here explained other items at the back of the receipt.</hi>) Those sums come to 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Long said, "I will make this entry in the book, 'Horse pictures, paid 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., by Alexander' "—instead of paying me the money he discharged the debt—it is on that entry that I say there was a partnership between us; that is the only corroboration of my statement that there was a partnership.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The letter from my solicitor was without prejudice—I have been put to considerable cost; I had to employ a Queen's Counsel" to defend me—I got judgment against Long with all the taxed costs—I went into a great quantity of transactions on the trial in which I received half profits—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in works of art, in Wych Street—in July, 1883, I attended a sale at Freemantle's, and bid for the Herring pictures; they went, with expenses, for about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Mr. Long agreed with me the day before that sale to go there with him, on account of his partner being in the West of England; that is that I should be his partner; as his partner, Mr. Alexander, cold not get home in time—on the day of the sale he told me that I could not expect to be partners with him on account of his partner being there, and I saw Mr. Alexander there—I then bid for the pictures on my own behalf; it was a knock-out, and I was appointed to bid—I am sorry to say that often takes place, and it sometimes takes place at Christie's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The arrangement I had with Mr. Long was, that I and he should be the partners, and share the profits or loss—if there is a sale where there are some pictures by different artists, we have a general venture together; one buys, and we arrange the proportions between ourselves—I had never entered into a joint speculation with Long before, but he asked me to do so.</p>

On 28th October, about 12.20, midnight, I was on duty in Harding Street, St. Giles's, Commercial Road East—I heard the noise of breaking of glass in Steele's Lane, and on looking up the lane I saw a man running into the Robarts Arms, Devon<lb/>port Street—I looked at the Emanuel Mission Hall, and on the north side found several panes broken and a quantity of broken glass on the pave<lb/>ment—I concealed myself for some time—the prisoner came out of the Robarts Arms followed by the manager, who came and spoke to me, and</p>

               <p>while we were talking I saw the prisoner put his hand through a broken window of the Mission Hall, on the south side, and strike three matches in succession—he then ran round the north side and I heard another breakage of glass on that side—I then apprehended him—he said "What do you want me for?"—I said "For breaking the windows and trying to set fire to the church"—some gentlemen held him while I went and examined the church—I found three matches on the window-sill on the south side, close to where one of the wheatsheaves were; they were not lighted, the wind being so strong—there had been a Thanks giving Service, and these small wheatsheaves were part of the decorations—they would easily take fire—I found no matches inside the window—altogether 37 panes were broken; they were small diamond-shaped squares—I found eight matches under the next window to where the three were—the prisoner's right hand was cut and bleeding—he was charged at the station and made no reply—he had been drinking, but knew perfectly well what he was about—he gave his address at his mother's; he is well known in the neighbourhood—some straw on one of these little wheat<lb/>sheaves had been ignited and had blown out—if he had succeeded in lighting these sheaves it is quite probable that it might have set fire to the building, and would have done considerable damage.</p>

I am a member of the firm of Schofield Brothers, cloth manufacturers at Wakefield, Yorkshire—I knew the prisoner before 28th May, 1883—he had given me orders for goods through a traveller—I subsequently took another order from him in London—goods the subject of two orders were sent to his place at Bow—after I got a third order I heard something about him, and wrote him a letter, and received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 29 <hi rend="italic">th May, and after referring to the goods, stated:</hi> "With regard to my age, your information is false.

After receiving that letter I seat goods to the amount of 248<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that letter induced me to part with them—I believed that he was 21 years of age—I came up to town and saw him at his office in Faleon Avenue, Aldersgate Street—I said I had heard there was something wrong with him, and I wanted to know where my goods were that I had sent him—I don't think I said anything then about his age—I can't remem<lb/>ber what passed between us—he did not tell me where the goods were—I asked him if they had ever been in his office—he said "No"—I don't think I said anything about prosecuting him—I was present at the police-court when a press copy of a letter marked "A" was produced; the prisoner acknowledged receiving the original.

                  </hi>. I live at 262, City Road, and am a hardware turner—on Monday, 26th October, about 3 o'clock, I met Darcy at a public-house—I had never seen him before—we walked about together getting some bills till about 5 o'clock—I saw him again about a quarter-past 6 o'clock in the George public-house, and remained in his company till about 8 o'clock—I then left him, and returned to the George about 9 o'clock—Darcy was there—I did not see White at that time—I was drinking in the same compartment as Darcy, but not with him—there were other persons there—at a quarter-past 9 o'clock I was drinking some soda-water, Darcy was near me, and I discovered his hand in my right-hand trousers-pocket, and at the same moment White put his hand into my left-hand trousers-pocket and took a packet containing six sovereigns—almost at the same moment I was struck very violently in the face by Darcy, who knocked me down—I bled very much, and was partly insensible for some time afterwards—the prisoners made the best of their way out of the house, having got my money—when I got up some friends bathed my face, and I was taken home in a cab—I was very unwell from the effects of the blow, and did not go to the police that night—next night I went to the George, Darcy came in and asked me to have a drink with him, and put out his hand to shake hands with me—I made no reply, but kept very close to him for fear he should escape—I sent some one for a policeman—he must have heard me do so; he re<lb/>mained, a policeman came, and I gave him in charge—on Friday afternoon, the 30th, I saw White at the police-station among a number of others—I did not feel quite certain of him at first, he seemed to be dressed smarter and differently—I saw him again on the 31st at the police-court and then recognised him—I have no doubt about him now.</p>

Ashton was present when I was asked to identify White on the Friday; he identified him—it was not in consequence of that that I identified him next day—I had been having a bit of a jollification on the Monday—I had been in four public-houses during the day—the printed bills I had were about the general election with my name on them, "The Great Cox for Finsbury"—I was dis<lb/>tributing those bills, Darcy was with me, he called me "Cox" that night, but on the Tuesday he said "Arthur, have a drink, shake hands," as though nothing had happened—Ashton was with me at the George on the Monday; he spoke to Darcy and warned him not to touch me—Ashton then went out to get a cab to take me home—I was not perfectly sober, but I knew what I was about; I was not intoxicated—Ashton was perfectly sober.</p>

I am barman at the George, St. John's Street Road—on Monday, 26th October, about 9 p.m., I was serving customers at the bar—I saw the prosecutor and both prisoners there—they were there when Cox came in; I saw them, one on each side of him—White was closest to the bar; Darcy was on his right—I saw Darcy strike him in the face with his right hand; that was the first thing that attracted my attention; it was a severe blow, it knocked him down—I did</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Chapel End, Walthamstow—on 19th October, between 1 and 2 p.m., I was at the corner of Nelson Street, City Road—the two prisoners passed me, and one said to the other "Now is his time"—they immediately ran across the road, and I saw the prosecutor being hustled by a third man at the corner of Wellesley Street—he ran away, and the prosecutor gave chase—at that time the prisoners had arrived over there by the prosecutor—as he was follow<lb/>ing, the third man, Last, put out his foot and tripped him up, Arnold giving him a shove at the same time—the prosecutor got up and gave chase, and the prisoners ran away—I followed Arnold to Windsor Terrace, but lost sight of him—I met the prosecutor at the top of Wellesley Street, which leads into Windsor Terrace—on the same day I went to the station and gave information—I identified Last next evening, and Arnold on the following Tuesday, from 12 or 14 others—I have not the least doubt about them—I do not know which spoke, but this remark called my attention to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of 15, Nottingham Court, Long Acre—on Sunday morning, October 25th, about half an hour after mid-night, I was walking down High Street, Bloomsbury, and was thrown down on my back from behind—I looked up and saw the two prisoners over me; I felt their hands in my pockets—I said "Oh, you thieves, to rob me of my hard earned money"—one of them struck me on my nose and forehead with his fist—I was relieved of 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in silver, which I had in my pocket—I got the blow because I shouted out—a constable came up and seized them as they were over me—a struggle took place between them and the constable, a crowd collected and kept me back—I am quite sure about Lane—I cannot positively swear to Keefe; to the best of my belief he is the other man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I left home at 9 o'clock; I kept an appointment with a young man at a public-house in Tottenham Court Road, and then went</p>

               <p>to a meeting of workmen at the Feathers, Warren Street—I had refresh<lb/>ment there—I did not kick at a door in High Street, saying the man who had gone in there had got my money—the man did not say "Go away, you are drunk"—I was not detained that night at the police-station—I said before the Magistrate "I swear Keefe is one of the two men"—the attack was very sudden and did not last long—I had never seen the men before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was not drunk—I had had a glass or two—I was conscious of what was going on—I went to the police-station afterwards without my hat, which I had lost.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 540). About 12.30 on 25th October I was in High Street, Bloomsbury, and saw Lane loitering about there for some time—I followed him up High Street—he met Keefe; they had a few words, and walked towards Oxford Street, away from me—I saw O'Brien coming in the direction of St. Giles's Church—Lane knocked him on the head with his fist, Keefe tripped him up at the same time, and he fell on his back—I was 10 or 15 yards off—I ran up; Lane was on his right side and Keefe on his left—their hands were in his pockets—they got them out just as I got up—he was struggling to get up—he cried to them not to rob him—I seized them both—Keefe said he would not go, and resisted and got away—I took my whistle out, but before I could blow it a second time, Lane pulled it from me—I threw him to the ground, Keefe came and rescued him from me, and they both got away—I caught Lane after he had gone three or four yards by the back of his coat collar—Keefe came behind him, lifted the coat up from his back, and Lane slipped out of the sleeves and ran away, leaving the coat in my hands—I threw it down and went after Lane, tripped him, and he fell at the corner of Denmark Court—Keefe pulled me down the court—another constable, Fairweather, came and caught Keefe—Lane became very violent, and made several kicks at my privates—I took out my truncheon, and told him I should use it if he showed any violence—a man in the crown held my arm while Lane took the truncheon from me, and struck me twice, once on my forehead and once on the top of my head—I held Lane till assistance came—he was very violent on the way to the station—Dr. Mill saw me—I have been off duty ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was on fixed point duty at St. Giles's Church—Lane and Keefe were going in the opposite direction to Mr. O'Brien—they were rather too far off for me to see how they attacked him—they struck him directly they got to him; there is no mistake about that—I had followed them about 20 yards from the church to Denmark Court—Lane said he did not do it, and resisted; Keefe could have got away if he liked; I could not have held two—he remained to help his friend—a crowd of roughs got round us; there was a good deal of struggling and pushing; a man lost his watch in the middle of the crowd—there were a great many not friendly to the police there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no doubt these are the two men—I never lost sight of Lane from the time I caught hold of him till I got him to the station.</p>

               <p>struggled and the crowd helped him—I felt for my truncheon, but found it was taken out of my case—I handed Keefe over to the sergeant, and went back to look for it; my helmet was also gone.</p>

Mr. Justice Smith being clearly of opinion that it was, it was read as follows:</hi> "Frederick Spinsby, age 45, rag sorter. I am afraid I am dying. About half-past 9 or a quarter to 10 on Friday Ada Spinsby rushed up and said 'I will b—well get some one to pay you to-night;' and this fellow I don't know came up outside my door. On Thursday night he had struck me with some sharp instrument, and on Friday night ho rushed up and struck me twice in the same place with his fist. He then went away. On the Saturday morning my head began to swell."</p>

I keep the Swan, Old Kent Road—about 10th July I advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi> for a barman; they were to apply at the Swan—Burkhill came, and gave his name Frank Burkhill—I asked him how long he had been out of employment—he said three months—I then asked him how long he had been in his last place, and he said eight months—I said "Where?"—he said "At the Jane Shore, Shoreditch," he had left on account of his father's death—he did not mention Mr. Wakley's name—I asked him who I was to see about his character, and he said Mr. Seymour, manager at the Jane Shore—I said</p>

               <p>I would write to him if his character was satisfactory—I went and saw Seymour and asked him how long Burkhill had been in his employ—he said "Eight months"—I asked him how long ago he left, and he said three months—I asked him if he would give him a good character for honesty and sobriety—he said he was very good in every respect, and that he left on account of his father's death—on that I engaged Burkhill—he entered my service a few days after, and remained with me one month; I then discharged him without notice—he asked why—I said "You must have made a mistake, I advertised for a barman, not for a partner; here is a week's wages in lieu of notice"—three of my men had seen him robbing me, and I saw him putting my money into his pocket instead of putting it into the till.</p>

I am a cab-driver of 20, Chapel Street, Islington—I was in my cab in High Street, Borough, and saw four men knock a gentleman down and take his watch—I was not so far off then as the length of this Court—directly I got by his side they ran—two went over London Bridge, two turned down St. Thomas's Street; I took the prosecutor up in my cab and went after them—I met a policeman, said something to him, and he sounded his whistle—I followed the two down St. Thomas's Street; one went down by Guy's Hospital, one to the left, whom I followed—I never saw his face—some more constables came up and I went with them into a urinal in Joiner Street, where I saw the prisoner.</p>

I know nothing about anything"—I brought him out of the urinal—the prosecutor was in the cab outside; he said "That is the man that had me by the throat"—going to the station the prisoner said he had been with his sister in Bermondsey drinking; he was sober—the prosecutor had been drinking, but he knew what he was doing; he was not drunk—I cannot say how far 23, Vauban Street is from the place where the prosecutor was robbed.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 87, Borough, 19th</hi>

(<hi rend="italic">Dated July 9th, 3.30, to Mr. Jones:</hi> "I must go early to-morrow with samples to Aberdeen. Try and persuade Mr. Lautzenberg to open account. Hope to see you on Monday. I shall call on Bund in Glasgow.") I went to the office in the Borough next day and saw Jones; he was alone—he told me I was to give him a sample of hops to take to the firm of Wiggins and Cosher, and said, "I believe I can make 65<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 66<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said that in order to do business with these people he could give it at 65<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Jones then went out of the office, and came back and said, "I have sold 75 bales at 65<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and wrote out this document in my presence. (<hi rend="italic">This was a sale note to Jones by Lautzenberg Freres of choice hops 75 LF Burgundy at 65</hi>s<hi rend="italic">., to be delivered as soon as possible.</hi>) He then wrote a duplicate, put it in an envelope, and said, "I am going to take this agreement to Mr. Wiggins's office," and went out with it in his hand, and came back again—I then sent a telegram to my firm to send over 75 bags—I returned home to Dijon on 12th July—some correspondence then took place, and I sent over the third lot—the price of them was fixed on the 18th. (<hi rend="italic">The cor<lb/>respondence between Enefer and Jones and Lautzenberg Freres was here read.</hi>) I have never seen Mr. Andrews, and have never been paid for his lot—after that correspondence, and getting no satisfaction, I came to London, and went to the prisoner and told him I wanted the money for the invoices that was due—he said he had not received any money for them from Andrews or Wiggins—I asked where the 57 bales were—he said they had been sold in the country—he showed me no "account sales," and did not tell me the names of the customers—I asked him two or three times why Wiggins and Cosher had not paid, and his answer always was that he had not received the cheque—I then made inquiries, and having ascertained how my hops had been sold, went and saw a solicitor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Most of the letters were written by Mr. Jones in French—I had one or two from Enefer; his were always in English—this letter of 22nd July, about the seventy-five bales, samples of which were held at the disposal of Messrs. Wiggins, reached me in due course—I have known Price Jones since 1882; he was first at Denekers,' and then for a short while at Mr. Lamey's—Denekers were dealers in foreign hops—I had known him to be for a number of years there—I don't know if Lameys became bankrupt about September, 1884—Jones did not tell me of their failure, nor that he had gone into Enefer's employment at a weekly salary—there is a circular in which he styles himself the prisoner's partner—he sent me a telegram in which he said he had left Lamey's employment, and was going to be Enefer's partner—in my</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman L R</hi> 11). About 6.30 on 29th October I went to the Company's police-station at Waterloo, and found the prisoner in custody of one of the South-Western Railway Company's constables, charged with uttering a counterfeit half-crown—he said it was not him that tendered it, it was another gentleman—I searched him, and found two good half-crowns and 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bronze; no railway ticket—he was sober—as I was taking him down the steps I noticed a man standing on the steps; I thought the prisoner moved his hand towards him—I at once sent a railway man to follow that man—I had seen the prisoner before—I did not know him—he was a barman—I knew the other man as well, he was also a barman, at the Sailor Prince, Waterloo Road.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). At 2 o'clock on 26th October I found the prisoner detained at Battersea Police-station—I told him he would be charged with causing the death of George Exhall by striking him with his fist in the York Road—he made this statement, which I wrote down: "I went into the public-house and had half a pint of beer. I accidentally pushed against Exhall. When I went outside the house Exhall was stupefied and wanted to fight me. I told him to put on his clothes, I did not want to fight him; with that he struck me in the eye. We had several rounds together, and he fell down. They took him into the house opposite, and I went home, and I am very sorry he is dead."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I arrested him on Monday—he had on a pair of light boots with gutta-percha soles and leather uppers—he is a hard-working young man—a short time ago the deceased came out of a reformatory after five years' for stealing lead—he was rather inclined to be noisy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—on 25th October the deceased was brought there; he was alive then—he had a black eye, and a scalp wound on the left side of the back of his head, which might have been caused by a kick or a fall—it would cause a good deal of blood to flow probably—he died about 2.30 on Tuesday morning—I assisted in the post-mortem examination on the afternoon of the day he died—he died from displacement and fracture of the spine, which was caused by violence to the back of the neck—it could be caused by a fall from some height, but not by just falling to the ground unless against something prominent—I do not think a fall on tram-lines would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188511160078"/>
               <p>do it—I do not think if two men were wrestling, and one took the other off his legs and threw him down, it would cause this—I should think it was caused by excessive kicking, two or three kicks—several of the muscles were full of extravasated blood—-one kick might have caused the displacement of the spine—he complained of it before his death—he was about 20 years old, and slightly smaller than the prisoner.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I, George Exhall, believing I am going to die, state that about 12 o'clock last night, the 24th, I was outside the Nag's Head public-house where a man called Chubb was—there was no quarrelling. Chubb pushed me, I asked him what he was doing that for, when he struck me in the face. I put up my hands to defend myself, when he caught hold of me and threw me backwards. My head came in contact with the tramway rails. I was stunned and recollect nothing till I found myself in bed this morning. Kate Kelly was there the whole time; she did not know what happened. I never quarrelled with Chubb before, or had an angry word with him before he pushed me. He was not sober. I had only a pot of six-ale between four of us. I know nothing of the persons present but Kate Kelly and Chubb."</p>

I am a labourer of 88, York Road, Battersea—on this evening I was in the Nag's Head and saw the prisoner and Exhall come in—the prisoner went up to the bar to get a pot of beer and accidentally pushed up against the deceased, who turned round, started swearing at him, and told him he would fight him—the prisoner said he would have nothing to say to him; he did not want to have nothing to do with fighting—Exhall left the public-house first; shortly afterwards I went out with Chubb, and found Exhall with his coat and waistcoat and hat and tie off—Exhall said he would fight him, and started pulling off his shirt—the prisoner said he did not want to fight—Exhall said he would fight, and struck the prisoner in the eye—they had three or four rounds—the deceased fell on the tram-lines, which are laid in stones on the middle of the road—I did not see the prisoner kick the deceased—the prisoner had gutta-percha boots on.</p>

I am a lath-seller at 138, York Road, Battersea—on this evening I was in my house, just opposite the Nag's Head, reading the paper—I heard a disturbance outside—I went to the door, and saw a large mob; I went two or three doors up the road—I saw the deceased stripped, with only his guernsey on, waiting ready to commence fighting—I saw them have one or two rounds—I could not say who began—the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I might not have seen him kicked, there was such a large crowd—I have lived there 19 years, and I know the place well—where he fell is the branch of a junction, my impression is, of the tram lines—when he fell another disturbance arose, and a rush was made, and two or three people fell over him, and if he got a kick it is my impression that was when he got it—I did not stop to see him picked up—during the time I was there I heard no mention made of any kicking—after he had fallen I did not see the prisoner go up and kick Exhall on the crown of his head.</p>
